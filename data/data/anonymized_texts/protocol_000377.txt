Study  Population 
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remestemcel -L in pediatric subjects with  
aGVHD that has failed to respond only to first- line systemic steroid treatment. The trial will  
exclude subjects who have received second- line treatment for aGVHD p rior to study 
screening, in order to evaluate remestemcel -L’s effects in the absence of other second -line 
agents.  The study plans to treat at least 48 pediatric subjects, male and female, between the 
ages of 2 months and 17 years inclusive, with acute Graf t versus Host Disease (aGVHD)  
following allogeneic hematopoietic stem  cell transplant (HSCT) that has failed  to respond 
to treatment with systemic corticosteroid therapy.  Subjects may have Grades C and D 
aGVHD involving the skin, liver and/or gastrointesti nal (GI) tract or Grade B aGVHD  
involving the liver  and/or GI  tract, with or  without concomitant skin disease.  
Acute  GVHD  Treatment  Response  Criteria  
Complete response (CR) - Resolution of aGVHD in all involved organs 
Partial response (PR)- Organ improvement by at least one stage without worsening of any 
other organ. 
Overall  response (OR) - Includes both complete  response and partial  response 
Very good partial response (VGPR) - Subset of PR  patients: Fulfillment of the CR criteria  
with the exception of one or more  of the following: 
Skin: no rash,  non-progressive stage 1 rash, or residual  erythematous rash  involving <25% 
of the body surface without bullae ( not including residual faint erythema or 
hyperpigmentation); 
Liver:  resolving elevations of total serum bilirubin concentration or total serum bilirubin 
concentration  of <2 mg/dl or <25% of baseline at  enrollment 
Gut: minimal gastrointestinal symptoms as  described  below: 
Tolerating food or enteral feeding Predominantly formed stools No overt GI bleeding or abdominal cramping No more  than occasional nausea or vomiting  
Mixed  response (MR)- Improvement in  at least  one evaluable organ  stage with  worsening in 
another 
No response (NR)- No change in any organ stage in any organ system and no improvement 
in organ stage 
Progression - Deterioration in  at least one organ system by one stage or more  with no 
improvement in any other organ 
Responder- Subjects  who  achieve an  overall  response (OR)  
Non-responder- Subjects  who do not achieve an  OR.  
Efficacy  Assessments 
Primary  Endpoint 
The rate of overall response (OR) in the study population at Day 28 post initiation of therapy  (Day  0) with remestemcel -L (MSC).

2. Subject  is 2 months to 17 years  of age,  inclusive 
3. Subject  has failed  to respond to  steroid  treatment, with  failure  to respond defined  as 
any Grade B -D (IBMTR grading) aGVHD that shows progression within 3 days or 
no improvement within 7 days of consecutive treatment with 2 mg/kg/day of 
methylprednisolone or equivalent. 
4. Subject  must be able to  be treated with  remestemcel -L within  4 days of signing of 
informed  consent. 
5. Subjects who have had persistent GI GVHD, as manifested by diarrhea with stool volume < 500 mL/ day (for subjects >50 kg), or < 30 mL/kg/day (for subjects ≤50 kg). See Table 2 : GVHD Organ Severity Criteria for values in ml/m
2. In the 
absence of nausea or vomiting, subject may still be considered to have Grade B GVHD if  
a. other causes of diarrhea have been ruled out (e.g., C. difficile, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,  oral magnesium administration)  
 
and if 
 
b. the low stool volume reflects the effects of fasting, narcotics, or anti- diarrheal  medications.  
 
6. Subject must have adequate renal function, as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min per 1.73m
2. For subjects 1 to 18 years of age, creatinine 
clearance  should be calculated  using the Bedside Schwartz equation: 
 
GFR (ml/min  per 1.73 m2) = [0.413  height (cm)]/Serum  creatinine (mg/dl) 
 
For subjects less than 1 year old, renal function should be determined using the Schwartz equation adjusted for this age group: 
 
Creatinine clearance (ml/min per1.73 m
2)= (height [cm] x 0.45)/ (serum creatinine 
[mg/dL]) 
 
7. Subject has a minimum Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Level of 30 at the time of study entry

allowed  in the study. 
16. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or to porcine 
or bovine proteins.  
Treatment  Groups  
This is a single- arm study; all enrolled  subjects  are to be treated  with  remestemcel -L. 
Treatment  Plan  
The trial design,  including treatment  plan, is outlined schematically  in Figure  1, which  
follows this synopsis. 
 
Initial Therapy 
Subjects will be treated with intravenous (IV) remestemcel-L at a dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg  
(actual  body weight at screening) twice per week  for each  of 4 consecutive weeks.  
Infusions will be administered at least 3 days apart and no more than 5 days apart for any  
infusion. All 8 infusions must be administered by Day 28 ± 2 days. 
 
Subjects may continue to be treated with a stable dose of systemic steroid therapy until they 
are eligible for steroid taper and may continue on an established regimen of baseline prophylactic therapy following initiation of remestemcel-L (Day 0). No other medications  
for the treatment of aGVHD are to be introduced to subjects during the initial 28 days post remestemcel -L administration  unless disease progression, as  defined  below, has  occurred.  
Addition of other secondary line agents prior to Day 28 would constitute failure to respond, in which case, the treated  subject would remain on the study for safety  follow up. 
 
Any changes in baseline prophylaxis regimen should be recorded in the eCRF and reason for change in regimen  should be discussed  with the  Medical  Monitor. Changes in dose or 
prophylactic agent due to administration route intolerance or toxicities are allowed at the  
discretion of the investigator with prior approval from the Medical Monitor as these changes  could be confused as second -line therapies.  
 
Steroid  taper 
If improvement in GVHD, as defined by OR, is observed for a period of 3-5 days and after at least two do ses of remestemcel -L, the dosing of methylprednisolone or equivalent may 
be tapered.  A steroid taper rate of at least 10% of the dose per week, not exceeding 25% of 
the dose per week, is recommended as described in Appendix 5, with the goal of discontinuing steroid by 10 weeks after initiating  taper.  
 
Assessments  
GVHD assessments will be performed at screening and weekly, beginning on Day 14, until  
Day 100 (±7 days)/End of Study. Assessments must  be after the  2nd dose of remestemcel -L 
is administered for each assessment week of the Initial Therapy period (or after the 1st dose 
of remestemcel -L during Continued Therapy). The weekly  assessment visits should be 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  10 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
conducted at least 24 hours after the most recent remestemcel -L infusion. Weekly GVHD  
assessments will be used to determine whether the subject’s GVHD status has progressed  
from baseline assessment (through Day 28), according to the definition of progression of 
disease , below. From Day 28 to Day 100, weekly GVHD assessments will be compared to  
the most recent prior assessment to determine whether the subject’s GVHD status has  
progressed. Rescue therapy may be administered if necessary. If new GVHD medications  
are administered as rescue therapy based on these assessment(s), no further remestemcel -L 
infusions will be allowed. Subjects would remain in the study regardless of response and would continue to be evaluated per the assessment  schedule.  
 
Progression of disease is defined as increase by one or more grade from screening/baseline assessme nt up to Day 28 and as increase by one or more grade from the most recent prior 
assessment from Day 28 to Day 100. Progression is not defined as ‘mixed response’ according to the definitions described above under Acute GVHD Treatment Response Criteria . 
 
Day 28 Therapy Assessment:  
A therapy assessment will be performed on Day 28 (±2 days) to determine treatment response and whether a subject will be provided continued therapy. The Day 28 therapy assessment must be at least 24 hours after the last dose of r emestemcel -L is administered.  
Continued Therapy  will be allowed  for subjects according to their response to  treatment,  as 
described  below. 
 
Day 56 Assessment  of Response to Continued Therapy 
A therapy assessment will be performed on Day 56 (±2 days) from treatment initiation for subjects receiving Continued Therapy after Day 28, in order to determine treatment response to the Continued Therapy. The Day 56 therapy assessment must be at least 24 hours after the last administration of  remestemcel -L. 
 
Continued  Therapy 
Eligible subjects may receive an additional 4 once- weekly infusions of remestemcel -L at 
the same initial dose of 2 x 10
6 MSC/kg actual body weight at screening, which would 
begin within one week after the Day 28 therapy assessment. Infusions will be given once weekly (± 2 days) and all infusions must be administered within 28 days (± 2 days) from the first infusion. No addi tional treatment with remestemcel-L is allowed at any other point 
in time  unless the criterion for GVHD flare,  as defined in this protocol, is met. 
 
Eligibility  for Continued  Therapy 
Eligibility to receive Continued Therapy after the initial 4 -week treatment period is 
dependent upon the results  of the subject’s  response assessments at  Day  28, as defined  in 
Table 4, compared with baseline, as follows: 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  11 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
Complete Response (CR):  If a subject displays CR, then no additional remestemcel -L will  
be administered.  
 
No Response (NR): If a subject displays NR, then no additional remestemcel- L will be  
administered.  
 
Partial Response (PR): If a subject displays PR, the subject will receive Continued 
Therapy. 
 
Mixed Response (MR): If a subject displays MR, the subject will receive Continued 
Therapy. 
 
GVHD flare: Subjects who have a GVHD flare of Grade B -D, after achieving a CR and  
before Day 70 post treatment initiation, may receive additional remestemcel- L treatment  
per the Initial Therapy plan, consisting of remestemcel-L, IV, at a dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg  
actual body weight at screening, twice per week for each of 4 consecutive wee ks. GVHD 
flare is defined as any increase in aGVHD symptoms (measured by GVHD grade B -D) 
beyond 28 days post first infusion, subsequent to achieving CR to Initial Therapy, or 
beyond Day 56 after achieving CR to Continued Therapy. If a subject has begun other  
second line GVHD therapy, they would not be eligible to receive additional remestemcel -L 
treatment.  Subjects are eligible  for a  single treatment for  flare.  
 
Other  GVHD therapy 
If a subject begins other second-line GVHD therapy within the period of Initi al and  
Continued Therapy (through Day 56, if applicable), he or she would be considered to have failed treatment and would be ineligible to receive any further remestemcel -L therapy upon 
receiving  the other second -line GVHD therapy. 
Route  of Administration  and Dose  
Remestemcel -L (ex-vivo cultured  adult human MSCs)  will be administered  intravenously at 
a dose of 2 x106 MSC /kg of actual body weight at screening. Remestemcel-L is stored and 
distributed  in cryogenic bags and cryogenic vials.  
Duration  of Treatment  
Enrolled subjects will receive Initial Therapy for 4 weeks; eligible subjects will receive  
Continued Therapy for an additional four weeks, beginning within one week after the end of Initial Therapy  period. Subjects may  receive Flare Therapy for an  additional four weeks 
if flare  criteria  is met.  
Duration  of Study  
Subjects  may  receive treatment f or up to  8 weeks  and will be followed out to 
100 ± 7 days. Total duration of study participation  per subject  is up to 111 days to account 
for the 4 -day screening window and End of Study visit ±7 days.

An extension study under a separate protocol (MSB- GVHD002), subsequent to the present 
study, is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. 
Statistical  Analysis 
 
Sample Size  
The primary  objective of this trial is to confirm  efficacy  of remestemcel -L in  improving 
Day 28 OR rate within the efficacy population. For assessment of efficacy, an effect size of  
20%, which has been deemed clinically meaningful based on discussions with clinical 
experts on aGVHD, was used to calculate the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis was calculated using 45% OR, a rate that is 20-points lower than the anticipated 65% OR rate to remestemcel -L. This estimated 45% response rate is supported by data showing comparable 
Day 28 OR rates  for historical populations of aGVHD patients  treated  with standard  of 
care, which varies across institutions, but generally consists of treatment with immune - 
suppressive agents used serially or in combination. Sample size was determined using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution under the assumption of a two- sided test  
of significance level 5% for a single proportion and a difference in proportion of 20%. This is equivalent to  one-sided testing at 2.5% of the null hypothesis that  the Day 28 OR  rate is 
at most,  45%, versus the alternative  hypothesis that the Day 28 OR rate is  65% or greater.  
The minimum sample size required to meet the primary objective with 80% power is 48 for the FAS population. At least 48 subjects will be enrolled. In order to account for dropouts/missing data and to ensure that this study has sufficient power, an additional increased  enrollment of up to 10% of the minimum required enrollment (48) is  planned. 
 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis Populations 
As this is a single arm study, the evaluable population for efficacy will be considered the full analysis set (FAS) , which will include all subjects who provided informed consent, 
were screened and found eligible to enter the study. The modified full analy sis set (mFAS)  
is the same as the FAS, but only for patients treated with IMP in cryogenic vials. The  
primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS population. The  
per-protocol (PP)  population will  include all  subjects from  the FAS p opulation who  had no 
major protocol violations during the study. The primary and secondary efficacy analyses performed on the mFAS and PP populations will be considered supportive. The safety  
population will include all subjects who have signed the informed consent form and have 
received at least one dose of study drug. We may conduct sensitivity analyses comparing 
results from patients treated with product in vials to results for all patients for each of the  
analysis  populations. 
 
General  Statistical Considerations : 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  Continuous 
variables  will be summarized  using descriptive statistics  (n, mean,  standard deviation [SD],  
median,  minimum,  and maximum). Two-sided  confidence intervals at the 95% level  will 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  13 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
be presented for estimates of proportions. All statistical tests will be two -sided at the 
alpha<0.05 level of significance, unless otherwise noted. 
 
The primary and secondary analyses will be based on the FAS population. Primary and  
secondary analyses perf ormed on the mFAS and PP populations will be considered 
supportive. Analyses of the PP populations will be used to assess sensitivity and thus will 
be considered  supportive. 
 
Pre-treatment demographics and subject characteristics will be summarized.  Time f rom 
HSCT to onset of aGVHD and from onset of aGVHD to initiation of study drug will be summarized.  Involvement of the skin, lower  gastrointestinal (GI)  tract,  and liver  will be 
summarized by the number of subjects with one organ, two organs, or all three organs involved at baseline.  
 
Efficacy  Analyses  
OR at Day 28 as response to remestemcel -L treatment is the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Missing data for the primary endpoint will be considered as non-responders. Details on  
imputation will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to database lock.  A 
hypothesis test will be performed to assess whether the percentage of responders is statistically significantly differe nt from the control percentage of 45% used to calculate the 
null hypothesis. 
 
Survival will be assessed from initial remestemcel -L treatment to the last date of  
assessment. The association between Day 28 OR and survival at Day 100, and between Day 28 VGPR and survival at Day 100, will be tested for statistical significance. First, the  
associations will be tested using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratifying by  
baseline aGVHD grade.  Day 100 survival Kaplan-Meier curves will be plotted by Day 28 
responder and non-responder groups, and differences between these groups will be tested 
for a statistically  significant difference  using the log- rank test. The odds ratio for survival 
at Day 100 given responder status at Day 28 will be presented and tested for statistical significance (whether statistically  significantly  greater  than 1). 
 
Additional secondary endpoints will be evaluated. The rate of VGPR will be described.  
The number and proportion of VGPR responders, non-responders, and missing values, at Day 28, Day 56, and at Day 100 will be summarized. The rates of OR and VGPR at Day  
28, Day 56, and at Day 100 will be reported by skin, gut (lower GI), or liver involvement at baseline.  The rates of OR and VGPR will also be reported by the mutually exclusive Skin- 
only and “Not skin-only” categories. The number and percentage of responders at each  
time point and for each endpoint will be summarized by baseline GVHD grade.  The 
number and percentage of survivors at Day 100 from first infusion date will be summarized by baseline grade and organ involvement. The incidence rate of GVHD progression requiring additional GVHD medications or therapy will be summarized by number and proportion of subjects.

1. BACKGROUND 
1.1 Acute Graft -versus  Host Disease  
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a progressive and lethal complication of hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and donor leukocyte infusion. Two clinically distinct forms of GVHD have been described, consisting of acute GVHD, which typically occurs within 100 days of HSCT, 
1 and chronic GVHD, which is characterized by later onset .2 However, this arbitrary  
temporal  distinction between the acute and chronic forms of GVHD has been largely discarded 
with the recognition of these  forms  as discrete pathophysiologic conditions definable by separate 
clinical  and diagnostic criteria.  3,4 
 
Occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after allogeneic transplantation is fairly common, with  
Grades II to IV aGVHD reported in approximately 39% of cases involving sibling donors and 59% of cases  with  unrelated  donors .
5  Overall,  an estimated  20% to 80% of patients who  receive 
allogeneic HSCT  develop acute GVHD,  even  after  prophylaxis with immunosuppressive 
agents.  6 
 
While aGVHD is common among patients with allogeneic transplantation, overall, it is a rare  
disease, affecting about 10,000 individuals per year worldwide, with an estimated 2,000 cases found in children (Table 1). Approxim ately  5,500 of worldwide aGVHD cases  are refractory  to 
steroid, 
4 1,000-1,200 of which are pediatric  cases.

In aGvHD, alloreactive T cells present in the donor cell transplant recognize the recipient’s 
tissues as foreign  and mount an  immunological attack,  causing  inflammation  and tissue  damage 
primarily affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, and liver.  7 Human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)  disparity  between  HSC donor and  recipient  is the  key driver of GVHD, causing  donor 
T cells to recognize recipient tissue as foreign.  7 The severity  of the disease  is associated with  
the degree of HLA mismatch between the donor and the recipient, and a greater mismatch will 
result in more aggressive alloreactivity. 8 Damage to  recipient tissue caused by the HSCT  
conditioning regimen  (irradiation or chemo -ablation) creates a cellular  and molecular  
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  27 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
environment that is conducive to GVHD. The tissue damage leads to the increased secretion of  
proinflammatory cytokines, which promote donor T cell proliferation and differentiation and 
interaction with recipient antigen presenting cells.  Alloreactive donor T cells traffic to target  
tissues (skin, gut, liver) and release soluble mediators that mediate cytotoxicity and end organ damage.  Other  donor immune  cells,  including natural  killer  cells,  neutrophils and  monocytes, are 
also activated and recruited to target organs and contribute to host tissue destruction. 
9 This  
adverse immune reaction increases over time as the expanding tissue damage mediated by  
alloreactive immune cells leads to more cytokine production. A vicious cycle ensues:  
amplification of cytokine expression supports further proliferation and activation of alloreactive immune  cells, which in turn leads to further tissue  damage. 
7 
 
Consequently, aGVHD potentially  involves multiple  organ systems,  with varying degrees  of 
clinical  severity.  
 
Acute GVHD onset primarily affects  the skin, the liver,  and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,  
though the GVHD reaction targets a number of different host cells, including those of the skin epithelia and mucosa, hair follicles, intestinal crypts, liver bile ducts, bone marrow, and immune system. 
1,7 Disease onset often manifests clinically as a pruritic maculopapular rash that first  
appears on the nape of the neck, shoulders, ears, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. The  
liver is  the next most commonly  affected  organ  after skin;  symptoms of liver involvement 
include jaundice and increased alkaline phosphatase levels that indicate damage to the bile canaliculi and portend cholestasis.  The GI tract is the third organ among the tissues most 
commonly affected in acute GVHD, frequently presenting as nausea, vomiting, intestinal bleeding, cramping, and diarrhea. GI involvement is often the most severe of the organs affected and can be the most difficult to treat.  The large  volumes of watery  diarrhea  common to intestinal 
involvement in acute GVHD often transitions into bloody diarrhea that prompt the need for frequent transfusions. 
7 
 
1.2 Current  Treatment  of aGVHD  and Prognosis 
Presently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for treatment of steroid- refractory aGVHD.  
Available  treatment options  to prevent aGVHD have historically  involved front- line therapy  with 
glucocorticoids along with different combinations of prophylaxis agents such as methotrexate and cyclosporine A. 
6,10-12 While many patients who develop aGVHD respond well to first- line 
corticosteroid treatment, steroids achieve complete response rates in only approximately 50% of cases.  
13 Many  aGVHD patients display  inadequate response to corticosteroid, with 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  28 of 121 Mesoblast   
 
 
approximately 10% to 30% of aGV HD patients progressing to the more  severe Glucksberg  
Grades  III or IV GVHD.5 
 
As shown by the survival curves in Figure 2, the prognosis for patients with the most severe 
forms of aGVHD (IBMTR Grades C and D) is dismal, pri marily because of greater risk for  
infectious complications, immunosuppression- mediated toxicity, and often incomplete GVHD remission. 
14 Patients that do not respond to steroid therapy have expected one-year survival 
rates of just 5% to 30%. 6,8,15-19 A wide variety of second-line immunosuppressive agents are 
commonly used to treat  steroid -refractory  aGVHD (SR -aGVHD),  though there is little  evidence  
to support the efficacy  of these drugs as secondary therapy  for aGVHD.  6

1.3 Grading  of Acute  GVHD 
Acute GVHD is  a heterogeneous set of disease processes  that potentially  involves multiple  organ 
systems, with varying degrees of severity by organ system. Disease onset typically manifests  
most commonly  in the skin, with  the GI  tract and liver  as the next most common sites  
involved. 17 Historically, classification systems of aGVHD have been established to segregate  
aGVHD according to severity.  The severity grade of aGVHD has been shown to correspond to 
overall survival, with increased transplant- related mortality correlating with higher aGVHD 
grade. 20 One of the first grading systems, published by Glucksberg and colleagues in 1974, 21 
involves assigning a stage of 1 to 4 to each involved organ, as described in Table 2,  and 
combining these stages to  yield an overall grade ranging from I  to IV (Table 3) . 
 
Another grading system, which will be used in the present study, was devised by the 
International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) and classifies aGVHD severity on a scale of A to D.  While a modified Glucksberg grading system is recommended in the most 
current published consensus statement for diagnosis and management of aGVHD, 
12 the current  
study will use the IBMTR classification system in order to maintain consistency with previous studies of remestemcel -L for aGVHD.  Table 3 presents a summary of the IBMTR compared 
with the IBMTR  grading systems for  GVHD.

1.5 Mesenchymal  Stromal Cells  (MSCs)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MSCs have been shown to attenuate inflammatory and immunological processes relevant to 
GVHD. MSCs demonstrate immunosuppressive activity in T cell-driven immune responses in animal models of allogenic skin graft rejection and GVHD. 
32-34 In vitro , MSCs suppress T -cell 
proliferation  in response to allo -antigenic and mitogenic  stimulation,  and stimulate  an increase  in 
the regulatory T cell (Treg) population. 35-37 Data suggest that Tregs play an important role in 
inhibiting allogeneic T cell response and aGVHD. 6,38 In co -culture systems, MSCs alter the  
cytokine secretion profile of immune cells (dendritic cells, naïve and effector T cells, natural  
killer cells), decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFNγ, TNFα) and  
increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL- 4, IL -10) 32   The 
immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are attributable, at least in part, to secretion of soluble factors such as PGE2. 
32 In addition, MSCs may mediate tissue protection and repair at sites of 
injury in GVHD by secretion of soluble factors that are known to mediate processes such as inhibition of apoptotic cell death, recruitment of endogenous stem cell populations and angiogenesis.

1.7.8 Pote
ntial  Risks  of MSCs  
A list of adverse events (AEs) possibly or probably related to remestemcel-L use is found in the 
Investigators Brochure. All AEs were events commonly expected in the treated population, independent of the infusions of hMSCs. The most common AEs observed for remestemcel -L in 
clinical trials of pediatric GVHD were infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory,  
thoracic and mediastinal disorders. 
 
Infusion reaction though, uncommon (≥1/1,000 to ≤1/100), has been reported in subjects treated with reme stemcel -L. An acute infusion reaction may include fever, chills, urticarial, hypotension, 
shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, hypoxia or other signs of acute respiratory  distress.  

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol

Infusional toxicity was evaluated by continuously monitoring the subject’s vital signs and 
oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry from the time of investigational agent infusion until two hours after starting  the infusion of study drug. To reduce the potential for infusion reaction, it  is 
recommended  that subjects  receive premedication  with hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine. 
Premedication  should occur  30-60 minutes prior to infusion of remestemcel -L. 
 
Due to the known in vitro immune  modulating effects  of human MSCs, there is  a risk of immune  
suppression and increased infection risk. Subjects undergoing treatment for GVHD are typically severely immunocompromised. Treatment with remestemcel-L may lead to further immunosuppression. Therefore, the potential exists for an increased risk of infectious compl ications.  Careful subject monitoring and appropriate anti-infective prophylaxis is 
recommended.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With consideration of the low incidence of ectopic tissue formation from the safety data, the risk of high radiation exposure from  computed tomography (CT) scans,  the required administration  
of contrast agents, and the potential need for anesthetics in an ailing pediatric subject population, Investigators may choose to omit CT/MRI scans at their own discretion, provided the rationale for omission is  documented in  the source documents.  
 
In theory, cells grown and expanded outside the body have the potential to be contaminated, and infection could be introduced to the subject at the time of infusion. This risk is made negligible  
by processing cells in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant production facility, utilizing a closed system, and then by reconstituting the cells in a processing facility immediately  
prior to administration.  The potential risks of introducing a donor- derived infectious agent are  
minimized  by strict adherence to the 21CFR1271 Subpart C Donor Eligibility  and multiple

screenings of remestemcel -L for adventitious agents prior to release. The IB contains a full list 
of donor screening tests performed on all lots of  remestemcel -L during production. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Remestemcel -L contains dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  
 
 In non- clinical  
studie
s, DMSO has  been  reported  to have potential adverse effects  on the heart  through negative 
inotropic or chronotropic actions on myocardium and decreased heart rates. In addition, DMSO 
has been associated with histamine release following degranulation of mast cells. Subjects that  
have a known allergy to sulfa drugs should be closely monitored for development of possible immune sensitivity reaction. In order to minimize potential reactions to DMSO, the subject is  
premedicated  with  diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone prior to infusion of  remestemcel -L. 
 
There has been  no experience with  pregnant wome n receiving  infusions of remestemcel -L. The 
effects of remestemcel -L infusion on the developing fetus have not been established pre- 
clinically or in clinical trials. All females of childbearing potential and post- pubescent males  
with female partners of ch ildbearing potential are to consent to use an  effective method of birth  
control during this treatment protocol in a manner  such that risk of failure  is minimized.

randomized to a placebo group. With this anticipated limitation, this study will be single -arm, 
open-label, with a planned enrollment of at least 60 subjects aged 2 months to 17 years inclusive 
diagnosed with  Grades  B-D aGVHD who fail to respond to first -line corticosteroid treatment.  
 
The primary endpoint in this study will be OR, defined as complet e response (CR) or partial  
response (PR), as described in Table 4,  at 28 days after treatment initiation with remestemcel- L. 
Response to treatment at a fixed time point after initiating treatment have been shown in several studies to be associated with improvement in mortality up to 2 years post-transplant. 
28-31 In 
particular, OR, as defined in Table 4,  to treatment at Day 28 was as sociated with significantly  
lower rate of non-relapse mortality at 6 months and 2 years. 28-30 Response at Day 28 has been  
supported in a guideline issued by an expert panel of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant (ASBMT) in 2009 as well as by subsequent studies 
28,30,31; therefore OR at  
Day 28 is considered an appropriate primary endpoint for efficacy evaluation of treatment for aGVHD.  
 
2.1.2 Rationale for Subject  Population 
Analysis of remestemcel -L’s treatment effects in the absence of other prior or concomitant 
second -line therapy for aGVHD presents an opportunity to discern remestemcel- L’s efficacy  
without the potentially confounding effects of other treatment agents.  
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  55 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
To confirm the results  of this pooled analysis,  this study will evaluate  the efficacy  and safety  of 
remestemcel -L in pediatric subjects with aGVHD that has failed to respond only to first- line 
systemic steroid treatment.  The trial will exclude subjects who have received second- line 
treatment for aGVHD prior to study screening, in order to evaluate remest emcel -L’s effects in  
the absence of other second- line agents.  
 
Based on results from previous clinical studies, which demonstrated that remestemcel-L 
conferred clinical benefit primarily to subjects with aGVHD involving the liver and/or GI, subjects with G rade B skin -only involvement will be excluded. Accordingly, subjects in this 
study may have Grade C or D aGVHD involving the skin, liver, and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tract  
or may have Grade B aGVHD involving the liver and/or GI tract, with or without conc omitant 
skin disease.  
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3 Rationale for Dosing  Regimen  and Treatment  Period  
In early studies, subjects infused with hMSCs for the treatment of steroid refractory, severe acute GVHD have experienced improvement in their GVHD, as manifested by complete resolution of GVHD symptom by 6 of 14 subjects  after one to  three infusions of hM SCs with a median  dose 
of 1 x 10
6 MSCs  per kilogram. 42,43 This dosing regimen of hMSC was also  well -tolerated.  42,43,50 
Based upon this experience, 1 – 2 x 106 MSCs per kilogram was deemed sufficient therapeutic 
benefit  to aGVHD patients.   
   
 
 Based  upon t
hese combined data, the 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  56 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
planned infusional dose for this study is 2 x 106 hMSCs/kg actual body weight at screening, 
twice per week for each of 4 consecutive weeks, with at least 3 days between infusions, for the 
first 4weeks.  
 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Hypothesis 
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), the primary component of remestemcel-L, are non- hematopoietic cells isolated from adult bone marrow and expanded in culture. In vitro studies 
show that MSCs can  inhibit alloantigen - and  mitogen -stimulated  T cell  prolifera tion and promote 
an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells, (T
reg), which play an important role in 
inhibiting  allogeneic T cell response in  aGVHD.  54,55 In clinical  studies, MSCs  elicited  improved 
clinical response  over placebo  in subjects  with aGVHD.  We hypothesize that remestemcel -L 
will display efficacy for treating aGVHD that has failed to respond to first- line steroid treatment 
in pediatric  subjects.  
 
3.2 Primary  Objectives  
1. To evaluate the efficacy  of remestemcel -L in pediatric subjects with  Grades  B-D aGVHD 
who have failed to respond to steroid treatment post allogeneic HSCT.  
2. To gather additional information on the safety of remestemcel- L in pediatric subjects  
with Grades B -D aGVHD that has failed to respond to steroid treatment post allogeneic  
HSCT.  
 
3.3 Secondary  Objectives  
1. To determine  the correlation  between  response to remestemcel -L at Day  28 and survival 
at Day  100. 
2. To obtain quality of life data on remestemcel-L- treated su bjects via the Pediatric Quality  
of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™; Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) and the pediatric global 
health -related  quality  of life  (HRQOL) Parent Proxy  Report (Appendix 3) . 
3. To measure the functional status of remestemcel -L-treated subjects using the 
Karnofsky/Lansky scale (Appendix 4) .

4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overview  of Study  Design  and Dosing  Regimen  
This trial is a prospective, single -arm study involving multiple study centers, to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of remestemcel -L in pediatric subjects with acute GVHD who have failed to 
respond to systemic  steroid  treatment.  The study plans to treat at least 48 pediatric  subjects,  
male and female, between the ages of 2 months and 17 years inclusive with aGVHD following 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  transplant (HSCT) that has failed  to respond to treatment  with  
systemic corticosteroid therapy. Subjects may have Grades C and D aGVHD involving the skin, liver and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or Grade B aGVHD involving the liver and/or GI tract, with or without concomitant skin disease. 
 
Subjects  will be treated with  intravenous (IV)  remestemcel -L at a dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg  actual  
body weight at screening, twice per week for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Eligible subjects will receive Continued Therapy, an additional 4 once weekly infusions of remestemcel- L at the same 
initial dose of 2 x 10
6 MSC/kg actual body weight at screening. Eligible subjects may also  
receive GVHD flare therapy, which consists of an additional 4 twice-weekly infusions of remestemcel -L at the  same  initial dose  of 2 x 10
6 MSC/kg actual  body weight at  screening.  
 
4.1.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be overall response (OR), defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR; see Table 4 ), of the study population at 28 days post initiation of therapy 
(Day  0) with remestemcel -L. 
 
4.1.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints in this study will be  the following: 
1. Overall survival at Day  100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy  
2. Rate of very good partial response (VGPR) at Day 28 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy  
3. Rates  of OR and VGPR  at Day  100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy  
4. Rates of OR and VGPR at Days 28 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy, 
stratified  by organ involvement 
5. Rates of OR and VGPR at Days 28 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy, 
stratified  by individual subject  organ involvement 
6. Rates of OR and VGPR at Days 28 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy, stratified  by baseline aGVHD grade

4.1.4 Treatment  Plan  
A summary  of the treatment  plan is presented  in Table 10.  

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  60 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
Any changes  in baseline prophylaxis regimen  should be recorded  in the eCRF  and reason  for 
change in regimen should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Changes in dose or 
prophylactic agent due to administration route intolerance or toxicities are allowed at the  
discretion of the investigator with prior approval from the Medical Monitor as these changes could be confused as second- line therapies.  
 
4.1.4.2 Continued Therapy  
Eligible subjects will receive an additional 4 once weekly infusions of remestemcel- L at the  
same initial dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg actual  body weight at screening,  which will begin within  
one week  after the  Day  28 assessment  (Table 10) . Infusions will be given once weekly  
(± 2 days) and all 4 infusions must be administered within 28 days (±2 days). No additional treatment with remestemcel -L is allowed at any other point in time unless the criteria for GVHD 
flare,  as defined in this protocol, is met.  
 
4.1.4.3 Eligibility  for Continued Therapy  
Eligibility to receive additional therapy after the initial 4 -week treatment period is dependent 
upon the results of the subjects’ response assessments, as defined in Table 4 , at Day 28, as 
follows ( Table 10) : 
 
Complete response (CR): If a subject displays CR,  then no additional remestemcel -L will be 
administered.  
 
No Response (NR): If a subject displays NR, then no additional remestemcel-L infusion will be 
administered.  
 
Partial Response  (PR): If a subject  displays PR, the subject will receive Continued Therapy. 
 
Mixed  Response  (MR): If a subject  displays MR, the subjects  will receive Continued  Therapy. 
 
4.1.4.4 GVHD  Flare  
Subjects who have a GVHD flare of Grade B -D after achieving a CR (after Initial or Continued 
Therapy) and before Day 70 may receive additional remestemcel -L treatment per the Initial 
Therapy plan (Table 10 ). GVHD flare is defined as any increase in aGVHD symptoms  
(measured  by GVHD  grade B- D) beyond 28 days post first  infusion, subsequent to achieving  CR 
to Initial Therapy, or beyond Day 56 after achieving CR to Continued Therapy. If a subject has  
begun other second- line GVHD therapy, he or she  would be ineligible  to receive  any further  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  61 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
remestemcel -L the rapy upon receiving the other second- line GVHD therapy. Subjects are 
eligible  for a single treatment for  flare.  
 
4.1.4.5 Other GVHD  therapy  
If a subject begins other second-line GVHD therapy within the period of Initial and Continued 
Therapy  (through Day 56, if applicable), he or she  would be considered to have failed treatment  
and would be ineligible to receive any further remestemcel -L thera py upon receiving the other 
second -line GVHD therapy. 
 
Changes in prophylaxis regimen (change in dose or prophylactic agent) due to administration route intolerance  or toxicities  are allowed  at the  discretion  of the investigator with  prior approval 
from  the Medical Monitor and are not considered  second -line therapies.  
 
4.2 Study  Duration 
Enrolled subjects will receive Initial Therapy for 4 weeks; eligible subjects will receive therapy  
for an additional 4 (Continued Therapy) to 8 (Flare Therapy) weeks. Subjects will be assessed  
according to a schedule of planned assessments, as summarized i n Table 11 , and will be 
followed for up to 100 days. The total duration of study participation per subject will be up to 111 days to account for the 4- day screening  window and end of study visit ±7 days. 
 
4.3 Extension Follow- up Study  of Safety  and Health  Outcomes  
An extension study under a separate protocol (MSB-GVHD002), subsequent to the present study, is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180.

4.4 Number  of Subjects  Assigned  to Treatment  Groups  
This is a single -arm study in which at least 48 enrolled subjects will be treated with  
remestemcel -L. 
 
4.5 Study  Sites  
This study will be  conducted in approximately 35 different  sites.  
 
5. STUDY POPULATION 
5.1 Overview  
The study plans to treat  at least  48 pediatric  subjects, male  and female, between  the ages of  
2 months and 17 years  inclusive.  Subjects may  have Grades C  and D aGVHD  involving the skin, 
liver and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or Grade B aGVHD involving the liver and/or GI tract, 
with or without concomitant skin disease. 
 
5.2 Eligibility  Criteria  
5.2.1 Informed  Consent  
The informed consent document will be used to explain the risks and benefits of participation to the patient and/or the patient’s guardian in simple terms prior to treatment.  Written authorization  
for use and disclosure of personal health information (PHI) as per the requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (45 CFR 164) or per local privacy regulation must be obtained as part of the informed consent process. Authorization can be included in the informed consent form or can be issued as a separate document. The treating  
physician is responsible for ensuring that written informed consent, including written authorization for use and  disclosure of PHI and appropriate signatures  and dates,  is obtained 
from each patient before any protocol-related procedures including any pre- treatment procedures  
are performed.  As subjects treated with remestemcel-L under this protocol will be under 18 at 
the time of informed consent, a signature from a parent or legal guardian indicating informed consent will be  required. 
 
The informed consent document must include the elements required by Food & Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 50), written authorization for use and disclosure of PHI (45 CFR 164) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, as applicable. The treating physician agrees to obtain approval from  Mesoblast  International Sàrl  (Mesoblast)  of any  informed  consent and written  authorization 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  66 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
for use and disclosure of PHI authorization document used in the execution of the protocol, prior 
to submission to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC).  In the event  
the subject  is re-screened  for participation,  a new and  written  authorization for use and disclosure 
of PHI document must be signed. 
 
An extension study under a separate protocol (MSB-GVHD002), subsequent to the present study, is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. Subjects may be presented with the IRB/EC approved consents for MSB- GVHD001 and MSB- 
GVHD002  simultaneously  at the  time of consent onto this protocol. 
 
5.2.2 Inclusion  Criteria  
Subjects  are eligible  for the  study if all of the  following criteria are met: 
1. Subject was diagnosed with Grade B- D acute GVHD requiring corticosteroid systemic  
therapy. The subject may have Grade C or D aGVHD involving the skin, liver, and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or may have Grade B aGVHD involving the liver and/or GI tract, with or without concomitant skin disease. Acute GVHD is defined as the presence of skin rash and/or persistent nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea and/or cholestasis presenting in a context in which aGVHD is likely to occur and where other etiologies such as drug rash, enteric infection, or hepatotoxic syndromes are unlikely or have been ruled  out. 
2. Subject  is 2 months to 17 years  of age, inclusive. 
3. Subject has failed to respond to steroid treatment, with failure to respond defined as any Grade B -D (IBM TR grading) aGVHD that shows  progression within3 days 
or no improvement within 7 days of consecutive treatment with 2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent. 
4. Subject  must be able to  be treated with  remestemcel -L within  4 days of signing of 
informed  consent. 
5. Subjects who have had persistent GI GVHD manifested by diarrhea with stool volume less than  500 mL/day (for subjects >50 kg) or less  than 30 mL/kg/day(for subjects  
≤50 kg). See Table 2 : GVHD Organ Severity Criteria for values in ml/m
2. In the absence 
of nausea or vomiting, subject may  still be considered to have Grade B GVHD if:  
a. other causes of diarrhea have been ruled out (e.g., C. difficile, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection , oral magnesium  administration)  and if 
b. the low stool volume reflects  the effects  of fasting, narcotics,  or anti- diarrheal  
medications.

  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  67 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
6. Subject must have adequate renal function as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance  
of >30 mL/min per  1.73 m2. For subjects  1 to 18 years  of age creatinine  clearance should 
be calculated  using the Bedside Schwartz equation :56,57 
 
GFR (ml/min  per 1.73 m2) = [0.413  height (cm)]/Serum  creatinine (mg/dl) 
 
For subjects less  than  1 year old, renal  function should be determined  using the Schwartz 
equation adjusted for this age group: 
 
Creatinine clearance (ml/min per1.73 m2)= (height [cm] x 0.45)/ (serum creatinine 
[mg/dL]) 
 
7. Subject  has a minimum Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Level  of 30 at the time  of study 
entry. 
8. Subject (or legal representative where appropriate) must be capable of pr oviding written  
informed  consent. 
9. Female subjects of childbearing potential (≥ 10 years of age) must use a medically 
accepted  method of contraception and must agree to  continue use of this method for the 
duration of the study and for the follow-up time period. Acceptable methods of  
contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method. Guidance on childbearing potential and pregnancy tests are located in  Appendix 6. 
10. Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method or abstinence) during the study, including the follow-up time period. 
11. The subject must be willing and able to comply with study requirements, remain at the clinic, and be willing and able to return to the clinic for the follow-up evaluation, as specified in this protocol during the study period. 
 
5.2.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects  will not be eligible  for participation in  the study if they  meet ANY of  the following 
criteria:  
1. Subject  has Grade B aGVHD with skin -only involvement.

6. Subject has received any stem cel l agents (other than hematopoietic graft) during study  
participation or within 30 days prior to study entry. Donor Leukocyte Infusion (DLI) is  
excluded during study participation or within 30 days prior to study entry. Previous use of irradiated  granulocytes within 30 days is permitted. 
7. Subject  has received  an HSCT  transplant for a solid  tumor disease.  
8. Subject has had prior treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), including  
remestemcel -L. 
9. Subject  shows evidence of  severe (require  treatment) hepatic  veno -occlusive disease  
(VOD)  or sinusoidal obstruction at screening.  
10. Subject has had positive labor atory test results indicating infection with the human  
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at  any time and/or active  hepatitis  B or C virus infection 
within  3 months prior to screening.  
11. Subject  shows evidence of encephalopathy  as defined by a change in mental status  since 
the onset of aGVHD.  
12. Subject is a female who is pregnant, lactating, or is planning a pregnancy during study participation,  or in the follow-up period.

15. Subject  has participated  or is currently  participating  in any autologous or allogeneic stem  
cell or gene therapy study for the treatment of aGVHD. Patients participating in investigative protocols aimed at modification of the transplant graft (such as T cell depletion) or aimed at modification of the conditioning regimen will be allowed in the study. 
16. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or to murine, porcine, or bovine proteins. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  69 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
5.3 Subject  Discontinuation  Criteria  or Premature Subject  Withdrawal 
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. Subjects may be 
also considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or become los t to follow-up. 
 
The Investigator may discontinue any subject for any reason that may interfere significantly with the trial procedures and/or the interpretation of results. In addition, a subject may be withdrawn from the study if the Investigator determines that continued participation in this trial would pose a significant safety  risk for the subject. 
 
At a minimum,  the following  should be collected  when  a subject  discontinues: 
• The reason  the subject discontinued 
• The date of last treatment  
• The date of the last assessment  and/or contact 
• Adverse events  (AEs),  including concomitant medications used  to treat  AEs  
• Final  (end  of study) Assessments.  
 
5.3.1 Lost to Follow- Up 
A subject is considered to have been lost to follow-up if he/she is unable to be contacted by the 
Investigator post- enrollment, after reasonable efforts have been made to contact the subject.  The 
Investigator should show “due diligence” by documenting in the source documents steps  taken  to 
contact the subject, e.g., dates of telephone calls or registered letters.  The end of participation 
for a subject lost to follow-up is the date of the last known contact (e.g., visit or telephone 
contact).  
 
5.4 Rescreening  of Screen -Failed  Subjects  
Screen -failed subjects may be re -screened once at the Investigator’s discretion.  If the  
rescreening  takes place within one week of  the screen  failure, only the tests the  subject has  failed  
at screening should be repe ated at the rescreening.  If the rescreening occurs one week or more 
after the initial screening,  all screening  tests should be repeated.

5.5 Rules  for Discontinuing  Investigational Medicinal  Product (IMP)  
Subjects  may  discontinue IMP under the following circumstances:  
• Subject voluntarily withdraws from  the study 
• Subject  is withdrawn  from  the study at the  Investigator’s discretion  
• Subject  completes  study requirements  
• Death.  
 
Every effort should be made to complete the ‘End of Study’ assessments for all subject 
withdrawals  / terminations.  
 
If the subject discontinues from the treatment protocol and has an ongoing adverse experience at the time of discontinuation, the subject must receive follow -up for at least 2 weeks to clarify the 
nature of the AE.  If clinical  visit(s)  are necessary,  the procedures  performed  during the follow-up 
visit(s) will be recorded on unscheduled visit pages of the CRF. If the AE has not resolved after a 2-week period, a plan for further follow- up of the subject will be created by the treating  
physician in consultation with the  Medical Monitor. 
 
5.6 Information to be Collected  for Screen  Failures  
Subjects who are consented and are screened for eligibility into the trial, but do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for trial entry, will be considered screen failures. Subjects who provide consent but discontin ue the trial prior to  being given IMP will also  be considered  screen  
failures.  
 
The following information must be recorded on the respective case report forms (CRFs) for all screen  failures:  
• Demography 
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Adverse events  
• End of screening  disposition. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  71 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
5.7 End of Study  
The end of study is defined  as any  one of the  following, whichever occurs  first: 
• The date of  the last  scheduled  visit for  the last  subject  
• The date of  death of the last  subject  
• The date of withdrawal of the last subject.  
 
Individual subjects will be considered to have completed the study when they have completed all 
required protocol procedures and assessments. For subjects with ongoing AEs at the last scheduled visit, the end of study date will be deemed the last scheduled visit date.  The study site 
staff will perform the  appropriate closeout/last visit assessments.  
 
5.8 Planned Follow- up Study  of Safety  and Health  Outcomes  
An extension study under a separate protocol (MSB-GVHD002), subsequent to the present study, is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. Subjects may be presented with the IRB/EC approved consents for MSB- GVHD001 and MSB- 
GVHD002  simultaneously  at the  time of consent onto this protocol.

6.3 Handling  and Accountability  
Remestemcel -L will be provided to the study sites by the Sponsor or designee. Only the 
Investigator(s) or their designee(s) will be permitted to administer the IMP to subjects  
participating  in this protocol. 
 
The IMP must  be received  by a person designated by the Investigator at the study site, handled 
and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location that is accessible only by the 
designated person(s). Upon receipt, the designee must update the IMP accountability records, including records of IMP order, and maintain and store the records in a secure location. The  
CRA  will review  the records at the monitoring visits.  
 
Details  regarding the accountability  records are provided in the study Investigational Medicinal  
Product (IMP) M anual.  
 
6.4 Storage of Investigational Medicinal  Product  
The IMP will be shipped directly either from Mesoblast or a designated central distributor to the cell processing technologist in the Cell Processing Laboratory at the study site. The IMP will be  
shipped to  the site in the vapor phase of a liquid  nitrogen cryoshipper. The IMP will be stored  in 
the vapor phase of a secured liquid nitrogen freezer where access to the area is strictly limited to the Cell Processing Laboratory personnel. The IMP will be appropriately identified and  
segregated from other products. Details regarding the storage, handling, and preparation of the IMP are provided in the study IMP manual.  
 
6.5 Destruction  of the  Investigational Medicinal  Product  
Partially used IMP will be discarded according to the study site’s destruction policy, and the discarding will be recorded  in the accountability  log. 
 
Local or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of any unused IMP for 
safety reasons.  In these cases, it may be acceptable for the investigational site staff to destroy  
unused IMP before a monitoring inspection, provided that source document verification is 
performed  on the remaining  inventory and reconciled  against the documentation of the quantity 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  73 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
of IMP that was shipped, dispensed, returned and destroyed. Written authorization must be  
obtained from the  Sponsor at study start up  before  destruction of the IMP.  
 
The unused IMP provided by the Sponsor may be returned to the Sponsor. Where local or  
institutional regulations permit,  destruction of IMP  will occur  at a location  designated  by the 
Sponsor. Written authorization must be obtained from the Sponsor prior to the return or 
destruction of the IMP. 
 
7. STUDY PROCEDURE  
Table 11 Schedule of Assessments and Procedures, lists all planned assessments, which are marked with an “X” when the visits are performed.  Subjects should be seen for all visits on the 
designated day or at a time that is as close as possible to the designated day. The study assessment schedule in Table 11 outlines all procedures to be performed on subjects at the scheduled  visits.  
 
In order to minimize variability in evaluations, ideally, the same individuals should perform the same tests on all the  subjects at a given  trial site.  
 
7.1 Visit  Schedule  and Assessments  
7.1.1 Screening  Period  
Subjects  will enter  the screening  period  once the written  informed  consent has  been  signed. 
The following assessments  and procedures will be performed  at the  screening  visit:  
• Written  informed  consent  and written  authorization  for use and disclosure of  personal  
health  information  
• Physical  examination  
• Height and  weight 
• Vital Signs (heart rate [HR],  blood pressure [BP],  temperature,  and respiratory rate [RR])

• Chronic GVHD assessment  
• CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Scans will contribute information 
with regard to baseline disease burden and will also provide baseline for evaluation of 
future possible ectopic tissue formation. For CT, use intravenous (IV) contrast; if IV is  
contraindicated for any reason, oral contrast is acceptable even in the presence of GI  
GVHD.  A previous CT scan or MRI may be used if performed up to 90 days prior to 
first IMP infusion or 24 hours after IMP infusion. 
NOTE:  CT/MRI  scans  are optional and  Investigators may  choose to  omit CT/MRI  scans  
at their own discretion, provided the rationale for omission is documented in the source documents. 
• 12-lead electrocardiogram 
• Urinalysis  
• Laboratory assessments  
o Hematology (including viral screening,  please see Table 12 for details)  
o Serum  chemistry  (including hsCRP,  please see Table  12 for details)  
o ESR (local  lab) 
  
• Karnofsky/Lansky performance assessment  (see Appendix 4) 
• Serum pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential ( ≥10 years of age)  
(see Appendix 6 for guidance on childbearing pot ential  and pregnancy testing)

7.1.2 At Each  Infusion  Day 
IMP infusions will be given to subjects who have signed the informed consent form, completed screening, and been  deemed  eligible  for inclusion in the study. Initial Treatment  infusion of IMP  
must be given within 4 days after signing of informed consent. Infusions of IMP must be given at least 3 days apart and no more than 5 days apart for any infusion. All 8 infusions must be administered by Day 28 (± 2 days). Continued Therapy infusions, when applicable, will be given once weekly (± 2 days). Flare therapy infusions, when applicable, will follow the same infusion schedule as the Initial Therapy. Missed  infusions will be documented on the eCRF.  

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  75 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
On the day  of infusion, the following procedures/assessments will be performed:  
• Vital Signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], temperature, and respiratory rate [RR]; 
please see Table 13 for time points)  
• Oxygen Saturation Monitoring:

o Detailed  instructions on IMP preparation, handling, and administration  may be found 
in the IMP  Manual.  
 
7.1.2.1 Special  Guidance  for Investigators During  IMP  Infusion  
During IMP  administration,  infusion should be stopped if:  
1. The subject shows signs of respiratory compromise such as tachypnea, cyanosis, 
complains of shortness of breath, etc. regardless of  the oximetry  reading. 
2. SaO2/SAT  decre ases    
 
3. IMP
 infusion may be stopped at the discretion of the Investigator if there is an AE that  
the Investigator believes is related to the IMP, if there is an issue with IMP infusion, or the subject withdraws consent. 
 
If the toxicity evaluation during an infusion resulted in a worsening of a subject’s respiratory functioning by one or more grades (per the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] assessment criteria, Table 14, Section 8.1.3) in comparison to the pre-infusion status, and the respiratory status did not return to baseline levels after symptomatic treatment, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor in order to discuss each specific case and determine  whether t he subject  will be  precluded from additional IMP infusions. 
 
No other medications  should be given during the investigational agent  infusion unless 
determined medically  necessary  by the Investigator. 
 
7.2 Efficacy  Assessments 
7.2.1 GVHD  Assessments 
GVHD assessments will  be performed  weekly, from Day  14 (±2 days) until Day 100 
(±7 days). During assessment weeks in the Initial Therapy period, the assessments must be performed after infusion of the 2
nd dose of remestemcel -L for that week (or after the 1st dose of 
remestemcel -L during Continued Therapy). The  weekly  assessment  visits should be conducted 
at least 24 hours after the most recent remestemcel -L infusion. These weekly GVHD  
assessments will be used to assess the GVHD status according to the definitions which are provided for grading and determination  of progression or improvement. 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  77 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
Rescue therapy  may be administered  if necessary.  If new  GVHD medication(s)  are administered  
as rescue therapy based on the assessment(s), no further remestemcel -L infusions will be  
allowed.  Subjects will otherwise remain in the study regardless of response and will continue to 
be evaluated per the assessment schedule.  
 
Progression of disease is defined as deterioration of GVHD by at least one organ system by one 
organ stage or more from screening/baseline assessment up to Day 28 and from the most recent prior assessment from Day 28 to Day 100. Progression is not defined as ‘mixed response’ according  to the definitions described above in  Table  4. 
 
7.2.2 Therapy  Assessments 
Therapy assessments will be performed at each study visit after Day 0.  Assessments must be  
after the 2nd dose of remestemcel -L is administered for each assessment week of the Initial 
Therapy period (or after the 1st dose of remestemcel -L during Continued Therapy). A schedule 
of the planned assessments is detailed in  Table 11. 
 
Day 28 Therapy Assessment:  
A therapy  assessment  will be performed  on Day 28 (±2  days) to determine  treatment  response 
and whether a subject will be provided Continued Therapy. The Day 28 therapy assessment must be at least 24 hours after the last dose of remestemcel -L is administered.  Continued 
Therapy will be allowed for subjects according to their response to t reatment, as described in  
Section  4.1.4.3. 
 
Day 56 Assessment of  Response to Continued Therapy 
A therapy assessment will be performed on Day 56 (±2 days) for all subjects. The Day 56 therapy  assessment must  be at  least 24  hours after the last  dose of remestemcel -L is administered  
for subjects receiving Continued Therapy, in order to determine treatment response to the Continued Therapy. 
 
Ongoing GVHD assessments will be performed  to assess the subjects’  eligibility  for flare  
treatment  in accordance with Section 4.1.4.4. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  78 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
7.3 Safety  Assessments 
All AEs,  including those considered to  have a causal  relationship  to the IMP,  will be collected  
weekly at each assessment time point.  AEs collected will consist of both solicited and events 
voluntarily reported by the subjects.  
 
Infusional toxicity will be evaluated at each remestemcel -L administration from the start of  
infusion to two hours after the start of  IMP administration  
 
Measurement of all clinical parameters should be performed as described in Table 12. Standard 
instructions for determining  these parameters  are provided in the following sections. 
 
7.3.1 Physical Examination 
A physical examination, including but not limited to a targeted examination for evidence of AEs, will be performed at Screening, Day 0, and at each weekly visits from Day 14 (±2 days) until Day 100 (±7 days). 
 
Information about physical examinations must be available in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to the start of the study drug must be included in the relevant CRF on medical history/current medical conditions.  Significant new 
findings made after the start of the study drug that meet the definition of an AE or SAE must be recorded  on the Adverse Event CRF. 
 
7.3.2 Vital Signs  
Measurements  of vital signs (BP, HR,  respiratory  rate, temperature,  and oxygen saturation) 
should be assessed at Screening, Day  0, and at each weekly  assessment  from Day  14 
(±2 days) through Day 100 (±7 days). Manual or automated procedures for obtaining BP are acceptable as long as the same method  and same arm are used throughout th e study. 
Measurements of vital signs will include sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2, pulse oximetry), temperature, and  
respiratory  rate (RR).  
 
Vital signs will be measured after approximately 5 minutes of quiet rest with the subject in a  
sitting position. Ideally, the site should have a dedicated blood pressure machine and use the  
same machine and blood pressure measurement method  for all  subjects during the trial.  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  79 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
Any clinically  significant findings in  vital sign  measurements  compared  with  baseline 
measurements  should be recorded as an  AE. 
 
7.3.3 Height  and Weight 
At the screening and end of study visits, height and weight should be measured. The weight  
measurement  at Screening  will be used to determine  the dose of IMP to be used  throughout the 
subject’s  treatment period.  
 
Measurement of height from a standing position should be performed with the subject’s shoes 
removed, the knees  straightened,  and head  held upright. For infants, height should be measured  
with the child lying down, and measurements should  be recorded  as recumbent length. 
 
Measurement of weight should be performed without shoes or extra layers of clothing (e.g., sweater  or jacket)  during the measurement. Subjects  should be weighed  on the same scales  at all 
visits.  
 
7.3.4 Electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
Electrocardiogram  (ECG) will be  performed  at screening  and at the  End of Study/Day 100 
(±7 days) to assess any changes in cardiac physiology. Subjects should be in a supine or semi- supine position for at least  5 minutes prior to  the recording. The same recording position (supine 
or semi -supine) and the same equipment  should be used for each  subject  throughout the study. 
 
All ECG  tracings must be  (1) reviewed by  a medically  qualified member  of the  study team,  
(2) annotated to indicate any clinical finding, and (3) signed and dated by the medically  qualified  
member, and (4) filed with the notes for the subjects. ECG parameters will be entered into the CRF,  and if any ECG abnormality  is associated with an  AE, it must be entered in  the AE  CRF.  
 
Heart  rate, PR, QRS and  QT durations should also be  noted on the CRF  along with the  ECG  
parameters.  
 
7.3.5 Adverse Events  
All AEs,  including those considered to  have a causal  relationship  to the IMP,  will be collected  
weekly at each assessment time point.  AEs collected will consist of both solicited and events  
voluntarily reported by the subjects.  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  80 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
7.3.6 Assessment  of Infusional Toxicity 
A theoretical risk of decreased respiratory function during the infusion exists, though to date, no 
infusional toxicities have been reported. Infusional toxicity will be evaluated by continuously monitoring the subject’s  vital signs and SaO2/SAT via pulse oximetry  from  investigational agent  
administration  through two hours after starting infusion. 
 
7.3.7 Pregnancy  Tests  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed by the site personnel for all female subjects of childbearing potential (≥10 years of age) at screening. At post-screening visits, a urine dipstick test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential (≥10 years of age) as per  
Table 10. A positive dipstick test would require a serum sample to be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation. Pregnancy test  dipsticks will be provided to the sites before study 
initiation.  Details on pregnancy testing requirements  are located in  Appendix 6. 
 
7.3.8 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
A designated laboratory (or laboratories) will perform t he analyses of all specimens collected.  
Collection, shipment of samples, and reporting of results by the central or local (if needed) laboratory (or laboratories) will be detailed in the laboratory manual provided to the Investigators. Collection for local labs should be performed for all subjects at screening. If the  
age/weight of the subject permits, collection for central labs should also be performed at screening, in addition, in order to facilitate comparison of later samples sent to the central lab. If age/weight of the subject does not allow for this additional blood volume, then local labs at screening will serve as baseline labs.  The laboratory tests to be performed for subjects in this 
study are listed in  Table 12. 
 
If necessary, laboratory assessments may be performed by a laboratory other than the designated laboratory. In this case, normal ranges of test values for this laboratory should be provided to the Sponsor. 
 
The Investigator at each site is required to review all clinically relevant laboratory results  
requested in the protocol and to record those results in the CRF. The diagnosis associated with  
any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be recorded as an AE on the CRF. The  
reported  AE should indicate  the underlying abnormality  or diagnosis (e.g., renal  insufficiency) as  
opposed to the observed deviation in laboratory results (e.g., elevated creatinine) if in fact the underlying abnormality  or diagnosis is known. If there  is no apparent underlying abnormality  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  82 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
7.3.9 Assessment  of Ectopic Tissue Formation (optional per Investigator’s discretion)  
To detect any ectopic tissue formation, a radiologist and an Investigator at each study site will 
compare the CT/MRI scan , if collected at screening, with the CT/MRI scan performed at study 
end to determine if there is ectopic tissue formation.  The same method of radiologic scan should 
be used for both evaluations. If the formation of ectopic tissue is suspected, further eva luation  
may be indicated, which could include positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning and possibly biopsy. 
 
With consideration of the low incidence of ectopic tissue formation from the safety data, the risk of high radiation  exposure from  computed tomography (CT) scans,  the required  administration  
of contrast agents, and the potential need for anesthetics in an ailing pediatric subject population, Investigators may choose to omit CT/MRI scans at their own discretion, provided the rationale for  omission  is documented in  the source documents.  
 
7.4 Long- Term  Safety  and Efficacy  Follow- Up 
Long- term efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at Days 56 and 100.  At Day 56  
(±2 days), a GVHD and remestemcel -L therapy assessment will be performed to determine  
whether subjects show response to Continued and/or Flare  Therapy, when  applicable.  At 
Day 100 (±7 days), assessments of GVHD  grade  and survival will be determined.  
 
In addition, an extension study under a separate protocol (MSB-GVH002), subsequent to the 
present  study, is also planned in order to capture health outcomes and safety  data out to Day 180. 
 
7.5 Missing  or Delayed  Study Visits  
Every effort should be made to ensure compliance with prescribed study visits. Missing of study 
visits is generally not permitted.  However, in exceptional situations and with the Sponsor’s 
approval, visits may be postponed. 
 
7.6 Subject  Demographics  and Other Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic data will include: 
• Gender  
• Age 
• Race and ethnicity  
• Smoking Status  (Never  Smoked, Current  Smoker, Previous Smoker) 
• Weight

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  84 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
7.8 Background,  First -Line,  Second -Line,  and Concomitant Medication  
If an agent used for prophylaxis of aGVHD is discontinued and restarted prior to initiation of  
corticosteroids to treat aGVHD, it is considered a prophylactic agent. If the agent is restarted  
after initiation  of corticosteroids to  treat  aGVHD,  it would be considered  a second -line agent.  
 
7.9 Concomitant Medication  and Supportive  Therapy  
Information on all concomitant medications will be collected for this study, including  
information  on all concomitant therapy to treat aGVHD.  
 
7.9.1 Standard of Care for aGVHD  
All enrolled subjects will receive institutionally defined standard of care (i.e., maintenance of  
steroid  treatment  and other  prophylactic treatment for  aGVHD).  In addition, investigators should 
provide standard of care for prevention and treatment of viral infections, particularly if there is 
evidence of viral reactivation.  In some cases, such as those involving adenoviral treatment or 
where no other approved treatment is available, patients may be treated with experimental agents  
at the Investigator’s discretion. However, if a subject begins other second-line therapy for GVHD (e.g., anti-TNF or anti- IL-6 agents) within the period of Initial and Continued Therapy 
(through Day 56, if  applicable),  he or  she would be considered  to have failed  treatment  and 
would be ineligible to receive any further remestemcel -L therapy upon receiving the other 
second -line GVHD therapy. 
 
7.9.2 Concomitant Medications  
Information  on all  concomitant  medications  will be collected for  this study, including 
information  on all concomitant therapy to treat aGVHD.  
 
Subjects may continue to be treated with a stable dose of systemic steroid therapy until subject is  
able to be tapered following initiation of remestemcel- L (Day 0).  Subjects may also continue 
any prior therapy used for prophylaxis at a stable regimen from baseline.  No other GVHD  
medications are to be introduced to subjects during the initial 28 days post remestemcel-L administration  unless disease has progressed. 
 
If a subject begins other second-line GVHD therapy within the period of Initial and Continued 
Therapy  (through Day 56, if applicable), he or she  would be considered to have failed treatment  
and would be ineligible  to receive any  further remestemcel -L therapy  upon receiving  the other 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  85 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
second -line GVHD therapy. However these subjects would remain on the study for safety 
follow up. 
 
Second line agents to treat GVHD will be coded using the World Health Organization dictionary 
(latest  available version) and presented  by preferred  term  for GVHD second line  agents  based  on 
reported  drugs for GVHD treatment.  
 
7.9.3 Steroid  Taper  
If improvement in  GVHD (CR or  PR) is observed for a period of 3-5 days and after  at least  two 
doses of remestemcel -L, the dosing of methylprednisolone or equivalent may be tapered. A 
steroid  taper rate of at least 10% of the dose per week but not to exceed 25% of the dose per 
week  is recommended  as described in Appendix 5, with  the goal of discontinuing steroid by 
10 weeks  after  initiating  taper.  
 
7.9.4 Escalating of Steroid Therapy  
Protocol guidelines for escalating  steroid therapy of aGVHD for  worsening disease include: 
1. Worsening of symptoms for at least  3 days OR  
2. Grades  C-D aGVHD persisting  for at least  1 week  despite treatment OR 
3. Grade B  aGVHD persisting  for at  least  2 weeks  despite treatment.  
 
Escalation of steroid therapy prior to Day 28 does not constitute withdrawal of a subject from the study. If escalation of steroid therapy occurs, the subject is to continue on the study and receive all treatments and assessments per protocol.  If second line agents are added, the subject would 
remain  on study for safety  follow up and would not receive any  further remestemcel -L treatment.  
 
7.9.5 Supportive  Care  
In addition to prescribed  investigational agent  plus corticosteroids and prophylactic  therapies,  
all subjects  may receive the following: 
• Transfusion support per institutional practice.  Type  of transfusion and the number of 
units will be  recorded in  the eCRF.  
• Anti-infective  prophylaxis directed  towards: CMV,  gram  positive (encapsulated)  bacteria,  
pneumocystis carinii  and fungal infections per institutional practice.

8. SAFETY  GUIDANCE  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Eve nt 
An AE is defined by the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice as  any untoward medical  occurrence in a subject  administered  a pharmaceutical  
product and which does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with  the treatment.  
 
An AE can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated  with the  use of a  medicinal product,  whether  
or not considered related  to the medicinal  product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation  of an  existing  disease (a worsening in the character,  
frequency,  or severity  of a known condition) 
• Recurrence of an  intermittent medical  condition (e.g., headache)  not present  at baseline 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  87 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
• Any deterioration in  a laboratory value or other clinical  test (e.g., ECG, X- ray) that  is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment  or discontinuation from study drug. 
 
Adve rse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening procedures such as biopsies etc.) are to be 
reported. 
 
Recording of AEs will begin upon signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Pre -existing  
conditions that worsen  during a study are to be reported as AEs. 
 
8.1.2 Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) (Immediately  Reportable to the Sponsor)  
An SAE  is any  AE that  meets any  of the following  criteria:  
• Fatal  (i.e., the AE  actually  causes or  leads  to death)  
• Life threatening  (i.e., the AE, in the view  of the Investigator, places  the subject at  
immediate  risk of death) 
o This does not include any AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was 
allowed  to continue, might have caused death. 
• Requires  or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s  ability  to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug 
• Significant medical  event in  the Investigator's judgment (e.g., may  jeopardize the subject  
or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above). 
 
8.1.3 Severity  
A clinical determination will be made of the severity of an AE.  The terms “severe” and  
“serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a description of the intensity of the manifestation of 
the AE and is distinct from seriousness, which implies a subject outcome. Severity will be  
assessed  according to the US  National Cancer  Institute  (NCI) Common  Terminology Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale. 63 (Table 14)

9. REPORTING  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
9.1 Procedures  for Reporting  Adverse Events  and Serious  Adverse Events  
Any AE occurring  after a subject has signed the informed  consent should be  recorded  on the 
appropriate CRF  page.  
 
Any SAE (as described in Section 8.1.2) occurring after a subject has signed the informed 
consent should be immediately reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. All subjects with an SAE must be followed up and the outcomes reported until the event  is resolved or has stabilized. 
 
Upon occurrence of an  SAE,  the Investigator must: 
• Immediately notify the Sponsor’s designee, Quintiles Lifecycle Safety (QLS). SAE 
reporting will originate  in the electronic data capture (EDC) system  and an email will be 
sent to individuals with designated responsibility for safety. Primary and secondary cause(s)  of death will be recorded on  the eCRFs  for SAEs that are fatal.  
• The paper  SAE form  is in place as  a back -up in the rare event that  EDC is  not access ible 
to the reporter of the  SAE:  
o If the EDC is not available, email the  SAE  form  to the QLS safety  mailbox: 
 
• Provide copy of all relevant  source documents, including medical  history, and  
concomitant medications, as appropriate. 
 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study product will be reported by the 
Sponsor or its designee as a 15-day report to the Regulatory Authorities as applicable  and to all 
participating  investigators. 
 
SAEs that are considered unexpected, related to the study and are life threatening, or result in death will be reported by the Sponsor or its designee to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities and to all participating investigators as a 7- day report.  
 
Each  investigator must notify the IRB/EC responsible for reviewing  the study at their  site of all  
15-day or 7-day safety reports required by local regulations or IRB/EC requirements and shall provide the Sponsor or its designee with written  confirmation of said  IRB/EC notification.

  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  90 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
9.2 24-Hour Urgent  Medical  Contact 
A Quintiles  Medical  Advisor is  available for  24/7 urgent contact in  this study.  If the Quintiles  
Medical Advisor is not able to provide 24/7 services for a period longer than 2 hours (e.g. for 
international business travel) or during vacations, adequate medical back-up with documented training on the protocol and experience with the therapeutic area will be arranged and communicated.  The system of 24/7 coverage ensures that a qualified medical advisor is 
available for advice within a safe and reasonable time frame.  
 
The following additional numbers are also  available for 24/7 urgent contact:  
 or  
 
9.3 Procedures  for Reporting  Pregnancies  
All pregnancies that occur during the study are to be reported immediately to the individual identified  in the clinical  study personnel contact information  section of this protocol, and the 
Investigator must provide Sponsor or designee, by facsimile, a  Pregnancy  Tracking  Form.  
Pregnancies in female partners of male subjects are not required to be followed up. All subjects  
who become pregnant will be monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Monitoring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (e.g. hemorrhage, spontaneous abortion), in addition to the Pregnancy Form, a separate SAE form must be provided as described in  Section  9. 
 
9.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory test results will appear on laboratory reports that are submitted directly from the  
central  laboratory. Local laboratory  results  should be recorded  on the CRF, if  applicable.  
 
Any laboratory result that fulfills the criteria for an SAE should be reported as both an SAE and 
as an AE  in the CRF.  
 
Any treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory result that is clinically significant should be 
recorded as a single diagnosis in the CRF. A treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory result is 
considered  to be clinically  significant if  it meets  one or more  of the following conditions: 
• Is accompanied  by clinical  symptoms. 
• Requires change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation 
of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment).  

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  91 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
These conditions will apply to any protocol- and non-protocol- specified safety and efficacy  
laboratory re sults from tests performed after ICF signature that fall outside the laboratory  
reference range and are considered clinically significant.  These conditions will not apply to any 
abnormal laboratory results that are outside the laboratory reference range, yet does not meet the 
criteria for clinical significance; these latter results will be analyzed and reported as laboratory  
abnormalities.  
 
In the event  of clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  test values,  the tests should be repeated  
and followed up until they have returned to the normal range and/or the abnormality is adequately explained or accounted for. If an acceptable explanation is established, it should be recorded  on the CRF. 
 
9.5 Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and  Ethics Committees  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all AEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, IECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
 
To determine reporting requirements for single AE cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness  of these events using the following reference documents: 
• IMP IB 
• IMP Development  Core  Safety  Information (DCSI) Document, if applicable.  
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported  for the  study with the  severity  and frequency reported in the applicable reference 
document. 
 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness,  with allowance  for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.

10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  AND ANALYTICAL  PLAN 
10.1 Study  Design  and Randomization 
This is an open- label single -arm study. No randomization will take place.  All enrolled subjects  
will be treated with remestemcel -L. 
 
10.1.1 Sample  Size and Power 
The primary  objective of this trial is to confirm efficacy  of remestemcel -L in improving Day 28 
OR rate within the  full analysis set (FAS)  population. 6 
 
For assessment of efficacy, an effect size of 20%, which has been deemed clinically meaningful 
based  on di scussions with  clinical  experts on aGVHD, was  used  to calculate the null hypothesis. 
The null hypothesis was calculated using 45% OR, a rate that is 20-points lower than the anticipated 65% OR rate to remestemcel -L. This estimated 45% response rate as the null 
hypothesis is further supported by data showing comparable Day 28 OR rates for historical populations of aGVHD patients treated with standard of  care. 
6,16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this study, a 28-day OR rate for a subject population treated only with steroids was conservatively anticipated to be 65%,  
 Hence, p=0.65 was chosen as the alternative 
hypothesis. 
 
Accordingly, the null and alternative hypotheses are as follows: 
H0: p = 0.45 vs. H a: p ≠ 0.45  
 
Sample size was determined using the East 6.0 software.  The hypothesis test uses a normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution  under the assumption of a symmetric  two-sided  one-

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  94 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
10.2 Statistical  Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be prepared  prior to Database Lock  (DBL)  containing 
details of the statistical analyses and data -handling rules planned for this trial. Post- DBL  
changes to the SAP will be documented in the Clinical Study Report. An overview of main 
methods is given below. 
 
10.2.1 General  Statistical  Considerations: 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  Continuous 
variables  will be summarized  using descriptive statistics  (n, mean,  standard deviation [SD],  
median, minimum, and maximum).  Confidence intervals, if presented, will have a 95% 
confidence level.  
 
The baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing observation taken prior to or 
on the first dose date of study treatment. By this definition of baseline, post- baseline is defined  
as data collected after first infusion (complete or partial) of study treatment.  Data collected at  
unscheduled time points will not be summarized at the unscheduled time points, but will be considered as for  baseline.  
 
The first dose date will be considered  the ‘Study Day 0’. The study day, the actual day  relative to  
start of treatment, will be  calculated  from  Study Day 0. 
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS population. Analyses of the mFAS and PP populations will be used to assess sensitivity  and thus will be considered  supportive. 
 
All statistical tests will be two -sided at the alpha=0.05 level of signif icance.  Confidence 
Intervals will be two sided  at the  95% level.  
 
10.3 Analysis Populations  
10.3.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
This is a single -arm study with no randomization after screening. All subjects who provided 
informed consent, were screened and found eligible to enter the study will belong to the FAS population. The FAS will be used for the primary  efficacy  analysis.  Secondary  efficacy  analyses  
will also be performed on the FAS population. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  95 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
10.3.2 Modified  Full Analysis  Set (mFAS) 
The mFAS  is all subjects  who  provided informed  consent, were  screened  and found eligible  to 
enter the study, however, were treated with IMP stored in cryogenic vials. Primary and  
secondary  efficacy  analyses  will also be  performed on the mFAS population. 
 
10.3.3 Safety  Population 
The safety population will include all FAS subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment  (complete or partial).  
 
10.3.4 Per-Protocol (PP)  Population 
The per -protocol (PP) population will include all subjects who had no major protocol violations 
during the study. In general, not meeting inclusion criteria or meeting any exclusion criteria would be assessed  as major protocol violations. 
 
The primary effi cacy analysis will be repeated as a sensitivity analysis on the mFAS and PP  
populations. The key secondary efficacy analyses will be repeated for the mFAS and PP populations for Overall Survival at Day 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy. The  
prim ary and secondary efficacy analyses performed on the mFAS and PP populations will be 
considered  supportive. 
 
10.4 Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Pre-treatment demographics and subject characteristics will be summarized.  Descriptive  
statistics [e.g., n umber of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum]  will be calculated for  continuous variables [e.g. age and  weight] and frequency  
counts will be tabulated for categorical demographic variables [e.g. gender, ethnicity, race, underlying malignancy or leukemic disease at transplant, donor type, donor compatibility, HSCT source, grade of aGVHD at onset, grade of aGVHD at baseline].  Time from HSCT to onset of  
aGVHD  and onset of aGVHD to  initiation  of study drug will be summarized.  Involvement of 
the skin, lower  gastrointestinal (GI)  tract,  and liver will be summarized  by the number of 
subjects  with one organ, two organs, or all three organs involved at baseline.

10.5 Efficacy  Analysis 
10.5.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint  
Overall  Response  (OR) at Day 28 
OR at Day  28 to remestemcel -L treatment is the  primary  efficacy  endpoint. If a subject  dies 
before  Day 28 or if additional second -line treatment was required  before Day 28, then the 
Day 28 response will considered “No Response” regardless of the actual response reported on 
the Day 28 assessment  form or the end -of-trial form.  For subjects  enrolled  but not treated, the 
Day 28 response will also be  considered  “No  Response”.  If a subject needs to  withdraw from the  
study because of an SAE or because of need for palliative care due to a lack of GVHD response and has completed a 28 day end point assessment, the data from the 28- day assessment will be  
used. 
 
Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed non-responders. No other imputation is planned, as specified in the SAP.  
 
A hypothesis test  will be performed  to assess whether  the percentage of responders is  statistically  
significantly  different  from the  historical control per centage of 45%.  
 
10.5.2 Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints  
10.5.2.1 Overall  Survival at Day 100 post initiation  of remestemcel -L therapy  
Survival will be assessed from initial remestemcel -L treatment to the last date of assessment.  
Since the trial period is 100 days, survival information will be censored at the 100 day time point. 
 
Data-handling rules taking account of visit windows for ascertaining survivor/non-survivor status at Day  100 will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
Percentages of survivors and deaths will be based on all subjects, including those with missing survival information for the lost to follow -up or wi thdrawal.  
 
The association between  Day 28 OR and survival at Day  100, and between Day 28 VGPR and 
survival at Day 100, will be tested for statistical significance.  First, the associations will be  
tested  using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test,  stratifying  by baseline aGVHD grade.  
Day 100 survival Kaplan-Meier curves will be plotted by Day 28 responder and non-responder groups, and differences  between these groups will be  tested  for a  statistically  significant 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  97 of 121 Mesoblast   
  
difference using the log- rank test.  The odds ratio for survival at Day 100 given responder status 
at Day 28 will be presented and tested for statistical significance (whether statistically  
significantly  greater than  1). 
 
10.5.2.2 Rate of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) at Day 28 post initiation of  
remestemcel -L therapy  
The rate of VGPR,  defined in Table 4, will be  described.  The number and  proportion of VGPR  
responders, non-responders, and missing values, will be summarized. The two sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented for  these estimates.  
 
10.5.2.3 Rates  of OR  and VGPR at  Day  100 post initiation  of remestemcel -L therapy  
The number and percentage of responders at Day 100 and for each endpoint will be summarized. Confidence Intervals  at the 95% level  (two  sided) will be presented  for estimates  of proportions. 
 
10.5.2.4 Rates of OR and VGPR at Days 28 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L therapy  stratified by organ involvement 
The rates of OR and VGPR at Day 28 and at Day 100 will be reported by skin, gut (lower GI), or liver involvement at baseline.  Confidence Intervals at the 95% level (two sided) will be 
presented  for estimates of proportions. 
 
10.5.2.5 Rates of OR and VG PR at Days 28 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L 
therapy  stratified  by individual subject  organ involvement 
The rates of OR and VGPR at Day 28 and Day 100 will be reported by the mutually exclusive Skin-only and “Not  skin-only” categories.  Confidence intervals  at the 95% level (two  sided) will 
be presented for estimates of proportions. 
 
10.5.2.6 Rates of OR and VGPR at Days 28 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel-L 
therapy  stratified  by baseline aGVHD grade 
The number and percentage of responders at each time point and for each endpoint will be summarized  by baseline GVHD grade.  Two -sided  confidence intervals  at the 95% level  will be 
presented  for estimates of proportions.

10.5.2.7 Overall survival at Day 100 post initiation of remestemcel- L therapy stratified by  
baseline  aGVHD grade and organ involvement 
The number and percentage of survivors at Day 100 from first infusion date will be summarized 
by baseline grade and organ  involvement. Confidence Intervals  at the 95% level (two  sided) will 
be presented for estimates of proportions. 
 
10.5.2.8 Rate of aGVHD progression requiring additional GVHD medications/ therapy  
through Day 100 post initiation of remestemcel -L therapy  
The incidence rate of GVHD progression requiring  additional GVHD medications  or therapy  
will be summarized by number and proportion of subjects. Two -sided confidence intervals at the 
95% level will be presented for estimates of proportions. 
 
10.5.2.9 Effect of additional remestemcel -L therapy after Day 28 on rate of OR and VGPR 
at Days 56 and 100 post initiation of remestemcel -L therapy  
Side-by-side shift tables, for response at Day 56 and response at Day 100 versus response at Day 28, summarizing  the effect of  additional IMP therapy, will be presented.  
 
Efficacy  analyses will include a  summary  of aGVHD  grade at  baseline,  Day 28, Day  56 and Day  
100. Shift  tables in  aGVHD organ  stages from  baseline to  Day  28 will be presented. Shift tables  
for organ stages will also be presented by organ involvement. Shift tables will also be presented for skin -only stages and separately for “All Others” (that is, excluding skin-only). Response by 
organ for each of these groups (by individual organ involvement, skin-only and all- others) will 
also be summarized as improving, stable or progressing, together with the number of deaths in each case.  
 
As sensitivity analyses, survival will also be calcula ted from the day of transplant and from the 
day of diagnosis of aGVHD to the last date of contact. For all survival data, Kaplan -Meier  
survival curves will be generated and relevant subgroups will be compared using the log- rank 
test. Kaplan -Meier curves  will also be generated  by number of organs involved, and by number 
of infusions (categorized).

11. DATA COLLECTION,  MANAGEMENT  AND  QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The overall  procedures for quality  assurance of clinical  study data are described  in the Sponsor’s 
(or designee’s) Standard  Operational Procedures (SOPs).  
 
Data for this study will be  recorded  using the Medidata Rave System and  eCRF.  
 
The site is expected  to respond to  all SAE  queries within  24 hours and all others  within  
5 business days. A Mesoblast representative,  or a designee,  will perform  final  data review  and 
external  data reconciliations prior to all major milestones,  including database close and lock. 
 
11.1 Assignment  of Preferred  Terms  and Original Terminology 
For classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the Sponsor to the original terms 
entered on the eCRF, using the most up- to-date version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) 64 terminology for AEs and diseases and for treatments and surgical and 
medical  procedures.  
 
12. STUDY COMMITTEES  
12.1 Independent  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board (DSMB)  
A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be set up for the trial to oversee the management of the trial, review the overall safety data, and propose appropriate actions if necessary.  The independent DSMB will consist of physicians with expertise in oncology, stem 
cell transplantation, and conduct of clinical trials and an independent biostatisti cian.  The 
composition of the DSMB and its specific working procedures will be described in a separate charter.  This charter  will clearly  specify  attendees,  rules  and responsibilities,  procedures, review  
meeting  schedule and the data to be analyzed.  
 
The DSMB will follow the  DSMB  charter  and data analyses  will be  done according  to the 
DSMB  charter.  
 
In addition to the regular monitoring of safety, one interim analysis is planned for this study as described in Section 10.1.3. The DSMB will review the data for futility and may make a  
recommendation  on whether  to stop the trial for futility,  as a result  of this  interim analysis.

12.2.2 Follow- up of Safety  and Health  Outcomes  
An extension study (MSB-GVHD002), subsequent to the present study, under a separate 
protocol is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. Subjects may be presented with the IRB/EC approved consents for MSB- GVHD001 and MSB- 
GVHD002  simultaneously  at the  time of consent onto this protocol. 
 
13. LAWS,  REGULATIONS,  AND ETHICS  
13.1 Local Regulations/Declaration of Helsinki  
This clinical study shall be conducted in full compliance with current material and relevant laws and regulations and the Investigator will use best efforts to ensure such compliance. This clinical study will also be conducted in compliance with principles outlined in the “Guideline for Good Clinical Practices” ICH tripartite Guideline 
70 and with the ethical principles of the “Declaration  
of Helsinki”  71 or with the laws and regulations of the country in which  the research  is 
conducted, including but not limited to  the EU  Clinical Trial Directive.  72

13.2 Informed  Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, if local 
regulations permit, to obtain signed Informed Consent from each subject prior to the subject’s participation in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study. For subjects who are not qualified to or are incapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable representative. In cases where both the subject and his/her legal representative are unable to read, an impa rtial 
witness must be present during the entire Informed Consent discussion. After the subject and  
representative have orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the form would attest that the information in the consent form was accurately explained and  
understood. The Investigator or designee must also explain that subjects are free to refuse to enter or  withdraw from  the study at  any time and for any  reason, that a copy of the consent 
would be provided to the subject, and that the process by which consent is obtained is described in the source documentation. The CRFs for this study would contain a section for documenting subject informed consent, which must be completed appropriately. If new safety information results in significant changes in the benefit/risk assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated if necessary. All subjects, including those already being treated, should be informed of the new information, provided with a copy of the revised form, and give their consent to 
continue in the study in accordance with the  IRB/EC requirements.  
 
13.3 Institutional  Review  Board/  Ethics  Committees (IRB/EC) 
This protocol and any modifications as well as appropriate consent procedures, any 
accompanying material provided to the subject, such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent, and advertisements or compensation given to the subject, will be reviewed and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IRBs/ECs.  
 
Before initiation of the trial at each investigational site, approval from the appropriate IRB/EC  
must be obtained. Written approval must be obtained before a trial site is initiated or the  
investigational product is released to the Investigator. 
 
Any extensions or renewals  of IRB/EC approval must be obtained during the course of the study. 
If required, approvals must also be obtained for any changes to the protocol, the Informed Consent form, the written information provided to  subjects, and/or other procedures. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  105 of 121  Mesoblast   
  
Any new information that may adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the 
study will be reported promptly to the IRB/EC by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor, in accordance with applicable local requirements.  Written summaries of the study status will be  
submitted  to the IRB/EC annually, or more  frequently if required  by the EC/IRB.  On completion  
of the study, the IRB/EC will be notified that the study has ended. 
 
13.4 Protocol Adherence  
Investigators will ensure that due diligence is applied in order to avoid protocol deviations or violations as defined  below. All significant protocol deviations and  violations  will be reported  to 
the IRB/EC in accordance with IRB/EC requirements.  All sign ificant protocol deviations and 
violations will be  recorded and reported in the CSR.  
 
13.5 Protocol Deviation 
A protocol deviation is  defined  as an intentional or unintentional change or non- compliance with  
a research protocol.  
 
14. CONDITIONS  FOR  MODIFYING  THE  PROTOCOL  
Requests from investigators to modify the protocol for ongoing studies will be considered only 
by consultation between an appropriate representative of the Sponsor and the Investigator . 
Protocol modifications must be prepared  by a representative of  the Sponsor and  approved by the 
Sponsor. 
 
All protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate IRB/EC for information and 
approval  in accordance with local  requirements,  and to regulatory  agencies  if required. Approval  
must be obtained before any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to  
eliminate  an immediate  hazard  to trial subjects,  or when  the change(s)  involves only logistical or 
administrative  aspects  of the trial (e.g. change in monitor[s],  chang e of telephone number[s]).  
 
15. CONDITIONS  FOR  TERMINATING  THE  STUDY 
Mesoblast reserves the right to terminate the study at any time under the conditions specified in the Clinical Trial  Agreement. In the event  the trial is terminated  before  the planned  completion  
date,  action will be  taken  to assure the protection of the su bjects’  interests.

  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  106 of 121  Mesoblast   
  
15.1 Enrollment  Hold  and Stopping  Rules  
Subject  safety  will be  continuously monitored. The Investigator site will report all  SAEs,  
including all deaths immediately  as outlined in Section 9 . 
 
Additionally, all AEs including all deaths will be periodically reported to the DSMB as per the 
DSMB charter.  The DSMB will investigate these complications through a complete safety  
review.  The DSMB will investigate futility data during interim analysis review.  The DSMB  
will then determine whether enrollment should be continued, continued with modification, suspended, or terminated, and their decision will be communicated to the Sponsor. Please refer  
to Section 10.1.3 and the SAP. 
 
16. STUDY DOCUMENTATION,  CRFS,  AND RECORD KEEPING  
16.1 Investigator's Files  / Retention  of Documents  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into two different separate categories, consisting o f: 1) An Investigator's Study File 
and 2) subject clinical source documents. 
 
The Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments and schedule of assessments, IRB/EC and  governmental approval with  correspondence,  sample  Informed  Consent, drug 
records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization forms, and other appropriate documents/correspondence. In addition, at the end of the study the Investigator will receive the subject data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data, query resolution correspondence, and reasons for changes, in a readable format on CD that must be kept with the  Investigator’s Study File. 
 
Subject clinical source documents may include subject hospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, special assessment reports, signed informed consent forms, and consultant letters. The Investigator must keep the Investigator’s Study File and subject clinical source documents (including the archival CD) on file for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or in accordance with ICH guidelines and local regulations, whichever is of greater duration. After this specified time  
period, the documents may be destroyed. Study sites must notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any trial- related  documents. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  107 of 121  Mesoblast   
  
Should the Investigator wish  to assign the study records  to another party or move them to  another 
location, the Sponsor must be notified in advance. 
 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee compliance with this archiving requirement at the 
investigational site  for any  or all  of the documents, special  arrangements  must be made between  
the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these documents in a sealed container(s) outside of the site in order to ensure that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in the event of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for continued care of subjects, appropriate copies should be made for storing  outside of the site.  
 
16.2 Source Documents  and Background Data  
The Investigator shall provide to the Sponsor, upon request, any required background data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important in cases where errors in  
data transcription are suspected.  In cases of special problems and/or governmental queries or 
requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary for the Sponsor to have direct access to the complete  study records,  provided that subject confidentiality  is protected.  
 
16.3 Audits  and Inspections  
Source documents for this trial must be made available by the Investigator to appropriately qualified  personnel from  the Sponsor’s (or designee's) Quality  Assurance  Unit or its  designees  or 
to health authority inspectors, upon appropriate notification. Verification of the CRF data must  
be by direct inspection of source documents. 
 
16.4 Electronic Case  Report  Forms  
Data for this study will be captured via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system by using eCRFs.  The data will be entered into the EDC system by trained site personnel per the eCRF  
Completion  Guidelines. An audit trail will maintain  a record of  initial entries and  changes  made,  
reasons  for change, time and  date of  entry, and user name of person authorizing entry  or change.  
 
An eCRF must be completed for each enrolled subject.  For each screen -failed subject, the 
reason for screen failure will be collected in the Completion eCRF along with the corresponding screen failure reason.  The entire subject casebook of data must be reviewed and electronically  
signed by the Investigator or by an authorized delegate from the study staff. This also applies to  
records for those enrolled subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject withdraws early  
from  the study, the reason  must be noted at  the end of the study eCRF.  If a subject is  withdrawn  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  108 of 121  Mesoblast   
  
from the study because of a treatment -limiting AE, attempts should be made to clearly document 
the outcome. 
 
The Investigator  should ensure the accuracy,  completeness, and  timeliness  of the data reported to 
the Sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required  repo rts. 
 
17. MONITORING  OF STUDY  
The Sponsor’s responsible monitor (or designee) will contact and visit the Investigator regularly 
and will be permitted, upon request, to inspect the trial records, including CRFs and other pertinent data, provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.  
 
It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the C RFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to ensure protocol adherence and that the data entered on the CRFs are complete, consistent, and accurate.  The monitor must verify that the subject received the study drug. The  
monitor will also have access to laboratory test reports and other subject records as applicable needed  to verify  entries  on the CRFs.  The Investigator (or deputy) must agree to cooperate with  
the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
 
18. CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL  DOCUMENTS  AND SUBJECT  RECORDS  
The Investigator must ensure that subject anonymity is maintained and that subject identity is protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor, subjects should be referenced by an identification code rather than by their names. The  
Investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes, names, and addresses.  The 
Investigator should maintain  documents that will not  be submitted  to the Sponsor (e.g., subjects’  
written  consent forms) in  strict confidence.  
 
19. PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION  OF TRADE  SECRETS  
19.1 Right  to Publish  
Subject to the restrictions in this Article 18 and processes described in this Section 19, an  
Investigator may individually communicate, orally present, or publish in scientific journals or other scholarly  media, the  study r esults.  The Sponsor retains the  title and all rights to,  as well as  
interest  in, the study data and case report  forms.  Authorship will be determined by mutual 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.0 
  Clinical  Study  Protocol   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  109 of 121  Mesoblast   
  
agreement  according  to guidelines published by the International  Committee  of Medical  Journal 
Editors (ICMJE). 73 
 
19.2 Publication  Steering  Committee  
A Publication  Steering  Committee  (the “Committee”) appointed  by Sponsor will be responsible 
for the creation, review and submission of publications and presentations relating to the study 
(i.e. primary manuscript on design, baseline data, mortality, efficacy and safety data) and sub- study, ancillary analyses after completion of the study. The Committee will encourage and  
support other manuscript(s) for publication, content for speaking engagements, abstracts of papers, poster presentations, and similar material by the Study Center and/or Investigator, as deemed appropriate by the Committee.  Prior approval by the Committee must be obtained 
before  any publication or public display of the Study results, alone or in aggregate.  
 
19.3 Procedure  
The Investigator shall provide Sponsor with a written copy of any proposed publication or other disclosure of the Study results, including disclosures at research seminars, lectures and professional meetings  and the submission of papers for publication, at  least sixty  (60) days prior 
to submission for publication or disclosure so that Sponsor may have a reasonable opportunity to: (i) review  and comment on the contents of the proposed publication or disclosure; 
(ii) identify  any trade secrets, proprietary  information or Confidential Information (other than the 
Study results themselves) of Sponsor to be deleted from the proposed publication or disclosure; and (iii) protect proprietary rights to inventions or products developed or investigated under the Study. The Sponsor shall provide, in writing,  any comments  to the Investigator or identify  any 
of the Sponsor’s trade secrets, proprietary information or Confidential Information (other than the Study results themselves) to be edited from the proposed publication or disclosure, within such sixty (60) day period. Upon Sponsor’s reasonable request, Investigator shall delay  
publishing or disclosure for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of receipt of such materials by Sponsor to permit the Sponsor to file patent applications or otherwise seek proprietary protection of subject matter disclosed in any proposed publication or other disclosure. In addition, Investigator shall give due regard to Sponsor’s legitimate interests, such as manuscript authorship, coordinating and maintaining the proprietary nature of submissions to Regulatory Authorities, and coordinating with other ongoing studies in the same field, and agree to accept Sponsor’s reasonable comments and suggestions with respect to such publications or disclosures.

19.4 Multi -Center  Study  
Investigator and Study Center acknowledge that the Study is part of a multicenter study. 
Accordingly and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Study Center and/or Investigator shall not publish or present the Study results until after the first publication, primary manuscript, or presentation regarding the overall study is completed, the results of the Study from all the sites have been published in a single publication or eighteen (18) months after acceptance of the manuscript or the conclusion of the Study at all Study sites whichever occurs earliest, the.  Thereafter, Study Center and/or Investigator may publish or disclose Study results 
in accordance with the  provisions of this Section 19 . 
 
20. STUDY COMPLETION  
Mesoblast  reserves  the right to  terminate  this protocol prematurely  for reasonable cause provided 
that written notices are submitted a reasonable time in advance of the intended termination. The  
Investigator may also terminate the protocol at his or her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to Mesoblast a reasonable time in advance of the intended termination. Advance notice is not required by either  party  if the  protocol is stopped due to  safety  concerns. 
If Mesoblast  terminates  the protocol for safety  reasons, it will immediately  notify the 
Investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for termination. If the  
Investigator elects  to terminate  the study at his or her site,  the Investigator will be responsible for 
returning all investigational products and study-related documents to the Sponsor in a timely manner.  Source documents supporting study- related data must be retained by the Investigator as  
previously described.

Appendix  6: Childbearing  Potential, Pregnancy Testing,  and Contraception  
All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a 
serum pregnancy test at Screening. Post-screening, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at Day 56, Day 100, and at any unscheduled visits under protocol MSB- GVHD001.  On protocol 
MSB -GVHD002, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at End of Study/Day 180 and at any 
unscheduled visit. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the result must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test (conducted by the central labo ratory). 
1 
 
All female  patients  are considered to  be of  childbearing potential unless they  meet  one of the 
following criteria:  
• The patient  has been  post-menopausal (amenorrheic)  for at least 1 year 
• The patient  had a surgical bilateral  oophorectomy (with  or without hysterectomy) more  
than 6 weeks prior to enrollment 
• The patient  had a hysterectomy. 
 
Female  patients  of reproductive or childbearing potential who  are unwilling  to use a 
highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study will be excluded  from  
study participation.  2 
 
Examples  of highly effective contraception include the following: 
• Abstinence  
• Contraceptive pill or transdermal  patch  
• Single barrier  plus spermicide 
• Intrauterine device  
• Implants  for contraception  
• Injections for contraception  (with  prolonged release)  
• Hormonal vaginal device  
• Sterilization,  surgical  tubal ligation  
• Sole sexual  partner  consisting of surgically  sterilized  male  partner  with appropriate post- 
surgical  verification  of the absence of  spermatozoa in  the ejaculate.  
Patients may provide verbal confirmation that the partner completed appropriate follow-up after vasectomy.  Sites  are not required to obtain partner medical  records.

Adults 18 years of age
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1
Pathology report confirming diagnosis of malignancy. Subjects will have advanced or metastatic disease. In the 
case of anaplastic thyroid cancer, subjects may receive nivolumab as part of primary therapy.
Subjects must have measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. 
Subjects must have received standard -of-care primary treatment for malignancy and standard -of-care for relapse 
or refractory disease, if treatment exists. For de novo metastatic disease, subjects with recurrent or refractory 
disease after standard -of-care (first -line or second -line [if treatment exists]) will be eligible for this trial. If there 
is no standard-of-care treatment for de novo metastatic disease (eg, metastatic carcinoid), subjects are eligible to 
enroll without prior first -line (or second -line) therapy. 
Mandatory tissue and blood collection for PD -L1 testing and MMR -deficiency  testing. Tumor tissue (formalin -
fixed , paraffin embedded archival [< 3 months old] or recent acquisition) must be received by a central 
laborato ry before first treatment. In order to receive treatment, the sample must meet the minimum quality 
requirements, as determined by the central laborat ory. If the archival tissue is > 3 months old, a fresh biops y 
will be required to obtain sufficient tissue sample for PD -L1 testing . Archival tissue samples are acceptable for 
MMR testing. A blood sample must be obtained before the first dose of nivolumab. Test results are not required 
for enrollment. (Note: Fine Needle Aspiratio n [FNA] and bone metastases samples are not acceptable for 
submission.)

Study Assessments: The primary  endpoint of this trial is investigator -assessed ORR of nivolumab monotherapy 
which is based on tumo r assessments at baseline and then at 28weeks from first dose of nivolumab. Clinical ben efit 
will be defined. Tumor assessments will occur at week 8, week 16, week 28, and the n every  12 w eeks until disease 
progression , regardless of any dose delay s. Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for 
100 days after last trial dose of nivolumab.
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: Up to 350 subjects
Primary Endpoint: ORR a nalyseswill be summarized for each tumor type.

aTumor tissue will be evaluated for sufficient tumor tissue that meet the minimum quality requirements, received by 
a central laboratory before first treatment. 
bBlood sample will be collected at screening or before first nivolumab administration
cSubje cts will be treated until confirmed progr ession ,unacceptable toxicity , or 24 months of treatment (see 
Section 4.5.3)
dTime interval between dose 8 and dose 9 is 2 weeks; time interval between dose 9 and dose 10 is 4 weeks
Enrollment of up to 350 subjects is expected to require approximately  24 months. Interim 
monitoring and final analyses are planned. Subjects will receive study  drug for the 
maximum treatment duration of 24 months. 
The start of the trial is defined as first visit for first subject screened. End of trial is defined as the 
last scheduled procedure shown in the Time & Events Schedule for the last subject. Study 
completion is defined as the final date on which data for the primary endpoint was or i s expected 
to be collected, if this is not the same.
3.2 Post -Study Access to Therapy
At the conclusi on of the study , subjects who continue to demonstrate clinical benefi t will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied study  drug for the maximum treatment duration specified in 
protocol Section 3.1. Study  drug will  be provided via an extensio n of the study , a roll over study 
requi ring approval by responsible healt h authority  and ethics committee or through another 
mechanism at the discret ion of BMS. BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS 
supplied study  drug if any of the following occur: a) the market ing applicati on is rejected by 
responsible healt h authori ty; b) the study  is terminated due to saf ety concerns; c) the subject can 
obtain medicat ion from a government sponsored or private healt h program; or d) therapeutic

Women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
mena rche and who has not undergone surgical sterilizat ion (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy ) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 
12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or 
physio logical causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle 
stimulat ing hormone, (FSH) level > 40 m IU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificia lly 
suppressed FSH levels and may requi re a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic 
FSH level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug 
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to sto p study  treatm ent
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormali ty or intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinio n of the investi gator, indicates that cont inued participat ion in the study  is not in 
the best interest of the subject
Terminat ion of the s tudy by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily 
incarcerat ion for treatm ent of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious disease) 
illness . (Note: Under specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned may 
be permi tted tocontinue as a participant. Strict condi tions apply, and BMS approval  is 
requi red).
Any event found in the Discont inuat ion criteria as outlined in Sect ion 4.5.3.
Subjects discontinuing study  treatm ent will remain on study  for documentation of progressi on 
and death for up to one y ear.
In the case of pregnancy , the investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor or designee of 
this event. In most cases, the study  drug will be perm anent ly discontinued in an appropri ate 
manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y). Please contact the Sponsor or desi gnee 
within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy . If the invest igator determines a possible 
favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuati on of study drug, a discussi on between the 
investigator and the Sponsor or designee must occur.
All subjects who discont inue study  drug should comply with protocol  specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the 
abilit y to conse nt freely (ie, is im prisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of eit her 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  drug is discont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for the 
discontinuat ion must be docum ented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post -Study Drug Study Follow up
In this study , overall survival is a key endpo int of the study . Post-study  follow-up is of critical 
importance and is essent ial to preserving subject safet y and the integrity of the study . Subjects 
who discont inue study  drug must continue to be followed for collect ion of outcom e and/or 
survival fo llow-up data as requi red and in line wit h Secti on 5 until death or the conclusion of the 
study .
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all treated/randomized subjects outsi de of 
the protocol  defined window (Table 5.1-4). At the time of this request, each subject will be

contacted to determine their survival status unless the subject has withdrawn consent for all 
contacts or is lost to fo llow-up.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to di scont inue study  drug will remain in the study  and must continue to be 
followed for protocol  specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically wit hdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authori zed by subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the 
decisio n to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , if possible. The withdrawal  of 
consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the invest igator, as to whether the 
withdrawal  is from  further treatm ent with study drug only or also from study  procedures and/or 
post treatm ent study follow-up, and entered on the appropri ate CRF page. In the event that vital 
status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available informatio n 
shoul d be used to determine vital status only as appropri ately directed in accordance with local 
law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authori zed by the subject as noted above. Lost to 
follow-up is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum of three docum ented 
phone calls, faxes, or em ails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. 
All attem pts shoul d be docum ented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If invest igator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow-up porti on of the study 
has been included in the subject ’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor -retained third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact

There will be no dose escalati ons or reducti ons of  nivo lumab allowed. Subjects m ay be dosed no 
less than 12 days from  the previ ous dose during q2w cycles. For q4w dosing cycles, subjects 
may be dosed within a 3 day window. Premedications are not recommen ded for the first dose 
of nivo lumab.
Subjects shoul d be carefully monitored for infusion reacti ons during nivolumab administrati on. 
If an acute infusio n react ion is noted, subjects should be managed according to Section 4.5.6 .
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discont inued depending on how well the 
subject tolerates the treatment. Dosing visit s are not ski pped, only  delayed.
Nivolumab Injection: 40 mg/4 mL and 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL) 
Nivo lumab inject ion is to be administered as an IV infusio n through a 0.2-micron to 1.2-micron 
pore size, low-protein binding in-line filter at the protocol -specified doses. It is not tobe 
administered as an IV push or bolus inject ion. Nivo lumab injecti on can be infused undiluted 
(10mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Inject ion, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, 
USP to pr otein concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL. 
When the dose is fixed (eg, 240 mg flat dose), nivolumab inject ion can be infused undiluted or 
diluted so as not to exceed a total infusio n vo lume of 120 mL. Nivo lumab infusion must be 
prom ptly followed by a flush of  diluent to cl ear the line. Instructions for diluti on and infusio n of 
nivolumab injection may be provi ded in the clinical protocol , pharmacy binder, or pharmacy 
reference sheet. Care must be taken to assure sterilit y of the prepared solution as the product 
does not contain any ant imicrobial preservat ive or bacter iostatic agent. 
No incompat ibilities have been observed between nivolumab inject ion and polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), non-PVC/non -DEHP (di[2-ethylhexyl]phthalate) IV components, or glass bottles have 
been observed.

or the study  ends, whichever occurs first .
If requi red for clinic scheduling, subjects may be treated up to 3 days before or after the 
scheduled date, ie, at intervals of not less than 12 days from the previous dose during Q2W 
cycles. For Q4W dosing cycles, participants may be dosed within a ±3 day window. A dose 
given more than 3 days after the intended dose date will be considered a delay . Subseque nt 
treatm ents shoul d be based on the actual date of administration of the previous dose of drug.
Nodose escalat ions or reductions of nivolumab areallowed. Dosing visits are not skipped, only 
delayed.
There areno prem edicat ions recommended fornivolumab until infusion reacti onshave been

4.5.4 Nivolumab Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
Accumulat ing evidence indicates a minorit y of subjects treated with immunotherapy  may derive 
clinical benefit despi te initial evidence of PD.48Subjects treated with nivolumab will be 
permitted to continue nivolumab treatm ent beyo nd initial RECIST 1.1 defined PD until the 
maximum of 24 months from the first treatm ent, assessed by the invest igator, as long as they 
meet the fo llowing cri teria:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
Tolerance of study  drug

BMS -936558 nivolumab
Stabl e performance status
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases)
Subject provi des wri tten informed consent pri or to receiving addi tional nivolumab treatm ent. 
All other elements of the main consent including descript ion of reasonably foreseeable risks 
or discomf orts, or other al ternative treatm ent opti ons will  still apply .
A radiographic assessment/ scan shoul d be perform ed within 6 weeks of initial investi gator-
assessed progressi on to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size or 
continued PD. The assessment of clinical benefit shoul d be balanced by clinical judgment as to 
whether the subject is clinically deteri orating and unlikely to rece ive any benefi t from continued 
treatm ent wi th nivo lumab.
If the investigator believes the subject woul d receive clinical benefit by continuing nivolumab 
treatm ent after scans showing disease progressi on, the subject may continue to receive 
nivolumab treatm ent, remain on the trial, and monitored according to the Time and Events 
Schedule in Sect ion 5.
When a subject receives nivolumab therapy beyond disease progressi on, further progressi on 
from initial progressive disease evaluat ion is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor 
burden (with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase). This includes an increase in the sum of 
diameters of all targe t lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the 
initial progressive disease evaluat ion. Nivo lumab treatm ent shoul d be discont inued permanent ly 
upon determinat ion of further progression.
New lesio ns are considered measureable at the time of initial progressi on if the longest di ameter 
is at l east 10 mm  (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least15 
mm). Any new lesion considered non -measureable at the time of initial progressi on may beco me 
measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at 
least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 
mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusio n of new lesions which beco me measurable, these new lesio ns must demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

4.5.6 Treatment of Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. However , if such a reacti on were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, arthal gias, 
hypotension, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like reacti ons. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusio n react ions shoul d be reported within24 hours to the study  medical  monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the cri teria. Infusi on reacti ons shoul d be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Versi on 4) gui delines.
Treatment recommendations are provi ded below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptom s: (mild reacti on; infusio n interrupti on not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic premedicat ions are reco mmended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 m g at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy  or infusio n interrupti on but responds 
prom ptly to symptomat ic treatm ent (eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticosteroi ds, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylact ic medicat ions indicated for ≤ 
24 hours):
Stop the nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and m onitor subject until resol ution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropri ate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be incre ased to 
100% of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no 
further BMS -936558 will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c premedicat ions are reco mmended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g of hydrocorti sone or equivalent) may be used.

following init ial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae (eg, renal 
impairment, p ulmo nary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or ventilatory  support 
indicated):
Immediately discont inue infusio n of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusio n of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylpredniso lone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject shoul d be monitored until 
the Investi gator is comfortable that the symptom s will not recur. Nivo lumab will be 
perm anent ly discont inued. Invest igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatm ent of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late -occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

Any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor response or progression (including scans 
perform ed at unscheduled timepo ints and/or at an outsi de institution) shoul d be collected for 
RECIST 1.1 tumor assessment and submitted to the BICR.
Study  evaluat ions will take place in accordance with Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2, Table 5.1-3, and 
Table 5.1-4accordin g to RECIST 1.1. CT with IV contrast are the preferred imaging modalities 
for assessing radiographic tumor response. In cases where contrast is contraindicated, a non-
contrast scan will suffice. Screening (baseline) tumor assessments of, chest, abdo men, pelvis, 
and all known / suspected sites of disease are to be performed prior to first dose. Subsequent 
assessments shoul d include chest, abdomen, pelvis, and all known / suspected sites of disease 
using the same imaging method and technique as was used at ba seline. 
For evaluating CNS metastasis, brain MRI is the requi red imaging method, and assessment is 
requi red during screening in subjects with a  k nown history of treated brain metastases. All 
known sites of disease (including CNS) should be assessed at baseline and subsequent  
assessments using the same imaging method and technique. If more than 1 method is used at 
screening, then the most accurate method according to RECIST 1.1 should be used when 
recording data, and shoul d again be used for all subsequent assessments. Bone scan, PET scan, 
or ultrasound is not adequate for assessment of RECIST 1.1 response. Previously treated CNS 
metastases are not considered measurable lesions for purposes of RECIST 1.1 determined 
response. Subjects with a history  of brain metastasis shoul d have surveillance MRI 
approximately  every  12 weeks or sooner if clinically  indicated. 
Radiographic tumor response will be assessed at Week 8 (days), Week 16 (days), and 
Week 28 (days) ,then every  12 weeks (days) until disease progressi on, beyo nd 
progression, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. Tumor assessments for all subjects 
shoul d continue as per protocol  even if dosing is interrupted. Tumor measurements shoul d be 
made by the same investigator or radiologis t for each assessment whenever possible. Change in 
tumor measurements and tumor response to guide ongoing study  treatm ent decisio ns will be 
assessed by the investigator using the RECIST 1.1 criteria (see Appendix 4for details of 
RECIST 1.1).49Independent adjudicat ion will resolve equivocal interpretati ons of imaging 
resul ts.
Local radiologic assessment of tumor measurements will be used during the study for clinical 
management and investigator- assessed disease progression using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The sam e 
imaging modality used in screening must be used in all subsequent imaging assessments. Any 
incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that are not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the study investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a clinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom , or di sease 
temporally associ ated with the use of study drug, wheth er or not con sidered related to th e study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and shoul d be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The causal relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable cau sal relati onship between study  drug administrati on and the AE.
Not rel ated: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administrati on and 
the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be

questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.) Care shoul d be taken not to 
introduce bias when col lecting AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs shoul d be guided by 
clinical judgement in the context of  known adverse events, when appropri ate for the program or 
protocol . 
Sponsor or designee will be reporting adverse events to regulatory  authori ties and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and 
FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
Immune-mediated (IM) adverse even ts are AEs consistent wi th an immune -mediated m echanism 
or immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which 
were exacerbated by the induct ion of autoimmunit y. Information supporting the assessment will 
be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheti cally might have caused death if it 
were m ore severe)
requi res inpat ient hospitalizat ion or causes prolon gation of existing hospi talizat ion (see 
NOTE below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening o r resul t in death or hospitalizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcom es listed in the defini tion above.) 
Examples o f such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency 
room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not 
resul t in hospi talizat ion.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs 
Suspected transmissio n of an infect ious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug i s an SAE. 
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory  definit ion, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See 
Secti on6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the BMS -936558 Nivol umab Invest igator Brochure represent the 
Reference Safety Informat ion to de termine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited 
reporting. Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, includi ng those thought to be associ ated 
with protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening 
period and within 100 days of the last dose of nivolumab. If applicable, SAEs must be collected 
that rel ate to any  later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a fo llow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator m ust report any SAE that occurs af ter these time peri ods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal  of previous therapy  or a c omplicat ion of a study 
procedure), the relat ionship must be specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether rel ated or not rel ated to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to Sponsor 
or designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must berecorded on the SAE 
Report Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electroni c or paper forms). The 
preferred method for SAE data reporting collect ion is through the eCRF. The paper 
SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up opti on when the eCRF system

Inform ation list.
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or ifnew informat ion 
beco mes available, the SAE report m ust be updated and submi tted wi thin 24 hours to Sponsor or 
designee using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regul atory authori ties and ethics committees according 
to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal

6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The co llection of nonseri ous AE informati on should begin at ini tiation of study drug. Nonseri ous 
AE informat ion shoul d also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observat ional period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or discont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and described on th e nonseri ous 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalit ies 
that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deem ed to be treatm ent-related) shoul d be

6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  drug, it is subsequent ly discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study  exposure, including during at least 
5half-lives after product administrati on, the investigator m ust immediately notify t he Sponsor or 
designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  to BMS
Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporti ng 
procedures described in Sect ion 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study  drug will be permanent ly discont inued in an appropri ate manner 
(eg,dose taperi ng if necessary for subject safet y). Please call the Sponsor or designee within 
24hours of awareness of the pregnancy.
The invest igator must immediately noti fy the Sponsor or designee of this event and complete and 
forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of awareness of 
the event and in accordance wit h SAE reporting procedures described in Sect ion6.1.1 . 
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant shoul d be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for BMS to collect any pregnancy surveillance inform ation from 
the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for di sclosure of this 
inform ation. Informati on on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form .
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental  or intentio nal administrati on ofany dose of a product 
that is consi dered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Hepatotoxicit y, such as transaminase elevat ions and hepat itis, has been ident ified as an important 
risk for nivo lumab. 
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a  p otenti al DILI event. All occurrences of potenti al DILIs, 
meet ing the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Sect ion6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2.Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase),
AND
3.No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre-exist ing chronic or acute liver dis ease, or 
the administration o f other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
A hepat ic AE management algorithm that has been established (Appendix 3) and applied across 
the nivolumab program  remains appropri ate for managing drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
cases . The experience to date shows that hepat ic AEs, including possible DILI cases, were 
manageable using the established management algorithm and thus do not meaningfully alter the 
benefit/risk of nivo lumab in the advanced malignancy populat ions.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, 
electrocardi ogram , x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment requi red or not required 
by protocol  should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingly.
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE AND OTHER EXTE RNAL 
COMMITTEES
A Steering Committee comprised of trial invest igators, trial statisticians, and BMS physicians 
will be created to desi gn the tri al and govern the tri al’s c onduct, scope, and execut ion. No DMC 
will be formed for this trial. The onco logy therapeuti c area of BMS has primary responsibilit y 
for overall design and conduct of the study . Decisions regarding the study  protocol  will be made 
by the sponsor upon consult ation wi th the steering committee.

Overview: This is a Phase 2 single -arm clinical trial that invest igates nivo lumab across multiple 
cancer types. At least 25 tumor types (groups) will be consi dered. If additional groups are 
ident ified in the course of the trial, they will be enrolled and will be included within the 
statist ical analysis provided reasonable estimates of the control  response rates can be ident ified.  
The trial is designed to estimate the underlying ORR of nivolumab in each tumor type (πg). 
Supporting secondary objectives include the duration of response, TTR, CBR, OS, and safet y. 
All subjects will receive nivo lumab.
A hierarchical model that borrows informat ion across tumor subgroups will be used to strengthen 
the overall evidence within each subgroup. Using the hierarchical model, both continuous 
monitoring for fut ility and success will be undertaken throughout the study .
Regularly scheduled trial update analyses occur at most every 4 weeks. At each of these 
analyses, a Bayesian hierarchical model is fit across the data in all cohorts. For each cohort we 
determine the Bayesian posteri or probabilit y that the treatm ent effect in that cohort (treatment 
compared to histori cal control ) is greater than 0 (eg, that treatment is better than control ). 
Formally, if θgis the true l og odds treatm enteffect f or cohort g, we com pute Pr(θ g>0 | data) for 
each cohort g.At the regularly scheduled trial update analyses, each cohort may stop enrollment 
for success or futilit y. If a cohort stops enrollment, subjects currently in the cohort are all still 
followed to their primary endpoint.
Separate final analyses will be conducted for each cohort.  A final analysis for a group will occur 
after enrollment in that group is complete and after all subjects in that group have at least 28 
weeks follow-up. Once a group is stopped early for futility,the group will not be re-opened for 
further enrollment. The final analysis for a cohort declares success if the Bayesian posteri or 
probabilit y that the treatm ent effect in that cohort (treatment compared to historical control) is 
above 80%. For example, cohort g will be declared a success at cohort g’s final analysis if 
Pr(θ g>0 | data) > 0.80. This posterior probabilit y will incorporate the entire dataset at the time o f 
analysis through the Bayesian Hierarchical Model.
Statistical Hypotheses: Let Yi  be the response indicator f or the i th subject. Define πg = Pr(Yi  = 
1 | gi = g) as the underlying probabilit y of response for group g for the experimental treatm ent 
and Rg as the assumed probabilit y of response for group g wit hin the (histori cal) control 
popul ation. Transformat ion to the logit scale is applied for modeling purposes. Let θg be the 
mean log odds treatment effect, ie,

θg=log (π g/(1-πg))-log (R g/(1-Rg)).
Thus, θg is the logistic regressio n coefficient for the treatment within tumor group g. The 
primary  analysis is a set of  group specific tests of θg>0 (equivalent ly, πg > Rg) meaning that the 
treatm ent is better than the assumed control  rate within that group. Thus, the following 
hypotheses are tested for each tumo r group g:
H0g : θg≤0,
H1g : θg>0.

8.1 Sample Size Determination
The maximum overall sample size across all tumor groups is 350 subjects. In addition, the 
maximum permi tted sample size per group is 25 subjects , although a group with high posteri or 
probabilit y of success may be permi tted a l arger sam ple size at Sponsor di scret ion. Some groups 
will enroll more subjects than others. Simulat ion studi es were conducted to evaluate the 
perform ance of the analysis under various assumpti ons for the distribut ion of true underlying 
ORRs across the tumor types. Operating characteri stics including power and type I error were 
assessed.
When the treatm ent effects are similar across all tumor types, estimation efficiencies, due to 
borrowing, resul t in strong trial performance. When all groups are in truth effect ive, the 
individual groups generally exhibit power between 86.8% and 98.0% , under the scenari o of odds 
ratio improvement of 3. When all groups are ineffect ive, the individual groups have between a 
2.1% and 9.5% chance of mistakenly declaring group success. In addi tion, the gl obal type I error 
(proporti on of trials that declare at least 1 group successful when none is effect ive) is controlled 
at 0.539. Full presentation and discussio n of the simulat ion parameters, corresponding simula tion 
resul ts, and exam ple trials are included in the Appendix 1 .
8.2 Populations for Analyses
All enrolled subjects: all subjects who signed an inform ed consent form and were registered 
into the IVRS.
All treated subjects: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of nivo lumab.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint 
ORR is defined as the number of participants with a best overall response of confirmed CR or 
PR divided by the number of all treated parti cipants. Best overall  response is defined as the best 
response designati on, as determined by invest igator, recorded between the date of first dose and 
the date of object ively docum ented progression per tumor-specific response criteria  or the date 
of subsequent therapy , whichever occurs first. For participants without documented progression 
or subsequent therapy , all available response designations will contribute to the BOR 
determinat ion.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoints
8.3.2.1 Duration of Response
DOR is defined as the time from first confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of the first 
docum ented tumor progression as determined by invest igator or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.Participants who start subsequent therapy  without a prior reported 
progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessments prior to initiation of the 
subsequent anticancer therapy . Parti cipants who die without a reported prior progressi on will be 
considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who neither progress nor 
die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. 
8.3.2.2 TTR
TTR is defined as the time from  first dosing date to th e date of the first confirmed response, as 
assessed by  invest igator.
8.3.2.3 CBR
CBR is defined as the number of participants with a best overall response of confirmed CR or 
PR, or stable disease divided by  the number of all treated subjects.
8.3.2.4 Overall survival
OS is defined as the time from the first dosing date to th e date of death. A participant who has 
not died will be censored at last known date alive. OS rate at 1 year is measured as the survival 
rate at 1 year from Kaplan -Meier curve of OS .
8.3.2.5 Safety and Tolerability
Safety and tolerabili ty will be measured by the incidence of deaths, adverse events, serious 
adverse events, adverse events leading to discont inuat ion, immune -mediated adverse events, 
select adverse events, adverse events l eading to dose delay, and specific laboratory ab normalit ies 
(worst grade) in each tumor group. Toxicities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

8.4.6 Outcomes Research Analyses
Not applicable.
8.4.7 Other Analyses 
Not applicable. 
8.5 Interim Analyses 
Interim Monitoring will be conducted, at most, every 4 weeks. At each analysis, the groups w ill 
be evaluated for futilit y and success by compar ing posteri or quantit ies for the overall response 
rate to pre -specified early stopping criteria based on the hierarchical model based on popul ation 
of subjects with at least 28 weeks of follow-up. The design may limit the maximum number of 
subjects per group to 25 subjects within the trial. Available resources will be used more 
effect ively by enrolling subjects in groups that offer greater promise of efficacy . Internal 
assessment of the program  will also take into consideration for the final decisio n of early 
stopping.
Early Futility: If there is a sufficient ly low probabili ty (20%) that the ORR in a group exceeds 
the histori cal rate Rgby at least 10%, then the group will stop enrollment early for futilit y.
Formally, enro llment will stop early for fut ility if:
Pr(πg > Rg+0.10) < 0.20
A group is only eligible for early stopping for futilit y once a minimum of 5 subjects have been 
evaluated for ORR in that group. 
Early Success: If there is a sufficient ly high probabilit y (95%) that the ORR in a group exceeds 
the histori cal rate Rg, then the group maystop enrollment early for success. Form ally, 
enrollment may stop early for success if:
Pr(πg > Rg) > 0.95
A group is only eligible for early  stoppi ng for success once a minimum of eligible 8 subjects 
have been evaluated for ORR in that group.
8.5.1 Pause Rule 
The Bayesian hierarchical model incorporates inform ation from all cohorts into each analysis, 
however the primary driver of the analysis for each cohort is the data from that specific cohort. 
Thus, i t is important that enough data is available in each cohort where possible. To minimize the 
possibilit y of excessive enrollment imbalance between the groups, enrollment may be paused in 
a cohort at any time where 12 or more patients have enrolled, but have not had, yet, an 
opportunit y to complete their 28 week evaluatio n visit (dropouts are not included in this 
calculat ion if they have no post-baseline tumor assessment). The pause may continue until at 
least 75% of the subjects in the cohort have reached 28 weeks follow-up or have discont inued 
due to disease progressi on.
In addition, based on considerations such as emerging external  data, cohorts may be paused by 
Sponsor decisio n in consultation wit h Steering Committee.

9 STUDY MANAGEMENT
9.1 Compliance
9.1.1 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
The invest igator should not implement any deviati on or change to the protocol  without prior 
review and docum ented approval /favorabl e opini on of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authori ty) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study  subjects. If a deviati on or change to a protocol  is implemented to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) prior to obtaining relevant approval /favorable opinio n(s), the deviat ion or 
change will be submitted as soon as possible to:
IRB/IEC 
Regulatory  Authori ty(ies), if applicable by  local regul ations per nat ional requirements)
Docum entati on of approval/favorable opinio n signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authori ty, must be sent to BMS. If an 
amendment substant ially alters the study  design or increases the potenti al risk to the subject: (1) 
the consent form must be revised and submi tted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review and 
approval /favorable opinio n; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study  if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.
If the revisio n is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
9.1.2 Monitoring
BMS or designee representatives will review data centrally to ident ify potenti al issues to 
determine a schedu le of on -site visi ts for targeted review o f study  records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study  site locati ons peri odically to assess the 
data qualit y and study  integrity. On site they will review study records and direct ly compar e 
them with source docum ents, discuss the conduct of the study  with the invest igator, and verify 
that the facilit ies remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the 
source documents:
In addition, the study  may be evaluated by BMS or designee internal auditors and government  
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source docum ents, other study  files, and study 
facilit ies. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The invest igator must notify BMS prom ptly of any inspections scheduled by regul atory 
authori ties, and prompt ly forward copi es of  inspectio n reports to BMS or designee.

9.2.3 Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histori es designed 
to record all observat ions and other data pertinent to the invest igation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control  in the invest igation. Data that are derived from source docum ents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Addit ional clinical informat ion may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding o f product safet y. CRFs may  be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnorm alities
that are reported or ident ified during the course of the study .
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electroni c CRFs will be 
prepared for all data collect ion fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy , which 
will be reported on the electroni c SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respect ively. If 
electroni c SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank 
only in those ci rcumstances permi tted by study -specific CRF completionguidelines provi ded by 
Sponsor of designee. 
The confident iality of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the 
privacy  and confident iality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory  requi rement(s).
The invest igator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and init ials of all persons 
authori zed to m ake entri es and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be prom ptly reviewed, signed, and dated by 
the investigator or qualified phys ician who is a subinvesti gator and who is delegated this task on 
the Delegation of Authori ty Form. Subinvest igators in Japan may not be delegated the CRF 
approval  task. For electronic CRFs, review and approval /signature is completed electronically 
through the BMS electroni c data capture tool. The invest igator must retain a copy  of the CRFs 
including records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electroni c CRFs must meet Sponsor or designee training 
requi rements and must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the unique user 
account provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to 
other individuals.

APPENDIX 4 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TU MORS 
(RECIST) 1.1
1 EVALUATION OF LESION S
Changes in tumor measurements and tumor responses will be assessed by the invest igator using 
the RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluat ion Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. (Eisenhauer, et al 2009.)
Source:  Eisenhauer et al New response evaluat ion criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST 
guideline (versio n 1.1), European Journal of Cancer, 2009, Vol. 45, p 228 -247
1.1 Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor
burden atbaseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease 
is defined by the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesion. When CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a m easurabl e lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.2 Measurable lesions 
Measurable lesio ns must be accurately measured in at least one dimensio n (longest diameter in the 
plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
.10 mm by  CT/MRI scan -(CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
.10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam  (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers shoul d be recorded as non -measurable)
 20 mm by  chest x -ray
 Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologi cally enlarged andmeasurable, a lymp h 
node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater th an 5mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and fo llowed.
1.3 Non-measurable lesions
 All other lesions, including small  lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymp h 
nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non -measurable lesio ns.  
 Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial  effusio n, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdo minal masses/abdominal organom egaly  identified by physical  exam that in not 
measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

1.4 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.4.1 Bone lesions
 Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to measure 
bone lesio ns. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesio ns. 
 Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h identifiable softtissue components , that 
can be evaluated by cross sect ional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesio ns if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of measurabilit y 
described above.
 Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
1.4.2 Cystic lesion s
 Lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts shoul d not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definit ion, simple cysts. 
 ‘Cyst ic lesio ns’ thought to represent cystic met astases can be considered as measurable lesio ns, 
if they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y described above. However, if non-cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesio ns.
1.4.3 Lesions with prior local tre atment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco -regiona l 
therapy , are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in 
the lesio n.
1.5 Specifications by methods of measurem ents
1.5.1 Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All baseline evaluat ions should be 
perform ed as cl ose as possible to the beginning of the treatment.
1.5.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported l esion at baseline and during follow-up. Im aging based evaluat ion shoul d 
always be done rather than clinical examinat ion unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assess able by  clinical exam .
1.5.2.1 CT/MRI scan 
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurabilit y of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumpt ion that 
CT/MRI slice thi ckness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesio n shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness.

BMS -936558 nivolumab 
1.5.2.2 Chest X -ray 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly  when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensit ive than X-ray, particularly  in identifying new lesio ns. However, lesio ns 
on chest X-ray may be co nsidered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated 
lung.
1.5.2.3 Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, docum entati on by color 
photography  including a ruler to estim ate the size of the l esion is suggeste d. As previously  noted, 
when lesio ns can be evaluated by both clinical exam  and imaging, imaging evaluat ion shoul d be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
1.5.2.4 Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are ident ified by ul trasound in the course of the study , confi rmation 
by CT or MRI i s advised. 
1.5.2.5 Endoscopy, laparoscopy
The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumor evaluat ion is not advised.
1.5.2.6 Tumor markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  
1.6 Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions
1.6.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all l esions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (lesions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum ofthediameters (longest f or non -nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum , then as noted bel ow, only the short axis is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diamete rs will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tum or regressi on in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
1.6.2 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
15mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.

Nodes that have a short axis < 10mm are considered non -pathol ogical and should not be recorded 
or fo llowed.
1.7 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record mul tiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as asingle item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver m etastases’).
1.8 Tumor Response evaluation 
1.8.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Com plete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions. Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10mm.
Parti al Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum onstudy (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study ). In addi tion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5mm. ( Note: the appearance of one or m ore new lesio ns is also considered 
progression).
Stabl e Disease (SD):   Neither suffic ient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference th e smallest sum diameters while on study .
1.8.2 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
1.8.2.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
15mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non -pathol ogical and should not be recorded 
or fo llowed.
1.8.2.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measur e’  
All lesio ns (nodal  and non-nodal ) recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (e.g. 2mm). If the radio logist is 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded , even if it is below 5 mm.
However, when such a lesio n beco mes difficult to assign an exact measure to then:
 if it is the opini on of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.

 if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default  
value of 5mm shoul d be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm shoul d be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This defaul t value is derived from the 5mm CT slice thickness (but 
shoul d not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
1.8.2.3 Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
 When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesio n sum. 
 As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter m easurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have tr uly coal esced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should 
be the maximal lo ngest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesio n’.
1.9 Evaluation of non -target lesions 
While so me non -target lesio ns may actually be me asurable, they need not be measured and instead 
shoul d be assessed only quali tatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Com plete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alizati on of tumor 
marker l evel. All lymph nodes must be non -patho logical in size (< 10 mm short axi s).
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):   Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progression).
1.9.1 Special notes on assessment of non -target lesions
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
1.9.1.1 When the subject al so has measurable disease
 To achi eve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non -target di sease, there must be an 
overall level of substant ial worsening in non-target di sease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy . 
 A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
qualit y for unequivocal  progressi on status.
1.9.1.2 When the subject has only non -measurable disease 
 To achi eve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non -target di sease, there must be an 
overall level  of substant ial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy .

BMS -936558 nivolumab 
 A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
qualify  for unequivocal progression status. 
 Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily  quantified (by definition: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to th e increase that woul d be 
requi red to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden represent ing an 
additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesio n). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trac e’ to ‘l arge’, 
an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocol s as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.
 If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject shoul d be considered to have had overall  PD 
at that point. 
1.9.1.3 Tumor markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers are init ially 
above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize in order for a subject to be considered 
as having attained a complete response. 
1.10 New lesions  
The appearance o f new malignant lesio ns denotes disease progression. The finding of a new lesio n 
shoul d be u nequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesio ns may be simply  healing or flare of pre -exist ing lesions). Thi s is particularly important 
when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a 
liver l esion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesion, which i t is not.
A lesio n ident ified on a follow -up study  in an anatomical location that was notscanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progre ssion. An example of this is the subject 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered whic h 
reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have bra in imaging at baseline.
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of its small size, con tinued therapy  and follow-
up evaluat ion will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new  lesion, then progress ion should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
1.10.1 FDG -PET evaluation
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study , it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of the qualitat ive assessment of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT

scanning in assessment of progressi on (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesio ns on the 
basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the fo llowing al gorithm: 
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, wi th a posi tive FDG -PET at follow -up might be a sign of PD 
based on a new lesio n. However, other reasons for newly detected lesio ns wit h increased FDG -
PET uptake, such as inflammatory  lymphnodes, should be taken into consideration.
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a posit ive FDG -PET at fo llow-up: 
If the positive FDG -PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, t his is PD. 
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progressi on 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the init ial posit ive FDG -PET 
scan).
If the positive FDG -PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-exist ing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis o f the anatomic images, this is not PD.
Other reasons for newly detected lesions with increased FDG -PET uptake, such as 
inflammatory  lymphnodes, should be taken into consideration.

1.11.3 Confirmation of Scans and External Evaluation
 Verification of Response: Confirmat ion of response (CR or PR) is requi red. Confirmed CR 
or PR will be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent timepo int 
(minimum 4weeks after criteria for an object ive response are first met).
 Verification of Progression: Progression of disease shoul d be verified in cases where 
progression is equivocal. If repeat scans confi rm PD, then progression shoul d be declared using 
the date of the initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered 
not to have progressive disease per RECIST 1.1.
 External Evaluation of scans: For all subjects, BMS will request the transfer of anonymized 
scans for a BMS internal or external  evaluati on through a third party. For tum or ty pes where 
data from study  CA209 -032 will potenti ally be used for future NDA submissi ons, BMS will 
request the transfer of anonymized scans from all subjects with this tumor type for a BMS 
internal  or external  evaluat ion through a third part y.
1.12 Best overall response: All time points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known. It is defined as 
the best response designation, as determined by the investigator, recorded between the date of first 
treatm ent and the date of object ively docum ented progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of 
subsequent therapy , whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression or 
subsequent therapy , all available response designati ons will contribute to the BOR assessment. 
The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non -
target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesio ns.
Com plete or parti al responses may  be cl aimed only  if the cri teria for each are met at a subsequent 
time point (minimum 4 weeks after criteria of object ive response are first met). In this 
circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 4.

aIf a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disea se meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent sca ns suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
For purposes of this study , the minimum scan time from baseline for determinat ion of SD will be 
6weeks.
1.13 Duration of response
1.13.1 Duration of overall response 
The durati on of  overall response is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively docum ented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements

1.13.2 Duration of stable disease  
Stabl e disease is measured from the start of the treatm ent (in rando mized trials, from date of 
rando mizat ion) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study  (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculat ion of PD).
1.13.3 Immune related Response Criteria
Immune related response criteria using unidimensi onal measurements may be used to describe 
tumor shrinkage following RECIST 1.1 defined disease progressi on Appendix 4. The 
methodol ogy is the same as described above for RECIST 1.1 except:
 New l esions do not autom atically denote disease progression
 The m easurem ent of l ongest di amet er of new measurable lesions are in included in the sum of 
the measurements of the original target lesions.
Best immune related responses, for subjects who have progressi on followed by tumor shrinkage 
are cl assified as irCR (disappearance o f all lesio ns) or irPR (30% reduction fro m baseline).

APPENDIX 6 WOMEN OFCHILDBEARING POTENTI AL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a wom an over age 
45years in the absence of other biological or physi ological causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum fo llicle stimulat ing hormone, (FSH) level > 40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTI ON GUIDANCE FOR FEMA LE PARTICIPANTS OF C HILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effect ive methods of contraception listed below is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 monthsafter the end of study 
treatment .*

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associated with inhibit ion of 
ovulationb
Horm onal methods of contracepti on including oral contraceptive pills containing a 
combinat ion of estrogen and progesterone ,vaginal ring, injectables, implants and 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system  (IUS)c
Intrauterine device (IUD)c
Bilateral tubal occlusio n
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstine nce is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently  and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participatin g in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interactio n with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that 
the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods 
of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrau terine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception *
Male or female condo m with or without spermicide.  Male and female condo ms cannot be 
used simultaneously
Diaphragm  with spermicide
Cervical cap wit h spermicide
Vaginal Sponge with spermicide

methods.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDAN CE FOR MALE PARTICIP ANTS WITH PARTNER(S) OF 
CHILD BEARING POTENT IAL.
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potenti al are eligible to participate if they 
agree to the fo llowing during the treatment and until the end of relevant sy stemic exposure.
Inform  any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study  and the need to 
comply with contracepti on instructi ons as di rected by the investigator.
Male participants are requi red to use a condom for study  duration and until end of relevant 
systemic exposure defined as 7 months after the end of study  treatm ent.

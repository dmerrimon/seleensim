Statistical Methods  
Analysis for 
Primary Bleeding 
Endpoint   The analysis  for the primary bleeding endpoint will be performed on 
the ITT population.  The primary objective is to determine if 
ticagrelor monotherapy is superior to ticagrelor plus aspirin for the 
primary bleeding endpoint (BARC Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding).  The 
null hypothesis for this analysis is th at the HR for the experimental 
group (H 0) = 1.  The alternative hypothesis is that the HR for the 
experimental group (H A) ≠ 1.  A test of superiority at the two -sided 
0.05 level will be performed using a Cox proportional hazard model 
that includes treatmen t group as a covariate.  A point estimate and 
two-sided 95% CI for the relative risk as measured by the hazard 
ratio will be calculated based on the Cox proportional hazards model.  
Event rates will be estimated at one year and Kaplan -Meier curves 
will be plotted for the time from randomization to the first occurrence 
of confirmed BARC Type 2, 3 or 5 bleeding by treatment group.  
This analysis will be repeated in the per protocol ( PP) cohort to 
support the primary results.

Page 5 of 58 Analysis for 
Primary Ischemic 
Endpoint  The analysis  for the primary ischemic endpoint  will be performed on 
the PP cohort.  The primary objective is to determine if ticagrelor 
monotherapy is non -inferior to ticagrelor plus aspirin for the primary 
ischemic endpoint ( all-cause death, non -fatal myocardial infarction, 
or stroke).  Event rates will be estimated at one year and Kaplan -
Meier curves will be plotted for the time from randomization to the 
first occurrence of confirmed all -cause death, non -fatal myocardial 
infarction, or stroke or by  treatment group. A test of non -inferiority at 
the one-sided 0.025 level will be performed. .  . .  Assuming an event 
rate of 8.0% in the control group, a sample size of 8200 will yield 
80% power to exclude an absolute non-inferiority margin  of 1.6%.  If 
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the point estimate of the absolute 
risk difference between groups is less than or equal to 1. 6% then the 
criteria for non -inferiority will be met.   This non-inferiority margin 
translates to a relative risk of 20% assuming t he observed event rate 
equals 8.0% in the control arm.  
Statistical Methods  Unless otherwise stated, all hypothesis tests will be performed using 
two-sided tests at the 5% significance level.  Continuous variables 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics including means and 
standard deviations if normally distributed or median with 
interquartile ranges for skewed distributions.  Discrete variables will 
be summarized using absolute and relative frequencies.  
Sample Size 
Parameters  A cumulative bl eeding rate of 4.5% is anticipate d between time of 
randomization and 1 year.  Assuming a 2% loss to follow -up and 
non-compliance  / cross-over rate of 4% , the current trial will require 
8200 subjects to detect a relative reduction in bleeding of 28% with 
ticagrelor monotherapy with 80% power  and a Type I error of 0.05 .  
It is anticipated that approximately 8% - 10% of enrolled subjects 
will not be eligible for randomization and therefore 9000 subjects 
will be enrolled  at the time of PCI .

1. INTRODUCTION  
Pharmacologic platelet inhibition with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor is a requirement in all 
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting. Such dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended by international guidelines, with duration 
varying according to clinical presentation (i.e. acute coronary syndrome) or type of stent 
implanted during PCI (bare metal vs. drug eluting)( 1-3). The paradigm for DAPT is shifting to 
shorter durations, as evidenced by most recent ESC /EACTS Guidelines on myocardial 
re
vascularization giving a class Ib recommendation for 6 months of DAPT after DES 
(4).While clopidogrel is the most widely used P2Y 12 inhibitor, its efficacy is hampered by 
substantial variability in platelet inhibition that may be attributable to clinical, genetic and 
procedural parameters ( 5-8). Moreover, although the novel thienopyridine prasugrel has a 
more potent and consistent effect on platelet inhibition ( 9, 10), bleeding risk is significantly 
higher compared to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients following PCI 
(11)
. In contrast, ticagrelor, an oral, reversible, direct-acting inhibitor of the adenosine 
diphosphate P2Y 12 receptor ( 12) has proven faster, greater and more consistent P2Y 12 
inhibition than either clopidogrel or prasugrel ( 13-15). In the landmark Study of Platelet 
Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, ticagrelor significantly reduced death from 
va
scular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, without significantly increasing overall 
major bleeding in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes ( 16).  
Along with the advent of more potent antiplatelet pharmacotherapy, stent technology has also 
advanced in a concordant fashion with the introduction of safer and less thrombogenic

Page 14 of 58 platforms. The
se devices, compared to their older-generation counterparts, yield significant 
reductions in thrombotic events that are durable over the long term ( 17).  As a consequence, 
classical paradigms favoring a minimum of DAPT duration of 1 year, particularly in elective 
patients, are being challenged as PCI safety continues to evolve and improve. Randomized 
comparisons of different DAPT durations such as the OPTIMIZE and the PRODIGY trials 
suggest no increased risk for thrombotic events after only 3-6 months of DAPT in PCI patients 
treated primarily with novel generation devices ( 18-22).   
1.1 Research hypothesis 
The overall hypothesis of the current study is that three months post-PCI of dual antiplatelet 
therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor, continued monotherapy with ticagrelor alone versus 
tic
agrelor plus aspirin for an additional year will be superior with respect to bleeding and non-
inferior
 with respect to ischemic events in high-risk patients undergoing elective or urgent 
PC
I.  
This hypothesis will be tested in the following two specific aims: 
Aim 1:  To determine the impact of 
ticagrelor  alone versus ticagrelor  plus 
aspirin in reducing clinically relevant 
bleeding among high -risk patients who had 
PCI. Hypothesis 1:  A DAPT strategy of ticagrelor  + 
ASA for 3 months followed by ticagrelor  alone 
for an additional 12 months will be superior to 
ticagrelor  plus aspirin with respect to clinically 
relevant bleeding (BARC ≥ 2) in high -risk 
patients undergoing PCI.  
Aim 2:  To determine the impact of 
ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor  plus 
aspirin in reducing ischemic adverse events 
at one year among high -risk patients 
undergoing PCI  Hypothesis 2:  A DAPT strategy of ticagrelor  + 
ASA for 3 months followed by ticagrelor  alone 
for an additional 12 months will be will be non -
inferior to ticagrelor  plus aspirin for with 
respect to ischemic adverse events at 1 year in 
high-risk patients undergoing PCI . 
1.2 Rationale for conducting this study 
Despite the trend and rationale for shorter DAPT durations following PCI, certain high-risk 
pati
ents may derive additional benefit from potent and sustained platelet inhibition extending 
beyond 3 months after PCI.  Defined by clinical and/or anatomic criteria, a short course of 
DAPT in such patients may provide sufficient protection against early stent-related thrombotic 
events while ongoing platelet inhibition may yield further reductions in systemic 
atherothrombosis.  Among diabetics undergoing PCI, for example, Brar et al. previously 
demonstrated that the benefits of DAPT compared to antiplatelet monotherapy persisted 
irrespective of BMS or DES use, suggesting a systemic rather than stent-related effect ( 23).  
Analogously, results from the EXCELLENT trial suggested diabetics may derive additional 
benefit from prolonged DAPT (ASA + clopidogrel) compared to ASA alone ( 24).  Findings 
from Dangas et al., which demonstrate a link between atherosclerosis and increased platelet

Page 15 of 58 rea
ctivity, provide a biological basis for potent platelet inhibition in high-risk patients 
characterized by diffuse vascular disease ( 25).  These observations are clinically relevant as 
many patients undergoing elective or urgent PCI exhibit high-risk features, such as renal 
dysfunction, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, that are associated with systemic 
atherosclerosis.  Given the clear benefits of ticagrelor in the setting of high-risk ACS, it is 
plausible that ticagrelor alone will provide sufficient platelet inhibition to reduce thrombotic 
events compared to ticagrelor plus ASA among high-risk patients who have completed a 
requisite short course of DAPT.   
Reduction in bleeding with ticagrelor alone while preserving of the anti-ischemic benefit 
associated with DAPT use would favor such a strategy in high-risk patients undergoing 
PCI.  
Accordingly, the proposed study will examine the comparative safety and efficacy of a 
strategy of 3 month DAPT with ASA and ticagrelor followed by monotherapy using a potent 
agent (ticagrelor) compared to continued ASA and ticagrelor among high-risk patients 
undergoing PCI with DES.  Our primary hypothesis is that, among such patients, use of 
ticagrelor alone will yield a significant reduction in clinically relevant bleeding while 
preserving anti-ischemic protection compared to the combination of ticagrelor and ASA. 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment 
The potential benefits that subjects might realize by participating in this randomized trial is a 
reduction in clinically relevant bleeding for those who are randomly allocated to the placebo 
arm.  Other benefits applicable to all subjects include close monitoring and surveillance for 
cli
nical events that will be performed by study personnel during the course of the trial. 
The potential risks for subject s include an increased rate of thrombotic events for those who 
are randomized to the placebo arm and increased risk for bleeding in subjects randomized to 
the active treatment arm (low-dose ASA [81 mg – 100 mg]).    
An independent data safety monitoring board will provide external oversight to ensure safety 
of all trial participants.  In addition, subjects will be followed closely with periodic study 
contacts.  Also, clinical equipoise exists for conducting a trial with this type of randomized 
compar
ison.

ndomization will be performed within the EDC system among subjects eligible for 
randomization.  The EDC will allocate the treatment group assignment for the subject and 
provide 
study site research personnel the appropriate bottle ID number(s).  
Upon r
andomization at the conclusion of the in-person 3-month visit, the study site research 
personnel will provide a 6-month supply of blinded investigational product (aspirin or 
matching placebo) and open-label ticagrelor. 
Enrolled subjects who do not meet eligibility for randomization will have completed their 
protocol required activities and therefore will not receive any further study-provided 
medica
tions. Their treating physician will also be notified that the patient’s protocol-mandated 
study activities have concluded. Further antiplatelet therapy will be at the discretion of the 
subject’s treating physician in accordance with local standard of care. Vital status of these 
subjects will be determined at the 18-month time point.    
Enrolled subjects who do not meet eligibility for randomization prior to the in-person 3-month 
visit will not be required to complete the 3-month in-person visit.  
5.3 Procedures for handling subjects incorrectly enrolled or 
randomiz ed on investigational product 
Subjects who are incorrectly enrolled will be immediately withdrawn from the study. The 
subject and the treating physician will be notified. If the subject has already been randomized, 
the investi
gational drug (aspirin or matching placebo) will be discontinued and further 
treatment will be as per standard of care. Subjects will be advised to continue therapy with 
ticagrelor until seen by their treating physician. 
Subjec
ts who are provided the incorrect investigational drug (study drug bottle(s) were not 
provided a
ccording to EDC randomization instructions) may be identified during monitoring 
proc
edure and/or drug reconciliation. In this case, the subject will be informed immediately 
a
nd requested to return with all dispensed investigational drugs. The subject will then be 
provided with the correct investigational drug according to the randomization instructions. In 
addition, a protocol deviation form will be completed. 
5.4 Bl
inding and procedures for unblinding the study 
5.4.1 Methods for ensuring blinding 
This study has a double-blind design with aspirin and matching placebo.  The subjects, study 
site research personnel, academic research center staff, and treating physicians involved in the 
tre
atment and/or clinical evaluation of the subjects will not be aware of treatments received.  
There
 will be an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to monitor the data on a 
periodic
 basis.  An independent statistician, not otherwise involved in the study, will prepare 
and provide the required reports to the DSMB as per the DSMB charter.

ethods for unblinding the study 
In the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the investigational drug is critical 
to the subject’s medical management, the blind for that subject may be broken by the treating 
physician.  The investigator should follow the instructions provided in the EDC to obtain the 
necessary treatment information or call the 24/7 TWILIGHT Medical Monitoring Hotline at 
347-541-1376.  As the active study drug in this trial is low-dose aspirin, in most instances the 
subject may be properly managed without the need for unblinding. 
5.5 Treatments 
5.5.1 Identity of investigational product 
In this protocol, the investigational product is enteric coated aspirin (81 mg – 100 mg) tablets 
a
nd matching aspirin-placebo tablets.

5.5.2 Doses and treatment regimens 
Study-provided medications including open-label ticagrelor at a dose of 90 mg twice daily 
plus ope
n-label EC aspirin at a dose of 81mg – 100 mg daily will be dispensed to enrolled 
participants at the time of discharge and should be taken daily until the in-person 3-month 
study visit. Study-provided medications including open-label ticagrelor at a dose of 90 mg 
twice daily plus blinded study drug will be dispensed to randomized participants at the 3-
month in
-person visit and should be taken daily until end of study.   
5.5.3 Additional study drug 
Open-label ticagrelor will be administered to all subjects regardless of randomization 
assignment.  
5.5.4 L
abeling 
Each aspirin/placebo bottle will be labeled in black ink.  This label will indicate the protocol 
number, blinded batch number, container number, blinded drug name, tablet quantity, storage 
conditions, directions for use and route of administration.   
At the study site, the investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to 
local regulations.  It is the responsibility of each site investigator to ensure that the 
investigational product is only dispensed to study subjects. The investigational product must 
be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local 
regulations.

ge conditions for the subjects to follow will be included in the labeling on the bottles. 
5.6 Concomitant and post-study treatment 
There are no protocol specific concomitant treatments.  
At the End of
 Study visit physicians caring for the patient will decide which antiplatelet 
medication the patient should receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care. This 
medication(s) will be open label and obtained locally.  
5.7 Treatment compliance 
Study drug compliance will be assessed using manual pill count at the 9-month and 15-month 
in-person follow-up visits.   
5.7.1 Accountability  
Reconciliation between the quantity of shipped study drugs versus the allocation of study 
drugs via the EDC and versus distribution of study drug to subject will be monitored and 
rec
onciled. 
5.8 Discontinuation of investigational product or study drug 
Study-provided medications (open-label ticagrelor or blinded study drug) may 
require temporary interruption  for the following reasons: 
1. Surgery or invasive procedure :  Study-provided medications should be 
resumed after surgery once the risk of bleeding is no longer considered 
prohibitive in the judgment of the treating physician.  Minor surgeries and 
procedures, including but not limited to tooth extraction, colonoscopy and 
endoscopy, may be safely performed on low-dose aspirin and therefore do not 
require temporary interruption of blinded study drug. However, if deemed 
necessary and at the discretion of the treating physician, open-label ASA may 
be substituted for blinded study drug in the peri-operative period.  Blinded study 
drug may then be restarted at the discretion of the treating physician after 
completing the mandatory course of open-label ASA.  
2.  Balloon angioplasty or PCI with bare-metal stent :  In the event of coronary 
revascularization with balloon angioplasty alone or PCI with bare metal stent, 
blinded study drug may be temporarily interrupted for 2-4 weeks while patients 
receive open-label ASA at the discretion of the treating physician  in accordance 
with local practice and standard of care.  Blinded study drug may then be 
restarted at the discretion of the treating physician after completing th e 
mandatory course of open-label ASA. 
3. Clinically Significant Bleeding : Study-provided medications should be 
temporarily interrupted pending resolution of the acute bleeding episode and

Page 23 of 58 may
 be restarted at the discretion of the treating physician if deemed clinically 
safe and in accordance with local practice and standard of care. 
   
4. Details surrounding the date, duration and reason for each episode of temporary 
interruption should be entered in the appropriate section of the EDC. 
Study-provided medications (open-label ticagrelor or blinded study drug) may 
require permanent discontinuation  for the following reasons: 
1. Patient decision: The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, 
without prejudice to further treatment. 
2. Investigator’s decision: 
a. Incorrectly enrolled patient in whom the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
violation would put the patient at undue risk 
b. Adverse Events felt to be related to either study medication for which 
Investigator feels continued treatment would put the patient at undue 
risk, such as severe or life-threatening bleeding, myocardial infarction, 
stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke or coronary revascularization with a 
DES. 
3. Renal failure requiring dialysis 
4. Chronic oral anticoagulation 
5. Details surrounding the date, duration and reason for permanent discontinuation 
of study medication should be entered in the appropriate section of the EDC. 
6. In the event of permanent discontinuation of either study medication, further 
antiplatelet therapy is at the discretion of and is to be provided by the patient’s 
treating physician. Any remaining study-provided medication should be 
re
turned to the local site at the next scheduled follow-up visit.  Although these 
patients will no longer receive study-related medication, follow-up will continue 
in all randomized patients until end of study 
5.9 Withdrawal from study 
Each enrolled subject shall remain in the trial until completion of the required follow-up 
period. However, a subject’s participation in any clinical trial is voluntary and the subject has 
the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. Conceivable reasons for 
discontinuation may include, but not be limited to, the following:  
• Subject voluntary withdrawal  
• Subject withdrawal by physician as clinically indicated  
• Subject lost-to follow-up

Page 24 of 58 The r
eason for subject discontinuation must be documented in the eCRF and source 
documents. The individual site Principal Investigators must also report all subject 
discontinuations to their IRB/EC as defined by their institution’s procedure. 
All data from evaluations and treatments performed prior to the withdrawal should be documented 
in the eCRFs. Source documents that pre-date the withdrawal should be submitted as required by 
the protocol. No data that post-dates the withdrawal will be collected. 
Once a subject has withdrawn from the trial, no further follow-up contact will be performed. 
However, vital status may be obtained from public records. Medical therapy after stopping the 
study will be as prescribed by the subject’s physician.    
6. COLLECTION OF STUDY VARIABLES 
6.1 Recording of data 
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining complete and accurate documentation of the 
trial including but not limited to medical records, trial progress records, laboratory results, 
electronic case report forms, signed informed consent forms, investigational product 
accountability records, correspondence with the IRB or EC as well as trial monitors and 
sponsor, adverse event reports, and information regarding subject discontinuations.  
The Investigator is required to maintain information in the subject’s medical records which 
documents and corroborates data entered in the case report forms. As a minimum the subject 
record should contain:  
• Medical history/physical exam documenting that subject meets inclusion/exclusion 
criteria  
• Documentation of subject’s consent and subject ID number in the trial  
• Dated and signed notes from each subject visit  
• Adverse events reported and their resolution or lack thereof including supporting 
documents such as hospital records, discharge summaries, catheterization reports, 
ECGs, etc.  
• Record of protocol required medications during the trial  
• Record of the subject’s condition upon completion of or withdrawal from the trial  
6.2 Data collection at enrollment and follow- up 
Data collection commences after the subject has provided informed consent and has been 
enrolled in the study. Data collection, including subject demographic information, laboratory 
tests, and pr
ocedural data as well as follow-up visits or telephone contacts will be conducted

 an Investigator or site coordinator who has been trained on the protocol and electronic Case 
Report Forms (e CRFs).  
Data required for analysis will be obtained as outlined in Table 1. After discharge from the 
hospital, each enrolled subject will be followed with a phone call at 1 month post enrollment 
and a
n in-clinic visit at 3 months post enrollment. Enrolled subjects who do not meet 
eli
gibility for randomization prior to the in-person 3-month visit will not be required to 
complete the 3-month in-person visit. Subjects who are randomized at 3 months post 
enrollment will be followed with a phone call at 4 months post enrollment and will return for 
additional in-clinic visits at 9 and 15 months post enrollment. A final follow-up phone call 
will be
 performed at 18 months post enrollment for randomized subjects. No further follow-up 
contact will be performed for subjects who did not meet eligibility for randomization at the 3 
month visit; however,  vital status may be obtained from medical or public records at 18 months 
post enrollment. A flow chart listing the planned visits and their timing can be found in 
appendix C).

staff involved
 in the study is familiar with the content of this section. 
7.1 Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration 
of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the

l results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs. 
7.2 Definitions of serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, 
wash
-out, follow-up), that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death 
• Is immediately life-threatening 
• Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The severity and causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatments and/or 
procedures) will be assessed by the investigator(s) and communicated to the ARC. 
7.2.1 Definition of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) 
A SUSAR is a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction. To qualify as a SUSAR, the 
event must be: 
 Serious 
 Undesirable reaction to medicinal product 
 Unexpected - NOT listed as a potential risk or reaction to the product as outlined in the 
protocol, informed consent document or literature. 
7.3 Recording of adverse events or serious adverse events 
7.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events 
All AEs related to bleeding and SAEs should be collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed c
onsent through study exit.

ollow-up of unresolved adverse events 
For ALL SAEs the subject’s course must be monitored until the event has subsided or, in a 
case of permanent impairment, until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has 
been ascertained.  
7.3.3 Information to be collected for each AE/SAE 
• Description of AE /SAE  
• The dates when the AE/SAE started and stopped 
• Whether the AE/SAE is serious or not 
• Investigator causality rating against the investigational product 
• Action taken with regard to investigational product 
• Whether the AE/SAE caused subject’s withdrawal from study  
• Outcome 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Date the study site research personnel became aware of S AE 
• Date when decision was made for meeting S AE criteria 
• Criteria met leading to classification as SAE 
• Date of hospitalization (if applicable) 
• Date of discharge (if applicable) 
• Date of death (if applicable) 
• Probable cause of death (if applicable) 
• Autopsy performed (if applicable) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 7.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke 
that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be 
an SAE.

Page 31 of 58 7.3.4 Adver
se Events based on signs and symptoms 
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses (when possible) is preferred to recording a 
list of si
gns and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately. 
7.3.5 Adverse Events based on examinations and tests 
Deterioration as compared to baseline in laboratory values or vital signs should therefore only 
be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation 
of treatment with the investigational product. 
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or s
ymptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 
7.3.6 Disease progression or pre-existing conditions 
Disease
 progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. For 
example, continued angina should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  
Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition without serious deterioration in health, is not 
considered a serious adverse event.  
7.3.7 Reporting of adverse events  
AEs must be reported to the sponsor within 7 business days of the study site research 
personnel’s knowledge of the event via the EDC.  
SAEs must be reported to the sponsor immediately, but no later than 24 hours, of the study 
site research personnel’s knowledge of the event via the EDC. 
The ARC Safety Monitor will review all submitted SAEs for qualification as a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs). The ARC will further report SAEs 
determined to qualify as SUSARs to the local regulatory body (IRB/EC).  
The ARC Safety Monitor will voluntarily inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs form, 
a
nd EudraVigilance, of any serious adverse events which qualify as SUSARs in accordance 
with reporting
 requirements.

s important new information will be provided to the subject throughout the clinical 
investigation.  
After a review of the prospective subject’s medical records to determine general eligibility, 
the investigator or authorized designee who has been trained on the protocol, will approach 
the prospective subject to explain the purpose and scope of the clinical trial, prospective risks, 
and benefits of participation. The prospective subject must be given the opportunity to ask 
questions about the trial and must be given sufficient time to decide to participate in the trial 
or not. Additional information requested by the prospective subject should be provided. Any 
coercion or undue improper influence on the prospective subject is to be avoided.  
If the prospective subject agrees to participate, the informed consent form must be signed and 
personally dated by the prospective subject. The investigator or an authorized member of the 
research team who has witnessed the prospective subject’s signature must also sign and date 
the informed consent, prior to enrollment of the prospective subject. A copy of the completed 
informed consent form must be provided to the subject. Local IRB/EC regulations regarding 
obtaining informed consent must be followed. The subject’s medical record should have a 
notation regarding the signing of the informed consent.  
The subject is to be made aware that their participation in the trial is voluntary, their legal 
rights will not be waived, and that they may withdraw from the trial at any time, without 
giving specific reason for doing so. The subject must also be informed that withdrawal from 
the trial will not affect their future treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for the achievement of written consent from the prospective 
subject before they are included in the trial. All subjects must provide informed consent in 
accordance with the local IRB/EC requirements, using an IRB/EC-approved informed consent 
form. 
8.4 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form 
If the protocol or informed consent form (ICF) needs an amendment, the ARC is required to 
submit
 such amendment to the Regulatory Agencies and/or other regulating body in each 
participating country for approval. Approved protocol or ICF amendments will be provided to 
the Investigators by the ARC prior to implementing the amendment.  
For
 administrative changes, th e Principal Investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB/EC 
of the protocol or ICF amendment. For changes involving subject care or safety, the Principal 
Inv
estigator is responsible for obtaining IRB/EC approval of the protocol or ICF amendment 
according to the instructions provided by the ARC with the protocol or ICF amendment.  
Acknowledgement/approval by the IRB/EC of the protocol or ICF amendment must be 
documented in writing prior to implementation of the protocol or ICF amendment. Copies of

eviations from protocol 
8.5.1 Compliance to protocol 
No investigative procedures other than those defined in this clinical investigational plan will be 
undertaken on the enrolled subjects without the written agreement of the IRB/EC and ARC.  
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that there are no deviations from the clinical 
investigational plan and full compliance with all established procedures of the IRB/EC is 
maintained. The Investigator will not deviate from the clinical investigational plan for any 
reason except in cases of medical emergencies, when the deviation is necessary to protect the 
life or physical well-being of the subject. 
8.5.2 Procedures for recording, reporting, and analyzing protocol deviations  
A deviation is an instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the 
requirements of the protocol. All deviations must be reported to the ARC. The occurrence of 
clinical investigational plan deviations will be monitored by the ARC or designee. It is the 
Investigator's responsibility to inform their IRB/EC of clinical investigational plan deviations 
in accordance with their specific IRB/EC reporting policies and procedures.  
In the event that an investigative site does not comply with the Investigator Agreement or 
clinical investigational plan, the ARC will notify the Investigator of the site’s non-compliance. 
Conti
nued non-compliance may result in further escalation in accordance with the ARC’s 
standard procedures. 
8.5.3 Corrective and preventative actions and principal investigator disqualification 
criteria 
Protocol deviations and site/PI non-compliance will be closely monitored by the ARC and 
appointed study personnel. Identifying deviations and taking corrective actions at the earliest 
possible stage increases the potential for clinical trial success and reduces patient risk. The 
initiation of a corrective and preventative action (CAPA) to investigate and establish 
corrective actions may be required in some cases. The ARC reserves the right to close a 
cli
nical study site or replace a PI if non-compliance is observed.  
8.6 Audits and inspections 
In the event that an Investigator is contacted by a Regulatory Agency in relation to this trial, 
the Investigator will notify the ARC immediately. The Investigator and study site research 
personnel must be available to respond to reasonable requests and inspection queries made 
during the inspection process. The Investigator must provide the ARC with copies of all 
cor
respondence that may affect the review of this trial. The ARC will provide any needed 
assistance in response to regulatory inspections.

9.1.1 Training of Monitors 
The ARC ’s monitors or designee will be trained to the protocol, randomization instructions, 
electronic case report forms, and study drug usage. The ARC or designee is responsible for the 
traini
ng. Training will be conducted in accordance with the ARC’s and/or designee’s  standard 
procedures.  
9.1.2 Training of study site research personnel 
Participating investigators and study site research personnel will be trained during site 
initiation visits conducted by the Mount Sinai Clinical Coordinating Center or designee. 
All training must be documented and must include or reference the revision of materials used 
for training, who was trained, the trainer and date of training. Original training records should 
be maintained at the site in the Regulatory Binder and copies should be dispensed to Mount 
Sinai Clinical Coordinating Center. 
Site initiation/training involves a didactic session whereby the protocol, including screening 
procedures, clinical follow-up procedures, and study drug procedures are reviewed in detail 
along
 with investigator responsibilities. 
In addition, the Mount Sinai Clinical Coordinating Center will assure that all participating 
investigators and study personnel are trained in the following: 
 Protocol requirements, including patient screening requirements, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, procedural requirements and subject follow-up requirements 
 Study and personnel requirements 
 Informed consent requirements 
 Adverse event reporting 
 Drug accountability procedures 
 Electronic CRF completion 
 Regulatory binder maintenance. 
9.2 Monitoring of the study 
The ARC and/or designee will monitor the trial over its duration according to the pre-
specified 
monitoring plan. The trial monitor will contact each site at appropriate intervals to 
review investigational data for accuracy and completeness and ensure compliance with the

nical investigation plan. The trial monitor may request all documents and required records 
that are maintained by the Investigator/Site, including medical records (office, clinic, or 
hospital) for the subjects in this trial. Source documentation must be available to substantiate 
proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting 
and follow-up of adverse events, accuracy of data collected on case report forms, and study 
drug information. The Investigator and/or study site research personnel will be available for 
monitoring
 contact. If a site visit is required, it is expected that the Investigator/Site will 
provide the trial monitor with a suitable working environment for review of study-related 
documents. 
9.2.1 Source data 
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining complete and accurate documentation of the 
trial including but not limited to medical records, trial progress records, laboratory results, 
case report forms, signed informed consent forms, study drug accountability records, 
correspondence with the IRB/EC, the trial monitors, and the ARC, as well as adverse event 
reports and information regarding subject discontinuations.  
The Investigator is required to maintain information in the subject’s medical records which 
documents and corroborates data entered in the case report forms. As a minimum the subject 
record should contain:  
• Medical history/physical exam documenting that subject meets inclusion/exclusion 
criteria  
• Documentation of subject’s consent and subject ID number in the trial  
• Dated and signed notes from each subject visit  
 Adverse events reported and their resolution or lack thereof including supporting 
documents such as hospital records, discharge summaries, catheterization reports, and 
ECGs.  
• Record of protocol required medications during the trial  
• Record of the subject’s condition upon completion of or withdrawal from the trial  
The Investigator and the associated institution will permit direct access to source 
data/documents for study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and regulatory 
inspections.  
Subjects providing informed consent agree to allow the ARC or designee access and copying 
rights to pertinent information in their medical records concerning their participation in this 
trial. The Investigator will obtain, as part of the informed consent, permission for trial 
monitors or regulatory authorities to review, in confidence, any records identifying the

9.3 Study
 timetable and end of study 
The trial is estimated to commence February 1st, 2015. The last subject follow-up at 18 
months post-procedure is expected to occur in February 2018. The total expected duration 
of
 the trial is 36 months. 
10. DATA MANAGEMENT 
A computerized data entry and management system will be developed during the initial 
project months by an independent academic research center. A closed and password protected 
data entry system has been designed to ensure that only the responsible data entry person and 
the Data Management site supervisor can enter and/or edit data and this can be done only by 
using the programs and/or utilities available on the menu system. An audit trail will be created 
by date/time and user stamping. Range checks, review screens, and various error trapping 
routines ar
e built into the system as quality control procedures. All possible relevant 
information on the forms is pre-coded. Specific instructions and explanation of choices will be 
provided for all data forms.  
The statistical programmer will perform additional data checks, data cleaning, and variable 
coding to create analysis datasets using SAS. The programmer will also create a reporting 
system that generates study specific tables, listings, and figures, which will be run periodically 
to monitor study and data entry. As a final check on data integrity, the Director of Clinical 
Biometrics and study biostatistician will check these outputs against the raw data in order to 
resolve any discrepancies. The Biometrics lead, statistician, and statistical programmer will be 
responsible for working with the project staff to ensure the integrity of the data entry process.

12. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION 
The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.0 or greater and Stata versions 
12.0 or greater. 
12.1 Description of analysis sets 
The Enrolled Population consists of all subjects who signed informed consent. 
The intention- to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who have been randomized 
(i.e. when the subject number and allocated treatment are recorded in the EDC).  Subjects will 
be analyzed in the treatment group assigned by the EDC.

Page 39 of 58 The pe
r-protocol population (PP) will consist of all randomized subjects without any major 
deviations
 from the protocol.  The following deviations will lead to exclusion from the PP 
population 
• Subjects not receiving the assigned treatment as allocated by the EDC or no treatment 
at all
 
• Non-compliance to study drug (aspirin or placebo) or ticagrelor.  Non-compliance is 
defined as taking less than 80% of dispensed tablets based on manual pill bottle count 
at each study visit. 
12.1.1 E
fficacy analysis set 
All analyses for the primary bleeding endpoint will be performed on the ITT and PP 
population.  The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population.  This analysis will 
be repeated in the PP population to support the primary results. 
The primary bleeding endpoint is the composite of BARC Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding. 
12.1.2 S
afety analysis set 
Analyses for the primary ischemic endpoint will be performed on the PP cohort.  A secondary 
ana
lysis for the primary ischemic endpoint will be performed in the ITT cohort. 
12.2 Methods of statistical analyses 
Unless otherwise stated, all hypothesis tests will be performed using two-sided tests at the 5% 
significance level.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including means and standard deviations if normally distributed or median with interquartile 
ranges for skewed distributions.  Discrete variables will be summarized using absolute and 
relative frequencies. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by randomized treatment group 
and for all randomized subjects combined.  Baseline characteristics that will define subgroups 
of interest for the efficacy and safety analyses are: 
• Age group (< 65, >= 65 years) 
• Race (Caucasian, non-Caucasian) 
• Gender (Male, Female) 
• Geographic Region (US, non-US) 
• Diabetes Mellitus (yes, no) 
• Chronic Kidney Disease (yes, no)

• Stent length implanted (< 30 mm, >=30 mm) 
• BMI (above median, below median) 
• History of Prior MI (yes, no) 
• Multivessel disease (yes, no) 
Censoring:   Subjects not experiencing any endpoint will be censored at time of death, last 
contact date (for subjects who withdraw consent or are lost to follow-up) or 365 days after 
randomization, whichever comes first. 
Analysis for the Primary Bleeding Endpoint:   This analysis will be performed on the ITT 
population.  The primary objective is to determine if ticagrelor monotherapy is superior to 
ticagrelor plus aspirin for the primary efficacy endpoint (BARC Types 2, 3 or 5 bleeding).  
The null hypothesis for this analysis is that the HR for the experimental group (H 0) = 1.  The 
alternative hypothesis is that the HR for the experimental group (H A) ≠ 1.  A test of superiority 
at the two-sided 0.05 level will be performed using a Cox proportional hazard model that 
includes treatment group as a covariate.  A point estimate and two-sided 95% CI for the 
relative risk as measured by the hazard ratio will be calculated based on the Cox proportional 
hazards model.  Event rates will be estimated at one year and Kaplan-Meier curves will be 
plotted f
or the time from randomization to the first occurrence of confirmed BARC Type 2, 3 
or 5 bleeding by treatment group.  This analysis will be repeated in the PP cohort to support 
the prim
ary results. 
Analysis for the Primary Ischemic Endpoint: The analysis for the primary ischemic endpoint 
will be performed on the PP cohort.  The primary objective is to determine if ticagrelor 
monotherapy is non-inferior to ticagrelor plus aspirin for the primary safety endpoint (all-
cause death, non- fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke).  .  A test of non-inferiority at the one-
sided 0.025 level will be performed. Event rates will be estimated at one year and Kaplan-
Meier curves will be plotted for the time from randomization to the first occurrence o f 
confirmed all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke or by treatment group.  
Assuming an event rate of 8.0% in the control group, a sample size of 8200 will yield 80% to 
exclude a non-inferiority margin of 1.6%.  If the upper limit of the 95% CI for the point 
esti
mate of the absolute risk difference is less than or equal to 1.6% then the criteria for non-
inferiority will be met.  This non-inferiority margin translates to a relative risk of 20% 
assuming the observed event rate equals 8.0% in the control arm. 
Subgroup Analysis One year event rates for the primary efficacy and safety endpoints will be 
calculated in all subgroups described in section 12.2.  Stratum-specific HRs and 
corresponding 95% CI will be calculated for each subgroup using a Cox proportional hazards

Page 41 of 58 model.  For
mal interaction testing will be performed using the subgroup X treatment 
allocation as an additional term in the Cox model. 
12.3 Determination of sample size 
Power calculations are based on a superiority comparison for the primary efficacy endpoint of 
clinically relevant bleeding (BARC Types 2, 3 or 5) at 1 year from randomization (15 months 
after enrollment).  Based on bleeding rates as shown in Table 3, a cumulative bleeding rate of 
4.5% is anticipated between time of randomization and 1 year. This estimate is more 
c
onservative than rates shown in Table 3 as subjects sustaining a major hemorrhagic event in 
the f
irst 3 months after PCI will not be randomized.  Assuming a 2% loss to follow-up and 
non-compliance / cro ss-over rate of 4%, the current trial will require 8200 subjects to detect a

lative reduction in bleeding of 28% with ticagrelor monotherapy with 80% power with a 
Type I error of 0.05.  It is anticipated that approximately 8% - 10% of enrolled subjects w ill 
not be eligible for randomization and therefore 9000 subjects will be enrolled.  Additional 
sample size estimates are provided in Table 4 assuming different control bleeding rates and 
risk reductions. References for the sample size estimates include Lakatos 1988, Biometrics 
volume 44 pages 229-241; and Lakatos 2002, Statistics in Medicine, Volume 21 pages 1969-
1989.   
Assuming a 1 year ischemic adverse event rate of 8% the current study will have 80% power 
to exclude a non-inferiority margin of 1.6% (upper limit of 95% CI for absolute risk 
diffe
rence).

Page 43 of 58 the principa
l investigator of the trial. Members of the Board will be determined prior to study 
enrollment. 
The DSMB will review data and determine reporting and stopping rules as specified in the 
DSMB charter. The DSMB members will review safety data while maintaining the scientific 
integrity of the trial. The data to be reviewed will consist of adjudicated and non-adjudicated 
MACE, Bleeding, and other Serious Adverse Events and their incidence, in order to identify 
potential safety issues. Based on the safety data, the DSMB may recommend modifications to 
the protocol, suspension or termination of the trial, and advise the Executive Committee. 
Members of the DSMB will meet or conference with steering group members before the trial 
starts to review the protocol, to determine the meeting schedule, the logistics of reporting the 
safety data and the stopping rules. Frequency of meetings can change during the study and 
will be determined by the DSMB and its charter. 
All adverse events will be reported to the DSMB and reviewed on an on-going basis 
throughout the subject enrollment and follow-up period as specified in the DSMB charter to 
ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in this trial. The DSMB may request additional 
information as needed. Based on safety data, the DSMB may recommend that the Executive 
Committee modify or discontinue the trial. All final decisions, regarding trial modifications, 
however, rest with the Executive Committee.

PORTANT MEDICAL PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED 
BY THE INVESTIGATOR 
13.1 Overdose  
If an overdose on the study drug occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other 
site personnel inform appropriate the ARC within  one day, i.e., immediately but no later than 
the end of the next business day  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The ARC will work with the  investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to 
the ARC. 
13.2 Pregnancy 
Due to the study enrollment criteria and proposed population, women of child bearing 
potential (as defined in Section 4.2) are excluded from participation in this study. In the 
unlikely event that pregnancy should occur during the course of the study, all outcomes of 
pre
gnancy should be reported to the ARC.

Clinically relevant bleeding is defined as any bleeding event that meets the BARC criteria types 
2, 3 or 5.  
Tab
le 4 BARC Bleeding Definition, modified from Mehran et al ( 26) 
Type Definition  
0 No evidence of bleeding.  
1 Bleeding that is not actionable and patient does not have unscheduled studies, 
hospitalization or treatment by a health care professional  
2 Any clinically overt sign of hemorrhage that is actionable but does not meet criteria for 
type 3, 4 or 5 bleeding.  It must meet at least one of the following criteria:  
 requiring medical or percutaneous intervention guided by a health care 
profession, includes  (but are not limited to) temporary/permanent cessation of a 
medication, coiling, compression, local injection  
 leading to hospitalization or an increased level of care  
 prompting evaluation defined as an unscheduled visit to a healthcare professional 
resulting in diagnostic testing (laboratory or imaging)  
3 Clinical, laboratory and/or imaging evidence of bleeding with specific healthcare 
provider responses, as listed below : 
3a  Any transfusion with overt bleeding  
 Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin (Hb) drop ≥3 to <5g/dL* (provided Hb drop is 
related to bleeding)  
3b  Overt bleeding plus Hb drop ≥5g/dL* (Hb drop is related to bleed)  
 Cardiac tamponade  
 Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding 
dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid)  
 Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive drugs  
3c  Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or hemorrhagic 
transformation; does include intraspinal). Subcategories: confirmed by autopsy, 
imaging or lumbar puncture  
                                                 
* Hemoglobin drop should be corrected for for intracurrent transfusion in which 1 unit of packed red blood cells or 
whole blood should be expected to increase hemoglobin by 1g/dL.

 Perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 hours  
 Reoperation following closure of sternotomy for the purpose of controlling 
bleeding 
 Transfusion of ≥5 units of whole blood or packed red blood cells within a 48 hour 
period 
 Chest tube ou tput ≥2L within a 24 hour period  
5 Fatal Bleeding. Bleeding directly causes death with no other explainable cause. 
Categorized further as either definite or probable.  
5a Probable fatal bleeding is bleeding that is clinically suspicious as the cause of death, but 
the bleeding is not directly observed and there is no a utopsy or confirmatory imaging.  
5b Definite fatal bleeding is bleeding that is directly observed (either by clinical specimen – 
blood, emesis, stool, etc . – or by imaging) or confirmed on a utopsy.

Major  Any intracranial bleeding (excluding microhemorrhages <10 mm evident only 
on gradient -echo MRI)  
 Clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of ≥5 
g/dL or a ≥15% absolute decrease in haematocrit  
 Fatal bleeding (bleeding that di rectly results in death within 7 days)  
Life threatening  bleeding is a TIMI major bleeding event that meets any of the 
following criteria:  
 Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage  
 Fatal bleeding  
 Leads to hypotension requiring inotropic agents  
 Requires surgical intervention for ongoing bleeding

the individual components of MACE are given below. 
15.2.1 Death 
All-cause death comprises several subclassifications ( Table 7). In general, all deaths are 
considered cardiac unless an alternate cause is unequivocally established, even among subject s 
with serious noncardiac comorbidities.  
Table 7 Classification of Death( 29) 
Cardiac death Any death due to proximate cardiac cause (eg, MI, low -output 
failure, fatal arrhythmia), unwitnessed death and death of 
unknown cause, all procedure -related deaths including those 
related to concomitant treatment, will be classified as cardiac 
death. 
 
Vascular death  Death caused by noncoronary vascular causes, such as 
cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic 
aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm or other causes.  
 
Noncardiovascular death  Any death not covered by the above definitions, such as death 
caused by infection, malignancy, sepsis, pulmonary causes, 
accident, suicide or trauma.  
 
 
15.2.2 Myocardial Infarction 
Myocardial infarction is defined according to the third universal definition( 30) and includes: 
 Type 1: spontaneous MI 
 Type 2: MI secondary to an ischemic imbalance 
 Type 3: MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable 
 Type 4a. MI related to PCI 
 Type 4b: MI related to stent thrombosis

Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis of MI: 
 Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (preferably cardiac troponin) 
with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL and with at least one of the 
following: 
o Symptoms of ischem ia 
o (Presumed) new significant ST-T wave changes or new LBBB 
o Development of pathological Q waves  
o Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion 
abnormality 
o Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy 
 Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of MI and presumed new ischemic ECG 
changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or 
before cardiac biomarker values would be increased 
 PCI related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarkers  
o (>5 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values or 
o > 20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling 
In addition, one of the following is required 
o symptoms suggestive of ischemia  
o new ischemic ECG changes  
o angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication OR 
o imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall 
motion abnormality  
 Stent thrombosis associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy 
in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker 
values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL 
 CABG related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarkers >10 x 99th 
percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values, AND one of the following:

abnormality 
15.2.3 Stroke  
Stroke is defined as an acute symptomatic episode of neurological dysfunction, more than 24 
hours in duration in the absence of therapeutic intervention or death, due to cerebral, spinal or 
retinal tissue injury as evidenced by neuroimaging or lumbar puncture. It includes the following 
subclassifications: 
 Ischemic stroke: infarction due to prolonged ischemia. Causes include (but are not 
limited to) arterial and venous thrombosis, embolism, and systemic hypoperfusion. 
 Hemorrhagic stroke: caused by a non-traumatic intraperenchymal, intraventricular or 
subarachnoid hemorrhage 
 Undetermined: stroke with insufficient information to determine ischemic or hemorrhagic 
cause 
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction (< 24 hours) 
caused by temporary cerebral, spinal or retinal ischemia with no evidence of acute infarction on 
neuroimaging. 
15.2.4 Stent thrombosis 
Stent thrombosis is classified according to the level of certainty and timing following PCI( 29) 
(Table 8). 
 Definite stent thrombosis: is highly specific and requires angiographic or pathological 
confirmation of stent thrombosis in or within 5 mm of the stent in the setting of at least 
one of the following criteria with a 48-hour time window 
o Acute ischemic symptoms at rest 
o New ischemic ECG changes 
o Typical rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers 
 Probable stent thrombosis includes 
o Any unexplained death within the first 30 days following PCI

ge 55 of 58 o Any MI at any time following PCI that is related to documented acute ischemia in 
the territory of the implanted stent, in the absence of angiographic/pathological 
confirmation of stent thrombosis and no other obvious cause 
 Possible stent thrombosis 
o Any unexplained death after the first 30 days following PCI until the end of trial 
follow-up  
Table 8 Timing of Stent Thrombosis 
Acute 0-24 hours following PCI  
Subacute >24 hours to 30 days following PCI  
Late >30 days to 1 year following PCI  
Very late >1 year following PCI  
 
15.2.5 Clinically driven revascularization 
Clinically driven revascularization includes repeat PCI or CABG for recurrent or persistent 
symptomatic ischemia and can be defined according to the relationship to the index PCI (target 
lesion)(29): 
 Target lesion revascularization, at the previously stented segment  
 Non-target lesion, target vessel revascularization, of the previously treated vessel or its side 
branches AND 
 Non-target vessel lesion revascularization, of a vessel other than the previously treated vessel

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) 
Multivessel (CAD), defined as significant disease in at least 2 major epicardial vessels or 
significant left main disease plus one major epicardial vessel.  Significant coronary artery disease 
is defined as angiographic stenosis of at least 70% in a major epicardial vessel or at least 50% in 
the left main trunk.  For intermediate stenosis in major epicardial vessels (50%-70%), an 
invasive hemodynamic assessment using fractional flow reserve (FFR) with values less than or 
equal to 0.8 will be considered significant.  For intermediate left main lesions, a minimal lumen 
area by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) less than 6.0 mm2 will be considered significant. 
Successful PCI 
PCI is considered successful for lesions treated with stent implantation if the residual diameter 
stenosis based on visual estimation is less than or equal to 10% and the final TIMI flow grade is 
3.  PCI is considered successful for lesions treated without stent implantation if the residual 
diameter stenosis based on visual estimation is less than or equal to 30% and the final TIMI flow 
grade is 3.

• This is a feasibility study so power and sample size 
calculations are not appropriate. Classically feasibility 
studies use a sample size of approximately 12 subjects 
per group (Julious, 2005).  The primary outcome will be 
descriptive, and presented as number of patients/parents 
approached: number of patients/parents enrolling in the 
study . 
• Secondary outcomes for safety and efficacy comparison 
will be presented primarily in a descriptive way between 
2 groups, including incidence of complications, NRS pain 
scores measured at multiple time points, time to 1st 
opioid use, incidence of opioid related side effects, and 
patient satisfaction. Continuou s outcome will be 
presented as mean +/ - standard deviation (opioid 
consumption, time to first opioid, NRS scores, 
patient/parent satisfaction). If results are skewed, data 
will be presented as medians (1st and 3rd quartiles). 
Normality of distribution will  be determined via Shapiro -
Wilk testing, where significance of >0.05 indicates 
normally distributed data. Categorical variables 
(incidence of complications, incidence of opioid related 
side effects) will be presented as counts and 
percentages. The balance of baseline patient 
characteristics will be compared between 2 groups using 
standardized difference.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
 Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common type of scoliosis (70% of all cases) with a 
prevalence of curves greater than 30 degrees to be approximately 0.2% to 0.3%. Surgical 
correction for idiopathic scoliosis is often indicated when the spine curvature is g reater than 
45-50 degrees as measured by Cobb's method or if there is coexisting cardiopulmonary 
compromise. Curves necessitating surgical correction are particularly skewed toward 
females with a ratio of approximately 10:1.  
 Inherent to surgical correcti on is a significant amount of morbidity to pediatric 
patients including postoperative acute pain. Practitioners have utilized a number of 
analgesic techniques to treat acute postoperative pain including intravenous patient 
controlled analgesia (PCA), intra thecal opioids, epidural catheters, wound catheters, and 
multimodal analgesia. However, many of these techniques have either limited evidence, 
inconclusive results regarding their efficacy, or barriers to use (such as changes in 
neurological function) that  limit their utilization postoperatively. Nevertheless, any technique 
that utilizes opioids subjects an already at risk patient (young, low BMI, females) population 
for further nausea/vomiting, which could delay recovery, prolong hospitalizations, and 
decrease patient/parent satisfaction. To date, there only exists a single case report using 
ESPB for PSF in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the patients in this report were 21 and 22 
years old. Other reports of this technique in pediatrics have been limited t o surgeries of the 
abdomen and thorax. Given the overall absence of evidence to support ESPB for pediatric 
spine surgery, this study is proposed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of bilateral 
ESPB on postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and pati ent satisfaction within a 
comprehensive enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) for complex spine surgery.

 The ESPB was first described as a regional anesthetic technique in 2016 (Foreo) as 
a mo dality to block both the ventral and dorsal rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. Since its 
initial account, there have been hundreds of case reports (Almeida 2019; Chin 2019), many 
case series (Melvin 2018; Singh 2018) and, some retrospective cohort studies  (Ueshima 
2019) in adult regional anesthesia that have highlighted its application to spine surgery. 
Each concludes a significant opioid -sparing capacity and improved NRS pain scores in 
patients who receive ESPB for a variety of spine surgery procedures.  
 Within pediatric anesthesia, there have been significantly fewer reports using the 
ESPB for postoperative analgesia. Most reports suggest the utility of the ESPB for analgesia

of the anterior spinal rami in cardiac, thoracic, and abdominal surgery (Wong 2 018, Patel 
2019, Hernandez 2018,) There exists only one recent case report of bilateral ESPB in two 
patients undergoing PSF for idiopathic scoliosis as a multimodal analgesic strategy for these 
patients. Given only this single case report, there is a deart h of evidence for utilization of this 
regional anesthetic technique in this patient population. Furthermore, this case is limited in 
suggesting the feasibility and efficacy of the technique given it was only reported on two 
patients.

2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
 The feasibility and efficacy of utilizing preoperative erector spinae plane blocks 
(ESPB) to decrease opioid needs/consumption and to decrease numeric rating scale (NRS) 
pain scores in pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis 
(AIS).  
 
1. What is the feasibility of performing bilateral US -guided ESPBs in this patient populatio n?  
2. What is the rate of recruitment to perform ESPB in this patient population?  
3. What is the rate of adherence to perform the ESPB in this patient population (i.e., number 
who receive the intervention and complete all assessments/ number who enroll)?   
4. Can patients be successfully randomized under the proposed study design?  
5. Can patients be successfully blinded to group allocation under the proposed study 
design?  
6. Are there factors that limit placing ESPBs after induction of anesthesia/prior t o surgical 
incision (including time to perform block, time to secure IV access and place arterial line(s), 
surgeon/anesthesiologist preference, and patient -related factors. These include OR work -
flow and timing issues, surgeon request to forego ESPB due to  OR delay, and the 
anesthesiologist's assessment of the ultrasound features that may preclude ESPB 
placement)?  
7. What is the incidence of complications for the ESPB in this patient population?  
8. What is the opioid requirement (in morphine equivalents) in the first 24 hours after surgery 
in patients who received ESPB compared to those who did not?  
9. What is the pain burden (in NRS, 0 -10) in the first 24 hours after surgery in patients who 
received ESPB compared to those who did not?  
By completing this study, we hope to assess the feasibility of performing this block for this 
particular operation in this patient population. To date, there are a limited number of 
applications of regional anesthes ia for pediatric spinal fusion in a comprehensive ERP. 
Further, the optimal block composition is unknown, and the study will help to define this.  
Utilization of this technique may demonstrate an opioid sparing effect, which may have 
multiple benefits incl uding a decrease in opioid -related side effects and increased patient 
satisfaction. If beneficial, the ESPB may become part of routine care for complex spine 
surgery in this patient population.

blinding to  group allocation (based on Bang's Blinding Index, measured at 
24 hours after  surgery)  
o 3. Feasibility outcome: type and incidence factors preventing performance 
of block  (patient, su rgical, anesthetic, and/or work flow related barriers), 
assessed in realtime.  
o 4. Feasibility outcome: attrition (number of patients who enroll, but do not 
receive  the intervention and/or study assessments, and the reasons), 
measured and  reported in real time.  
o 5. Incidence of intra - and postoperative complications attributed to ESPB  
(interference with intraoperative neuromonitoring, infection, local 
anesthetic toxicity,  bleeding/hematoma, extremity weakness)  
o 6. NRS pain scores (after recovery from anesthes ia in PACU; and 8, 12, 
and 24  hours post -surgery, and at discharge).  
o 7. Total opioid consumption as measured in oral morphine equivalents 
(OME)  (over the first 24 hours post -surgery).  
o 8. Time to first opioid use (oral, or via IV PCA).  
o 9. Incidence of opioi d-related side effects (measured via the ORSDS in 
the first 24  hours post -surgery).  
o 10. Patient/parent satisfaction with pain management (at hospital 
discharge, via  Likert scale rating from 0 -10, where 10 is the highest 
satisfaction)

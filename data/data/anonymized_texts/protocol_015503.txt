Tempe, Arizona 85281 USA 
Objectives:  The objective of this study is to assess  the safety and effectiveness of the   
VENOVO ™ Venous Stent  for the treatment of symptomatic iliofemoral  
venous outflow obstruction.  This would include  Acute or Chronic  Deep 
Vein Th rombosis ( DVT ), May -Thurner Syndrome, or any combination of 
the above . 
Design:  This is a prospective, multi -center, non -randomized, single -arm clinical 
study  of the VENOVO ™ Venous Stent  for the treatment of symptomatic 
iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction.    Safety and effectiveness 
measure s of subjects receiving  the VENOVO ™ Venous Stent  will be 
compared  to a Performance Goal ( PG) derived from published literature .   
 
The study will be conducted at a maximum of  35 investigational sites 
(“sites”) in the Unit ed States, and Europe  and Australia/New Zealand .   
 
Clinical follow -up for all treated subjects will be performed at hospital 
discharge, 30 -days, and 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36 -months post -index procedure.   
Devices:  The VENOVO ™ Venous Stent  is comprised of a self -expanding nitinol 
(nickel -titanium ) alloy . The diameter of the flared ends is approximately

VERNACULAR  (BPV -14-007) Version 2.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.   
1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
1.1. Analysis Populations  
Several populations of patients enrolled into the trial need to be defined.  
 
The intent -to-treat ( ITT) population consists of those subjects who have signed the Informed Consent 
Form  and had the VENOVO™ Venous Stent catheter intro duced (i.e. , delivery system enters the 
subject’s body).  
 
Subjects who do not receive the study implant (section 5.2.2), but in whom the VENOVO™ Venous 
Stent  catheter was introduced will be included in the ITT population.  Subjects who need more than 
two ( 2) VENOVO™ Venous Stent s (section 5.2. 3) or undergo other treatment modalities (section 5.2. 4) 
will be included in the ITT population.    
A per -protocol (PP) population may be created if there are subjects who have any major protocol 
deviations . Major Protocol Deviations are defined as those that occur to protect the life or physical 
well-being of a subject in an emergency, or those that may affect the scientif ic soundness of the study, 
or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.  The PP population will consist of any subjects in the 
ITT population who receive at least one stent and do not have any major protocol deviations , including 
deviations of study  eligibility criteria .    Subjects who need more than two (2)  VENOVO™ Venous 
Stent s, require placement of a commercially -available stent (section 5.2.3), or undergo other treatment 
modalities (section 5.2.4) will be excluded from the PP population.   
All e ffectiveness and safety analyses including the primary analysis will be primarily based on the 
ITT population. A PP analysis may also be performed for the primary endpoint. It will only serve as a 
sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis which is base d on the ITT population.  
 
1.2.     Primary Endpoint s: Primary Study Hypotheses  
For this study, the primary efficacy and primary safety endpoint will be considered as c o-primary  
endpoints. That is, both primary efficacy and safety endpoint need to be significant to claim the study 
as successful.  
 
1.2.1.   Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The Primary Efficacy endpoint is  the primary patency  of the VENOVO™ Venous Stent (BVS) at 12 
months post index procedure, which need to be  better  than the Performance Goal (PG) (74%) developed 
from  the patency of other marketed stents at 12 months  (see section 6.4 sample size consideration for 
the derivation of the  PG).  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated by the following hypothesis : 
H0:  The primary patency rate  at 12 months post index procedure from the overall  VENOVO™ 
Venous Stent (BVS) patients (PTS and NIVL combined) is at most as good as that of the PG;  
Ha:  The primary patency rate at 12 months post index procedure from the overall  VENOVO™ 
Venous Stent (BVS) patients (PTS and NIVL combined) is better than that of the PG;  
 
H0: 0.45×𝜋𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿+0.55×𝜋𝑃𝑇𝑆≤𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐺 v.s H a: 0.45×𝜋𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿+0.55×𝜋𝑃𝑇𝑆>𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐺

BARD® VENOUS  Stent  
VERNACULAR  (BPV -14-007) Version 2.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.   
Where 𝜋𝑃𝑇𝑆is the true primary patency rate at 12 -month post index procedure for PTS patients, 𝜋𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿 
is the true primary patency rate at 12 -month post index procedure for NIVL patients, and 
PPPG=74%.The test statistics can be formulated as:  
 
𝑍=0.45×𝑝𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿+0.55×𝑝𝑃𝑇𝑆−0.74
√(0.45)2×𝑃𝐺𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿(1−𝑃𝐺𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿)
𝑛𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿+(0.55)2×𝑃𝐺𝑃𝑇𝑆(1−𝑃𝐺𝑃𝑇𝑆)
𝑛𝑃𝑇𝑆 
 
Where 𝑝𝑃𝑇𝑆 and 𝑝𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿 are observed primary patency rate at 12 -month post -index procedure for PTS 
and NIVL patients, respectively. 𝑃𝐺𝑃𝑇𝑆 (=77% -10%=67%) and 𝑃𝐺𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿 (=93% -10%=83%) are 
expected value for PTS and NIVL patients under the null; 𝑛𝑃𝑇𝑆 and 𝑛𝑁𝐼𝑉𝐿 are the number of PTS and 
NIVL patients in the analysis. A one -sided p -value will be calculated using a normal distribution. The 
study device will be considered to have achieved the primary efficacy objective if the one -sided p -
value is less than 0.05.   
 
1.2.2.    Primary Safety Objective  
The primary safety endpoint of the study is freedom from major adverse events (MAEs) and freedom 
from TVR through 30 days post -index procedure, as adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee 
(CEC). The performance goal of free from primary safety event is 89%.   
The primary safety endpoint will be evaluated by the following hypothesis: H0:  The primary safety 
endpoint absence from event rate in the VENOVO™ Venous Stent (BVS) through 30 day at 
most as large as that of the PG;  
Ha:  The primary safety endpoint absence from event rate in the VENOVO™ Venous Stent (BVS) 
through 30 day is better than that of the PG;  
 
Ho:  M BVS < MPG Ha:  M BVS > M PG 
 
Where MPG=89% A one -sided p -value will be derived based on an exact binomial test. The study 
device will be considered to have achieved the primary safety objective if the one -sided p -value is 
less than 0.05.   
 
 
1.2.3. Handling of Missing Data  
Study endpoints may be missing due to withdrawal of consent, investigator’s decision to terminate, lost 
to follow -up and death. As long as the missing data is unrelated to the study intervention and the 
observed and unobserved data, limiting the analysis to those subjects who co ntribute endpoints 
produces unbiased estimates of the event rate s. 
 
 
The reason  for missing data in any subject will be reported.  If there is any indication that missing data 
is related to the study intervention, a worst -case analysis may be performed in addition to the standard 
analysis.  In a worst -case analysis, a failure of effectiveness or safety will be assumed to have occurred 
at the time the subject was censored.

VERNACULAR  (BPV -14-007) Version 2.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  In addition, regardless of whether missing data are related to the study intervention, a tipping -point 
analysis will be performed, in which assumptions about missing data are varied from worst -case to 
best-case to examine at what point the missing data would alter the results of the analysis.  
 
Multiple imputation will also be e xplored as another method to handle missing data.  
 
1.2.4. Assessment of Poolability of Sites  
The sites will be tested for potential differences in the primary endpoint.  Sites with fewer than 10 
treated subjects will be combined for this purpose. The pooli ng will be restricted within country.  The 
sites with less than 10 treated subjects will be sorted by site number within each country and pooled by 
order to form one or more combined site(s) with at least 10 treated subjects. A logistic regression 
analysis  will be performed with sites as a fixed effect. If the p -value associated with the sites effect is 
< 0.15, it will be considered as evidence of statistical significance.  
 
If there are any site effects, the sites that have similar and dissimilar results wi ll be grouped and 
exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate the potential reason for the differences among 
sites.  
 
An analysis will be performed to examine the potential difference in the primary endpoint between the 
two geographic regions (US vs. OUS).  A logistic regression model will be fit that includes fixed effect 
for geography.  If the p -value of the geography effect is <0.15, it will be considered evidence of a 
statistically significant difference between the geographic regions, and addi tional analyses will be 
performed to explore the differences between geographies to assess their potential causes and whether 
or not they are clinically meaningful.  
 
 
1.3.     Evaluation of Secondary Endpoints (with and without hypotheses)  
 
1.3.1. Control of Study -wise Type I Error  
The Secondary Endpoints will be evaluated and tested only if the Primary Safety and Effectiveness 
hypotheses pass (i.e., both Primary non -inferiority tests reject the null hypothesis).  Two of the 4 
secondary endpoints wi ll include a hypothesis test. They will be tested along with the inequality test of 
the Primary Efficacy Objective. The method of adjusting the α -level of the tests described below will 
be used to ensure that the study -wide error rate does not exceed 0.05.  
 
The Hochberg method for controlling multiple comparison will be used. Two p -values will be obtained 
for the two  Secondary Endpoints with hypothesis tests . If the larger p -value is less than 0.05, then both 
endpoints are considered statistical significant; otherwise, if the larger p -value is greater than 0.05, the 
smaller p -value need to be less than 0.025 to claim statistical significance for that endpoint  with smaller 
p-value.  
 
1.3.2. Analysis of the VCSS Pain Assessment  
The first Secondary Objective is to evaluate whether the VCSS Pain Assessment  of the BVS improves 
between the baseline classification and the follow -up classifications at 6, 12, 24, and 3 6 months.  The

BARD® VENOUS  Stent  
VERNACULAR  (BPV -14-007) Version 2.0  
Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  emphasis will be on the change between baseline and 12 months, since that is the time of the endpoint 
for the Primary Efficacy Objective.  The four classes of VCSS for pain have been discussed previously 
in this Investigational Plan. (The VC SS includes clinical signs and symptoms other than pain, but this 
objective focuses only on pain.)  
 
The objective is to demonstrate that the distribution of classifications improves from baseline to each 
follow -up time, especially at 12 months.  This requi res testing the null hypothesis (Ho) that the 
distribution at the 12 -month follow -up (D BVS@12M ) remains unchanged compared to baseline (D BVS@BL ) 
against the alternative hypothesis (Ha) that the distribution shifts toward lower (less pain) classes:  
Ho:  D BVS@12M > DBVS@BL  vs Ha:  D BVS@12M < DBVS@BL  
 
The endpoint for each study subject is the VCSS pain class at baseline and at each follow -up time (6, 
12, 24, and 36 months).  
 
 
Paired mean difference of the 12 -month follow -up and baseline pain score and 95% CI will be 
presented. If the mean difference < 0 and the two -sided p -value from the paired t -test is deemed 
significant based on the appropriate α -level as described above, this will indicate success for this 
endpoint.  
 
In addition, the VCSS pain class at each time point will be  summarized descriptively. . 
 
1.3.3. Analysis of the Quality of Life (CIVIQ -20 Assessment)  
The second Secondary Objective is to evaluate whether the QoL Assessment  of the BVS improves 
between the baseline classific ation and the follow -up classifications at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.  The 
emphasis will be on the change between baseline and 12 months, since that is the time of the endpoint 
for the Primary Efficacy Objective.  The QoL instrument will be the CIVIQ -20 and its use in the trial 
has been discussed previously in this Investigational Plan.  
 
The objective is to demonstrate that the mean improves from baseline to each follow -up time, especially 
at 12 months.  This requires testing the null hypothesis (Ho) that th e mean score at the 12 -month follow -
up (QoL BVS@12M ) remains unchanged compared to baseline (QoL BVS@BL ) against the alternative 
hypothesis (Ha) that the mean is lower (better):  
 
Ho:  QoL BVS@12M > QoL BVS@BL  vs Ha:  QoL BVS@12M < QoL BVS@BL  
 
The endpoint for each study subject is the CIVIQ -20 score at baseline and at each follow -up time (6, 
12, 24, and 36 months).  
 
The QoL hypothesis test:  
 
Ho:  QoL BVS@12M > DBVS@BL  vs Ha:  QoL BVS@12M < DBVS@BL  
 
will be tested using a paired t -test with the appropriate α -level as described above.

Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  In addition, descriptive statistics of total CIVIQ -20 score as well as score of each dimension at each 
time point will be presented by visit.  
1.3.4. Analysis of the CEA P Scores  
The third Secondary Objective is to assess the CEAP scores at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Each 
classification factors at each time points will be summarized descriptively . No hypotheses will be 
tested.  
 
1.3.5. Analysis of other Secondary Objective  
The following secondary endpoints are intended to be reported in the device’s labeling and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (sample size of reported values, means or proportions, standard 
deviations, and 95% confidence in tervals). The details of the definition of the secondary endpoints are 
described in Section 3.2.  
 
− Acute Proc edure Success  
− Lesion Success  
− Acute Technical Success  
− Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)  
− Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)  
− Patency at 24 and  36 months  
− X-ray analysis for fracture at 12 , 24, and 36  months  
 
1.4. Sample Size Consideration  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
 
Table 6.3 -1 shows the possible combinations of proportions of patients that could be enrolled in the 
study along with the weighted mean primary patency (PP) and the sample size required for 85% power 
against the PG (PP PG). 
 
Bard has chosen the sample size for the trial required for 85% power when the proportion of NIVL 
patients with endpoints is 20% and the proportion of PTS patients is 80%.  This is the company’s best 
guess for the actual enrollment. The estimate from the literature of the PP is 80% (used as the alternative 
proportion in the sample size estimate) and the PP PG is 70% (used as the null proportion). The sample 
size is 138 patients.  (This row is highlighted in yellow in Table 1.3-1.).  With 45:55 split  of the sample 
size, the PPPG becomes 74 %. As indicated in Table 6.3 -1, the sample size required for 85% power will 
be between 121 and 125, which is less than planned sample size 138. In other words, with the same 
sample size as planned, >85% power can be achieved.  
  
 
All sample size estimates in Table 1.3-1 were made with PASS 12 (Hintze, J. (2013). PASS 12. NCSS, 
LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA. www.ncss.com  ) using the Fisher’s Exact Binomial test for one proportion.  
 
Note that the sample size of 138 patients is the number of evaluable patients.  Up to 170 patients may 
be enrolled, depending on the losses -to-follow -up, deaths, and st udy withdrawals. Bard further 
estimates that approximately 50% of consented subjects will not meet the eligibility criteria (i.e., will

Primary Safety Endpoint:  
 
The freedom -from -MAE rate estimated from the literature was 99%, which was used as the alternative 
proportion.  The null proportion was the M PG of 89%. With 42 BVS subjects, the study will have 85% 
power to detect a difference, and with 138 BVS subjects, the study power will be over 99%.  
 
Overall study power: with taking into consideration of both co -primary efficacy and safety endpoints, 
with 138 BVS subjects, the overall study power is at least 85%*99%=84%.

RETURN TO  WORK S TUDY: MODAFINIL AND COUNSELING  
 
Purpose of Study  
You have been asked to partic ipate in a study of MODAFINIL (Pro vigil) for HIV+ men  and women 
who wish to retu rn to work but find that fatigue prevents them from doing so. The  study has two 
parts. Firs t, you wil l be treated for 4 weeks with modafinil , and, if your energy improves, 
medication will be continued for another 12 weeks. You will also have 8 counseling sessions 
(behavioral activation or supportive counseling) to help you succeed in finding wo rk or training. 
Modafinil is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of daytime 
sleepiness related to serious conditions called narcolepsy a nd obstructive sleep apnea, and for 
work -shift related sleep disorders. The aim of the stud y is to see whether counseling plus 
modafinil are helpful in overcoming fatigue and achieving vocational goals for adults with 
HIV/AIDS. The study is supported by th e National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  
 
Voluntary Participation  
Participation in thi s research study is voluntary. If you decide not to participate, or if you decide to 
stop participating, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise en titled. A decision not 
to participate will not affect your treatment at New York State Psyc hiatric Institute.  You will be 
notified of significant new findings that may relate to your willingness to Continue to participate in 
this project.  
 
Alternative Tre atments For Fatigue  
Modafinil  is available by  prescription outside of the study , although it is not approved for 
treatment of fatigue. . Alternative treatments for fatigue include psychostimulants such as 
methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, or steroids su ch as oxandrolone or testosterone (for men). 
Antidepressant treatment may also help with fa tigue, which may be related to depression among 
other factors.  
 
Alternative Programs Providing Assistance with Employment  
New York City has 17 career centers that pr ovide job placement services and career  guidance. 
Community agencies such as Housing Works and GMHC also offer job promotion services.  
 
Study Procedures  
Before you begin, you will have had a comprehensive laboratory work -up which  includes  blood 
chemistrie s, thyroid tests, immune tests (T cell count), and hormone blood levels. You also will 
have  had a physical examination (or you will get a letter from your health care provider saying you 
had one within the past 3 months). You will be asked to give permissi on for the study doctor to 
call your physician regarding your study participation if clinic ally indicated.  
 
The clinical trial lasts 4 weeks. During this time, you will see the study psychiatrist weekly and 
take study medication every day. Please return a ny unused medication at the next study visit. 
During this time, you cannot start taking oth er medicines to increase energy. After 4 weeks, you 
and the doctor will decide together if your fatigue has been significantly reduced.  
 
IRB # 6911  3 
An additional 12 weeks of modafinil treatment is offered if you found it helpful and you  participate 
in the counseling program. After that, you will be given a prescription, and thereafter your own 
doctor will be responsible for providing subsequent treatment.  
 
At the first visit, yo u will meet with the study psychiatrist, review the nature of the study  including 
risks and  benefits, sign the consent form and start medication. You will be asked to  return weekly 
for 4 weeks. After four weeks on modafinil, if you continue, visits will be  scheduled every 2 weeks, 
or monthly. Study visits with the doctor will last about a half h our. You will take your medication by 
mouth once a day when you get up in the morning,  unless otherwise instructed by you r doctor. 
The starting dose is 10 0 mg/day, w hich may be  increased slowly up to 2 00 mg/day in the absence 
of clinical effect and dose -limiting side  effects.  
 
After 2 weeks:  
After 2 weeks of modafinil, you will meet with a study psychologist to identify specific  work -related 
goals as well as other goa ls you seek to attain in the next 3 or 4 months. At this  visit you will be 
assigned to one of the two forms of counseling, and at the Week 3 visit, meet  with your counselor 
for the first counseling session. Initiation of counseling will be deferred if  you have no t responded 
to modafinil by Week 3. I f you have not benefited from modafinil by  Week  4, counseling will not be 
offered and your study participation will end.  
 
Goal -Directed Counseling: Behavioral Activation Counseling (“BA”) or Supportive Counseling  
(“SC”)  
There will be 8 counseling sessions, scheduled every other week  from Week 4 on, to work on  
steps to accomplish your goals. Since we do not know which method is more helpful, we are  
comparing these two forms of counseling. BA is more focused on spec ific actions to promote each 
person's vocational goals. Supportive counseling focuses on  emotional aspects of reaching such 
goals.  You will be randomly assigned (as in the  flip of a coin) to one or the other.  
 
The counseling sessions will coincide with stu dy visits for medication. The sessions  each will be 
about an hour initially, but may be sho rter over time depending on your needs  regarding work or 
training. The counseling will include homework assignments between visits  with the object of 
increasing goal -directed activities.  
 
The sessions will be audiotaped, with no identifying information, to  permit a clinical  supervisor to 
monitor the counselor’s work to be sure he or she is following the study guidelines.   Audiotaping is 
a study requirement. If you do not agree to audiotaping, you cannot participate  in the study.  
 
One and three months after the final counseling session, you will be asked to return to  see how 
you are doing, to repeat some of the questionnaires you filled out earlier, and evaluate  goals.   In 
the future, you may be contacted about participating in other studies, but you are  unde r no 
obligation to do so.  
 
When both medication visits and counseling occur in the same week, we will schedule them 
consecutively on the same day in our clinic  unle ss you prefer a different schedule.  
 
Study Measures and Tests  
You will be asked to fill out  brief rating scales at 4 -week intervals during the study, in  order to 
detect any changes that may occur in your energy level, mood, alertness, and goals.  
 
At one or  more of the regularly scheduled study visits, you will be asked for a urine sample for a  
toxicology (drug) screen.  
IRB # 6911  4 
 
Pulse and blood pressure will be measured at every study visit for the first 4 weeks, and then  
every 4 weeks thereafter.  
 
 
Women of childbe aring age : You should use barrier methods of protection, not hormonal  patches 
or oral contr aceptives during the study if you are sexually active, to avoid pregnancy.   This is 
important be cause of the possibility that modafinil may reduce the effectiveness of oral  
contraceptives or patches.  
 
If you are depressed before entering this study, please  initial one of the following as  appropriate:  
 
“ I have been told that I have depression  which currently is not being treated. I have  also been told 
that fatigue is one of the symptoms of depress ion, and that treatment for  depression may help 
with my fatig ue. However, at this time I do not wish to be treated with an  antidepressant, and 
inste ad wish to participate in the modafinil study.”  
(Initials)_______  
 
If you are already taking an antidepressant but are still depressed:  “I have been told that I have  
symptoms of depression which are currently being treated with a dose  of antidepressant that has 
not eliminated my symptoms. I understand that the study doctor can  raise  this dose for 2 -4 weeks 
to see if this helps with my fatigue, before I  enter the modafinil  study. If I still have significant 
fatigue, then I can enter the modafinil study at that time.  However, I do not want this option, but 
instead  choose to participate  in the modafinil study  without this delay.” (Initials)_______  
 
Risks and Benefits  
Risks . The most common side effect of modafinil is headache. Other side effects,  reported by 
patients in our previous studies include increased irritability, and, uncommonly , dizziness, dry 
mouth, or anxiety.   Although not observed in clinical trials, post -marketi ng cases of serious rash, 
including  Stevens -Johnson Syndrome and other hypersensitivity reactions, have been reported 
among  patients taking modafinil. In some cases this required hospitalization. While skin conditions 
or other hypersensitivity reactions co nnected to modafinil or armodafinil are extremely rare, we  
are bringing this information to your attention and request that you immediately stop taking  the 
study med ication if you develop a rash of unknown origin, or swelling of the face,  eyes, 
lips, tongu e or larynx and/or difficulty breathing or swallowing. We ask that you call  your 
doctor and also notify us if this occurs.  
 
The effects of modafinil on HIV viral loa d and the immune system are currently unknown.  Also, 
drug i nteractions between modafinil an d the antiviral medications or other  HIV-related medications 
you may be taking are currently unknown; no data are available. One  drug can sometimes 
increase or decre ase the amount of the other drug in the blood, but the  clinical significance of 
such change s, if any, are also currently unknown. We have treated  about 300 HIV+ people with 
modafinil or armodafinil. For these patients, all of whom took either  medication fo r at least 4 
weeks and up to 26 weeks, on average there were no changes in CD4  cell counts or viral load 
over the period of observation.  
 
There may be as yet unknown side effects from the combination of antidepressants and modafinil. 
However, to date we ha ve treated over 100 study participants with  modafinil or armodafinil who 
were also taking a n antidepressant, and no adverse events were  reported by them or observed by 
us. In 7 published studies where  modafinil was used in  combination with an antidepressan t, there 
were similarly  no repo rts of drug interactions .  Nevertheless, it is a possibility . 
IRB # 6911  5 
 
Other risks include the possibility of elevated blood pressure (hypertension), and the  possibility 
that your fatigue may worsen during the study. In addition, if you are depressed, your  depressive 
symptoms also may worsen during the study.   The risk of blood tests is the possibility of slight 
discomfort at the site of needle entry or a  small bruise.  
 
There also have been rare reports of worsened mental state in pat ients taking modafinil   including 
psychosis (hallucinations, irrational thoughts), aggressi on, and thoughts of  suicide. If you begin to 
feel worse mentally or emotionally, please let us know right away.  
 
During counseling, you may become distressed or anxi ous about some of the topics that may 
come up. You can discontinue the conversation or the session if you wish to do so. Vi olation of 
confidentiality is another risk, although as we explain below, we take great precautions to protect 
your personal informat ion. 
 
Benefits . Participants may or may not benefit from study participation. In our clinic al trials of 
modafinil and armodafinil, we found that most participants experienced reduced  daytime 
sleepiness, and increases in energy, alertness and mood. However,  only a minority of  patients 
who said they wanted to return to work or school once their en ergy was restored were  successful 
in doing so.  We are conduct ing this study to see whether modafinil in combination  with behavioral 
activation or supportive counsel ing is helpful to participants who seek these  goals.. If counseling 
is not  effective in pro moting return to work, other programs meant to promote employment will be  
recommended. If modafinil is not helpful, alternative treatments for fatigue such as  
methyl phenidate will be offered for up to 2 months as clinically indicated after the initial 4 -week 
trial. 
 
Benefits to other people : This study may help in identifying an effective strategy for HIV+ adults  
ho want to return to work. This would provide useful in formation for other people and their  doctors 
in the future.  Note on availability and cost o f medication:  Insurance programs may not provide 
cover age after the end of your study participation.

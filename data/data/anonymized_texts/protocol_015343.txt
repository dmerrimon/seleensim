Title  A PHASE 2b, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND, PLACEBO -
CONTROLLED STUDY TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND 
EFFICACY OF SPI -1005 IN MENIERE’S DISEASE   
Study 
Objective(s)  The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to determine the: 
•Safety of SPI -1005 treatment in adults with Meniere’s disease.
•Efficacy of SPI -1005 will be determined by the following
clinically significant methods and measures (responder
analysis) :
Pure tone audiometry (>30 dBHL at 250, 500 or 1000 Hz)
>10 dB improvement from baseline
Words in Noise Test (0 -35)
>10 % increase from baseline
Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) (0 -100)
>10 pt. reduction from baseline
Tinnitus Loudness: Q#2 of TFI (0-10)
>2 pt. reduction from baseline
Vertigo Symptom Scale  (0-60)
>6 pt. reduction from baseline
The re
sponder analysis from each method and measure will be 
compared between treatment groups for significance.  
•Efficacy of SPI -1005 treatment in adults with Meniere’s
disease based on
oImprovement in sensorineural hearing loss using puretone audiometry at 250, 500, or 1000 Hz; or
oWord recognition score using WIN testing at 24, 20,16, 12, 8, 4 and 0 SNR; or
oImprovement in the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI); or
oImprovement in Tinnitus Loudness (TL); or
oImprovement in the Vertigo Symptoms Scale (VSS) .
The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the:  
•Pharmacokinetics of SPI -1005.
Study Design  Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Study of SPI-1005 in 
adult volunteers with Meniere’s Disease  (probable or definitive

SPI-1005 Submission 0003 
SPI-1005- 251: CLINICAL TRIAL SYNOPSIS  
diagnosis ) with active symp toms in the months preceding study 
enrollment. All subjects will undergo baseline audiometric testing and 
have their severity of sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo determined before initiating treatment. Subjects will be randomized to treatme nt, either placebo or two different doses of SPI-1005 (1:1:1) 
and treated for 28 days. Subjects will return to clinic 2 weeks after the start of study drug to have safety assessment s and to receive additional 
study drug. Subjects will return to clinic at week 4 to have their 
hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo re- assessed, and again 4 weeks after 
the end of study drug treatment. Therefore, 4 scheduled clinic visits will be performed over an 8 week period. Audiometry will be performed at baseline, at the end of the 4 week  treatment period, and 4 
weeks after treatment has stopped. The TFI and VSS will be performed at all scheduled clinic visits. Subjects are allowed to continue with their existing maintenance therapies (i.e. low salt diet, thiazide diuretic, or other PRN medications) except for the use of oral or locally injected steroids.  New treatments should be avoided while 
on study.  
Study Centers  Approximately 12 U.S. sites will participate in this study 
Subjects  120 male and female adults with probable or definitive Meniere’s 
disease.  
Inclusion Criteria  •Adult male and female patients , 18-75 years of age at the time
of enrollment.
•Diagnosis of probable or definitive Meniere’s disease by AAO -
HNS 1995 criteria ( Section 12.1, APPENDIX I ).
•Two of three active symptoms  including vertigo or
disequilibrium, fluctuating hearing loss, or tinnitus  within the 3
months prior to study enrollment.
•Hearing loss of >30 dB HL at either 250, 500 or 1 000 Hz .
•Voluntary consent to participate in the study.
•Male subjects that are willing to use condoms throughout the
study period and 90-days following study completion even if
not fertile.
•Females of childbearing potential should either be sexually
inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to screening and
throughout the study or be using one of the following acceptablebirth control methods:
oIUD in place for at least 3 months prior to study; or
oBarrier method (condom or diaphragm) with spermicide
for at least 14 days prior to screening through study
completion; or
oStable hormonal contraceptive for at least 3 months prior

SPI-1005 Submission 0003 
SPI-1005- 251: CLINICAL TRIAL SYNOPSIS  
to study and through study completion; or 
oSurgical sterilization (vasectom y) of partner at least 6
months prior to study enrollment.
•Females of non -childbearing potential should be surgically
sterile (bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 6 months
prior to study enrollment, hysterectomy, or bilateral
oophorectomy at least 2 months prior to study) or be at least 1
year since last menses.
Exclusion 
Criteria  •Current use of or within 60 days prior to study IV ototoxicmedications such as chemotherapy including cisplatin,carboplatinum, or oxaliplatin; aminoglycoside antibi otics
including gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, kanamycin, orstreptomycin ; or loop diuretics including furosemide.
•History of otosclerosis or vestibular schwannoma.
•History of significant middle ear or inner ear surgery.
•Current conductive hearing loss, otitis media, or mixed hearing loss .
•Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic,gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, or psychiatric disease .
•Current use or within 30 days prior to study enrollment systemic
steroids or drugs known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
cytochrome P450 enzymes.
•Hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to compounds related to
ebselen  or selenium.
•Female patients  who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
•Participation in another interventional drug o r device study within
30 days prior to study consent.
Study Duration  Estimated duration of 12  months  
Participant Duration Participation for each s tudy p articipants  will be approximately 8 to 12 
weeks across 4 clinic visits.  
Dose & Regimen  Subjects will receive either SPI -1005 or matching placebo for 28 days. 
Treatment  will be taken  orally  BID. Doses include 200 mg  or 400 mg 
of ebselen  or matching placebo  in capsule form. Two  week  supplies

Safety & 
Tolerability Assessments  Physical  examinations, vital signs, adverse events, hematology (CBC) 
and serum chemistries will encompass safety assessments . 
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA (Version 18.1 or higher) and summarized by treatment group for the number of adverse events and compared. 
Vital signs and clinical laboratory results will be summarized for each 
treatment group  and compared.  
PK 
Assessments  The trough plasma levels of ebselen and its major metabolite (2 -
glucuronyl selenobenzanilide) will be determined using LC- MS/MS.  
The corresponding selenium plasma levels will be determined by ICP-MS. 
PK results will be summarized by treatment group .

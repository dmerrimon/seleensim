1. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Overview of the Disease  
 
Management of Myeloma has changed significantly over the past 10  years. The  use 
consolidation of induction therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has 
become an important part of the therapeutic plan for transplant eligible patients with 
multiple myeloma [1 -5] demonstrating improvements in responses and translated to PFS and 
OS benefits. Based on the findings of 6 international trials looking at ASCT, the ASCT 
regimen of melphalan 200 mg/m2 has become the standard of care.  
 
Despite the clinical benefit with the use of ASCT, myeloma continues to remain  incurable, 
and patients progress within 2-3 years of single  ASCT.  
 
Several strategies, have attempted to improve on the single autologous transplant, using 
either consolidation or maintenance therapy. Various consolidation strategies include use of 
a second  autologous stem cell transplant or combination  chemotherapy/  
 
A second strategy uses chemotherapy either as a single agent bortezomib or combinations 
regimens including bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone or bortezomib/ lenalidomide/ 
dexamethasone. An ongoing national intergroup trial is designed to answer the role of 
consolidation therapy and the best strategy.  
 
The second strategy to improve outcomes post transplant have been the use of long term 
maintenance therapy. Initial trials evaluated the use of alpha-interferon, prednisone with no 
significant benefit in survival and significant toxicity.  
 
Multiple trials have studied immunomodulatory therapy with thalidomide to  improve 
progression free survival post ASCT. All of the trials showed improvement in progression free survival however only 3 showed benefit in overall survival. Subset analysis showed benefit limited to patients in a partial remission post transplant and no benefit for  patients 
with high risk cytogenetics and patients in a deeper remission  including complete  remission. 
The use of thalidomide  has been limited by  development of toxicity  with long  term use  
including neuropathy, somnolence and fatigue.  
 
A second generation Imid, lenalidomide has been developed with improved side effect 
profile with limited neuropathy and somnolence. Lenalidomide has been approved in the 
relapsed myeloma in combination with  dexamethasone.  
 
Two trials have evaluated the role of lenalidomide in the post- transplant setting  as 
maintenance therapy, in the US as an in tergroup effort led by the CALBG, and the IFM 
group (1, 2). Continuous low dose lenalidomide demonstrated similar results between both studies with significant benefit in progression free survival. There was an absolute18-20 month increase in PFS, with an increase from 22+ months to 40+ months .  The CALBG 
trial more recently and importantly has demonstrated early overall survival benefit.  
The benefit in PFS with lenalidomide,  has also present in patients with high risk

cytogenetics and patient in complete remission post ASCT, which was not seen with 
maintnenace thalidomide. The use of maintenance lenalidomide has been very well 
tolerated with minimal neuropathy. The major toxicity has been leucopenia with limited 
neutropenic fevers. The second emerging signal has been development of second primary 
malignancies with use of lenalidomide and  additional followup and data is needed.  
In congregate the significant clinical benefit with improvement in PFS, limited side  effect 
profile has established lenalidomid e as an important therapeutic option. 
 
Proteaseome inhibition has been studied post transplant in a hybrid consolidation 
/maintenance model with predefined course of bortezomib based therapy, which was well 
tolerated and led to significant improvement in response rates and benefit in PFS. However 
long term proteasome inhibitor therapy has been limited by the necessary IV administration.  
 
The combination of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents have strong 
preclinical rationale which have been co nfirmed with high response rates with all 
combinations of PI+IMid in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory myeloma.  
 
MLN9708 offers an exciting new opportunity as an active proteasome inhibitor with oral 
administration of therapy to be studied in the maintenance therapy. Multiple ongoing  studies 
of MLN9708 as single agent and in combination with lenalidomide therapies are onging.  
 
New treatment strategies to continue to improve progression free survival with  maintenance 
therapy in an important window of opportunity to improve survival in patients with 
myeloma. We propose the addition of MLN9708 to lenalidomide as maintenance therapy 
will be a well tolerated regimen and lead to significant improvement in duration  of 
remission post- transplant.

1.2.6 Clinical Experience 
 
As of 12 October 2011, 247 patients have been treated with MLN9708 across 7 enrolling, 
sponsor-led phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies evaluating both twice- weekly and weekly  dosing 
schedules. Regardless of the route of administration in the twice-weekly dosing schedule, 
MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle; in the weekly dosing schedule, 
the drug is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Ongoing and planned studies 
include: 
 
• Study C16001: phase 1, single- agent intravenous (IV) administration twice  weekly 
in adult patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies; N = 111 
 
• Study C16002: phase 1, single- agent IV administration weekly in adult patients  with 
advanced lymphoma; N = 21 
 
• Studies C16003 and C16004: phase 1, single- agent oral (PO) administration  twice 
weekly and weekly, respectively, in adult patients with relapsed  or refractory  MM 
(RRMM) (previous exposure to bortezomib, IMiD, and corticosteroid required); N = 
56 and 32, respectively 
 
• Study C16005: phase 1/2, PO administration weekly  in combination with  
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone every 28 days in adult patients  with 
previously untreated transplant eligible MM; N =  15 
 
• Study C16006: phase 1/2, PO administration twice  weekly  and weekly in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone (MP) in patients with previously 
untreated transplant ineligible MM; N =  6 
 
• Study C16007: phase 1, single- agent PO administration weekly in patients  with 
relapsed or refractory light-chain amyloidosis; N = 6

In addition to the trials noted above, there are currently 4 planned trials, each of which will 
use the PO formulation of MLN9708.  These studies include: 
 
• Study C16008: PO twice -weekly administration in combination with  lenalidomide 
and low -dose dexamethasone every 21 days in adult patients with newly  diagnosed 
multiple myeloma  (NDMM)  
 
• Study C16009: PO  administration on Day s 1 and 15 of the first 28 -day cycle  to 
assess drug -drug interactions (DDIs) with ketoconazole, relative bioavailability,  and 
food effect in patients with advanced solid tumor malignances, lymphoma, or 
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia; in subsequent cycles,  PO administration  on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 
 
Both Study C16008 and Study C16009 are in the process of institutional review board (IRB) 
and independent ethics committee (IEC) reviews and have not yet begun to enroll patients 
(for additional information, please refer to  ClinicalTrials.gov).  
 
The 2 planned phase 3 trials are: 
 
• Study C16010: phase 3 trial of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with MLN9708 or 
placebo given weekly in patients with relapsed or refractory MM; currently in  the 
development stage  
 
• Study C16011: phase 3 trial of dexamethasone with MLN9708 given weekly versus 
physician’s choice from a preselected list of available therapy in patients  with 
relapsed or refractory AL amyloidosis; currently in the development stage  
 
1.2.6.1 Pharmacokinetics and Drug  Metabol ism 
 
Clinical IV and PO pharmacokinetic (PK) data show that MLN9708 (measured as the 
biologically active boronic acid form of MLN9708 [MLN2238]) has multi-exponential 
disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over by 4 hours. Oral MLN9708 is 
rapidly absorbed with a median time to first maximum plasma concentration (T max) of 
approximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t 1/2 after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to  7 
days.[1] Results of a population PK analysis (N = 137) show that there is no relationship 
between body surface area (BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL). Also, based  on 
stochastic simulations for fixed dose, exposures are independent of the individual patient’s 
BSA.[2]  Based on these data, a recommendation was made for fixed dos ing in  clinical

trials. An absolute bioavailability of 67% was determined for MLN9708 using the 
population PK analysis.  See the IB for information on the PK for IV doses of  MLN9708. 
 
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for MLN9708, with  negligible 
urinary excretion of the parent drug (< 3% of dose). In vitro studies of liver microsomes 
show that MLN9708 is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and 
non-CYP enzymes/proteins. The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of the  5 
major human CYP isozymes is 3A4 (34.2%) > 1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) > 2C9 (12.1%) 
> 2C19 (< 1%). MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor is 
it a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  The potential for MLN9708 treatment to 
produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low; however, there may be a potential 
for DDIs with a concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor because of the potential 
for first -pass metabolism when MLN9708 is administered via the PO route and because of 
the moderate contribution of CYP3A4- and CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of MLN9708 in human liver microsomes. MLN9708 may be a weak substrate of P- glycoprotein  (P-gp), 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance associated  protein 
(MRP2) efflux pump transporters. MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2. 
The potential for DDIs with substrates or inhibitors of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is,  therefore, 
inferred to be  low. 
 
1.2.6.2 Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral F ormulation of MLN9708 
 
As of 12 October 2011, a total of 115 patients have been treated with escalating doses of 
MLN9708 in 5 enrolling studies designed to investigate PO MLN9708 in patients with MM 
and amyloidosis.  These studies are outlined in Table 1-1.

The emerging clinical safety profile pooled from the ongoing trials indicates that PO 
MLN9708 is generally well tolerated with manageable, reversible, dose- dependent  treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that are consistent with class -based effects of  proteasome 
inhibition though frequencies differ. As of 12 October 2011, the most frequent (> 10%) 
TEAEs irrespective of causality to PO MLN9708 (pooled data) are listed in Table 1-2.

1.2.6.3 Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
 
As of 12 October 2011, there are 2 ongoing, phase 1 clinical trials investigating PO 
MLN9708 in RRMM. In Study C16003 of twice-weekly MLN9708 (21 -day cycle, Days  1, 
4, 8, and 11), the MTD is 2.0 mg/m2. In Study C16004 of weekly MLN9708 (28-day cycle, 
Days 1, 8, and 15), the MTD is 2.97 mg/m2. In both trials, patients are enrolled into the 
following defined expansion cohorts: RRMM, bortezomib relapsed, proteasome inhibitor 
naïve, and carfilzomib exposed.  Study C16003 (single agent, twice weekly) has completed  
accrual and Study C16004 (single agent, weekly) is enrolling patients into the  expansion 
cohorts. 
 
Study C16003:  Single- agent, Twice- Weekl y MLN9708 
 
Study C16003 has enrolled 56 patients with the following characteristics:  median age of 
65.5 years (range 50 –86); median time since initial MM diagnosis of 4.7  years  
(range 1.1 -24.3); median number of prior therapies of 4 (range 1–28); 57% of patients  had 
received stem cell transplant; 88%, 79%, 59%, and 4% had prior therapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide, thalidomide, and carfilzomib, respectively; and 52% were refractory to last 
therapy, including 28% who were bortezomib- refractory.  Patients have received a  median  
of 3.5 cycles of therapy (range 1 -23+). Six patients have achieved at least a partial  response 
(PR) (1 very good partial response [VGPR] and 5 PRs); additionally, 1 patient has achieved

a minor response (MR), and 28 patients have achieved durable disease stabilization for up to 
12.9 months.[3] 
 
In Study C16003, 1 of 3 patients experienced a protocol-defined dose- limiting  toxicity 
(DLT) (Grade 3 rash) at a dose of 2.23 mg/m2. Another patient at this dose experienced 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 10,000/mm3). Per protocol, a DLT related  to 
platelets required either a platelet count < 10,000/mm3 or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting 
more than 7 consecutive days; therefore, a platelet count equal to 10,000/mm3 did not 
formall y meet the protocol definition for DLT.  Although thrombocytopenia and rash have  
been identified as adverse drug reactions (see the IB), both events have predictable patterns, 
are reversible (spontaneously or with standard medical treatment), and can be monitored in 
the clinic with routine clinical observations and tests. Therefore, after a discussion with the 
participating investigators, an intermediate yet lower dose was allowed in the C16003 
protocol and supported by available PK data to further characterize dose- related  toxicities. 
Six patients were treated at the intermediate dose of 2.0 mg/m2, a dose approximately  half 
way between the 2 existing dose levels of 2.23 mg/m2 and 1.68 mg/m2 (a dose without any 
DLTs). Given that not 1 patient (0/6) has exper ienced a DLT, the MTD of  MLN9708 
administered PO, twice weekly was determined to be 2.0  mg/m2.[3] 
A summary of the safety profile of patients treated in Study C16003 is outlined in Table 1-3. 
Overall, 98% of patients experienced a TEAE of any grade and of any  cause.

Study C16004:  Single- agent, Weekly  MLN9708 
 
In Study C16004, where MLN9708 is administered weekly, 28 patie nts have been  enrolled 
to the dose-escalation phase as of 12 October 2011. Patient characteristics included median 
age of 64 years (range 40 –76), median time since initial MM diagnosis of 4.9 years  (range 
1.5–18.8), and median number of prior therapies of 6 (range 2 –14); 72% of patients had 
received SCT; 97%, 91%, 56%, and 6% had prior bortezomib, lenalidomide, thalidomide, and carfilzomib, respectively; and 56% were refractory to last therapy, including 28% 
refractory to bortezomib and 41% refractory to le nalidomide -thalidomide.  Patients  have

received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range 1 -11+). Two patients in the dose- escalation 
phase have achieved an objective response: 1 achieved a VGPR (relapsed after 4 prior  lines 
of therapy including SCT, thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and carfilzomib); and 1 
achieved a PR (relapsed after 4 prior lines of therapy including SCT,  thalidomide, 
lenalidomide, perifosine, and bortezomib) . Additionally, 6 patients achieved durable disease stabilization for up to 9.5 months. At data cut-off, 2 patients remain on treatment; 
discontinuation has been due mainly to progressive disease (69%).[4] 
 
In Study C16004, 2 of 3 patients experienced a protocol-defined DLT (Grade 3 rash  and 
Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) at a dose of 3.95 mg/m2. Per the protocol, 
subsequent patients were treated at 1 dose level below (2.97 mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients 
experienced a protocol -defined DLT (Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  Based on 
this information and other safety data, the MTD of weekly PO MLN9708 was determined to 
be 2.97 mg/m2. This dose cohort is currently being expanded to further evaluate the safety 
and activity of  MLN9708.[4]

1.2.6.4 Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma  (NDMM)  
 
Study C16005 has completed enrollment to the phase 1 portion of the study and is enrolling 
into the phase 2 portion. MLN9708 is given weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 with lenalidomide 
on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28- day cycle.  This 
study has enrolled 15 patients as of the clinical data cut (12 Oct 2011) to 4 dose cohorts. No 
DLTs were seen at doses up to 2.23 mg/m2. Three of 3 patients treated at the 3.95 mg/m2 
dose cohort experienced Grade 3 nausea and vomiting despite ade quate antiemetic  therapy; 
1 patient additionally experienced Grade 2 syncope, and, in another patient the dose of 
lenalidomide was compromised such that < 80% of the planned doses were received.  Per 
the protocol, subsequent patients were treated at 1 dose level below (2.97 mg/m2),  at which 
1 of 6 patients experienced a protocol- defined DLT (Grade 3 rash). The MTD of  weekly 
MLN9708 in combination with a 28-day cycle of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was 
established at 2.97 mg/m2. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) estimation  was 
established following evaluation of the available data from the phase 1 portion of the trial, 
which included, but were not limited to, analyses of efficacy results (response rates: 
complete response [CR] and VGPR) and toxicity char acterization (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs,  all 
grades peripheral neuropathy, and treatment discontinuation). For the purpose of the RP2D 
estimation, Cycle 1 data from 6 evaluable patients were used in addition to the available 
clinical data supporting tolerance over multiple treatment cycles. Based on this review,  the 
RP2D dose was determined to be 2.23 mg/m2 in this combination. The clinical development 
of MLN9708 included a population PK analysis evaluating the feasibility of switching from 
BSA -based dosing to fixed dosing.[2] The results of this analysis support this transition; 
therefore, in Study C16005, all patients treated in the phase 2 portion of the trial will receive 
PO MLN9708 at a dose of 4.0 mg (the RP2D dose of 2.23 mg/m2 × the mean patient BSA  of 
1.86 m2).[5] 
 
As of 12 October 2011, patients in Study C16005 have completed a median of 5 cycles 
(range 1 -9). To date, all 15 response- evaluable patients have achieved at least a PR  to 
therapy, including 4 CRs, 4 VGPRs, and 7 PRs; 14/15 of patients achieved at least a PR  by 
the end of  Cycle 1, and all 15 achieved at least a PR after Cycle 2.[5]

involving nausea, vomiting, dehydration, dizziness, fainting, orthostatic hypotension, 
hypo tension, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, and muscle weakness.[5] 
 
An additional study is being conducted in patients with NDMM, Study C16006, “An Open - 
Label, Dose-Escalation, Phase 1/2 Study of the Oral Form of MLN9708, a Next -Generation 
Proteasome Inhibitor, Administered in Combination With a Standard Care Regimen  of 
Melphalan and Prednisone in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Requiring 
Systemic Treatment”. In this study, PO MLN9708 is being administered on the twice - 
weekly  schedule in 1 group and on the weekly  schedule in a second  group. This study 
recently started to enroll patients. As of 12 October 2011, 6 patients, 3 per treatment group, have been treated, and all patients have received a fixed starting dose of 3.0 mg w ith 
standard doses of melphalan and prednisone.

reversible and can be managed by routine clinical monitoring and standard medical 
interventions, which may include dose reduction or supportive care. There is also 
consistency in the type of TEAE reported regardless of the MLN9708 formulation, even 
though there are differences in the frequency and severity of the reported events. Over all, 
the weekly schedule is active and has milder  toxicities than the twice -weekly schedule.  The 
most frequent AEs, listed in Table 1 -6, were anticipated based on nonclinical data and 
previous experience with  bortezomib.

1.3         Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent  with 
anti-angiogenic properties. The chemical name is 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -2H - 
isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure:

The empirical  formula  for lenalidomide  is C13H13N3O3, and the gram  molecular  weight  is 
259.3. 
Lenalidomide is off -white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic  solvent/water 
mixtures,  and buffered  aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide  is more  soluble in organic solvents 
and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging  from 
about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml.  Lenalidomide  has an asymmetric  carbon  atom  and can exist  as the 
optically active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with a net  optical 
rotation of zero.  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is availa ble in 5 mg capsules for oral administration. Each 
capsule contains lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the  following  inactive 
ingredients: lactose anhydrous, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and 
magnesium stearate. The 5 mg capsu le shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and black  ink. 
The 10 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, FD&C blue #2, yellow iron  oxide,  titanium 
dioxide and black ink. 
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is indicated for the treatment of patients with  transfusion- 
dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1- risk myelodysplastic syndromes  associated 
with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional  cytogenetic 
abnormalities.  Revlimid®  is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least  one prior  therapy. 
All other uses are considered  investigational.  
Clinical Pharmacokinetics and  Pharmacodynamics  
Absorption: 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapidly absorbed fol lowing oral administration  with 
maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.625 and 1.5 hours  post- dose. Co-
administration  with food does not alter the extent  of absorption (AUC)  but does reduce the 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of 
lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. 
Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodysplastic syndrome (MD S) patients was not  performed. 
In multiple  myeloma  patients  maximum plasma  concentrations occurred  between  0.5 and 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
December 6, 2019  MDAC C 2012 -0277 
Confidential 18     
  
 
4.0 hours post -dose both on Days 1 and 28. AUC and Cmax values increase  proportionally 
with dose following single and multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple  myeloma 
patients is 57% higher than in healthy male  volunteers. 
1.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
 
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of  lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two -thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged  through  urinary 
excretion.  The process exceeds  the glomerular  filtration  rate and therefore  is partially  or 
entirely act ive.  Half -life of elimination is approximately 3  hours. 
 
Supplier(s) 
Revlimid® (lenalidomide) will be billed to the patients insurance through  commercial 
supply to study participants.  
 
Dosage  form  
Lenalidomide will be supplied as capsules for oral admini stration.  
 
Packaging  
.   Bottles will contain a sufficient number of capsules for one cycle of dosing . 
 
Storage  
Lenalidomide should be stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight and protected 
from excessive heat and  cold. 
 
Prescribing  Information  
Lenalidomide  will be provided in accordance with the RevAssist®  program. Per standard 
RevAssist® requirements all physicians who prescribe lenalidomide for research  subjects 
enrolled  into this trial, and all research  subjects  enrolled into this trial, must be registered  in

1.3.4 Clinical Experience 
 
A Phase I study in subjects with refractory or relapsed MM was conducted to identify  the 
maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety  of lenalidomide  given  orally  for 
up to 4 weeks  at 5 mg/day,  10 mg/day,  25 mg/day  and 50 mg/day.  Secondary objectives 
included evaluation  of response to lenali domide, as well as pharmacokinetics and identification 
of surrogate markers to aid in defining mechanisms of action. Subjects who tolerated  study 
drug with acceptable toxicity  and were  without disease progression were  permitted  to continue 
on therapy beyond 28 days as part of an extension phase for over 1 year.  Twenty -seven 
subjects were enrolled, of whom 15 had undergone prior autologous  stem  cell 
transplantation and 16 had received prior thalidomide, with a median of 3 prior  regimens 
(range  2-6). All subjects  had relapsed  MM and 18 (72%) were refractory  to salvage 
therapy. Two subjects were removed from study on the first day of treatment due to rapid 
disease progression, which  resulted  in renal  dysfunction and rendered  them  ineligible.  The first 
group of 3 subjects were treated for 28 d at 5 mg/d without any dose limiting toxicity  (DLT). 
The second cohort of 3 subjects commenced therapy at 10 mg/day. In one subject, DLT  was 
encountered with grade (G) 2 fever as well as G3 leukopenia and neutropenia, resulting  in 
removal  from  study before day 28. Two subjects tolerated  drug.  Three  additional subjects 
were treated at 10 mg/day with no attributable toxicity within the first 28 days. In the third 
cohort of 3 subjects  at 25mg/day, drug was well tolerated  within the first 28 days but G3 
thrombocytopenia and G3 and G4 neutropenia occurred during the second month,  resulting 
in 2 subjects  being  removed  from  study.  In the fourth  cohort at 
50mg/day, the first 3 subjects  tolerated  treatment  without DLT  in the first 28 days and a 
subsequent 10 subjects  also tolerated  drug without DLT  within  the first 28 days.  However, 
subsequent G3 thrombocytopenia and G3/4 neutropenia in the extension phase has prompted dose reduction and GCSF support in all subjects. No significant somnolence, constipation or 
neuropathy has been  seen in any cohort. Median  duration of therapy  is currently  4 months 
[range 2 weeks – 14 months] and 11 subjects continue on treatment. Maximal protein 
reductions seen during therapy in subjects who have received > 28d of treatment are 
summarized  below:

Thus, best responses in protein of > 25% have been  seen in 15 of 24 evaluable pts (63%), 
and a <25% reduction has been seen in 4 subjects to achieve stable disease or better in 19 of 
24 (79%).  Pharmacokinetics  [days  1-4, and 28] have be en completed  in 24 subjects  and 
reveal rapid absorption (t max: 1-1.5 h); monophasic elimination (t ½: 3.1-4.2 h), and low to moderate inter -subject variability for AUC (11- 52%) and C  max  (3 -33%).  Furthermore, 
there  was  no  significant  accumulation  by day 28. In  conclusion,  these  studies suggest 
Lenalidomide  at the dose levels  studied has  anti-tumor  activity,  continuous 
pharmacokinetics (PK) with convenient daily oral dosing and acceptable toxicity in subjects 
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. (Richardson et al., 2002) 
 
Given the myelosuppression beyond day 28 seen in all subjects at 50 mg/day, this dose was 
considered  to be the DLT,  and thus the 25 mg/day  dose level  as a continuous daily  schedule 
of administration  was considered  MTD.  Given  the activity  of the drug seen at lower  dose 
levels and the PK characteristics observed, 30 mg/day in divided or single daily dose was 
assessed for activity and safety, and to determine whether a divided dose schedule  is 
superior. In addition, a 3- week on and one- week off schedule was assessed to determine if  a 
cycling  schedule would decrease the myelosuppression that was observed in earlier  trials 
with daily dosing. In this phase II study, 70 subjects with relapsed and refractory Myeloma 
were  enrolled at several  centers  in the U.S. Richardson  et al reported  that 26% of subjects 
required  dose  reduction  due  to  myelosuppression  in  this   study.  Responses  that  were 
observed included 4% of subjects with complete responses, 17% with partial respons es and 
33% with minimal responses. Progressive disease occurred in 15% of subjects (Richardson et 
al., 2002). It was concluded  that daily  dosing was better  tolerated  than twice daily  dosing 
because of a lower incidence and severity of  myelosuppression.

Data from two phase III trials comparing lenalidomide + dexamethasone to single agent 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma were presented 
at the 10th International Multiple  Myeloma  Workshop in Sydney Australia  (Weber  et al., 
2005;  Dimopoulos  et  al.,  2005). Patients  who  had  received  1-3  prior  therapies,  and 
progressing on their last therapy  were randomized to receive lenalidomide,  25 mg/d  x 21 d, 
placebo d22-28 plus dexamethasone, 40 mg, d 1-4, 9-12, 17-20, q 28d or placebo daily x  28 d plus dexamethasone, 40 mg,  d 1-4,  9-12, 17-20,    q28d. The  responses  reported are 
summarized in Table 1 -4 while the incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism are 
summarized in Table 1 -5. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia , fatigue, neuropathy, and 
constipation were also observed  more  often  in lenalidomide  + dexamethasone group compared 
to dexamethasone only group, however these events were generally manageable.

1.4         Study Rationale and Selection of Drug Doses  
 
There  have significant advances  in the management  of multiple  both in the relapsed/refractory, 
newly diagnosed patients with subsequent improvements in response rates,  and   survival. 
The role of maintenance therapy  and the optimal regimen  post autologous stem  cell 
transplant (ASCT) in t he myeloma paradigm continues to  evolve. 
 
Both lenalidomide and bortezomib have been evaluated as maintenance therapy post   ASCT. 
 
CALBG 100104 was a phase III trial which randomized patients post ASCT to maintenance 
lenalidomide  10  mg/day  or placebo.  Maintenance lenalidomide  on  an  intention to  treat 
analysis  lead to a 20.5 month improvement in time to progression (TTP)  from  21.8 months 
to 42.3 months with 17 months of followup. This benefit  in TTP was seen in patients  with 
prior thalidomide or lenalidomide based induction therapies. The major toxicity was 
hematologic  toxicity,  with 43% of patients  experiencing  grade  3/4 neutropenia, 13% with 
G3/4 thrombocytopenia with 12% patients discontinuing therapy due to any adverse event.  
 
A second trial, IFM 2005- 02 trial randomized patients post ASCT to placebo or 2 months  of 
consolidation with lenalidomide 25 mg/day for days 1- 21 for 2  months  followed 
maintenance lenalidomide  10-15 mg daily.  This led to an improvement in progression free 
survival post transplant from 24 months to 42 months. 
 
These two trials  have established  maintenance  lenalidomide  as an important therapeutic option 
leading to significant improvements in PFS and potentially overall survival. 
 
The combination of proteasome inhibitors and lenalidomide have been  studied preclincally 
demonstrating synergy and clinically in both induction therapy as well as relapsed  myeloma 
with promising  activity.  
 
The combination also warrant further exploration as the  maintenance  therapy  post 
transplant. Specifically  the addition of oral MLN  9708 to lenalidomide,  is attractive  as an 
all oral regimen with expected improvements in PFS/TTP compared to single  agent 
lenalidomide.  
 
The dosage of lenalidomide  will be based  on the CALBG  experience with 10 mg and modified 
as tolerated.  The dose of MLN  9708 will be based  on the single  agent  experience as well 
combination studies. We will start 3 mg orally  on day 1, 8, and 15 and dose modifications 
based on tolerability.

December 6, 2019  MDAC C 2012 -0277 
Confidential 31     
  
 
Patients  who take more  than the prescribed  dose of lenalidomide should be instructed  to 
seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff  immediately.  
Accurate records will be kept in the source documents of all drug administration (including 
prescribing and  dosing). 
 
Research center personnel will revi ew the dosing instructions with subjects. Subjects will  be 
asked  to maintain  a diary  to record  the drug administration.  Subjects  will be asked  to bring 
any unused drug and empty drug containers to the research center at their next  visit. 
Research  personnel will count and record  the number of used and unused drug at each visit 
and reconcile with the patient  diary.  
MLN9708 
 
All protocol- specific criteria for administration of study drug must be met and  documented 
before drug administration. Patients should be monitored for toxicity, as necessary, and 
doses of MLN9708 should be modified as needed to accommodate patient tolerance to 
treatment; this may include symptomatic treatment, dose interruptions, and adjustments  of 
MLN9708 dose (see Section 3.3.3) and per PI  discretion. 
 
MLN9708 Administration  
 
Capsules of MLN9708 will also be referred to as study drug. Study drug will be supplied by 
Millennium as capsules of 0.2, 0.5, and 2.0 mg MLN9708. 
 
The prescribed administration of MLN9708 doses in this study is 3 mg MLN9708 on days 
1, 8, 15 on a 28 day cycle.  
 
Patients should be instructed to swallow MLN9708 capsules whole, with water, and not to break, chew, or open the capsules. Study drug should be taken on an empty stomach (no 
food or drink) at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Each capsule should be 
swallowed separately with a sip of water. A total of approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of 
water should be taken with the capsules.  
 
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers if the next scheduled dose is 
72 hours or more away. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose. If 
the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled  dose.

MLN97 08 Destruction  
 
Investigational MLN9708 (expired or end of study) should be destroyed on site according  to 
the institution’s standard operating procedure. Be sure to document removal and destruction 
on drug accountability logs.  
 
3.3.3 Dose Modification and Delay  
 
Before each cycle the patient will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may  have 
occurred after the previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html).  Each AE should be attributed to a specific 
drug, if possible, so that the dose modifications can be made accordingly. If multiple 
toxicities are noted, the dose adjustments and/or delays for lenalidomide and MLN9708 are 
per PI discretion  and suggest refer  to guidelines that address the most severe toxicity.  
 
3.3.3.1 Criteria for Beginning or Delaying a Subsequent Treatment  Cycle  
 
Treatment with Lenalidomide and MLN9708 will use a cycle length of 28 days. For a new 
cycle of treatment to begin, the patient must meet the following  criteria:  
 
• ANC must be ≥ 1,000/mm3. 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3. 
In addition, all other toxicity considered to be related to treatment with MLN9708 must  have 
resolved to ≤ Grade 1, to the patient’s baseline values, or to a level considered acceptable by 
the physician (eg, hypokalemia that can be managed by replacements) before a new cycle of 
MLN 9708  treatment may begin. 
 
If greater than > 4 week delay in starting subusequent cycle due to recovery from 
toxicity, consider dose reduction in attributable drug. 
 
If the patient fails to meet the above -cited criteria for initiation of the next cycle  of 
treatment, dosing should be delayed until recovery. The maximum delay before treatment 
should be discontinued will be 6 weeks or at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

3.3.5 Packaging and Labeling 
MLN9708 
For blistered material, the capsules are packaged in cold form foil- foil blisters with a  paper 
backing for child -resistance.  
 
MLN9708 is an anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds caution 
should be exercised when handling MLN9708 capsules.  
 
The study drug MLN9708 capsules will be provided by Millennium. The study drug will be 
labeled and handled as open -label material, and packaging labels will fulfill all requirements 
specified by governing regul ations. The formulation consists of 0.2-, 0.5-, and 2.0- mg 
capsules for oral  administration.  
 
MLN9708 capsules may be stored unopened at 2°C to 8°C (36°F-46°F). The capsules are 
individually packaged in cold form foil- foil blisters with a paper backing for  child 
resistance. The capsules are in 1 × 4 blister strips that are individually perforated.  The 
strips (1 × 4) are placed in cartons containing 6 strips (24 total capsules) of the same 
strength. 
 
Storage, Handling, and Accountability  
 
Upon receipt at the investigative site, MLN9708 should remain in the blister and carton 
provided until use or until drug is dispensed. The container should be stored at the 
investigative site refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C). All excursions should be brought 
to Millen nium’s attention for assessment and authorization for continued use. Ensure that 
the drug is used before the  retest expiry  date provided by Millennium. Expiry extensions 
will be communicated accordingly with updated documentation to support the extended 
shelf life. 
 
In countries where local regulations permit, MLN9708 capsules dispensed to the patient for 
take-home dosing should remain in the blister packaging and refrigerated as noted above until the point of use. The investigative site is responsible for providing the medication to 
the patient 52in the correct daily dose configurations. Comprehensive instructions should be 
provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedures. Patients who 
are receiving take-home medication should be given only 1 cycle of medication at a time.  
Patients should be instructed to store the medication refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C) for the duration of each cycle. Patients should be instructed to return their empty blister  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
December 6, 2019  MDAC C 2012 -0277 
Confidential 38     
  
 
packs to the investiga tive site, rather than discarding them. Reconciliation will occur 
accordingly when the patient returns for their next cycle of take-home medication. Any 
extreme in temperature should be reported as an excursion and should be dealt with on a 
case- by-case ba sis. 
 
Because MLN9708 is an investigational agent, it should be handled with due care. Patients 
should be instructed not to chew, break, or open capsules. In case of contact with  broken 
capsules, raising dust should be avoided during the clean-up operation. The product may  be 
harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Gloves and protective clothing should 
be worn during cleanup and return of broken capsules and powder to minimize skin contact.  
 
The area should be ventilated and the site washed wi th soap and water after material  pick-up 
is complete. The material should be disposed of as hazardous medical waste in compliance 
with federal, state, and local  regulations. 
 
In case of contact with the powder (eg, from a broken capsule), skin should be washed 
immediately with soap and copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. In case of 
contact with the eyes, copious amounts of water should be used to flush the eyes for at least 
15 minutes. Medical personnel should be notified. Patients are to be instructed on proper 
storage, accountability, and administration of MLN9708, including that MLN9708 is to be 
taken as intact  capsules.  
 
3.4 Management of Clinical Events  
 
Prophylaxis Against Risk of Infection  
 
If lymphopenia is noted, patients may be at an increased risk of infection. In particular, 
lymphopenia can be associated with reactivation of herpes zoster and herpes  simplex 
viruses. Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir may be initiated as clinically 
indicated.  Other antivirals are also  acceptable.  
 
Thromboembolism Prophylaxis 
For patients at high risk, thromboprophylaxis according to ASCO guidelines or institutional 
standard of care is  recommended. 
Nausea and/or  Vomiting  
 
Standard anti- emetics, including 5 -HT 3 antagonists, are recommended for emesis  occurring 
upon treatment initiation; prophylactic anti- emetics may also be  considered. 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
December 6, 2019  MDAC C 2012 -0277 
Confidential 39     
  
 
Dexamethasone should not be administered as an anti- emetic. Fluid deficits should  be 
corrected before initiation of study drug and during treatment.  
 
Diarr hea 
 
Diarrhea should be managed according to clinical practice, including the administration  of 
antidiarrheals once infectious causes are excluded. Fluid intake should be maintained to 
avoid dehydration. Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation of treatment and 
during treatment.  
 
Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus  
 
Rash has been reported with both lenalidomide and MLN9708. The lenalidomide - 
Induced rash is characterized as generalized, maculopapular, morbilliform, urticarial, papular, 
often with pruritus, and is noted as a warning/precaution in the lenalidomide package insert  
(PI). Serious skin reactions  such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome, toxic  epidermal  necrolysis, 
and erythema multiforme have been reported. Lenalidomide interruption 
Or discontinuation should be considered as described in the PI/Summary of Product 
Characteristics  (SmPC).  
 
As with VELCADE, rash with or without pruritus has been reported with MLN9708, 
primarily at the higher doses tested. The rash may range from some erythematous areas  to 
macular and/or small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the 
body or more generalized, or it may have been transient and resolved either spontaneously 
or with standard symptomatic measures such as oral or topica l antihistamines.  Prophylactic 
measures should also be considered if a patient develops a rash (eg, using a thick, 
alcohol- free emollient cream on dry areas of the body). In the case of rash, the use of a 
topical or oral steroid (eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day or equivalent) is permitted.

Thrombocytopenia  
 
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with both MLN9708 and lenalidomide. Blood counts 
should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional testing obtained 
according to st andard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has  been 
manageable with platelet transfusions according to standard clinical practice. MLN9708 or 
lenalidomide administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification 
recommendations when thrombocytopenia occurs. Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced 
level upon recovery of platelet  counts. 
 
Neutropenia  
 
Neutropenia has been reported with both MLN9708 and lenalidomide. Blood counts  should 
be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional testing obtained  according 
to standard clinical practice.  Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable with 
G-CSF according to standard clinical practice. MLN9708 or lenalidomide administration 
should be modified when neutropenia occurs, as noted in the dose modification 
recommendations in Table 3- 2. Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon  recovery 
of absolute neutrophil counts. 
 
Fluid  Deficits  
Dehydration should be avoided because lenalidomide is substantially excreted by 
kidney, and MLN9708 may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Two cases of acute 
renal failure have been reported in patients treated at or above the MTD with  IV 
administration of MLN9708. There has been no treatment- related renal failure reported in 
patients treated with PO MLN9708. Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation of 
study drug and during treatment. Until further information is available, intake of  NSAIDs 
while on this protocol should be avoided. 
 
Hypotension  
Symptomatic hypo tension and orthostatic hypotension with or without syncope have been 
reported with ixazomib. Blood pressure should be closely monitored while the patient is on study treatment and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting  of 
concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either hypo- or 
hypertension) should be managed according to standard clinical practice, including 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
December 6, 2019  MDAC C 2012 -0277 
Confidential 41     
  
 
considerations for dose adjustments of their concomitant medications during the course of 
the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study drug and as needed 
during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy  Syndrome  
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved,  has 
been reported with ixazomib. This condition is characterized by headache, seizures  and 
visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed  by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or suspected, symptom- 
directed treatment should be maintained until the condition is reversed by control of 
hypertension or other instigating factors.  
 
Transverse Myelitis  
Trans verse myelitis has also been reported with ixazomib. It is not known if ixazomib 
causes transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving  ixazomib, 
the possibility that ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be 
excluded.

• Patients who experience worsening neuropathy from baseline may be observed 
for recovery, and any supportive therapy or intervention may be initiated as 
appropriate at the discretion of the investigator. Dose reduction is suggested, 
when and if the patient resumes MLN9708 therapy.  
 
  
3.5.2 Prohibited Concurrent  Therapy  
 
The following medications and procedures are prohibited during the study.  
 
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inhibitors is  not 
permitted in this study A DDI with a strong inhibitor would increase MLN2238 exposure. 
(rationale: if there were to be a drug -drug interaction with an inhibitor, the MLN2238 
exposure would be increased leading to a high probability of an adverse event): 
 
• Strong inhibitors of CYP1A2: fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin  
 
• Strong inhibitors of CYP 3A: clarithromycin, telithromycin,  itraconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, and posaconazole 
 
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should  be 
avoided, unless there is no appropriate alternative medication for the patient’s use . A  DDI 
with a strong inducer would decrease MLN2238 exposure Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital 
 
The dietary supplements St John’s wort and Ginkgo biloba are not permitted. 
The following procedures are prohibited during the study:  
• Any antineoplastic treatment with activity against MM except for drugs in  this 
treatment  regimen.

Confidential 45     
  
 
• Development  of new bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  (development  
of a compression  fracture does not exclude  continued response).  
• Development  of hypercalcemia (corrected  serum  calcium  > 11.5 mg/dL  or 2.8  
mmol/L) not attributable to any other  cause.  
 
 
Relapsed  disease  (for patients  who were  in CR) requires  at least one or more  of 
the following  (to be used for analyzing  disease  free survival).  
 
• Reappearance of serum  or urine monoclonal  paraprotein  by immunofixation  
or electrophoresis. 
• Development of at least 5% plasma cells in the bon e marrow.  
• A difference  between  involved  and uninvolved  FLC levels  of >10 mg/dL,  only 
in patients  without  measurable paraprotein  in the serum  and urine.  
• Development  of new lytic bone  lesions  or soft  tissue  plasmacytomas  or 
definite  increase  in the size of residual  bone  lesions  (development  of a 
compression fracture does not exclude  continued  response  and may not 
indicate  progression).  
• Development  of hypercalcemia (corrected  serum  calcium  > 11.5 g/dL  or 2.8  
mmol/L) not attributable to any other  cause.  
• Appearance of any other sign of  progression.  
 
Patients  with relapsed  disease  (recurrence of disease  after attaining  a CR) should  
continue  on treatment  if they do not fulfill  criteria  for progressive  disease.  This would apply  to patients  at any 
time following  initiation  of maintenance  therapy.  
 
3.10 Efficacy, Correlative Studies, and Safety  Measurements  
 
 
3.10.1 Efficacy  Measurements  
 
Patients will be staged every 1 -3 cycles +/ - 7 days while on protocol. Efficacy evaluations 
will be based on changes in myeloma protein measurements in serum and 24-hour urine, 
bone marrow examination as indicated, skeletal survey as indicated  clinically, 
extramedullary  plasmacytomas  as clinically  indicatedA serum  sample  for FreeLite  TM testing 
will be  obtained. 
 
 
3.10.2 Correlative/ QOL  Questionnaire  
 
 Mandatory blood samples one 50 ml in green top tube and 10 ml in Purple top will 
    
be obtained at time of routine blood collection and banked in the MDACC  Plasma   
Cell Dyscrasia Tissue Bank every 1 -3 cycles on day 1 +/- 7 days.  
The blood samples will be used for future research to better understand myeloma biology, 
diagnostic and prognostic features and  immunoprofiling 
M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI -MM module) scores. The core  MDASI - 
MM module is a brief, easily understood instrument that provides a measure of  the 
intensities of 13 cancer- related symptoms. Patients will be asked to rate the intensity  of 
physical, affective, and cognitive symptoms on 0 to 10 numeric scales from “not present"  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
December 6, 2019  MDAC C 2012 -0277 
Confidential 46     
  
 
(score of 0) to "as bad as you can imagine" (score of 10). Patients will also rate the  amount 
of interference with daily activities caused by symptoms on 0 to 10 numeric scales from "did 
not interfere" (score of 0) to interfered completely (score of 10). Six symptom items 
determined by physicians and nurses in the Lymphoma/Myeloma and Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation Departments to be important for the assessment of patients with  multiple 
myeloma and patients who are post-transplant will be added to the core MDASI -MM 
module for this study. The symptoms to be assessed by the core MDASI -MM module 
include: pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, difficulty 
remembering, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness, 
constipation, muscle weakness, diarrhea, mouth or throat sores, rash, and trouble concentrating. The six additional items assessing symptom- related interference in  general 
activity, mood, work, relation with others, enjoyment of life and walking. The MDASI -MM 
module will be administered in person, by  an interactive voice response (IVR)  telephone 
system, or through the use of tablet PCs. The IVR system will asks patients to rate  each 
symptom and interference item on the 0 -10 numeric scales using the keypad of a touch-tone 
telephone. 
 
 
While on study, patients will complete MDASI on day 1 (+/- 7 days) of every 1-3 
cycles of  therapy  
 
 
 
3.10.3 Safety  Measurements  
 
Before starting each cycle, patients will be evaluated for toxicity. Safety evaluations will  be 
based on changes in physical examinations, ECOG Perform ance Status scores,  clinical 
laboratory findings from pretreatment to the End-of-Treatment Visit, and on the observation 
or report of any AEs (including laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs) that occur after 
starting study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study agent and those SAEs (including 
laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs) occurring after 30 days if considered related  to 
Lenalidomide or MLN 9708. The intensity (severity) of AEs will be assessed using the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI - 
CTCAE), Version  4.0. 
 
 
 
4. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
4.1 Adverse Event  Definition  
 
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical  occurrence in a patient administered  a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have  a causal relationship with  the 
treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of  the 
drug, whether  or not it is considered  to be drug related.  This includes any newly  occurring 
event  or previous condition that has increased  in severity  or frequency since the administration 
of drug.

 The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing  source 
document ation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for  all 
subjects enrolled on the trial.”  
 PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form (eCRF) and  protocol 
specific data will be entered into PDMS/CORe for patients at  MDACC.  
We will only capture clinically  relevant  AE as determined by the treating physician.  
 
For this protocol an abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless 
that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, 
therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the investigator to be a  clinically 
significant change from baseline.  
 
We will per GCP  have an AE log. 
 
 
 
4.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Definition/  Reporting  
 
An adverse event  or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  “serious” if, in the view  of 
either  the investigator or the sponsor, it results  in any of the following  outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places  the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused  death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persist ent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
• Suspected transmission of infectious agents by a medicinal  product 
 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or  require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  or subject  and may require 
medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatien t hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (
21 
CFR 312.32 ). 
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered  serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as  an

SAE  if deemed  appropriate by the Principal  Investigator or the IND Sponsor, 
MDACC IND Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of  a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and  procedures 
outline d in “University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional  Review 
Board  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study 
drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  
 
 
• Serious  adverse events  will be captured  from  the time  the patient  therapy  and 
until 30 days after therapy discontinues. Serious adverse events  must  be 
followed  until  clinical recovery  is complete  and laboratory tests  have returned 
to baseline, progression of the event has stabilize d, or there has been  acceptable 
resolution of the event.  
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 30 day time  period 
that are related to the study treatment must be reported to MDACC  IND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary  malignancy. 
 
Reporting to  FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND  Sponsor (Safety 
Project Manager MDACC IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ensure serious adverse events 
are reported according to the Code of Federal Regulations,  Good Clinical  Practices, 
the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional  Review  Board 
policy. 
 
 
Reporting to  Millennium:  
 
This is an investigator -initiated s tudy. The principal investigator (who may also sometimes 
be referred to as the sponsor-investigator), is conducting the study and acting as the sponsor. 
Therefore , the legal/ethical obligations of the principal investigator include both those of  a 
sponsor and those of an investigator. 
 
Sponsor -investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of expectedness or relationship 
with any study drug, to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) as soon as  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson

Confidential 49     
  
 
possible, but no later than 5 calendar days of the sponsor-investigator’s observation or 
awareness of the event. In the event that this is a multisite study, the  sponsor- 
investigator is responsible to ensure that the SAE reports are sent to  Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all sites participating in the  study.  
Subinvestigators must report all SAEs to the sponsor -investigator so that the sponsor- 
investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator and 
subinvestigator(s). Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) may request follow - 
up information to a reported SAE, which the sponsor -investigator will be responsible 
for providing to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  
 
The SAE report must include event term(s), serious criteria, and the investigator’s  or 
sub-investigator’s determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and  the 
relationship of the event(s) to study drug  administration. 
 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by using  the 
NCI CTCAE, version used at your institution, as a guideline, whenever possible. The 
criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
 
Rela tionship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by the investigator  or 
sub-investigator by responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable 
possibility that the AE is associated with the study  drug(s)?  
 
Sponsor -investigator must also provide Millennium Pharmacovigilance with a copy of 
all communications with applicable regulatory authorities related to the study or study 
drug(s), including, but not limited to, telephone conversation logs, as soon as possible 
but no later than 5 calendar days of such communication.

4.2 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth  Events  
 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating  in 
this study or within 90 days after the last dose, she must inform the  investigator 
immediately and must permanently discontinue study drug(s). All pregnancies  and 
suspected pregnancies must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee; see Section 4.2 for contact information) immediately. The pregnancy  must 
be followed for the final pregnancy outcome (ie, delivery, still birth, miscarriage)  and 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance will request this information from the  investigator.  
 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s 
particip ation in this study, this must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance  (or 
designee) immediately (see Section 4.2 for contact information). Every effort should be 
made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy  outcome.  
 
 
4.3 Long Term Follow- Up P hase   
Following end of therapy on this trial, all subjects will be followed until death, withdrawal of 
consent for study participation, or removal from study. Subjects will return to the site or be contacted by telephone every 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) for follow up assessments of the following:  
• Second primary malignancies  
• Next -line of therapy  
• Progressive disease on next line of therapy  
• Overall survival  
 
Following disease progression on the next-line of therapy, subjects will only be followed for 
overall survival and development of 2nd primary malignancies.

5. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Design  
This is a single -arm, open label,  phase  II trial to determine the progression  free survival  (PFS)  of 
patients with multiple myeloma treated with the combination of MLN 9708 with Lenalidomide as 
maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplant. 
 
Analysis plan, Sample Size and Power  
 
The primary  endpoint is PFS,  defined as the  time from  autologous stem  cell transplantation (ASCT) 
to the time of clinical  progression,  death, whichever  occurs first or the time of last contact.  It is 
hypothesized that  the combination will prolong PFS compared  to the current  standard  regimen.  A total 
of 48 patients (dosed at 3 mg of Ixazomib) will be enrolled at an accrual ra te of 2 patients per month 
over 24 months. Additional 48 months of follow -up  is  planned  after the  last  patient  is recruited 
into the trial. Assuming that PFS time follows an exponential distribution, and patients treated  with the 
current standard regimens had a median PFS of 40 months, we will monitor the PFS using the  method 
of Thall et al. (Thall, 2005). Let Ts and Te represent the time to progression for the standard regimens 
and the proposed treatment  regimen,  respectively.  We assume Ts|Ms and Te|Me follow an exponential 
distribution with respective median Ms and Me. Furthermore, we assume that the prior for Ms  follows 
an inverse gamma distribution IG (100, 3960) to reflect our knowledge of PFS for the patients treated 
with the standard  regimens.  This  has  a  mean  of  40  months,  and  a variance  of  16.3. The  prior 
for Me is  assumed to be  IG  (3, 80), which has the same  mean  of  40 months and a larger  variance 
of 1600 to reflect the uncertainty about the median PFS of the proposed treatment regimen.  
 
The PFS will be monitored every  six months, and the study will be terminated  early  if there  is little 
evidence based  on the available data that the median  PFS of the patients treated  with the proposed 
treatment  regimen  is 12 months or more than that of the patients  treated  with the standard  regimens. 
The formal stopping rule  is 
 
Pr(Me > Ms+12 | data) <  0.035 
 
Specifically,  the trial will be  stopped early  if there  is less than 3.5% chance  that the median  PFS for 
the patients treated with the pro posed treatment regimen is 12 months or more than the median PFS 
for the  patients  treated  with the standard  regimens.  The probability cutoff 0.035 was chosen to obtain 
an early  stopping probability  around 10% (0.091) if the true median  PFS for the proposed treatment 
regimen  results in a 12 months improvement over the historical  median  PFS of 40 months. 
 
The operating characteristics of this decision rule are summarized in Table 1 using the onearmTTE 
software developed at the Department of Biostatistics at M .D. Anderson.

This monitoring will be carried out via the Clinical Trial Conduct (CTC)  website 
(https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct ) which is housed on a secure server  at 
MDACC  and maintained  by the MDACC  Department of Biostatistics.  Access to the website  will be 
gained through usernames and passwords provided by the MDACC Department of  Biostatistics. 
Training  on the use of the CTC will be provided by the biostatistical collaborator  of the study, with 
emphasis on the importance of timely updating of follow -up times and recording of events. The 
monitoring rules  for the PFS will be applied every  six months with the probability criterion  recomputed 
based  on the most  recent  data available at that time.  If the stopping rule is met, the study statistician, 
research nurse, and principal investigator will each receive an email notification that the  stopping 
boundary has been met. 
 
Because of the limited number of patients who have received the combination treatment, we 
will monitor the toxicity  of the combination while  we monitor the efficacy  of it. Due to the 
lack of detailed  information about the association  between  toxicity  and efficacy,  independency 
between the efficacy endpoints and toxicity endpoints is assumed, and the toxicity events  are 
monitored continuously (Thall  et al., 1996). The toxicity  endpoint is defined as treatment - 
related unmanageable toxicities, including grade 3 non- hematologic effects, or grade 4 
hematologic  effects,  that require  delay  or termination  of the treatment during cycle  1 A toxicity 
rate of 30% or higher will not be considered  acceptable. The prior probability of toxicity  is 
assumed  to follow a Beta (0.3, 0.7) distribution  with one patient  worth  of information. The 
toxicity  will be monitored by a cohort size of 4. At any time after at least 4 patients  have 
completed toxicity evaluations, the trial will be stopped if the following statement is  true 
 
 
 
Pr[toxicity rate > 30% | data]  > 0.95, 
  
 
which  means that the trial will be stopped for toxicity  if the posterior probability of the toxicity  rate 
being greater  than 30% is greater  95%. The early  stopping boundaries for toxicity,  shown in the 
format of 
 
(The  number of patients  with toxicities)  / (The  number of patients  treated),  
are ≥3/4,  5/8, 7/12, 9/16, 10/20, 12/24, 13/28, 15/32, 16/36, 18/40, 19/44, and 21/48.

Early  termination  of the trial can  be caused  by either  lack of efficacy  or excessive toxicity.  If the 
efficacy  and toxicity  are considered  jointly,  the early  stopping probabiliti es as shown  in Table  3 will 
be higher than the probabilities shown in Tables 1 to 2.

(OS),  will be estimated  using the Kaplan -Meier  method (Kaplan,  1958). log- rank test will 
be performed  to test the difference  in time-to-event  distributions between  patient  groups 
(Mantel, 1966). Cox proportional hazards model will be used to include multiple  covariates 
in the time -to-event analysis (Cox,  1972). True

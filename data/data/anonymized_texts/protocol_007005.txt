Response:  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To investigate the effect of the semaglutide addition to standard of care weight loss 
intervention (personalized lifestyle and exercise) in elderly obese subjects on body 
weight and body composition as assessed by DEXA  compared to age and gender 
matched control  group on standard of care weight loss intervention  only. 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
1. To assess between group differences in gene expression related to adipose 
tissue lipolysis and changes in mitochondrial metabolism.  
2. To assess between group differences in muscle strength as evaluated by both 
biceps  strength and quadriceps leg strength.  
3. To assess between group differences in measured and patient reported side 
effects including hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal concerns, injection site irritation 
and any physical activity limitations.   
2.2 State the hypotheses to be tested , if applicable.  
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to 
happen in your study that corresponds with your above listed objectives.  
Response:  
We hypothesize that:  
Hypothes is 1: We hypothesize that the addition of semaglutide treatment to the 
standard weight loss intervention will lead to greater weight loss, while, 
importantly, also enhancing the proportion of lean (muscle) mass in comparison to 
standard intervention alone.  
 Page 6 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Hypothesis  2: We hypothesize that the addition of semaglutide will be associated 
with a gene expression profile favorable for increased lipolysis. Furthermore, we 
hypothesize semaglutide treatment will be associated with greater energy utilization 
and increased mitoc hondrial reserve in the adipose tissue relative to standard 
intervention alone.  
Hypothesis  3: We hypothesize that semaglutide treatment added to standard weight 
loss intervention will improve muscle strength relative to standard intervention.  
Hypothesis  4: We hypothesize that semaglutide can be safely added to a standard 
weight loss intervention program in obese elderly patients.  
3.0 Scientific  Endpoints * 
 
3.1    Describe  the scientific  endpoint (s), the main result or occurrence under study.   
 
NOTE:  Scientific endpoints are outcomes defined  before the study begins  to determine 
whether the objectives of the study have been met and to draw conclusions from the data.  
Include primary and secondary endpoints.   Some example endpoints are :  reduction of 
symptoms, improvement in quality of life, or survival.   Your response should  not be a date.    
Response:  
PRIMARY ENDPOINTS   
1- Body weight :  Change from baseline will be calculated at 8 and 16 weeks  
2- Body composition by DEXA: Change  from baseline  in total body fat (kg), total

4.0 Background*  
4.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance of 
the research  based on the existing literature an d how it will contribute to  
existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.  Include  
relevant pr eliminary findings or prior research by the investigator.   
Response: Americans are living longer  and obesity rate is on the rise. These two trends add 
up to an increase in the number of obese older people (1, 2) . Both obesity and aging are 
associated with increased risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer (3). Obesity is also independently associated with all -
cause mortality (4, 5) . Abdominal obesity is also associated with accelerated muscle strength 
decline (6) Therefore weight loss is typically recommended to lower many of these risks. 
However, weight loss in older patients is a more complex issue. Aging process is associated 
with loss of muscle mass and increase in fat mass and increasing the risk of sarcopeni a (7). 
Approximately 25% - 33% of all weight lost in older adults during intentional weight loss 
interventions is fat -free mass (lean body mass and bone mass) (8, 9) , which further 
contributes to sarcopenia and increases risk for impaired activity, disability, and frailty (10, 
11). Therefore, providers can be discouraged from recommending losing weight in this 
population. On the other hand, existing evidence suggests that intentional weight loss should 
be recommended in older people specifically when obesity -related comorbidities e xist, 
including those with functional limitations or metabolic complications such as metabolic 
syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (12, 13) . The current therapeutic 
options for weight management in older adults do not generally differ from those offered to 
younger or middle -aged people but personalized regular resistance exercise combined with 
adequate protein intake is usually advised to mit igate the risk of further reductions to lean 
mass (12). Unfortunately, very little is done to emphasize the importance of exercise, and/or 
poor adherence in the elderly lead to poor mitigation of weight loss induced sarcopenia. 
Therefore, weight loss intervention that targets fat mass reduction while preservi ng lean mass 
is clearly needed in older patients.  
GLP -1RAs are drugs approved for use in type 2 diabetes to manage hyperglycemia. They are 
also known, with semaglutide approved, for inducing weight loss by reducing the appetite 
slowing the release of food from the stomach and increasing feelings of fullne ss after eating. 
We have previously shown that treatment with liraglutide, a GLP -1 RA, improved glycemic 
control and led to significant weight loss in obese type 1 diabetic patients (14). Our data 
reveal that weight loss was attributable to the loss of total body fat, including visceral fat, 
while there was no change in lean body mass as assessed by dual -energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA). Additionally, this was associated with increased expression of 
genes involved in lipolysis, lipid oxidation and thermogenesis in the adipose tissue including 
ATGL, CPT -1, PPARα, PPARγ, UCP -2 and Dio -2 (14). Our observations are supported in 
part by basic research suggesting that GLP -1 RA induced weight loss involves central and 
peripheral mechanisms, which increase adipose tissue metabolism and thermogenesis (15, 
16). Additional studies have also demonstrated, albeit with significant variability, a fat mass 
targeted weight loss in response to GLP -1 RA treatment in obesity (17). There has been only 
one previous report in a form of a series of cases that looked at the effect of liraglutide on 
weight loss in elderly  obese patients with type 2 diabetes (18). In this study, liraglutide 
treatment was associated with reductions in fat mass and android fat and preserved the 
muscular tropism (18). None of these studies prospectively investigated the effect of these 
drugs on weight loss and body composition in older  obese patients.  Therefore, GLP -1 RAs 
 Page 8 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 use to safely combat obesity and preserve muscle mass, and potentially improve muscle 
strength, in older obese patients requires further investigation . 
The basis for hypothesizing that GLP -1RA can improve proportion of lean body mass 
while reducing overall body weight is based in part on our data in obese type 1 
diabetes patients treated with liraglutide (14). The hypothesis is also based on basic 
researc h in animal models suggesting that GLP -1 RA actions in the brain triggers 
many of its effects on the adipose tissue. GLP -RA administered directly in the brains 
of mice lead to reduced body weight and increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) 
thermogenesis throu gh activation of GLP -1 receptors in the hypothalamus which 
increased activity of sympathetic fibers innervating BAT. This was combined with 
increased expression of genes upregulated by adrenergic signaling and required for 
BAT thermogenesis, including PGC1 a and UCP -1 (15) and browning of white 
adipose tissue (16). This data supports an independent effect of GLP -1 RA on 
increasing energy expenditure and thermogenesis in the adipose tissue, which can 
potentially translate to fat mass targeted weight loss.  
Our study will be the first prospective randomized and controlled study to investigate 
the ability of semaglutide (the most potent GLP -1 RA) to induce the desired weight 
loss while preserving lean mass in elderly obese patients and to investigate 
mechanism s involved. This approach capitalizes on basic research concepts and 
supported by human data.

☐ Prisoners  
 
8.4 Indicate whether you will include non -English speaking individuals  in your 
study .  Provide justification if you will exclude non -English speaking 
individuals .  
In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection of 
subjects, n on-English speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research  as a matter of convenience.  
In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent  or is designed to 
investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populations who may 
not speak English, the researcher is required to make efforts to recruit and 
include non -English speaking individuals.  However, there are studies in 
which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak English .  
Some examples include pilot studies, small unfunded studies with validated 
instruments not available in other languages, studies with numerous 
questionnaires, and some non -therapeutic studie s which offer  no direct 
benefit.  
Response:   
We will not have  non-English speaking individuals in this study. W e have patients 
that English is a second language, but they can read, write and understand it.   This 
population is less than 10%  of the total population .

employees of a specific firm , or educationally  or economically disadvantaged 
persons  are vulnerable.   Provide information regarding t heir safeguards and 
protections, including safeguards to eliminate coercion or undue influence.  
Response:  
No specific populations or vulnerable groups will be targeted. All subjects enrolled 
in this study will be of legal adult consenting age with the ability to speak, read and 
interrupt the English language. Subjects  will have the ability to speak with the 
research team regarding any questions or concern they have before signing the 
consent. Subjects will be  made aware that this study is voluntary, and they are able 
to stop participating at any time they feel uncomfortable. Subjects will  not be 
pressured into participating and their clinic standard of care will remain the same if 
they participate or choose not to participate.  
 
10.0 Eligibility Screening*  
10.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subjects’ eligibility.  Screening 
refers to determining if prospective participants meet inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.   
 Page 15 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Include all relevant screening documents with your submission (e.g. screeni ng 
protocol, script, questionnai re).  
Response:  
After obtaining partial HIPAA waiver, patient charts will be screened according to 
the study inclusion and exclusion criteria by our trained clinical staff and 
physicians. In addition, the study clinical team will evaluate their clinic patients for 
possibl e participation in this study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
at the Diabetes and Endocrinology Center of WNY clinics. Physicians will speak to 
them about their interests in participating in research. If the patient agrees, their 
informat ion will be given to the research coordinator to be contacted for further 
evaluation. The research coordinator will contact interested patients and those 
meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on preliminary phone evaluation  
(phone -script attached)  will be invited to participate in the study. All personal 
information will be kept confidential and locked in the coordinator office.  In 
addition, i nterested subjects who are informed about the study through the online 
listing or those referred  by other physicians will be contacted and evaluated for 
potential participation.  
Prospective participants  who pass the phone screening will be scheduled to An in -
person screening visit. At the screening visit, they will be asked to read the consent 
and any questions they may have regarding the protocol will be answered. If the 
subject wants to participate in the study, they will be asked to sign the informed 
consent form  and a copy provided for their record.  The subject’s medical history 
and current medications will be obtained as well as their blood pressure and vitals. 
A physical examination will also be done. Blood samples  (about 2 5 ml) will be 
taken to evaluate HbA1c, CBC  and CMP. Patients daily eating and exercise habits 
will be collected and reviewed for determining lifestyle intervention. Patients 
meeting all the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on all screening tests will be 
enrolled in the study  
☐ N/A:   There is no screening as part of this protocol.  
 
11.0 Recruitment Methods  
☐ N/A:   This is a record review only, and subjects will not be recruited.  
NOTE:  If you select this option, please make sure that all records 
review procedures and inclusion/exclusion screening are adequately 
described in other sections.  
11.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.

Participants will also be recruited through researchmatch.org  and the  study 
will also be  listed  on UB’s Study Information Portal (SIP) website.  
Patient records will be reviewed at the time of clinical encounter to identify 
potentially eligible individuals. If a participant is identified during clinical 
encounter, physicians will speak to them about their interests in participating in 
research.   
This study will be publicized on the UB Participate in Research (PIR) portal 
(www.research.buffalo.edu/portal/clinicaltrial/) while in the active recruitment 
period. Once study accruals have been met, the study will be removed from the 
portal. A lay title and study description will be included on the portal and have been 
included as an attachment in Click for approval. Once approval is received, the 
study will be populated onto the portal and will receive its own unique hyperlink. 
The UB PIR Portal was dete rmined to be not research involving human subjects 
(see STUDY00006316 for more information).  
 
11.2 Describe how you will protect the privacy interests of prospective subjects 
during the recruitment process.   
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.    
Response:  
Patient charts will be screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria by our trained clinical staff and physicians. If the patient qualifies and is of 
consenting age, the physicians will speak to them about their interests in 
participatin g in research in a private room where no one else can hear the 
conversation. If the patient agrees, their information will be given to the research 
coordinator to be contacted for further evaluation. No personal information will be 
shared without patient’s  approval and will not be used for any purpose except for 
this research. All personal information will be kept confidential and locked in the 
coordinator office.  
11.3 Identify any  materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for telephone calls, in person announcements / 
presentations, email invitations.  
For advertisements, include the final copy of printed advertisements with your 
submission. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach the final 
audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior to 

 Page 17 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 taping to ensure there will be no IRB -required revisions, provided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version.  
 Response:  
No paper, audio or video advertisement will be used. Patients will be identified 
through screening of clinical charts from  investigators clinics and through  
researchmatch.org and UB’s SIP website . 
 
12.0 Procedures Involved * 
12.1 Provide a description of all research procedur es or activities  being performed 
and when they are performed  once a subject is screened and determined to be 
eligible . Provide as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and include enough detail so 
that another investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research.  For 
studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the addition of a 
schedule of events table in in your response.  
Response: Eligible and qualified patients will be randomized  1:1 (using Excel, 
Microsoft Inc. randomization function) in pairs  (8 pairs)  matched by age  and BMI 
within 5% and by gender to one of two  open -label  interventions . Priority of enrollment 
will be to match already existing  and non -matched  pair(s) before starting new ones. 
However, participants  will not need to wait until they are matched to be enrolled in 
the study . The two open -label interventions  are:  
1- Control group: Standard of care weight loss program that includes lifestyle changes 
and personalized exercise and dietary education.  
2- Semaglutide group: semaglutide (up to 1mg) once weekly injection added to the 
standard of care weight loss program. Semaglutide dose will be started at 0.25 mg 
dose during the baseline visit  and doubled every 2 weeks up to 1mg dose or up to 
maximum tolerable dose. Patients will be instructed on how to inject themselves with 
the drug and how to increase the dose.  At every visit, number of injections taken  and 
doses will be collected.  Semaglutide dose escalat ion is  faster than recommended in 
the product label and during  clinical  use but is consistent with our current studies 
approved by FDA. During this faster dose escalation, we will  be monitoring the 
subject more extensively (4 weeks and 8 weeks) , compared to clinical practice, for 
any side effects including if they experience any GI side effects, and subject s will be 
kept at the maximum  tolerable  dose up to 1mg/week.  
At the baseline visit, and for all other visits, patients will come fasting (10 -12 hours) 
to the research center. P atients will visit the research center at 4 weeks (safety visit), 
8 weeks and at 16 weeks (final study assessment visit). Blood ( about 25 ml), body 
weight and other  vitals, adverse events including hypoglycemia  (blood sugar <70 
mg/dl)  will be collected at all visits. Fat biopsy aspiration, DEXA scans , muscle 
strength measurement  and age -appropriate quality of life questionnaire  (Quality of 
Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire – Short Form  (Q-LES-Q-SF) will be 
performed at 0- and 16 -weeks  visits.  
 Page 18 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 All patients will receive instructions  at the beginning of the study on weight loss 
nutritional program and appropriate physical activity to be performed for the next 16 
weeks. The program will be based, in -part, on dietary and  exercise habits collected at 
screening visit. For the entire duration of the study, participants  will maintain a daily 
diary to document food and exercise  activities  to ensure compliance with lifestyle 
program provided . At the 4- and 8 -weeks  visits, the daily  diary will be reviewed for  
food and exercise activities , and instructions will be provided again to reinforce 
intervention.  
Patients will be provided with glucose meter and glucose strips to measure 
fingerpick blood glucose. For the entire duration of the study, patients will be asked 
to measure their blood sugars at least one time after exercise  and to record any  
hypoglycemi c events (glucose <70mg/dl)  in their diary , Patients will be instructed 
to record  any other untoward side effects like nausea,  vomiting,  changes in appetite 
and other experiences  in the diary . Patients will be instructed to call the Diabetes 
Center to speak to a study investigator directly in case of any problem or untoward 
side effects.  
Subject will receive phone call s at 2- and 12 -weeks  following start of treatment to 
collect any safety data  and at 2 weeks after the end of the treatment . The subjects 
will then be discharged from the study.  Patients will be instructed to call the 
research center anytime they have a question or side effects.  
Standard of care weight loss program : 
Patients  will be instructed  to implement dietary and exercise program  for the next 16 
weeks and to record their activities on daily food and exercise diary  provided . 
1- Energy intake should be reduced by 500 –750kcal/day . 
2- Dietary fat should be reduced to 30% of total energy intake maximally .  
3- Meal replacements (if used) will be consumed during breakfast and lunch.  
4- Dinner consisted of conventional food and participants will be encouraged to eat 
fruits and vegetables within their calorie limit.  
5- Participants should ingest 1.0 –1.5g of protein/kg/day and spread consumption 
equally throughout the day. A leucine -enriched balanced amino acid supplement 
can be used.  
6- Subjects will be instructed to perform aerobic, muscle -strengthening, flexibility, 
and balance exercises. Minimally , this should include  moderate -intensity aerobic 
activity for 30 minutes five days per week or vigorous -intensity aerobic activity 
for 20 minutes three days a week, 10 –15 repetitions of 8 –10 major muscle group 
strengthening exercises two or more nonconsecutive days each week, 10 minutes 
of flexibility activities at lea st two days a week, and balance exercises three times 
a week for fall prevention.  
Fat aspiration procedure:  
Subcutaneous fat tissue aspiration will be performed on abdomen at a 10 cm distance 
from the umbilicus under sterile conditions and local anesthesia. 0.5 -3 gm tissue will 
be aspirated and cleared from blood and fluids contaminants by centrifugation. The 
upper adipose tissue will be collected into a separate sterile tube, washed twice with 
 Page 19 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 cold sterile PBS and centrifuged to remove the PBS. Total RNA, nuclear extracts and 
total cell lysates will be prepared from the adipose . 
DEXA scans : Patients will visit an off -site imaging center (Seton Imaging , Amherst, 
NY) for this test.

2- Body composition by DEXA: DEXA scans will be performed to collect data on 
total body fat (kg), total fat -free mass (kg), lean mass (kg) and bone mass (kg) and 
bone mineral density (BMD). Lean body mass to total fat mass ratio will be 
calculated at every  visit. Changes from baseline will be calculated at week 16.   
3- Adipose tissue metabolism and energy expenditure: Subcutaneous abdominal fat 
biopsies will be collected and assayed for A: RNA expression levels (by RT -PCR) 
of genes related to lipolysis (AGTL and HSL), lipid storage and mobilization 
(PPARs and PGC -1a) and mitochondrial thermogenesis ( β-adrenergic receptors, 
CPT-1, UCP -1 and UCP -2). B: freshly collected adipose tissue samples will also be 
processed to assess mitochondrial basal and maximal metabolism as well as 
mitochondrial reserve will be measured using the Seahorse XFP energetic flux 
Analyzer. This will be performed at baseline and at 16 weeks.  
4- Blood samples will be assayed for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile and for serum 
insulin, free fatty acids, glycerol, and lipoprotein lipase concentrations. This will be 
performed at baseline and at 8 and 16 weeks.  
5- Muscle strength: Biceps  and quadriceps muscle strength will be collected as the 
average of 3 measurements using  the MicroFET2  dynamometer . For these 
assessments , participants will be asked to take a seat and either lift an arm or kick a 
leg straight while be restrained by the MicroFet2 device – allowing collection of 
force generated.  This will be performed at baseline and at  16 weeks.  
6- Patient reported side effects and responses to age -appropriate quality of life 
questionnaire will be used to assess any adverse events and changes to quality of life 
and mobility  and will be compared to baseline .

during th eir one-on-one consultation time with the physician if they wish to 
participate in the research study. If the patient agrees, the research coordinator will 
contact them privately for a possible telephone screening and ask if time is 
appropriate for this discussion.  
When the patient is being seen at our clinics for the first time they sign the “Consent 
to use and disclosure of protected health information” form which clearly states that 
their protected health information (PHI) can be used for review in preparation for  
possible research. Additionally, a partial HIPAA waiver will be obtained to access 
medical records when screening for patients.  
If the patient passes the telephone screening, they will be asked to make an 
appointment to review and sign the consent. Patient will do this in a private room 
in the research unit and will be allowed to discuss the consent in detail with the 
research coor dinator and or study doctor. Patient will be notified that it is 
completely voluntary to participate in the research study and can withdraw at any 
time.  
We will not be accessing any medical information of the patients for whom the 
services are not provided by our clinic providers before partial HIPAA is obtained 
or informed consent  is signed.  
18.2 Indicate how the research team is permitted to access any sources of 
information about the subjects.    
NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include: school permission for review of 
records, consent of the subject, HIPAA waiver.  This question does apply  to records 
reviews . 
Response:   
Consent of the subject and partial HIPAA waiver  
 Page 26 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 19.0 Data Management and Analysis*  
19.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.   This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response:  
Analytical plan:  
Measurements taken on a continuous scale will be summarized by range, median, 
means and standard deviations. Categorical measurements will be summarized using 
percentages, various types of cross -tabulations, and proper graphical presentations. 
Type -I error  will be set to 5%, i.e. α=0.05, for all the statistical tests. Baseline values 
for patients’ demographics and concomitant illnesses will be compared using 
parametric or non -parametric tests. The primary endpoint will be to compare the 
between group differences in lean body mass/to tal fat mass ratio changes from 
baseline at 16 weeks. Secondary end points will include the additional study measures 
listed above assessed as the difference between groups at 8 and 16 weeks.  
Statistical  analysis  will be carried  out using  SPSS  and SigmaStat software  (SPSS , 
IL). All data will be  expres sed as mean ± S.E of arbitrary units  and percent  change  
is calculated  from  the means for mRNA gene expression . To evaluate si milarity 
between  the study  groups, baseline values  for subject’s demographics will be 
compared using appropriate  parametric and non -parametric tests based upon the 
nature  of the  data. 
19.2 If applicable, provide a power analysis.   
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the investigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study objectives  
and justify a conclusion.   
Response:  
There are no previous studies investigating the effect of semaglutide in the age 
group specifically, however semaglutide was shown to induce significant weigh 
loss (about 5%) predominantly from body fat mass in obese subjects. Therefore, 
with an estimated difference between semaglutide group and standard of care only 
group of about 50% in the primary endpoint, a sample size of 8 patients in each 
group (semaglutide vs control) should provide at least 80% power to detect a 
significant difference ( α = 0.05), provided the standard deviation of the residuals 
(variability) is not greater than half the estimated difference between the groups.  
 
19.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected 
data.  
Response:  
Two investigators and study coordinator  will double check the accuracy of collected 
data. All laboratory testing will be standardized using references and standards.

without participants approval. If a patient participation is terminated or the patient 
withdraws consent and decide not to participate in the study, she/he will be asked to 
undergo a final study visit for his/her safety.  Final blood sample collection, DEXA 
scan and fat biopsy procedures may  be performed if patient agrees. If a subject 
 Page 32 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 withdraws from the research, the data collected to that point will be used toward the 
research finding. If applicable the subject will have to bring back any unused 
research drug.  
 
22.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including retention of already collected data, and partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection , as applicable . 
Response:  
If a subject withdraws from the research, the data collected to that point will be 
used toward the research finding.  
If necessary, they will be asked to complete an end of study visit for their safety.  
 
23.0 Risks to Subjects * 
23.1 List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences 
to the subjects related to their participation in the research. Consider 
physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks.   Include a 
description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the 
risks.  
NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data.  
Response:  
- The risks associated with the study blood draw are generally considered to be 
minimal.  All subjects will be informed of the complication of venipuncture , which 
includes mild bruising at the site, which should resolve in few days. They will also 
be informed about the possibility of infiltration at the time of performing blood 
draws in which case another venipuncture at different site will be performed and 
this may lead to bruising at more than one sites.  Serious risks associated with 
venipuncture may also include infections and thrombosis. If any of these serious 
side effects is observed, the patients will be asked to call us immediately or seek 
immediate medical help.  
- The risks involved with fat biopsy procedure are also very minimal. This procedure 
is performed under local anesthesia and therefore study subjects might experience 
momentary discomfort at the time of giving local anesthesia. There is a small risk of 
bleed ing at the site of incision, but this will be controlled with cotton gauzes and 
pressure. The risk of infection is very rare as the procedure is done under sterile 
conditions.  
- Potential side effects of GLP -1 RA, like semaglutide, include  GI side effects 
including nausea (especially when you start using semaglutide); vomiting, stomach 
pain, loss of appetite; diarrhea; or  constipation.  
 Page 33 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 - The risk of hypoglycemia appears to be low with semaglutide , however, it could 
increase when combined with exercise or lower food intake as proposed in this 
study.  
- In rodents, semaglutide causes dose -dependent and treatment -duration -dependent 
thyroid C -cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. However, it received FDA -
approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2017 following large Phase 3 trials 
including t he cardiovascular safety trial SUSTAIN -6. Based on  the above rodent 
studies, semaglutide is contraindicated in those with a personal or family history of 
medullary thyroid carcinoma and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 
syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). However, following review of human data with GLP -
1RAs, FDA does not require or suggest routine monitoring of serum calcitonin/ 
thyroid ultrasound in people treated with semaglutide.  
- Injection -site reactions: Serious injection -site reactions, with or without bumps 
(nodules), have happened in some people who use GLP -1RAs but are less frequent 
with semaglutide. Injection -site reactions have rarely required surgical intervention. 
Particip ants will be instructed to report any injection site reactions including nodules 
to study investigators.  
- Kidney injury: GLP -1 RA might cause acute kidney injury in patients without 
underlying renal disease especially in patient who had experienced nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration.  
- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to study drug  ingredients may accrue in rare 
cases.  
- There might be other unforeseen risks associated with the use of semaglutide in this 
age population.  
- Exercise related events including, falls, fractures, dizziness, and loss of balance.   
- Patients always run a risk of breach of confidentiality when doing a research trial. 
However, procedures are in place to minimize this risk  as described in the protocol 
and consent . 
 
23.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety.  
Response:  
- We will collect no more than 25 ml of blood on each study visit . We will follow 
standard sterilization procedure s. Safety data will be collected at screening  and 
during  the study .  
- To lessen risk of hypoglycemia, patients will be instructed to not exercise before 
mealtime  and up to 1hr after meals. For  the entire duration of the study,  patients 
will be asked to measure their blood sugars at least one time  daily  after exercise. 
Patients will maintain a diary to record any hypoglycemia and other untoward side 
effects like nausea, changes in appetite and other experiences. Patients will be 
instructed to consume a small sugary drink or small, sweet snack if blood sugar is 
 Page 34 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 >70mg/dl and to repeat the test in 30 min. They will be also instructed to call the 
Diabetes Center to speak to a study investigator directly in case of any problem or 
untoward side effects. They will be specifically asked to call if they have 
hypoglycemia (blood sugar <70 mg/dl) on more than one occasion.  
- Injection site reactions and complications from fat biopsy collection will be 
monitored . If injection site reaction is observed or reported  patient will be instructed 
to alternate semaglutide injection site.   
- Risk of acute kidney injury or renal function impairment: CBC, CMP, including 
kidney function test will be performed at screening  and every visit  of the study 
(table 1). Additional testing will be performed in patients who suffer from sever 
nausea or GI symptoms or hypovolemi a. 
- To reduce the risk of injury due to exercise patients will be instructed to perform 
warm up and cool down stretching exercises. Subjects will also be advised to stop 
exercise in the event of unexpected pain , dizziness  or discomfort and to contact the 
study team.  
Research team will monitor patients for side effects and other unwanted outcomes 
through phone calls, patients own reporting and during visits.  
 
23.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures  may have risks to the subjects that 
are currently unforeseeable.  
Response: Any adverse effects of semaglutide  not currently known  may be some of 
the unforeseeable risks . 
 
23.4 If applicable, indicate which research procedures may have risks to an 
embryo or fetus should the subject be or become pregnant.

24.1 Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects may experience by 
taking part in the research.   Include the probability, magnitude, and duration 
of the potential benefits.   Indicate if there is no direct benefit.    
NOTE:  Compensation cannot be stated as a benefit.  
Response:  
 Page 35 of 44 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 While following a weight loss dietary and exercise program with or without study 
drug can lead to weight loss, the short duration of the intervention may reduce th e 
magnitude of such  benefit . Particip ants in this study may not directly benefit from 
the biomarker assessment s and the results will not be reported in th eir clinical 
record .

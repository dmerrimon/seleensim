1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the 
research hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory  skin dis ease clinically 
characterized by intensely pruritic nodules on the extremities and trunk (Fostini et 
al., 2013; Pereira & Ständer, 2016) . There are no  FDA approved therapies for PN. 
Topical therapies such as topical corticosteroids, calcineurin in hibitors, calcipotriol, 
and capsaicin, systemic corticosteroids, thalidomide, systemic immunomodulatory 
drugs such as methotrexate and cyclosporin, antiepilect ics and antidepressants, 
phototherapy and photochemotherapy are often tried with limited success and in 
some cases with unfavorable risk -benefit ratio (Qureshi et al., 2019) . Emerging 
reports are detailing the significant disease burden and unmet need in P N patients, 
with a prevalence estimate of 125,000 ambulatory visits per year in the United States  
(Whang e t al., 2020) . 
Chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) is defined as itch lasting for more than 
6 weeks without underlying systemic or neuropathic et iologies (Kim et al., 2019) . 
CPUO presents on multiple segments of the body, and it is unrespons ive to 
emollients. CPUO encompasses patients without a characteristic primary 
dermatologic eruption and negative systemic workup. Currently, there is a poor 
understanding of the etiology of CPUO, with eosinophilia and immune dysregulation 
suggested to play  a role, but studies have been limited by small sample sizes (Kim et 
al., 2019; Patel et al., 2019) . CPUO pathophysiology is hypothesized to involve 
several neu roimmune mediators, including histamine, IL -31, substance P, and 
TRPV1 (Miranda et al., 2018).  
In this study, we would like to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abrocitinib, a Jak1 
inihibtor, as a treatment for PN and CPUO. We hypothesize application of abrocitinib 
will improve these conditions of chronic itch, ultimately leading to improved overa ll quality 
of life via blockade of key cytokines known to be associated with conditions of itch 
including IL -31.

experiencing moderate to severe pruritus   
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
• To evaluate the effect of abrocitinib in improving quality of life in patients with prurigo nod ularis or 
chronic pruritus of unknown origin who are experiencing moderate to severe pruritus   
• To evaluate the  safety and tolerability of abrocitinib in subjects wi th prurigo nodularis or chronic pruritus 
of unknown origin who are experiencing moderate to  severe p ruritus  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
 
• To evaluate the correlation between abrocitinib responsiveness and comorbidities in prurigo nodularis and 
chronic prurit us of unknown origin  
• To evaluate the correlation between responsiveness to abrocitinib the rapy with skin and blood biomarkers 
of prurigo nodularis and chronic pruritus of unknown origin  
 
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, curre nt experience with 
proce dures, drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Jak1, the target of abrocitinib, plays a critical role in signaling of many cytokines. 
Relevant for this application, Jak1 is involved in the signal ing for IL -6 family cytokines 
including oncostatin M and IL -31, as well as for IL -4 signali ng, all of which have been 
linked to chronic itch and prurigo nodularis (Campion et al., 2019; Ghoreschi et al., 
2009; Zhang et al., 2008) . Additionally, abrocitinib  has been shown to inhibit IL -22 
signaling in keratinocytes as well as various cytokine sig naling pa thways, including 
IFNα (Fetter et al., 2020; Silverberg et al., 2020) . 
As the etiology of PN and CPUO is unknown, and there are currently no FDA approved 
therapies, it is extremely difficult to treat patients with PN and CPUO . Prior 
investigations have suggested roles f or aberrant keratinocyte signaling, neuronal 
dysregulation, and cutaneous inflammation (Hughes et al., 2020; Kowalski et  al., 2019; 
Zhong et al., 2019) . Targeted RT -qPCR and immunohistochemical staining have 
demonstrated dysregulation of select neurotrophi c factors and cytokines, but these 
results were inconsistent (Fukushi et al., 2011; Matsumura et al., 2015; Park et al.,  2011; 
Takada et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2019) .  Similarly, previous studies 
have shown conflicting evidence of immu ne polarization (Fukushi et al., 2011; Park et 
al., 2011; Wong et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2019) . 
In both CPUO and PN, there is evidence of involvement of IL -31 and Oncostatin -M 
(Kowalski et al., 2019; Salao et al., 2020); Sonkoly et al., 2006) . IL-31 sign als through 
binding the heterodimer receptor complex of Type -1 cytokine receptor IL -31RA and 
sub-unit OSMRb, which acti vates Jak1 for signal transduction (Zhang et al., 2008) . PN 
has been studied more extensively than CPUO, and these studies have identifie d Th1/2 
cytokine signatures as driving pSTAT6 and pSTAT3 nuclear localization in PN 
epidermis (Fukushi et al., 2011) . As explained previously, there is conflicting evidence 
of immune polarization in PN. Notably, STAT6 and STAT3 activation and subsequent

 nuclear localization is mediated by Jak1 activation, which itself is mediated by 
extracellular cytokine binding (Seif et al., 2017) . 
Abrocitinib is made by Pfizer, Inc. and is currently in Phase 3 trials for treatment of 
atopic dermatitis. At present, there is evidence that 200mg taken orally as a single daily 
dose is effective at reducing atopic dermatitis and itch associa ted from this condition. 
The incidence of adverse events with abrocitinib is well characterized and known 
adverse events will be monitored  for during the course of this trial.  
 
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
• Screening Visit  
• At the screening visit (Visit 1),  eligibility for the study will be confirmed. This will entail:  
o Physical examination: Examination of major body organs.  
o Vital sign s: Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, bo dy 
temperature,  height and weight.  
o Tuberculosis assessment: tu berculosis tes ting will be performed where indicated 
and as required by local health practice. This can be a skin test or a blood test.  
o Blood collection : The total amount of blood to be taken in this study for each 
participant is approximately 130mL (abou t 9 tablespoon s). These samples will be 
used to test:  
 Complete Blood count,  biochemistry  (tests of kidney, thyroid and liver 
function) .  
 IgE (immunoglobulin E) marker  of inflammatory disorders  
 Hepatitis B and C test.  The law requires us to report po sitive tests to 
the health department.   This reporting will include informati on that 
identifies you (for example name, date of birth, home address, phone 
number, etc.) as required by Maryland law.   The health department 
may use this information to contact you for  further follow up and/or to 
help conduct health surveillance activiti es aimed at preventing or 
controlling diseases.  
 HIV screening test. You may be asked to sign a separate State of 
Maryland c onsent form for this HIV test.  If the HIV test is posit ive it 
does not always mean you are infected with the HIV virus.  It does 
mean you will need further testing and you will receive counseling 
about this.  The law requires us to report positive tests t o the health 
department.   This reporting will include in formati on that identifies you 
(for example name, date of birth, home address,  phone number, etc.) as 
required by Maryland law.   The health department may use this 
information to contact you for furthe r follow up and/or to help conduct 
health surveillance a ctiviti es aimed at preventing or controlling 
diseases.  
• Only for participants with known history of HIV: CD4+ T 
cell count and viral load will be evaluated at screening and

 at the end of the study drug  period. This will be 
approximately 10 mL (less than on e table spoon) blood in 
addition to total amount of blood.  
 Pregnancy testing: only for women capable of having children: by 
blood test at the first  study visit and urine sampling test every 4 weeks 
at site visit . 
• For Study Visits 2 through 7 (Wee k 0 – 16) the foll owing procedures will be done according to 
the schedule above: Visits will be conducted within the specified week or within +/- 5 days  of the 
intended week.  
o Dispensing of Investigat ional Drug: All participants will receive abrocitinib beginning  at visit 2 . 
This will be taken as a daily oral dose of 200mg in tablet form. This thera py will continue for 12 
weeks (through visit 6).  
o Electronic diary: Partic ipants will be asked to complet e a diary daily in the 
morning. This will include questionnaire s to evalua te the severity of sy mptoms 
such as itch and pain  and asking participants  to rate their quality of sleep during 
the last night. The completion of the d iary will take approximately 10  minutes. 
The study doctor or site staff will train participant s on how to  use the diary during  
Visit 1 and give you instructions on how to complete th ese assessments. This 
diary must be returned to the site at the end of stu dy visit.  
o Questionnaires: Parti cipants  will need to complete up to 6 questionnaires on 
a table t. This wil l provide insight int o how their disease is affecting their quality 
of life a nd to provide information on symptoms and the impact of the disease on 
quality of life. Total duration of  completion of these questionnaires will take 
approximately 30  minutes. Al so, the study doctor will need to evaluate the 
severity of symptoms and compl ete up to 2 questionnaires at each visit.  These 
questionnaires include:  
 PP-NRS 
 DLQI  
 PROMIS PIQ T Score  
 5D Pruritis Score  
 SD-NRS  
 EQ-5D 
 HADS  
 PAS 
 PN-IGA 
o Physical examinati on: Examina tion of major body or gans.  
o Vital sign: Measurement of blood pressure, heart r ate, respiratory rate, body 
temperature,  and weight.  
o Photographs: Digital photographs of the pruritic ar eas will be taken at each study 
visit.  These photographs will a void any id entifying areas/marks  including the 
face, tatto os or identifying birth marks.  
o Skin biopsy: A 4mm punch biopsy of the affected pruritic area will be taken at 
visit 2 and visit 6. This  will inv olve injection of lidocaine and epinephrine  
followed b y taking th e biopsy. Participant s will not feel pain, only pre ssure. A 
stitch will be pl aced and care instructions will be given. Particpants  will return for 
suture removal 7 to 10 days after t he biopsy .

 1.1.2.  Permanent Discontinuation from Inv estigational  Product  
Investigat ional product must be permanently disc ontinue d if the patient or the patient’s  designee reques ts to 
discontinue investigational product.   
Discontinuation of the investigational product for abnormal liver test s should be considered by the 
investig ator wh en a patient meets 1 of the follo wing conditions:  
• ALT or AST > 2.5 x ULN  
• ALT or AST > 2 x ULN wi th the appearance of fatigu e, nausea, vomiting, right upper -quadrant 
pain or tendernes s, fever, ra sh, and/or eosinoph ilia (>5%)  
• ALP >3 x ULN that is deemed  to be of liver origin and drug -related  
• ALP >2.5 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomitin g, right upper -quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, an d/or eosinop hilia (>5%)  
Investi gational product should be permanently  discon tinued if any of the following la boratory 
abnorma lities are observed:  
• White blood cell count < 1000  cells/ µL (1.00 x 10 3/µL or 1.00  billion/L)  
• ANC <1000 cells/ µL (1.00 x 10 3/µL or 1.00 billion/L)  
• Lymphocyte c ount < 500 cells/ µL (0. 50 x 10 3/µL or 0. 50 billion/L)

posture, by >20 mmHg  
Note:   Temporary interruption rule s must be fo llowed where applic able.  For laboratory values that meet  
perman ent discontinuation thresholds, i nvestigational p roduct should be discontinued.  However, if i n the 
opinion of the invest igator the laboratory abnormality is due to intercurrent il lness such a s cholelithiasis or  
another identified factor, laboratory  tests may be repeated.  Only when the l aboratory value meets 
resumption thresholds  following the res olution of the intercurrent  illness or other identified factor may the 
investigator re start invest igational product a fter consultation with the Pfizer -designated medical monitor.  
In addition, pat ients will be di scontinued from investigational product in th e following circumstances:

Please note  that both ski n tissue and blood samples will be sent to Duk e Univers ity 
for analysis a s described below. We do intend to publish with the Duke team however 
it’s not a straight c ollaboration (fee for service - no subcontract). We will send them 
samples for  the biomarker analysis. We will pay for services done there.   Duke will  
return any unu sed samples so there will be no sample ownership change. Any 
residual spec imens will be returned to Dr. Kwatra at JHU . 
 
Skin biom arker a nalysis  
 
All patients will underg o two 4 mm punch bio psies at baseline and Week 12, the end of  
treatment. The 4mm biopsi es will incl ude one from lesional skin (pruritic, prurigo nodule) 
and one from non -lesional  (non-itchy) skin at baseline and agai n at We ek 12. Each 4 mm 
punch biopsy wil l be divided in tw o. One half of the 4mm biopsy samples (lesi onal and 
non-lesional) wil l immediatel y be placed in RNALater solution to be used in confirmatory 
qPCR. The other hal f of the 4mm biopsies will be stored i n 10% f ormalin prior to 
preservation as FFPE cassettes. Nanostring will use the Neuroinflammatory pan el with 30 
custom genes sp ecific to ab rocitinib (Appendix F). Specific deliverables for publication 
will be a volcano  plot and heat map showing differences  in exp ression of itch -related 
mediators  before and afte r treatment for lesional and non -lesional ski n. In addition, 
ingenuity pathway anal ysis and gene set variation analyses of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th 22 
pathways affec ted by abrocitinib will be displayed g raphica lly.. Our group is already 
comple ting an investig ation using these techniques in collaboration  with Duke University 
for healthy PN p atients. Nanostring data will be confirmed with targeted 
immun ohistochemistry s taining, where choices of specific tar gets wi ll be based on most 
dysregulated mediators observ ed following Nanostring.  
 
 
 
Blood biomarker analysis   
 
Plasma will b e isolated fro m patients before therapy at We ek 0, at Week 12, and at W eek 
16. Plas ma will be used for cytokine profiling, proteomics and metabolo mics. We will 
perform cytokine arrays on plasma samples  using the V -PLEX Human Biomarker 54 -Plex 
Kit.. Translat ional work fo r human plasma will also include  proteomics and metabolo mics

For proteomics, we w ill use an untarg eted LC -MS/MS approach. Using this app roach, Dr. 
Moseley, Director of Duke’s p roteomics facili ty, has been able to detect over 400 proteins  
in human plasma samples .  
 
For metab olomics,  we will use the MxP  Q500  assay  kit from  Biocrates  
(https://biocrates.com/mxp -quan t-500-kit/). This kit includ es 633 metabolites from 26 
bioch emical classes. We will measure each sample in triplicate.  
 
PBMCs will be isolated from patient who le blood at the s ame time points above, at Week 
0, at W eek 12, and at Week 1 6. To analyze multip le immune cell p opulations, we will use 
the Maxpar Direct Imm une Profiling Assay fr om Fl uidigm, w hich uses Cytometry by 
time-of-flight (CyTOF), a novel variant o f conventional fl ow cytometry. This kit supplies 
30 met al-tagged antibodies as a dry pellet, wi th additional ch annels/metal  tags allowing 
for additional tar gets. 37 immune cell p opula tions can  be characterized from PBMCs, and 
CyTOF technology will allow fo r complete protei n quantification of all selected marke rs. 
 
 
These tests will not be performed at a CLIA certif ied laborato ry because these are not 
clinical  grade tests and are d esign ed only f or research purposes. No results from these tests 
will be shared  with participant s as these are not intended for diagno stic pu rposes.

 a) Female parti cipants are eligi ble for the stu dy if they are not preg nant, p lanning to become pregnan t or 
breastfee ding durin g the study and one of the following applies:  
- Female participant is not a WOCBP: Female patients of non‒child -bearing potential are not 
required to use birth cont rol and they are defined as:  
• Women who  are infertile due to surgical s teriliza tion ( hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
tubal ligation ) 
• Post-menopausal – defined  either a s 
o A woman at least 50 years of age with an intact uterus, not on   hormone therapy, who has 
either  
• Cessation of menses f or at least 1 year  
• At least 6 mo nths of sponta neous menorrhea with follicle -stimulating hormone >40 
mIU/mL  
o Women aged 55 years o r older w ho are not on hormone therapy, and who have had at least 6 
month s of spontaneous amenorrhea  
o Women aged 55 years or olde r who have a diagnosis of menopa use 
 
OR 
-     If female participant is a WOCBP:  
a. Female patients of  child -bearing potential wh o are abs tinent (if this is complete abstinence, as 
their preferred and u sual lifestyle) or in a same -sex relationship (as part of their preferred and 
usual lif estyle) must a gree to either remain abstinent or stay in a same -sex r elationship without 
sexual relations hips with the opposite sex.  
 
b. Total abstinence is defined as r efraining from intercourse during the entirety of 
the study and for at least 1 week fol lowing t he las t dose of investigational 
product. Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation , symptot hermal, post -
ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable  methods of contraception.  
 
c. Otherwise, female patien ts of childbearing potential mus t agree to use  2 
effective methods of contraception, where at least 1  form is highly effective, for 
the e ntirety of the study and for at least 1 week following the last dose of 
investigational product.  
 
d. The following cont raception methods are considered  accepta ble (t he patient 
should choose 2, and 1 must be highly effect ive [defined as less than 1 % failure  
rate per year when used consistently and correctly]):  
 
• Highly e ffective birth control methods:  
o Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal  contrac eption  
associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intrava ginal, or transdermal  
o Proge stogen - only containing hormonal contraception associated with inhibition  
of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal  
o intrauterine device (IUD)/intrauterin e hormon e-releasing system (IUS)  
o vasectomized male (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentatio n of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate).  
• Effective birth control meth ods: 
o Male or female condom with spermicide. It should b e noted that the use 
of male and  female condom s as a double barrier method is not 
considered acceptab le due to the high failure rate when  these methods 
are combined.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosin g the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be 
used.  
 
 
Drugs:  
 
Abrocitinib 200mg ora l tablet – This drug is a study drug that was selected due to its 
targeting of the Jak1 pathway. 200mg is the dose that has been through Phase 3 trials 
for treatment of atopic dermatitis and there is significant data available regarding the 
safety and avai lability of t he drug at this dose.  
 
Tuberculin PPD – This drug is used as part of a tuberculin PPD test as performed by 
injecting .1mL of purified tuberculin PPD subcutaneously in the skin. This is the 
standard dosing for a test to determine if a patient i s infected wi th Mycob acterium 
tuberculosis.  
 
Lidocaine /epinephrine  – 3 mL injection at the biopsy site. Lidocaine -HCL 1% w/ 
epinephrine (1:100,000)  
 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered 
for non -FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or 
participant  populations are changed.  
 
 
N/A 
 
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND 
will be administered.  
 
 
N/A An IND has been given approval to proceed.  
 
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Prima ry outcome variable . 
Percent PP -NRS reduction between baseli ne and week 12.  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
 
Analysis of PN-IGA, PROMIS Itch Ques tionnaire, PAS, 5D Pr uritus Score, DLQI, 
HADS, and EQ -5D and detect differences between baseline through Week 12 . An 
ordinal regression will be used because these are non -parametric, ordinal scales.

c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
 
 
The trial arms of PN and CPUO will be used to conduct subsequent analyses of 
treatmen t efficacy. We will treat a p -value of <0.05 as statistically s ignificant, and all 
tests will be two -tailed. For the primary endpoint, ANOVA will  be used to analyze 
differences in percent PP -NRS reduction (baseline and week 12) with the inclusion of 
other covariates. We will use a Least -Square means to account for mis sing data or 
unbalanced design. We will conduct a two -way analysis of the response  variable (PP -
NRS per cent reduction) by classification variables: specifically, whether the patient 
has PN or C PUO, and week of treatment. We can derive all LS -means differen ces 
from every permutation of week or diagnosis, relative to Week 0 (baseline, pri or to 
treatment). We will incorporate a 95% confidence limit for a significant difference in 
LS-mean difference  between the control group and other groups.  
 
Unlike the primar y efficacy endpoint, the secondary endpoints do not have explicit, 
clinically mean ingful changes outlin ed in the literature. As such, we will look for 
significant downregulation in itch assessm ents, and significant improvements in 
quality of life and sleep  measures.  
 
Secondary aims will be analyzed using appropriate statistical tests a s outlined below, 
and missing data will be corrected with Multiple Imputation (MI) and we will assume 
that miss ing data is Missing at Random (MAR).  
 
For secondary analyses, a  multivariable logistic regression will be used to calculate 
the odds ratios of di fferent study arms (P N and CPUO) achieving a 4 -point reduction 
in PP -NRS and in SD NRS.  
 
To analyze the PN -IGA,  PROMIS Itch Questionnaire, PAS, 5D Pruritus Score, 
DLQI, HADS,  and EQ -5D and detect differences between baseline through Week 12, 
an ordinal reg ression will be used because these are non -parametric, ordinal scales.  
 
IgA for PN is not validated in the US,  so we are using it as an additional secondary 
efficacy measure . Appendix D has a simplified version we are applying to this study. 
Eczema and ps oriasis IgA are simil arly qualitative. Analysis of PN/CPUO  IgA will 
be an ordinal scale based on qualitative s caling determined at the site visit. We will 
analyze IgA with a n ordinal regression, same as other scales mentioned above.  
 
Atopy will be defined  as a binary variable  where patients have 2 out of 3: underlying 
history of atopic dermatitis, history of seaso nal allergies, or asthma.  
Among PN patients taking 200 mg of ab rocitinib, we will use a linear regression to 
compare PP -NRS reduction from baseli ne with week 12, amon g PN patients with 
atopy and PN patients without atopy.

d. Early stopping rules.  
 
 
Patien ts may withdraw at any time or they wil l be asked to end participation if the 
physi cian det ermines that discontinuation is in the pat ient’s best interest. Data collected 
may be used if any end points are reached.  
 
 
 
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedu res, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 
 
Foreseeable and known risks of study drug  
There is a risk that participants  might experience disco mfort or side effects with the use of the study drug or 
procedures. Some of them are still unknown at this stage. In some cases, side effects can be seri ous, long -
lasting, permanent, or life -threatening . The study doctor is trained to take the appropriate measures to 
reduce risks and limit any discomforts you may experience.    
 
Side Effects:  
o The most c ommonly reported side effects are:  
 Nausea (1 in 7 peop le) 
 Nasopharyngitis (1 in 8 people)  
 Headache (1 in 25 people)  
o Rare but serious side e ffects include:  
 Serious infection (less than 1 in 100 people)  
 Vomiting (1 in 85 people)  
 Decreased platelet counts (1 in 75 people)  
o  
 
 
Skin Biopsy  
• Small risk of bleeding  
• A scar may form, but is likely to fade over time  
• All procedures have a small risk of in fection  
 
Blood D raw 
Taking blood may cause discomfort, bleeding, or bruising where the needle enters the 
body. In rar e cases, it may result in fainting. There is a small risk of infection.  
 
Interviews or questionnaires  
Participants  may get tired or bored when we are aski ng you questions or they are 
completing questionnaires. Participants  do not have to answer any questi on they do not 
want to answer.  
 
Identifiable private information  
There is the risk that information about about par ticipants  may become known to people 
outside this study.

b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
 
Participants will be screened for  conditi ons that may increase risk of study drug or skin 
biopsy.  
 
All participant data will be deidentified and stored on a s ecure server in order to protect 
privac y to the utmost degree.  
 
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.  
 
All unan ticipated problems and study deviations will be reported to the primary 
investigator, Shawn Kwatra, as well as the IRB immediately upon discovery.  
 
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
 
As this study  invol ves personal health information, there is a risk of breach of 
confidentiality. Additionally, as there are genetic studie s planned as part of this study, 
there is a risk that this information  could be disclosed with a breach of confidentiality.  
 
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
 
There is a small financial risk to participants if they suffer from severe side effects that  
impact their day -to-day life and requi re additional medical care or potentially missing 
work. These are not anticipated to be sig nifica nt risks for this study.  
 
 
 
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
 
There is potential benefit to the participant if  abrocitinib shows efficacy in 
improvement for conditions of chronic itch. There is also be nefit for society of 
contributing to the understanding of these chronic itch conditions for which no 
approved therapies curren tly exist.  
 
 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration

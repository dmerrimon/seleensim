This amended protocol 06 is considered to be  substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the Eu ropean Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT
Under the current EFC14028 protocol applicable for patients in the UK (Amended protocol 04) the duration of the extended open-label avalglucos idase alfa long-term follow-up period is defined 
as ‘up to 144 weeks after the last patient has been enrolled in the study’. Last enrolled patient was 
a pediatric patient enrolled in the open-label period in August 2020. The 144-week period leads to May 2023. This date is inconsistent with the maximum period allowed per protocol, which is 289 weeks of treatment, because all patients in the UK will reach Week 289 earlier than 
May 2023. In order to correct this discrepancy, the duration of the extended open-label 
avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow- up period will be defined as ‘ up to the approval in the 
country or to the maximal duration planned in the study (ie, end of treatment at Week 289),
whichever occurs first ’.

STUDY NAME: COMparative Enzyme replacement Trial with 
neoGAA versus rhGAA (COMET)
TITLE A Phase 3 randomized, multicenter , multinational, double-blinded 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of repeated biweekly infusions 
of avalglucosidase alfa (neoGAA, GZ402666) and alglucosidase alfa in 
treatment -naïve patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Phase 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) Primary objective:
The primary objective of the stud y is to determine the effect of 
avalglucosidase alfa  treatment on respiratory muscle strength as 
measur ed by Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) % predicted in the upright 
position , as compared to alglucosidase alfa. 
Secondary objectives:
Secondary objectives a re to determine the safety and effect of 
avalglucosidase alfa  treatment on functional endurance (6- minute walk 
test [6MWT]), inspiratory muscle strength (maximum inspiratory 
pressure [MIP ]), expiratory muscle streng th (maximum expiratory 
pressure [MEP ]), lower extremity musc le strength (hand-held 
dynamometry [HHD ]), motor function (Quick Motor Function Test 
[QMFT]), and health-related quality of  life (Short Form-12 [SF-12]). 
Other Objectives :
Additional objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK ), 
exploratory pharmacodynamics  (PD), pharmacogenetics and effect o f 
avalglucosidase alfa  treatment on motor fu nction (Gross Motor 
Function Measure -88 [GMFM-88] and Gait, Stair, Gower’s Maneuver, 
and Chair  [GSGC]), upper extremity muscle strength (HHD), 
health -related quality of life (EuroQ oL in 5 dimensions [EQ-5D-5L ] and 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [ PedsQL] Generic Core Scale), and 
patient reported outcomes (P ompe Disease Symptom Scale [ PDSS ], 
Pompe Disease Impact Scale [ PDIS], Rasch-built Pompe-specific 
Activity scale  [R-PAct], and Patient Global Impression of Change 
[PGIC]).
STUDY DESIGN A Phase 3 multicenter, multination al, randomized, double-blinded 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa and 
alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®/Lumizyme®) in treatment- naïve patients 
with LOPD. 
The study includes 2 main periods: the blinded treatment period and 
the open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase. 
Patients in the alglucosidase alfa arm will be switched to 
avalglucosidase alfa  treatment after 12 months. 
Patients will remain blinded to the randomized treatment until after 
database is locked.  
Randomization will be in a 1:1 ratio wi th stratification factors based on 
baseline FVC, gender, age, and country (Japan or ex-Japan).

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE The study will comprise up to 76 visits including the Screening Visit 
(V1: Day -14 to Day -1); V2 (Day 1/Day 2) through V27 (Week 49) 
occurring every 1 to 2  weeks for study drug infusion, PK, safety 
assessment, and eff icacy evaluations in th e blinded treatment p eriod; 
V28 (Week  51) through V76 (Week 145) for study drug infusion, safety 
assessment, and efficacy evaluations i n the open-label 
avalglucosidase alfa  long-term follow-up pha se; an additional exten ded 
open -label avalglucosidase alfa long-t erm follow-up period of up to 
144 weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa is approved in the patient’s 
country , whichever comes first; refer to Appendix C Section  17.3.3  for 
patients in Canada  and Section  17.3.4  for definition applicable for UK 
patie nts) will include bi-weekly visits (study drug infusion, adverse 
events check and vital signs) as well as less frequent visits for other 
assessments (every 4 weeks, 12 w eeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks). At 
the end of this period, the end of study visit/contact will be performed . 
If at the end of the recruitment, <4 pediatric patients aged 3 to 
<18 years are enrolled, up to 2 ad ditional pediatric patients will be 
enrolled directly in the open -label avalglucosidase alfa long-term 
follow -up phase where they will receive avalglucosidase alfa. 
For th is subgroup of pediatric patients, the study will comprise 52 visits 
including the Screening Visit (V1: Day -14 to Day -1) and the 
Enrollment Visit V2 (Day 1/Day 2); V3 (1 week after V2) through V52 
(Week 97) for study drug infusion, PK, safety assessment, and efficacy 
evaluations in the open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow- up 
phase (refer to study flow chart Section  1.2.5.1  for V29 details); an 
additional exten ded open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-
up period of up to 144 weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa is approved 
in the patient ’s country, whichever comes first; refer to Appendix C 
Section  17.3.4  for definition applicable for UK patients) will include bi-
weekly visits (study drug infusion, AEs checks and vital signs) as well 
as less frequent visits for othe r assessments (every 4 weeks, 
12 weeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks). At the end of this period, the end 
of study visit/contact will be performed.  
For all patients, a ll visits following V2 are calculated from day of first 
infusion of investigational medicinal product (IMP) in 14-day 
increments with a window of ±7 days for infusions and safety 
assessments and ±14 days for all other assessments.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 8STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination:
Sample size calculation is based on a comparison of FVC 
(% predicted) change from baseline at 12 months (Week 49). The 
study will be tested for non -inferiority (NI) first (with an NI margin of 
1.1%), followed by superiority testing if NI is achieved. A sample size 
of 96 (1:1 randomization ratio) will provide 80% power to demonstrate 
NI of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa with 2-sided 5% 
significance level. The power calculation was based on 2-sample 
t-test. The following assumptions were made based on the 
alglucosidase alfa pivotal study for LOPD (LOTS) and the completed 
avalglucosidase alfa  Phase 1/2 study (TDR12857): 
x Common standard deviation of 5.1%; 
x Mean treatment difference (avalglucosidase alfa – 
alglucosidase alfa) of 2.0%; 
x Percent of patients with missing data to be 10%. 
Analysis population:
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) populat ion is defined as all 
randomized patients who received at least  1 infusion (partial or total).  
The mITT population is the primary  analysis population for all efficacy 
endpoints. Patients will be analyz ed in the treatment group to which 
they were randomized.  
The per protocol (PP ) population is defined as a subset of the mITT 
population that excludes patients wi th major protocol deviations that 
potentially impact the primary efficacy endpoint. The criteria for 
exclusion of patients from the PP population will be determined and 
documented prior to database lock. The PP population will be used for sensitivity analysis purposes.
 
The safety population is defined as all patients who received at least  
1 infusion (partial or total). All safety analyses will be performed on the 
safety population. Patients will be summarized based on the treatment they received.
 
Analysis of efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to Week  49 
in FVC (%  predicted) in upright position. 
The primary endpoint will be an alyzed using a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with change from baseline as outcome 
variable. The MMRM model will include the baseline FVC 
(% predicted) as a continuous va riable, and gender, age, treatment 
group, visit, and treatment-by-visit int eraction as fixed effects. An 
unstructured covariance matrix shared  across treatment groups will be 
used to model the within -patient error, the Kenward-Roger 
approximation will be used to es timate the degrees of freedom,  and 
the model will be fit using restricted maximum likelihood. This analysis 
will include all post -baseline assessments up to Week 49, regardless 
of treatment discontinuation status ; missing data will not be imputed 
and will be assumed to be missing -at-random (MAR). Sensitivity 
analyses will be performed to assess the impact of missing data.  
The primary comparison of interest is the difference in least -square 
means between groups at the Week  49 visit. 
A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-specific primary analysis 
will be conducted using the method described above for those patients

lower age range of patients in the LOTS trial of alglucosidase alfa.  
Analysis of safety:
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population and the 
“as treated” population.  
All AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ). Adverse event 
incidence tables will be presented by  system organ class (SOC) sorted 
by internationally agreed order and preferred term (PT ) sorted 
alphabetically for each treatment arm, by the number and percentage 
of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same 
event in the same patient will be c ounted only once in the tables. The 
denominator for computation of perc entages is the safety population 
within each treatment arm.  
All TEAEs, all TEAEs potentially r elated to study drug, all TEAEs 
leading to treatmen t discontinuation, all TEAEs that are IARs, all 
treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) (including 
treatment -related SAEs), all AEs with fatal outcome, and adverse 
event of special interest (A ESI)s will be summarized descriptively by 
treatment groups.  
Additional safety data including clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 
ECG, and immunogenicity will be summarized descriptivel y by 
treatment groups.  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient) After the initial period (blinded treatment period and open-label 
avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up period), an additional period 
of up to 144 weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa is approved in 
patient’s country, whichever comes first; refer to Appendix C 
Section  17.3.3  for patients in Canada and Section  17.3.4  for definition 
applicable for UK patients ), including: 
Blinded treatment period: 
x An up to 14-day screening period (may be extended to up to 
8 weeks in pre-specified situations [refer to Section  10.1.2 ]); 
x A 49-week blinded treatm ent period (Primary Analysis Period 
[PAP]), except for the subgroup  of pediatric patients aged 
3 to <18 years enrolling direct ly in the open-label long- term 
follow-up phase. 
Open -label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up period:

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 494 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
Sanofi Genzyme is investigating an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease called 
avalglucosidase alfa (rhGAA conjugated with synthetic bis-mannose-6-phosphate-Man6 glycan);
rhGAA is produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster Ovary) using recombinant DNAtechnology. Avalglucosidase alfa is a modification of alglucosidase alfa that results in the conjugation of a number of hexamannose structures containing 2 terminal mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) moieties to oxidized sialic acid residues on alglucosidase alfa, thereby increasing bis-M6P levels on the compound. More detailed information on the compound is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
A proportion of patients with LOPD treated with alglucosidase alfa demonstrate suboptimal 
treatment response, in particular in respiratory function, and may benefit from a potentially more 
potent treatment (avalglucosidase alfa) ( 1). The efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa in
treatment-naïve LOPD has not been evaluated in a controlled study. As there are no data on the safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in treatment-naïve pediatric LOPD patients 3 years and older, this study will be also conducted to evaluate treatment response in that population.
The benefits and risks assessment of avalglucosidase alfa for the Phase 3 EFC14028 study is 
based upon the nonclinical studies of avalglucosidase alfa in acid α-glucosidase (GAA) knockout 
mice, CD-1 mice and cynomolgus monkey studies, as  well as on the results from the clinical 
Phase 1/2 TDR12857 study (in adult treatment-na ïve LOPD patients and adult LOPD patients 
who had been treated with alglucosidase alfa prior to their study participation) and previous 
experience with alglucosidase alfa. In noncli nical studies, avalglucosidase alfa was more 
successful in reducing glycogen in muscle tissue compared to alglucosidase alfa. The safety profile of avalglucosidase alfa in both nonclinical and clinical studies has shown avalglucosidase 
alfa to be well-tolerated; AEs and IARs are mostly non-serious and usually manageable (see IBSection 7 for detailed discussion of risks). The pot ential benefits of avalglucosidase alfa, balanced 
against its known risks, support further investigati on of the safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase 
alfa across the broad spectrum of Pompe disease, including both pediatric and adult patients.
The overall objective of this study is to evaluate  the efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa in
treatment-naïve patients with LOPD as compared to alglucosidase alfa. The primary objective of 
the study is to determine the effect of avalgl ucosidase alfa treatment on respiratory muscle 
strength as measured by FVC% predicted in the upri ght position. Additional secondary objectives 
are to evaluate the safety profile of avalglucos idase alfa in treatment-naïve patients with LOPD 
and to determine the effect of avalglucosid ase alfa treatment on functional endurance (6MWT),
inspiratory muscle strength (MIP), expiratory muscle strength (MEP), lower extremity muscle strength (HHD), motor function (QMFT), and health-related quality of life (SF-12 in patients ≥18years of age). Other objectives are to determ ine the PK, exploratory PD, pharmacogenetics 
and effect of avalglucosidase alfa treatmen t on motor function (GMF M-88 and GSGC), upper 
extremity muscle strength (HHD), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and PedsQL Generic Core Scale), and patient reported outcomes (P ompe Disease Symptom Scale [PDSS], Pompe 
Disease Impact Scale [PDIS], Rasch-built Pompe- specific Activity scale [R-Pact], and Patient 
Global Impression of Change [PGIC]).

should not exceed 14 days, but could be extended to a maximum of 8 weeks in pre-specified situations (refer to Section 10.1.2 ). Patients will be observed in a 12-month blinded treatment 
phase, in which patients will receive an IV  infusion of 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa or 
alglucosidase alfa biweekly (qow). This dose regimen is supported by data from a Phase 1/2 study showing a potential avalglucosidase alfa dose res ponse after treatment for 6 months in previously 
untreated patients, with doses differentiated by improvement in FVC with avalglucosidase alfa
20 mg/kg qow versus stabilization with 5 mg/kg qow. Following the 12-month treatment period, 
patients will continue in the study in an open- label treatment period, in which all patients will 
receive an IV infusion of 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa qow for long-term follow-up.
The primary and secondary endpoint assessments selected for this study have been used in 
previous studies in patients with LOPD.
Exclusion criteria limiting the study population to LOPD patients who are able to ambulate

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
EFC14028 is a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, 12-month PAP
study comparing the efficacy and safety of aval glucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa (both at 
20 mg/kg qow) in treatment-naïve patients with LOPD ages 3 and above. The study includes an 
open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up pha se for all patients, in which patients in the 
alglucosidase alfa arm will be switched to avalgl ucosidase alfa treatment after 12 months. Patients 
will remain blinded to the randomized treatment un til after database is lo cked. Randomization will 
be in a 1:1 ratio with stratification factors base d on baseline FVC, gender, age, and country (Japan 
or ex-Japan).
At the end of the recruitment, if <4 pediatric pati ents aged 3 to <18 years are enrolled, in order to 
comply with Health Authority requirements to enroll a certain number of pediatric patients, up to 2 additional pediatric patients will be screened and enrolled directly in the open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase wh ere they will receive avalglucosidase alfa.
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient
The duration of the study for each patient will be  at least up to approximately 3 years (151 weeks)
(or 2 years [99 weeks] for the subgroup of pediatric patients aged 3 to <18 years enrolling directly in the open-label long-term follow-up phase), including:
xAn up to 14-day screening period (refer to Section 10.1.2 for extended duration in 
pre-specified situations);
xA 49-week blinded treatment period (PAP), ex cept for the subgroup of pediatric patients 
aged 3 to <18 years enrolling directly in the open-label long-term follow-up phase;
xAn up to 96-week open-label treatment period (open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term 
follow-up phase) for all patients regardless of prior randomization group; 
An extended open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up period will last up to 
144 additional weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa is approved in the patient’s country, whichever 
comes first; refer to Appendix C Section 17.3.3 for patients in Canada and Section 17.3.4 for 
definition applicable for UK patien ts) for all patients (extended open-label avalglucosidase alfa 
long-term follow-up phase). 
An up to 4-week post-treatment observation period will close the patient’s participation.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 536.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients)
The clinical trial will end when the last patient completes the last follow-up visit/contact.
6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS
No interim analysis is planned dur ing the double-blinded PAP (refer to Section 6.2.1 for the 
details of the different periods). Note that the primary analysis for the study is performed at the end of PAP, when the database will be locked a nd a study report will be produced for regulatory 
submission. The study will continue for additional 2 years (open-label long-term extension) and with an additional extension period of up to 144 additional weeks or until avalglucosidase alfa isapproved in the patient’s country, whichever comes first (refer to Appendix C Section 17.3.3 for 
patients in Canada and Section 17.3.4 for definition applicable for UK patients). A final database 
lock will occur at the end of extension period, with a corresponding final study report generated.
After the primary analysis for PAP, interim analyses may be performed during the open-label 
extension period to provide additional information for regulatory purpose.
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES
6.4.1 Data monitoring committee
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC), appointed by the Sponsor, will review 
unblinded data as outlined in the DMC charter, wh ich is maintained separately from the study 
protocol. The DMC procedures will be detailed in the DMC charter and will have to be approved 
by the DMC members.
During the course of the study, bi-annual reviews of sa fety data will be performed by the DMC. In 
addition, the DMC will review safety data on an  ad hoc basis as outlined in the DMC charter.
IARs and other events which could require consultation of allergist/immunologist will be reviewed by the DMC member who is an allergist/immunologist. Should any major safety issues arise, final decisions regarding the study will be  made by the Sponsor, taking into consideration 
the DMC opinion (as applicable).
An independent statistical center will be used to provide unblinded data to the DMC through a 
completely confidential process,  and act as liaison between the Sponsor biostatistician and the 
DMC.
6.5 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN AND CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUPS
Study EFC14028 is being conducted as a Phas e 3 multicenter, multinational, randomized, 
double-blinded study to minimize bias.
EFC14028 is a head-to-head study design to compare avalglucosidase alfa directly to 
alglucosidase alfa, which is the only available ERT for LOPD. The study will be conducted at a

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 54dose of 20 mg/kg qow, which is the recommended labeled dose for alglucosidase alfa and is 
supported based on results from nonclinical studies a nd the safety and exploratory efficacy results 
from the Phase 1 TDR12857 clinical study as being likely to result in greater glycogen depletion in skeletal muscles and clinical efficacy than al glucosidase alfa without new safety concerns.
Because avalglucosidase alfa is expected to be at least as efficacious as alglucosidase alfa, it is 
considered appropriate to test firs t for NI and then for superiority.
The primary endpoint of the EFC14028 study is % predicted FVC in the upright position, which is 
one of the same primary endpoints used in the AGLU02704 (LOTS) trial, which was the basis for 
the approval of alglucosidase alfa in LOPD. FVC is an established measure of lung capacity, and respiratory insufficiency is a major source of morbidity and death in this patient population.
A 12-month duration for the PAP should be sufficient to see a treatment difference compared to 
alglucosidase alfa and to collect safety data,  including the development of anti-drug antibody 
(ADA).

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S)
Avalglucosidase alfa, the IMP, will be supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized product in 
single-use vial containing approximately 100 mg of avalglucosidase alfa. Alglucosidase alfa(IMP) is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, white to off-white, lyophilized cake or powder in a single-use vial containing 50 mg of alglucosidase alfa.
Avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa will  be administered by IV infusion following 
reconstitution and dilution at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight qow.
Quantity of vials required for each infusion will be calculated based on the patient`s weight. The 
total amount of IMP administered may be adjusted as needed to account for changes in body weight. Most recent body weight should be used for dose calculation; weight obtained at aprevious infusion visit may be used for preparation of IMP, if obtained within a timeframe of 1 month for pediatric patients and 3 months in adult patients. Each IV infusion will be administered in a step-wise manner. The rate will be gin at a slow initial rate and will be gradually 
increased if there are no signs of IARs, until a maximum rate is reached. The infusion length will be dependent on the dose. Specific details pertaining  to the infusion volumes and rates as well as 
dose calculation, preparation, and administration of the investigational product can be found in the 
pharmacy manual.
Prior to each infusion, the patient should be assessed by the Investigator or appropriate designee 
(ie, qualified physician with the exception of  patients who receive home infusion of 
avalglucosidase alfa as outlined below under the subsection “Home i nfusion ”) to determine if the 
patient is free of acute illness and is clinically stable to receive the infusion. Infusions will be postponed (see Section 8.7.1 ) if the patient is acutely ill on the scheduled day of infusion. Any 
modification to the dose and/or frequency of dosing is  not permitted unless it is due to an AE, in 
which case it is not a protocol violation, but the Investigator must consult with the Sponsor in the 
event of a dose change. The Sponsor will consult the DMC for any dose change related to AE. Nodose increase above the maximum recommended dose of 20 mg/kg qow will be allowed for any 
patients.
Patients will be required to remain in the hospi tal or the infusion center for observation of AEs for 
1 hour after each infusion; see below for the patients receiving home infusion. Patients may be 
required to stay for a longer observation period at the Investigator’s discretion. In case the patient 
does not stay for this observation period (eg, as pa rt of contingency measures for a regional or 
national emergency that is declared by a gove rnmental agency), the Investigator (or appropriate 
designee) will contact the patient or their legally authorized representative (for pediatric patients) to ensure that no adverse event occurred during the observational period.
The study includes 2 main periods: the bli nded treatment period and the open-label 
avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase.

For all patients, all visits following V2 are calculated from day of first infusion of IMP in 14 days 
increments with a window of ±7 days for infusio ns and safety assessments and ±14 days for all 
other assessments. There should not be less than 7 days between 2 IMP infusions. 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment should be followed as scheduled.Home infusionHome infusion may be possible in the open-label extension period, where permitted by national 
and local regulations. Patients must meet the elig ibility requirements outlined below. In addition, 
the Investigator and the Sponsor must agree that home infusion is appropriate. Patient’s underlying co-morbidities and ability to adhere to  the requirements of the study need to be taken 
into account when evaluating patients for eligib ility to receive home infusion. Any identified risk 
of noncompliance to monitoring of study requirements or potential for loss to follow-up should 
lead to this patient not being eligible for home infusion.
The following criteria must be documented in the patient’s medical record:
xThe Investigator must agree in writing that home infusion is appropriate for the patient. 
xThe patient must be willing and able to comply with home infusion procedures.
xThe patient has been trained on home infusion process.

while receiving avalglucosidase alfa with no history of moderate or severe IARs for at least 12 months, and must be on a stable avalglucosidase alfa dose. In case of unexpected event that prevent infusions to be performed at site for a prolonged period, (eg, as part of 
contingency measures for a regional or national emergency that is declared by a governmental agency), with DMC agreement, the required period of 12 months with no history of moderate or severe IAR may be re duced to at least 6 months, to allow home 
infusion to be resumed sooner.
xIf this reduced period from 12 months to at least 6 months, is considered safe and after 
confirmation with the DMC (which will be documented in the Trial Master File), it will be considered as a permanent criterion after the unexpected event is resolved (eg.,contingency measures for a regional or na tional emergency that is declared by a 
governmental agency are terminated).
xNo infusion rate increases will be allowed while a patient is receiving home infusions.
xThe patient must have no ongoing (not yet recovered) SAEs that, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, may affect the patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion.
xHome infusion infrastructure, resources, an d procedures must be established and available 
according to applicable regulations (see Appendix C Section 17.3.2 for regulations 
applicable specifically in France disallow ing the option for home infusion). In exceptional 
circumstances, the Investigator may require a local vendor for home infusion services. In such circumstances, the Investigator will attest that this vendor meets the requirements to properly manage the home infusion of avalglucosidase alfa, including available resources 
and procedures.
xPatients experiencing a moderate or severe IAR while being infused at home will return to 
the study site for their following infusion and will continue to receive infusions at the site 
until the Investigator feels it is safe for the patient to resume home infusion.
xIf recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphylacti c reactions have occurred prior to start of 
home infusions or occur during home infusions, the Investigator should assess whether or not it is safe for the patient to start or to continue to be treated via home infusion.
xThe Sponsor should be notified about all IARs and consulted (as needed) if the patient 
experiences IARs suggestive of hype rsensitivity reactions (refer to Section 10.6 ).
xPrior to beginning home infusions, the home infusion agency staff, including new staff 
members, must have been trained by the site on proper procedures to administer infusions, monitor patients, document procedures, and report to site on a timely basis. Any new staff 
member must be trained by the site prior to resuming home infusions. The site must 
confirm that the home infusion agency staff has received training at least equivalent to that provided to new staff members.

8.3.1 Methods of blinding
Refer to Section 10.5 for suspected unexpected adverse drug reaction requiring unblinding by the
Sponsor.
In the double-blinded period of the study, avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa will be 
provided as open-label supplies.
For blinding purposes, the on-site preparation of avalglucosidase alfa and/or alglucosidase alfa 
will therefore be performed by an independen t unblinded pharmacist or an independent unblinded 
designee at the investigational site. The unblinded pharmacist or the unblinded designee should 
not be involved in activities that could be biased by the knowledge of the treatment assignment (eg, AE assessments, access to PD data) and will  not disclose any information to anyone and 
ensure to maintain blinding condition of the study.

via centralized treatment allocation system  (interactive response technology [IRT]).
In accordance with the double-blind design of the first blinded treatment period, study patients, 
Investigators and study site personnel, excep t for the unblinded pharmacist or the unblinded 
designee, will remain blinded to study treatmen t and will not have access to the randomization 
(treatment codes) except under circumstances described in Section 8.3.2 . The unblinded 
pharmacist or the unblinded designee is not allowe d to disclose any unblinded information to the 
blinded study site team and therefore should not  take part to any discussion regarding AE 
assessments for the patients, except to give info rmation in a blinded manner on the preparation of 
the IMP (eg, preparation steps order well followed, confirmation of the usual visual aspect of the IMP once diluted).
Additional measures will be taken to ensure bli nding of the patients (see pharmacy manual for 
details).
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study
In case of an AE, the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP is 
required for treating the patient. 
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the IRT and/or by 
calling any other phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking.
The code- breaking can also be performed by contacting the “24 -hour alert system”. A patient 
card, including the relevant “24 -hour alert system” telephone number will be provided to every 
patient who will participate in the study.
If the code is broken, the patient must withdra w from IMP administration. Please refer to 
Section 10.3 of the protocol for details on handling of patient treatment discontinuation.
At the facilities where the systemic drug concentration measurements, ADAs and selected 
biomarkers are determined, the samples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to 
unblinding of responsible bioanalysts. Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team. One programmer may be unblinded to prepare the dataset for population PK analysis. The procedure detailing the process to maintain blind beyond the programmer is described in a separate Sanofi 
quality document.
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP

allocation system/IRT. During the double-bli nd period, approximately 96 patients will be 
randomly assigned across sites to 1 of 2 treatmen t arms, avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa 
at 20 mg/kg qow in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed within each of the following 6 strata:
A) Age <18,B)Age ≥18, all genders and FVC (% predicted), Japan,
C)Age ≥18, male and FVC (% predicted) <55%, ex -Japan,
D)Age ≥18, female and FVC (% predicted) <55%, ex -Japan,
E)Age ≥18, male and FVC (% predicted) ≥55%, ex -Japan,
F)Age ≥18, female and FVC (% predicted) ≥55%, ex -Japan.
To control the number of patients with high baseline FVC (% predicted), the percent of enrolled 
patients with baseline FVC (% predicted) of 80% to 85% will be capped at 15% of the total 
population.
The treatment kit number lists are generated centra lly by the Sponsor. The IMPs (avalglucosidase 
alfa or alglucosidase alfa in blinded treatment pe riod; avalglucosidase alfa in open-label long-term 
follow-up period and in additional extension open-label follow-up) are packaged in accordance with the lists.
The IRT (centralized tr eatment allocation system) generates th e patient randomization list and 
allocates the treatment number and the corresponding treatment kits to the patients accordingly.
Investigator and assigned study site personnel will have access to blinded IRT menu/reports,
whereas the unblinded pharmacist or unblinded de signee will have access to unblinded reports.
The treatment kits will be allocated using a centralized treatment allocation system (IRT) every 
2 weeks starting at Visit 2 (Day 1/Day 2). Multiple treatment kits will be required to be used for each IMP administration.
The number of vials of avalglucosidase alfa/alglucosida se alfa to be used for each infusion will be 
calculated using the latest available body weight data. Body weight will be measured at the time points specified in Section 1.2 .
Before randomizing a patient, the Investigator or designee will have to contact the centralized 
treatment allocation system/IRT.

Investigators or other authorized persons (ie, pha rmacists or designees) are responsible for storing 
IMP provided by the Sponsor in a secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations,labeling specifications, policies, and procedures.
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control  of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in-use stability and instructions  for handling the compound should be managed 
according to the rules provided by the Sponsor.
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained.
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor designee. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure.
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards.
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner.

receiving the study drug infusion qow within a ±7-day window from the scheduled infusion datebased on V2 (Day 1/Day 2). Missed, delayed, or inco mplete infusions will be clearly documented. 
Missed doses of study treatment due to sickness, safety concerns, or for medical reasons are not protocol deviations, but must be documented for  analysis and potential impact on the study 
results. Refer to Section 10.1.7 if the missed infusion is due to a missed visit.
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments
Destruction of IMP kits (ie, used, unused or expi red) can be performed during the course of the 
study as well as at the end of the study once reconciliation has occurred.
Used vials must be kept in their original se condary packaging (box) unless unique treatment 
number is printed on the vial which will allow reconciliation to be performed by site and Sponsor representative.
In some specific cases described in the monit oring plans (blinded and unblinded), reconciliation 
may be performed by blinded monitor, as long as the blinding is maintained as per conditions detailed in the monitoring plan.
Reconciliation of IMP kits allocated dur ing patient’s double -blind period must be performed at 
the site by the unblinded pharmacist or the unblinded designee and unblinded monitor using 
treatment log forms and documented on-site IMP inventory countersigned by the unblinded pharmacist or the unblinded designee and unbli nded monitor. A written authorization for 
destruction of used and unused IMP must be provided by the Sponsor once the IMP reconciliation 
is achieved.
Destruction at the site is strongly encouraged a nd can be performed provided that the following 
requirements are met:
xSite has appropriate facilities to destroy IMP;
xSite has procedures to allow traceability of the batches and quant ities destroyed, and 
delivers the corresponding destru ction documentation/certificate; and
xSponsor has provided written authorization to destroy IMP.
In case the above requirements are not satisfied and the site cannot destroy IMP, the kits will be 
returned to Sponsor for destruction.

8.8.1 Pretreatment for patients with infusion-associated reactions
In clinical trials with alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa, some patients were pretreated 
with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. Infusion-associated reactions occurred in 
some patients even after receiving antipy retics, antihistamines, or corticosteroids.
In general, the use of pretreatment in this study is at the discretion of the Investigator. The routine 
use of pretreatment is not recommended, especially in patients with previous immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Antihistamines can mask early symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction (skin reaction), making it difficult for the infusion staff to recognize the initial signs of distress and the need to decrea se the infusion rate and/or otherwise intervene.
Refer to Section 10.6 for IAR management recommendations including pretreatments.
8.8.2 Prohibited concomitant medications
Use of immunomodulation treatments (eg, methotrexate, rituximab, immunoglobulins, and other 
immunosuppressants), either alone or in combination, that would interfere with the evaluation of the immunogenic potential of avalglucosidase alfa, is not allowed during participation in the study. In the case of administration of a prohibi ted treatment, the Sponsor must be notified, the
treatment with IMP will be discontinued, and th e patient will be asked to continue study 
assessments to the extent possible prior to study withdrawal.

9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT
9.1.1 Primary efficacy endpoint
Pulmonary function testing (PFT) will be performed locally at the time points specified in 
Section 1.2 and measured by a central laboratory. During the treatment period, the assessment will 
be completed before IMP infusion. Assessment should continue to be collected for at least up to 
Week 49, end of PAP, if the patient discontinues the treatment earlier.
The PFT administration protocol is standardize d across sites in accordance with ATS/ERS 
guidelines ( 2). Per ATS/ERS 2005 quality standards, an adequate test requires a minimum of 
3 acceptable FVC maneuvers and acceptable repe atability needs to be met for the largest and 
next-largest FVC and forced expiratory volum e in the 1st second of the FVC maneuver (FEV 1)a s  
outlined in the study manual. Patients may repeat the PFT assessment up to 3 times within the Screening Visit time window in case of failed quality as determined by the central laboratory
(refer to Section 7 for details on screening and re-screening  conditions). For each PFT assessment, 
up to 8 efforts may be performed. Patients are not allowed to use noninvasive ventilation during this assessment. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 49 in FVC 
(% predicted) in upright position. FVC will be reported in liters and percent of predicted normal values based on age, gender, race, and heig ht. Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 reference 
equations will be used for this study ( 3).
Postbaseline PFT should meet the ATS/ERS 2005 quality standards. However, if no acceptable 
efforts can be recorded during the upright position PFT with up to 8 efforts, an additional PFT may be scheduled as soon as possible no later than 45 days after this failed planned test, if this is feasible for the patient. The highest acceptable effort will be kept in the database.
In addition, if the patient did not perform the PFT at a planned visit, the patient should be 
reminded to perform the PFT as soon as possible no later than 45 days after the missed test, if it is feasible for patient to perform the test within this period.
Refer to the study specific manual for  instructions on test administration.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 709.2.2.2 Laboratory safety variables
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis (including hematology and biochemistry) 
and urinalysis. Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed by a central laboratory. These values 
will be analyzed after conversion into standard in ternational units, and international units will be 
used in all listings and tables.
Blood samples should be drawn in fasting conditions for:
xHematology: red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cell count with 
differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes), platelets.
xBiochemistry:
- Plasma/serum electrolytes: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium,
- Liver function: aspartate aminotransfe rase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total and conjugated bilirubin,
- Renal function: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid,- Metabolic panel: glucose, albumin, total proteins, total cholesterol, triglycerides,- Potential muscle toxicity: creatine kinase, creatine kinase with MB fraction, lactate 
dehydrogenase.
Urinalysis will include urine color, appearance, specific gravity, proteins, glucose, erythrocytes, 
leucocytes, ketone bodies, and pH to be assessed:
xQualitatively: A dipstick is to be performed on a freshly voided specimen for qualitative 
detection using a reagent strip.
xQuantitatively: A quantitative measurement for protein, erythrocytes, and leukocytes count 
will be required in the event that the urine sample test is positive for any of the above 
parameters by urine dipstick (eg, to confirm any positive dipstick parameter by a quantitative measurement). A urine sample will be  sent to the central laboratory for that 
purpose.
9.2.2.3 Vital signs
Vital signs include heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Vital signs are to be assessed prior to infusion, with each infusion rate change (including the start of infusion which is considered as first infusion rate change), at the 
end of the infusion and at the end of the post-infusion observation period, ie, a total of 
7 assessments. Collection windows are ±15 minutes.
9.2.2.4 Electrocardiogram variables
Standard 12-lead ECGs are recorded at the time points specified in Section 1.2 after at least 
15 minutes in the supine position using an electrocardiographic device. The following will be assessed: heart rate, rhythm, interval from start of the Q wave to the end of the S wave (QRS),

and the end of the T wave (QT), QT interval co rrected for heart rate (Q Tc) automatic correction 
evaluation (by the ECG device), QRS axis, left ventricular hypertrophy criteria, right ventricular hypertrophy criteria, repolarization charges, a nd overall cardiac impression for each patient. For 
Day 1 only, and prior to receiving IMP, 3 ECGs within 5 minutes will be performed with at least 1 minute between 2 replicates.
Each ECG consists of a 10-second recording of the 12 leads simultaneously, leading to:
xA single 12-lead ECG (25 mm/s, 10 mm/mV) pri ntout including date, time, and number of 
the patient, signature of the research physicia n, and at least 3 complexes for each lead. The 
study site cardiologist’s medical opinion and automatic values will be recorded in the 
e-CRF. This printout will be retained at the site.
xA single digital file will be stored which en ables manual reading when it is necessary 
(centralized reading of computerized ECGs); each digital file will be identified by theoretical time (day and time), real date and real time (recorder time), and patient number 
(eg, 3 digits). The digital recording, data st orage, and transmission (whenever requested) 
need to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements (such as US FDA Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 11 or EU regulation Eudralex volume 4 annex 11).
The Investigator who reads the ECGs or appropriate designee (noninvestigator physician who
reads the ECGs) should review the ECGs in a timely manner to determine if there are any safety concerns and for clinical management of the patient. In the event of any clinically significant abnormal findings that meet the definition of an AE (see Section 10.4.1 for definitions and 
reporting), the Investigator will continue to monitor the patient with additional ECGs until the 
ECG returns to baseline or the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer necessary.
In case of abnormal findings by the Investigator who reads the ECGs or appropriate designee, the 
ECG should be provided to the study site cardiol ogist for further confirmation and description of 
findings.
All ECGs will also be collected and read centrally by a third-party independent reviewer for 
analysis purposes and not for clinical management of the patient.
9.2.2.5 Physical examination
Physical examination will include, at a minimum, an assessment of the patient’s general 
appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; examinations of lymph nodes, abdomen, 
extremities/joints, neurological and mental status; heart and respiratory auscultation; peripheral arterial pulse; and pupil, knee, Achilles, and plantar reflexes. Head circumference and Tanner

Immunogenicity assessments will include the following:
xSamples will be collected from patients  for evaluation of ADA every month up to 
Week 73 and then every 3 months throughout the duration of the study. In addition, samples will be collected from all patients  at Week 2 (Day 8) and Week 52 (1 week after 
the first possible avalglucosid ase alfa infusion in patients who received alglucosidase alfa 
during the blinded treatment period) to monitor for an early antibody response in avalglucosidase alfa-treated patients. 
- Patients in the avalglucosidase alfa treatment arm will be tested for 
anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibodies and pati ents in the alglucosidase alfa treatment 
arm will be tested for anti-alglucosidase alfa antibodies; in addition, patients in the alglucosidase alfa treatment arm will also be tested for anti-avalglucosidase alfa 
antibodies at V27/W49 to get their baseline value. In the open-label follow-up phase, 
patients from the alglucosidase alfa  treatment arm who have switched to 
avalglucosidase alfa will be tested for bot h anti-alglucosidase alfa antibodies and 
anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibodies. In these patients, ADA against alglucosidase alfa 
will no longer be tested in the extended open-label follow-up phase (ie, after Week 145). Patients who remain on avalglucosid ase alfa treatment will continue to be 
tested for anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibodies. Patients who are positive for anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibodies will be  tested to determine if the antibodies 
cross-react with alglucosidase alfa.
- ADA seropositive patient serum will be assessed for neutralizing antibodies to 
avalglucosidase alfa and/or alglucosidase alfa , as appropriate, including inhibition of 
enzyme activity and uptake.
- Samples may be collected from patients a nd evaluated for IgE, complement activation, 
serum tryptase following moderate, severe, or recurrent mild IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions ( Section 10.6 ).

9.3.1.1 Gait, Stair, Gower’s M aneuver, and Chair composite functional assessment
Functional performance will be measured using th e GSGC score at the time points specified in 
Section 1.2 . During the treatment period, the assessment will be completed before IMP infusion. 
The GSGC total score can be obtained by adding the item scores of the 4 functional tests; item 
scores range from 1 to 7 for 3 items and 1 to 6 for 1 item (Arising from a chair). Total scores can vary from a minimum of 4 representing normal performance to a maximum of 27 representing the poorest functional score. The GSGC performance tes t has been validated for use with glycogen 
storage disease (GSD) type II patients and patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( 10). Each 
of the functional items is also evaluated according to the time required to complete the task.
xTime to walk 10 meters (Gait);
xTime to climb 4 stairs (Stair);
xTime to stand from sitting on the floor (Gower’s Maneuver) ;
xTime to stand from sitting position in a chair (Chair).
See the study specific manual for further details.
9.3.1.2 Gross Motor Function Measure
The GMFM-88 ( 11) will be administered at the time points specified in Section 1.2 to evaluate 
changes in motor function. During the treatment period, the assessment will be completed before IMP infusion. The GMFM-88 was developed specifically to detect quantitative changes in gross motor function. There is no age cut-off for the GMFM-88.
Of the 5 dimensions to the GMFM-88, 2 will be evaluated in this study:
xStanding (13 items);
xWalking, Running & Jumping (24 items).
Items were selected to represent motor functions typically performed by children without motor 
impairments by 5 years of age. Each item is sc ored on a 4-point Likert scale (ie, 0 = cannot do; 
1 = initiates [<10% of the task]; 2 = partially co mpletes [10% to <100% of the task]; 3 = task 
completion). The score for each dimension is expre ssed as a percentage of the maximum score for 
that dimension. Total score is obtained by addi ng the percentage scores for each dimension and

equally to the total score.
This assessment will include the expanded a nd revised Gross Motor Function Classification 
System for the GMFM-88 (GMFCS-E&R) adapted for adults ( 12). The GMFCS emphasizes 
concepts in the World Health Organizati on’s International Classification of Function ing, 
Disability and Health. Emphasis is on perform ance in home, work and community settings 
without judgments about quality of movement or prognosis for improvement. The GMFCS is a 5-level classification system consisting of Levels I to V based on self-initiated movement, with 
emphasis on sitting, transfers, and mobility. The distinctions between levels are based on functional limitations, the need for assistive mobility  devices, and to a much lesser extent, quality 
of movement, and are designed to be meaningful in daily life ( 12).
The general headings for the 5 levels are:
xLevel I Walks without limitations
xLevel II Walks with limitations
xLevel III Walks using a hand-held mobility device
xLevel IV Self-mobility with limitations; may use powered mobility
xLevel V Transported in a manual wheelchair

2 weeks between visits at the time points specified in Section 1.2 .Patients ≥18years of age at 
screening/baseline will complete this assessment.  The PDSS and PDIS are both self-administered 
questionnaires specifically designed to capture the symptoms and impacts pertinent to patients with LOPD. The PDSS contains 12 questions on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (as bad as I can imagine), while the PDIS contains 15 questions with varying scales implemented depending on question type. The data from these scales will be analyzed both separately and together as a 
composite. Since these are recall questionnaires, they can be completed by the patient anytime, 
but preferably at the same time of the day. In ca se of unavailability of the e-diary (eg, device

clinical trial. For patient s who have consented to it, the samples that are unused or left over after 
testing may be used for other research purposes (excluding genetic analysis) related to Pompe disease and other diseases than those defined in the present protocol.
These other research analyses will help to understand either disease subtypes or drug response, or 
to develop and/or validate a bioassay method, or  to identify new drug targets or biomarkers.
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers used during the study (ie, Patient ID).
They will be transferred to a Sanofi site (or a subcontractor site) which can be located outside of 
the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting patient confidentiality and personal data (see Section 14.1 ). The samples may be stored or used 
for as long as they last or are needed for research.
9.5 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS
The primary objective of the EFC14028 study is to determine the effect of avalglucosidase alfa
treatment on respiratory muscle strength as mea sured by FVC % predicted in the upright position,
as compared to alglucosidase alfa in approximately 96 patients with LOPD, male or female, aged from 3 years, and previously not treated with ERT. The PAP will be a 12-month phase from start 
of study treatment. The primary endpoint will be change in % predicted FVC from baseline to 
12 months (49 weeks).
The consensus of a survey of treaters conducted by Sanofi Genzyme highlighted respiratory 
function improvement as an ongoing unmet need in Pompe disease. In LOPD patients,

EFC14028 - avalglucosidase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80alglucosidase alfa leads to improvement in 6MWT  and muscle function with stabilization of 
decline in respiratory function. The most common cause of death in Pompe disease is respiratory 
complications of long-term decline in respiratory function.
In previous alglucosidase alfa experience from the AGLU02704 double-blind placebo-controlled 
trial in late-onset patients, the patients from the alglucosidase alfa treated arm had a mean (±standard deviation [SD]) change from baseli ne in % predicted FVC of 1.56 ±4.3 at 6 months,
demonstrating stabilization. In a subsequent study of alglucosidase alfa in 18 late-onset patients (AGLU07310), there was an average improvement of 1.8 % in FVC. More recently, a Phase 1/2trial (TDR12857) with avalglucosidase alfa in an LOPD population similar to AGLU07310 was completed, in which the mean (SD) change from  baseline in % predicted FVC was 6.2 (3.15) in 
the 3 patients previously naïve to treatment dosed with 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa or 5.2 when 
looking at the 6 patients from the 10 and 20 mg/kg treatment-naïve group. Replication of this 
preliminary clinical evidence of superiority of avalglucosidase alfa over the existing treatment of alglucosidase alfa with respect to pulmonary func tion should correlate to a clinically meaningful 
benefit in the context of the known long-term respiratory complications seen in Pompe disease.
The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of avalglucosidase alfa on change in 6MWT
distance walked, MIP and MEP % predicted, musc le strength (HHD), motor function (QMFT), 
and health-related quality of life (SF-12). In the co ntext of availability of an existing treatment, 
assessment of these endpoints is important to assu re that the new treatment is not less effective.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
It is recommended that assessments/procedures at a site visit are performed in the following order, 
if applicable:
1. Patient-reported outcomes and other questionnaires2. Physical examination (including height, body weight, head circumference, Tanner stage)
and patient interview
3. Procedures:
-E C G-P F T
4. Motor assessments5. Safety and laboratory assessments6. IMP administration
Visits that are longer due to multiple assessments or procedures (eg, motor assessments and 
multiple questionnaires) may be carried out over 2 days, consecutive or not. In any case, IMP administration will be the last procedure a nd the appropriate time needed for post-infusion
surveillance will be taken into account.

The recommended duration of the screening period  is up to 14 days but may be extended to a 
maximum of 8 weeks in the following pre-specified situations:
xOne or more of the assessments/procedures w ere not properly conducted or results were 
flawed because of a proven and tracked devi ce deficiency (eg, spirometer) or a proven and
tracked vendor deficiency (eg, courier vendor re sponsible for transferring samples from 
investigating site to central laboratory). In  this case, the test(s) will be repeated.
xAn intercurrent acute disease or event occurr ed during the screening period, which does 
not meet an exclusion criterion (see Section 7.2 ).
xUp to 4 PFTs (original plus 3 repeat test s) may be required to meet ATS/ERS quality 
criteria.
xThe study or the IMP administration is tem porarily put on hold due to a Sponsor decision 
(see Section 10.3.1 ).
FVC% predicted may be repeated up to 3 times dur ing the screening period if ATS/ERS quality 
criteria have not been met as assessed by the ce ntral laboratory. Repeat tests should not occur on 
the same day in order to allow the patient to rest.
Re-screening may be allowed as described in Section 7.2.5 .
Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none  of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for 
inclusion in the study. Randomization should be performed just before the IMP administration at 
the first treatment visit.
For the subgroup of pediatric patients aged 3 t o <18 years enrolling directly in the open-label 
long-term follow-up phase, an IRT call for enroll ment will replace the rando mization call and will 
be performed just before the IMP administrati on at the first treatment visit. Postscreening

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 98xAll AEs documented at a previous visit/contac t that are designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed by the Investigator at subsequent visits/contacts.
xIn case of any SAE, the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory results have returned to normal, or until outcome has been stabilized. This may 
imply that follow-up may continue after the pa tient has left the clinical trial and that 
additional investigations may be requested by the monitoring team. The Investigator will ensure that follow-up includes further invest igations consistent with appropriate medical 
management and patient consent to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.
xIn case of any SAE or non-serious AE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of the IMP and considered by him/her to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the monitoring team.
xThe Investigator will provide follow-up information for any SAE to the Sponsor as soon as 
it is available. The Sponsor or regulatory authorities may request additional information regarding an SAE.
xFor this study, the on-treatment period will be defined as the period from the time of first 
dose of IMP to at least 4 weeks after the last administration of the IMP. The on-treatment 
period may end earlier (ie, 2 weeks after the l ast administration of IMP) if the patient 
enrolls in another study or receives commercially available ERT. In this case the follow-upperiod may be reduced from 4 to 2 weeks. For the purposes of the study, status of ongoing and new AEs will be assessed 4 weeks afte r the last infusion, or for patients who 
discontinue early, after their last completed study visit. Any new AE or SAE that occurs 
during the 4-week follow-up period will be reported/collected in the clinical database.
xIn exceptional circumstances, if a visit is missed during the course of the study, the 
following should be followed:
- If safety assessments/procedures should have been performed during that missed visit, 
they will be performed at the next visit, even if none was planned, using unscheduledlab kits for any lab samples.
- If efficacy assessments/procedures shoul d have been performed during that missed 
visit (ie, V9/Week 13, V15/Week 25, V21/Week 37, V27/Week 49, V34/Week 61, V40/Week 73, V52/Week 97, V64/Week 121 [not applicable for pediatric patients aged 3 to <18 directly enrolled in th e open-label long-term follow-up phase],

date (which might exceed the authorized window) and will still be associated with the 
visit that was missed (see CRF completion guidelines for details regarding the CRF completion in this case). In these instances, th is will not be considered a deviation but 
should be clearly documented in the patient’ s file. Refer to Section 9.1.1 for details on 
PFT when missed.

xIn addition, if the patient did not perform the PFT at a planned visit, the patient should be 
reminded to perform the PFT test as soon as possible no later than 45 days after the missed test, if it is feasible for the patient to perform the test within this period.
10.1.9 Follow-up for patients who temporar ily or permanently discontinued the study 
treatment
xFor those patients who discontinued treatm ent prior to the scheduled Week 49 visit, 
assessments related to the primary and seconda ry efficacy and safety endpoints will be 
performed every 3 months (ie, at Week 13, 25, 37, 49) if not done previously based on original protocol schedule (ie, PFT, 6MWT , SF-12, HHD, QMFT, AE, prior/concomitant 
medications, ECG, vital signs, laboratory  tests [Urine pregnancy test (females of 
childbearing potential only), hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, ADAs (with neutralizing antibodies in ADA-positive pati ents), exploratory biomarker urine sample 
collection, exploratory biomarker DBS and p lasma sample collection, plasma sample 
collection for microRNA analyses, urine Hex4 sample collection], physical examination,body weight and height) (refer to Section 10.1.3.5 ).
xFor those patients who discontinued treatment after the scheduled Week 49 visit but before 
Week 145 visit:
- In case of permanent discontinuation: assessments corresponding to Week 145 as 
outlined in Section 10.1.4.5 will be performed if possible.
- In case of temporary discontinuation: study visits can be adapted to visits when 
laboratory and/or clinical testing are scheduled, as much as possible, as long as the assessment time windows in the study protocol are respected.
xFor those patients who discontinued treatment during the extended open-label 
avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase:
- In case of permanent discontinuation: assessments corresponding to the end of 
treatment visit as outlined in Section 10.1.5.5 and Section 10.1.7.3.5 will be performed 
if possible.
- In case of temporary discontinuation, the visits and assessments will be adapted to the 
absence of infusion of avalglucosidase alfa  until the patient resumes treatment within 
the study: study visits can be adapted and th e patient come to visits when laboratory 
and/or clinical testing are scheduled, as much as possible, as long as the assessment time windows in the study protocol are respected.

DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporaril y; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.
The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator or Sponsor to discontinue a patient
from treatment:
xThe patient was erroneously included in the study;
xThe patient experiences an intolerable or unacceptable AE;
xThe patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol;
xThe patient participates in another investigational study without the prior written 
authorization of the Sponsor;
xThe patient becomes pregnant;
xThe patient becomes lost to follow-up.
The Investigator or the Sponsor ( Section 14.2 ) terminates the study.
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s)
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consid ered by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs or if the patient becomes preg nant. Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under 
close and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judg ment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the 
occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section 7.1 andSection 7.2 ).
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, durati on should be recorded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF. Visit and assessment schedules will be adapted to the absence of infusion of IMP (refer to Section 1.2 andSection 10.1.9 ).
Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by the Investigator corresponds to 1 or more doses
not administered to the patient.
All efforts should be made to continue to follow the patients for primary and key secondary 
endpoints, after the temporary treatment discontinuation.
If any of the following AEs occur, dosing will be temporarily stopped for the specific patient who 
experienced the AE, pending ad hoc DMC review and recommendations:
xAny life- threatening AE not related to the patient’s underlying condition.
xMore than 1 AE rated severe, not related to the pa tient’s underlying condition, for which 
the relationship to treatment cannot be reasonably excluded.

except if the increased value is still in the normal range.
xAny increase in ALT or AST >3x the upper limit of normal (ULN), in the presence of total 
bilirubin >2x ULN.
xAny AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, raises significant concerns 
regarding the safety of the IMP administered dose.
If either of the following events occurs, an ad  hoc DMC review will be requested immediately:
xTwo patients develop the same  life-threatening AE (eg, anaphylactic reaction), not related 
to their underlying condition.
xAny IMP related death.
After consideration of DMC recommendations, fi nal decisions for discontinuation of study drug 
for all or selected clinical trial patients and for not dosing new patients will be made by the 
Sponsor.
In the event a significant safety concern arises, the Sponsor may immediately decide to 
discontinue study drug dosing in all clinical trial patients and to not dose new patients prior to 
receipt of a DMC recommendation. Investigational sites will be notified within 24 hours of the 
Sponso r’s notification of the event(s).
If a temporary discontinuation of study drug occurs while one or more patient is currently in their 
screening period, this screening period might be extended (see Section 10.1.2 ).
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s)
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pa tient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time.
10.3.3 List of criteria for perm anent treatment discontinuation
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the I nvestigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reason(s) for treatment discontinua tion and this should be documented in the 
e-CRF.
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG para meter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanen t discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.
Any code-breaking requested by the Investigator will lead to a permanent treatment 
discontinuation of the patient for whom the code was broken (see Section 8.3.2 ).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 10310.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation
Patients will be followed-up according to the st udy procedures specified in this protocol (see 
Section 10.1.9 ), or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed-up as specified in this 
protocol, whichever comes last.
Since the primary study comparison is based on intent-to-treat principle using all randomized 
patients with any study treatment, missing data , especially the key study assessments during the 
PAP (Week 49) may potentially lead to biased result s and challenges in assessing the treatment 
effect of the study drug. Therefore, all efforts should be made to continue to follow the patients for primary and key secondary endpoints, after a p ermanent discontinuati on of treatment, in 
addition to the 4-weeks post-treatment safety  follow-up. At the minimum, patients should be 
assessed at their regularly scheduled Week 49 visit (or as close as possible to Week 49 even if it 
may be outside of visit window) if treatment discontinuation occurred prior to that visit.
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF when considered as confirmed by documenting the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation.
Patients who permanently discontinue study trea tment and who will be switched to commercial 
alglucosidase alfa will be withdrawn from the study.
In the event that a patient dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent 
form) for a research autopsy or post mortem re search biopsy. Samples collected from these 
procedures will be used for research purposes only and data will not be included in any study analyses.
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence fo r patient withdrawal from study
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason without any effect on their care. Discontinuation of study 
treatment should be distinguished from withdra wal of consent for follow-up visits and from 
withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact follow-up, eg, medical records check. Therefore, if patients no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study and attend the remaining visits (see Section 10.3.4 ). The value of critical study data collected during their
continued involvement will be emphasized as important to the public health value of the study.
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the last visit of the 
PAP (Week 49) including a PK sample, if appropriat e, or if the patient withdraws from the study 
after the scheduled Week 49 visit, using the procedures normally planned for the last dosing day 
with the IMP (Week 145 in the open-label avalgluc osidase alfa long-term follow-up phase or end 
of treatment visit in the extended open-label av alglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase).
Patients need to be assessed 4 weeks post last infusion. However, this 4 weeks post-infusionsafety assessment may be combined with the regular scheduled visits indicated here (refer toSection 10.1.6 ).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 104Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to withdraw consent in writing.
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens of the 
e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when c onsidered as confirmed. In the medical record, 
at least the date of the withdrawa l and the reason should be documented.
For patients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws consent for follow-up, the
Investigator should make the best effort to recont act the patient (eg, contact patient’s family or 
private physician, review available registries or he alth care databases), and to determine his/her 
health status, including at least his/her vital st atus. Attempts to contact such patients must be 
documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, r eceipt 
for sending a registered letter).
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their 
primary endpoints will be considered.
Patients who have withdrawn from the study canno t be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.

AnAEis any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which doe s not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.

patient or may require medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to  be considered a medically important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive:
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:
- Allergic bronchospasm- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc).
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse- ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling)
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest
An AE of special interest (AESI) is an AE (ser ious or nonserious) of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the S ponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitor ing and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added, modified or removed during a study by protocol amendment.
AESIs will include:
xIARs:
IARs are defined as AESIs that occur during either the infusion or the observation period 
following the infusion which are deemed to be related or possibly related to the IMP. At the discretion of the Investigator, AEs occurring af ter completion of the post-infusion observation 
period that are assessed as related may also be considered IARs. Refer to Section 10.6 for
additional testing in the event a patient expe riences a moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR 
suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions and for suggested guidelines for the management of IARs.
xPregnancy:

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 106- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial. Pregnancy will be 
recorded as an AESI with immediate notification in all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria.
- Male patients will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover 
that their sexual partner is pregnant.
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.- Follow-up of the pregnancy is mandatory in a female participant or in a female partner 
of a male participant, until the outcome has been determined.
xSymptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP:
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient and defined as at least twice the 
intended dose within the protocol-defined therapeutic interval (see Section 8.1 ),
adjusted according to the tested drug.Of note, asymptomatic overdose has to be reported as a standard AE.
xClinical laboratory (change from baseline):
-A L T or AST increase of ≥3 x ULN if baseline is <ULN, or ALT or AST increase ≥2x
the baseline value if baseline is ≥ULN,
-A maximum ALT value of ≥400 IU/L or AST value of ≥500 IU/L or an increase in 
direct, indirect, or total bilirubin of ≥2 x ULN,
- Serum creatinine increase of >1.5 x the ba seline value (and final serum creatinine 
value is >ULN).
In the event of an AESI, the Sponsor will be informed immediately and within 24 hours, using the 
AE form together with the SAE complementary form to be entered in the e-CRF.
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events
xAll AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF.
xWhenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to study treatment, corrective treatment/therap y given, additional investigations performed, 
outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether th ere is a reasonable possibility that the AE 
was caused by the study treatment or by the study procedure(s).
xIf the Investigator assesses the AE related to study treatment and the Investigator cannot 
reasonably explain the AE by other factors (such as clinical state, concomitant therapy, and /or other interventions) or if the cause of the AE is unknown by the Investigator, the relationship to study treatment must be checked “Related ”by the Investigator.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 107xThe Investigator should check “Not Related ”when there is a clear alternative cause to the 
event other than the study treatment according to the Investigator.
There is 1 exception to this rule. In instances where a patient experiences an IAR (refer to 
Section 10.6 ), allergic, or anaphylactic reaction, either during infusion or postobservation period, 
each of the individual signs and/or symptoms comprising the reaction should be captured as individual AE terms.
xThe Investigator should take appropriate measure s to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have re turned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last  planned visit PP, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.
xWhen treatment is prematurely discontinued, th e patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient.
xLaboratory, vital signs, or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:
- Symptomatic and/or- Requiring either corrective treatment or consultation, and/or- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or- Defined as an AESI
Instructions for AE reporting are summarized in Table 2 .
10.4.3 Instructions for repor ting serious adverse events
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Inve stigator or any designees must immediately:
xENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay.
xAll further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is fatal or life-threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification.
xA back-up plan is available and should be used when the e-CRF system does not work.
Please refer to the Study Operations Manual for further guidance.
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the 
patient and considered by him/her to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should be reported to the monitoring team.

During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner:
xAll SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction; SUSAR), to  the regulatory authorities, independent 
ethics committee (IECs)/institutional review  boards (IRBs) as appropriate and to the 
Investigators.
xAll SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory 
authorities, according to local regulations.
Adverse events that are considered expected will  be specified by the reference safety information
(IB for avalglucosidase alfa and label for alglucosidase alfa).
The Sponsor will report all safety observations ma de during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report.
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions  (ie, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the reaction.
Testing for moderate, severe, and recurrent mild  IARs will include, if clinically indicated:
xAssessments for circulating immune complex de tection; and IgE, serum tryptase, and 
complement activation, following moderate, severe, or recurrent mild IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions.
xSkin testing if IARs are suggestive of a type I hypersensitivity reaction (IgE-mediated) as 
appropriate.
For moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the Investigator may consider the use of pretreatment 
medications (ie, antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or glucocorticoids), in addition to infusion rate 
reductions, interruptions, or even discontinuation, if necessary. Please refer to the IB(Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3) for further guid ance on the management of IARs.
Moderate, severe, and recurrent mild IARs will be discussed with the DMC. If the DMC 
recommends or suggests that a desensitization pr ocedure to the IMP could be proposed to the 
patient, in agreement with the Investigator, such a procedure may be initiated as per pharmacy 
manual guidelines. Depending on the phase of the study the patient will be in at the time of thedesensitization procedure, this one may be blinded (if the procedure is started when the patient is 
still in the double-blind phase) or unblinded (if the procedure is started when the patient is in one of the open-label phases).
If severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic re actions occur, immediate discontinuation of the 
infusion should be considered, and appropriate me dical treatment should be initiated. Severe

corticosteroids, IV fluids, and/or oxygen, when clin ically indicated. In some cases of anaphylaxis, 
epinephrine has been administered. Because of  the potential for severe infusion reactions, 
appropriate medical support measures, includi ng cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment 
especially for patients with cardiac hypertroph y and patients with significantly compromised 
respiratory function, should be readily available.
The Investigator will continue to monitor the pa tient until the parameter returns to baseline or 
until the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 11211 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
Sample size calculations are base d on the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to 
Week 49 in FVC (% predicted) upright position, with the following assumptions:
xNormal distribution for the endpoint with a common SD of 5.1% predicted, which is 
estimated based on the data from pr evious trials (AGLU02704-LOTS),
xMean treatment difference (avalglucosidase alfa –alglucosidase alfa) of 2.0% predicted,
assumed based on a conserva tive estimate when comparing studies AGLU02704-LOTS 
and TDR12857,
xA 2-sided 5% significance level,
xExpected percent of missing data = 10%,
xAn NI margin of 1.1%, which is based on the estimated alglucosidase alfa effect from the 
placebo-controlled study (AGLU02704-LOTS). The proposed margin represents approximately 50% of the lower bound of the 80% confidence interval for the 
alglucosidase alfa versus placebo treatment effect.
A total sample size of 96 (1:1 randomization ratio) will provide approximately 80% power to 
demonstrate NI of avalglucosidase alfa versus al glucosidase alfa, when the true difference 
(avalglucosidase alfa –alglucosidase alfa) is 2.0% predicted. If the NI criterion is met, a test for 
superiority will be performed. If the true difference between avalglucosidase alfa and 
alglucosidase alfa is 3.5% predicted (as suggested based on cross-study comparisons between AGLU02704-LOTS and TDR12857), the study will ha ve at least 85% power to demonstrate 
superiority of avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa.
Calculations were made using East 6.3 software.
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS
Screened patients will be defined as any pa tient who has signed the informed consent form. 
Patients treated without being randomized will not be considered as randomized and will not be included in any efficacy population.
For any patient randomized more than once, only the data associated with the first randomization 
will be used in any analysis population. The safety experience associated with any later randomization will be assessed separately.

The randomized population will include any patient who had been allocated to a randomized 
treatment arm regardless if study drug was administered.
11.3.1 Efficacy  populations
The mITT population will include randomized patients who receive at least 1 infusion (partial or 
total). The mITT population will be used for all efficacy analyses unless otherwise specified. Analyses using the mITT population will be performed according to the treatment arm allocated by randomization and not actual treatment received.
The PP population will be a subset of the mITT population who have no major protocol 
deviations that are expected to interfere with  assessments of the primary efficacy endpoint. This
population will be used for sensitivity analyses and described with more detail in the SAP.
11.3.2 Safety population
The safety population will include patients who receive at least 1 infusion (partial or total). The 
safety population will be analyzed according to which treatment was received, unless otherwise specified.
11.3.3 Extension treatment population
The extension treatment population will consist of patients who receive at least 
1 avalglucosidase alfa dose (partial or total) during the extension treatment period.
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will  use the mITT population, where patients will be 
considered to be in the treatment group to which they were randomized. Safety analyses will use the safety population, where patients will be cons idered to be in the treatment group of the 
treatment they actually received.
For all analyses, the avalglucosidase alfa treatmen t group will be compared to the alglucosidase 
alfa group. While the primary comparison of interest is at 12 months (49 weeks), all summary statistics will be computed and displayed by treatment group and each scheduled assessment time
as well. Summary statistics for continuous variables will minimally include n, mean, SD,
minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical va riables, frequencies and percentages will be

Efficacy endpoints and assessments are provided in Section 9 .
11.4.2.1 Analysis of pr imary efficacy endpoints
Refer to Section 9.1.1 for details on this endpoint.
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in FVC (% predicted) in upright position
to Week 49 will be analyzed in the mITT population using an MMRM with change from baseline as outcome variable. The MMRM model will in clude the baseline FVC (% predicted) and age 
(both as continuous variables), gender (ma le, female), treatment group, visit, and 
treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects.  An unstructured covariance matrix shared across 
treatment groups will be used to model the within-patient error and the Kenward-Roger 
approximation will be used to estimate the degr ees of freedom. The model will be fitted using 
restricted maximum likelihood. The difference betw een treatment groups will be estimated based 
on least-square means at the Week 49 visit within the MMRM model.
The primary analyses will be performed after all mITT patients have been followed for at least 
12 months after randomization. This analysis will  include all post-baseline assessments up to 
Week 49, regardless of treatment discontinuation status ; missing data will not be imputed and will 
be assumed to be missing-at-random (MAR).
The primary statistical objective is to test the NI o f avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa 
at 5% level of significance. The null and alternative hypotheses based on an NI margin of 1.1 are 
described as H

After NI is demonstrated, a test for superiority of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa 
will be performed with an ove rall 5% level of significance.
If the superiority null hypothesis of no difference between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase 
alfa is rejected, and the point estimate for the di fference favors avalglucosidase alfa, the statistical 
superiority of avalglucosidase alfa vers us alglucosidase alfa can be claimed.
The same analysis as described above will be  performed for the PP population to assess the 
robustness of the study outcome.
A US FDA-specific primary analysis will be conducted using the met hod described above for 
those patients in the mITT population 8 years of age or older in order to match the lower age range of patients in the LOTS trial of alglucosidase alfa.
Sensitivity analyses will be performe d to assess the impact of missing data.
Additional supportive analyses for the primary e fficacy endpoint will be performed, including 
subgroup analyses based on age, gender, and baseline FVC.
11.4.2.2 Analyses of seco ndary efficacy endpoints

11.4.2.3 Multiplicity considerations
The primary efficacy endpoint (FVC% predicted ch ange from baseline) will be tested for NI of
avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa first. After the NI is demonstrated, the superiority of the avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase al fa will be tested with the same overall 5% 
significance level.
After the superiority of avalglucosidase alfa vers us alglucosidase alfa is demonstrated on the 
primary efficacy endpoint, the hypothesis testin g for the secondary efficacy endpoints will 
proceed in a hierarchical fashion using the closed testing principle, and will stop if significance level of 5% is not achieved. Testing will proceed according to the following sequence:
1. 6MWT change from baseline to Week 49 (superiority test),2. % predicted change from baseline to Week 49 for MIP (superiority test),
3. % predicted change from baseline to Week 49 for MEP (superiority test),
4. HHD (lower extremity summary score) change from baseline to Week 49 (superiority 
test).
Analysis of additional secondary endpoints will be considered for supportive purposes.

immunogenicity testing
Percentage of patients who seroconverted to avalglucosidase alfa, time to seroconversion and peak 
anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibody titer will be summarized by treatment group using summary 
statistics. Anti-avalglucosidase alfa antibody ti ter values will be summarized using summary 
statistics at each study visit. All data will  be presented in listings for each patient.
By patient listings will also display results of ne utralizing antibody, circulating immune complex, 
anti-avalglucosidase alfa IgE antibody, serum tr yptase activity, complement activation, and skin 
testing performed. Descriptive summaries may also be provided as appropriate.
11.4.5 Analyses of pharmacokineti c and pharmacodynamic variables
The list of PK parameters is listed in Section 9.3.2.4 .
Pharmacokinetic exposures (C maxand AUC 0-last) for avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa 
may be determined using non-compartmental analysis . If data allows, total body clearance of a 
drug (CL), and Vss will be determined. If data do not lend to non-compartmental analysis, 
model-based approaches such as nonlinear mixed effects modeling may be used. Values will be reported for individual patient s and summarized us ing descriptive statistics by study week as 
appropriate.
To evaluate the effect of immunogenicity on the PK of avalglucosidase alfa, pre-dose 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibody titers for each patient will be analyzed 
graphically with respect to PK parameter for Week 1 (Day 1/Day 2), Week 13, Week 25,
Week 37, and Week 49. If relationships are apparent , further quantitative/statistical analysis may 
be performed (eg, statistical significance, correlation coefficients).
Pharmacodynamic endpoints as described in Section 9.3.4 will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics at each scheduled study visit. Observed  measurements as well as change from baseline 
will be summarized. If a linear  trend in the change of a PD endpoint is observed, longitudinal 
model may be employed to model change from  baseline over time. In  addition, 95% confidence 
intervals of changes will be presented.
Urine Hex4 levels normalized by creatinine will be  summarized using descriptive statistics at each 
scheduled study visit. Observed measurements as well as change from baseline will be summarized. If a linear trend in the change of ur ine Hex4 levels is observed, a longitudinal model 
may be employed to model change from baseline  over time. In addition, 95% confidence intervals 
of changes will be presented.
Correlation between PK endpoints and Hex4  levels may be explored as appropriate.
Similar analyses may be carried out to explore the relationship between other PD endpoints, 
biomarkers, efficacy assessments, and exploratory endpoints.

Refer to Section 9.3.5 for details on these endpoints.
The 18 questions for the R-PAct will be scored according to the 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to 
perform without difficulty) Likert scale and will  have a descriptive analysis by treatment group.
Scores for the PDSS and PDIS will be calculated separately for each questionnaire, as well as a 
composite score for both questionnaires together. Th e analysis will be descriptive and separated 
by treatment group.
Further details on the scoring algorithms will be provided in the SAP.
PGIC total score will be summarized descrip tively by treatment group at each of the scheduled 
visits. Correlation of PGIC and primary and key secondary endpoints will be explored. 
11.5 INTERIM ANALYSIS
No interim analysis is planned dur ing the double-blinded PAP (refer to Section 6.2.1 for the
details of the different periods). Note that the primary analysis for the study is performed at the end of PAP, when the database will be locked a nd a study report will be produced for regulatory 
submission. The study will continue for additional 2 years (open label long-term extension) and an additional extension period of up to 144 additional weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa isapproved in the patient’s country, whichever comes first; refer to Appendix C Section 17.3.3 for 
patients in Canada and Section 17.3.4 for definition applicable for UK patients) and a final 
database lock will occur at the end of extension period, with a corresponding final study report generated.
After the primary analysis for PAP is completed, interim analyses may be performed during the 
open-label extension period to provide addition al information for regulatory purpose. However, 
those additional analyses after PAP will be cons idered for supportive purpose and no significance 
level will be allocated to for analyses after the completion of PAP.

17.1 APPENDIX A: GUIDANCE ON CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS AND COLLECTION OF 
PREGNANCY INFORMATION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCB)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).
Women in the following categor ies are not considered WOCBP
1. Premenarchal
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
- Documented hysterectomy- Documented bilateral salpingectomy- Documented bilateral oophorectomy.
3. Postmenopausal female
- A postmenopausal state is de fined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement th erapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. 
- Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonhormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment.
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE
Male patients
xMale participants with female partners of ch ildbearing potential are eligible to participate 
if they agree to ONE of the following (during the protocol-defined time frame in Section 6.2 ):
- Are abstinent from penile-vaginal interc ourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent
- Agree to use a male condom plus partner us e of a contraceptive method with a failure 
rate of <1% per year as described in Table 3 when having penile-vaginal intercourse 
with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant

xRefrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and for 1 month after the last 
dose of study treatment
xFemale participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use 
a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table 3 .

Vasectomized partner
A vasectomized partner is a highly effectiv e contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been co nfirmed. If not, an additional highly effe ctive method of contraception should be 
used.
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly e ffective method only if defined as refr aining from heterosexual intercourse during th e 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. Th e reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relati on to 
the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Us e should be consiste nt with local regul ations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for pa rticipants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the efficacy of the contrac eptive 
method. In this case, TWO highly effective me thods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at l east 1 month, 
corresponding to time need ed to eliminate study tr eatment after the last do se of study treatment. 
COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION
Male patients with partners of reproduc tive potential who become pregnant 
xThe Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies only to patients who receive study treatment. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female pa rtner directly, the Investigator will record

24hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. Partner will also be followed to determine 
the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any te rmination of the pregnancy will be reported 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absenc e of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
Female patients who become pregnant 
xThe Investigator will collect pregnancy infor mation on any female patient, who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a participant ’s
pregnancy. Participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow-up information on participant and neona te, which will be 
forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date.
xAny termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for proce dure. Any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is 
always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any SAE occurring as a result of a poststudy pregnancy which is considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the Investigator, will be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 10.4.3 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.
xAny female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
temporarily discontinue study treatment.

17.3.1 Sweden
Provided an addendum to the protocol applicable  only in Sweden with recommendations related 
to contraception and pregnancy testing in line with the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance 2014.
www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-
About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf
The aim of this document was to supplement as part of the protocol the definitions of women of 
childbearing potential and fertile men and the list of birth control methods which may be considered as highly effective.
Definition of Women of Childbearing Potential and of Fertile Men
For the purpose of this document, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), 
ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical 
cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used 
to confirm a postmenopausal state in wome n not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.
For the purpose of this document, a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently 
sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.
Birth Control Methods Which May Be Considered As Highly Effective
For the purpose of this guidance, methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year 
when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods. Such methods include:
xcombined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (1):
- oral- intravaginal- transdermal
xprogestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (1):
- oral

1. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may 
reduce the efficacy of the contraception method (see section 4.3 in the CTFG guidance).
2. Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user 
dependency.
3. Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial particip ant and that the vasectomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success.
4. In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method 
only if defined as refraining from heterosexu al intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatments. The reli ability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.
17.3.2 France
Consistent with the French Health Authority position disallowing home infusion for all ERTs, the option for home infusion added in EFC14028 amended protocol 03 does not apply in France.
17.3.3 Canada
Due to operational challenges with the use of the HHD in Canada, several measures assessed with this device will be missing. Therefore, thes e assessments (HHD in lower extremity muscle 
strength [see Section 9.2.1.3 ] and HHD in upper extremity muscle strength [see Section 9.3.1.3 ])
will no longer be required in stud y participants in Canadian sites.
For enrolled patients wishing to start commercial treatment with avalglucosidase alfa in Canada 
after their participation in the EFC14028 study, and to avoid a treatment gap between the end of 
treatment visit of the EFC14028 study and the possi bility to start commercial treatment with 
avalglucosidase alfa, the duration of study particip ation of patients in Canada is defined as 
follows:
An extended open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up period will last up to 144 
additional weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa is commercially available in Canada, whichever 
comes first) for all enrolled patients in Canada  (extended open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-

Major changes specific to this global amendment include the following:
Protocol amendment summary of changes table
Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale
Clinical Trial Summary, 
Sections 4, 7.1, and 7.2.1 Change to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Inclusion criteria I01 and exclusion criteria E08 
were reworded and E06 was modified. I01. and E08. were reworded in order to 
comply with local requirements regarding age 
of minors and adults. E06. was modified to allow more severely compromised patients into the study by 
reducing the lower cutoff for % predicted FVC 
from 40% to 30%. 
Clinical Trial Summary, 
Sections 1.1, 8.4, and 11.1  Change to the sample size; sample size was 
increased from approximately 86 to approximately 96. Sample size was increased from 
approximately 86 to approximately 96 as a result of modification to the exclusion criteria for % predicted FVC (the primary efficacy 
endpoin
t) and using a more conservative 10% 
estimate for missing data.

were included:
xMinor editorial changes to spelling, punctuation, grammar, and syntax.
xTable of contents was updated.
xFlow charts were updated to reflect the study procedures in Section 10 and to clarify that 
AEs and concomitant medication use information are to be collected at each visit to assure 
that information is kept up to date.
xSections, table footnotes and citation s, and references were renumbered.

consent form to start of study treatment) should not exceed 14 days, but could be extended to a maximum of 8 weeks in pre-specified situations (refer to Section 10.1.2).
xAdded details of re-screening: Patients may be re-screened once if their clinical condition
changes. Patients who were screen failed  because their FVC% predicted was >85% may 
be re-screened only if a clinically relevant  worsening respiratory condition related to 
Pompe Disease and not related to intercurrent  illness as assessed by the Investigator
occurs. In case of re-screening, the patient will  be first screened failed in the IXRS, will 
sign a new written informed consent form and a new patient number will be provided. All screening assessments/procedures will have to be performed again, except GAA and ACE 
genotyping.
xPFT details updated: Patients may repeat the assessment once up to three times within the 
Screening Visit time window in case of fail ed quality as determined by the central 
laboratory.
xClarification in the ADA tests was provided: Pa tients in the neoGAA treatment arm will 
be tested for anti-neoGAA antibodies and patien ts in the alglucosidase alfa treatment arm 
will be tested for anti-alglucosidase alfa antibodies. In the open label follow-up phase, patients from the alglucosidase alfa treatment arm who have switched to neoGAA will be tested for both anti-alglucosidase alfa anti bodies and anti-neoGAA antibodies. Patients 
who remain on neoGAA treatment will continue to be tested for anti-neoGAA antibodies. Patients who are positive for anti-neoGAA antibodies will be tested to determine if the antibodies cross-react with alglucosidase alfa.
17.4.3 Amended protocol 03: 10 Apr 2019
This amended protocol 03 is considered to be  substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the Eu ropean Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.
Overall Rationale for the AmendmentGlobal changes
xIn order to allow study participants to continue to receive the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) after Week 145, the study is extended to an additional period of up to 144weeks (or until avalglucosidase alfa is a pproved in the patient’s country, whichever 
comes first; refer to Appendix C Section 17.3.4 for definition applicable for UK patients).
xEnrollment of patients aged 3 to <18 years in the study has been challenging, mainly due 
to exclusion criterion related to respiratory function (requirements that FVC% predicted 
≤85%). At the end of the recruitment, if <4 patients aged 3 to <18 years are enrolled, in 
order to comply with Health Authority requirements to enroll a certain number of pediatric patients, up to 2 additional pediatric patients  will be enrolled directly in the open-label 
avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase  where they will receive avalglucosidase 
alfa.

xLanguage is added in the ‘randomization code -breaking during the study’ section, to 
document that an unblinded programmer will prepare the dataset for population PK analysis.
xThe statistical section is updated. Removed non-inferiority test of 6MWT from the testing 
order and used superiority instead for sec ondary endpoint of 6MWT in accordance with 
feedback from regulatory agency. Also, added superiority test of MEP to the hierarchical testing and updated definition of safety population. 
xThe mRNA test is removed since this test is not performed.
xClarifications are given regarding the condi tions for temporary IMP discontinuation with 
DMC consultation (eg, in case of abnormal liver function test).
xCollection of dry blood spot has been added for determination of exploratory biomarkers 
in addition to samples of urine and plasma to  develop alternative assays and potentially 
reduce blood volume needed for testing in future.
Canadian-specific requirement
xDue to operational challenges with the use of the hand-held dynamometers (HHD) in 
Canada, several measures assessed with these devices will be missing. Therefore, these 
assessments (HHD in lower extremity muscle strength, HHD in upper extremity muscle strength) will no longer be required in study participants in Canadian sites.
France-specific requirement

Section # and Name Description and Change Brief Rationale
Clinical Trial Summary Added the following description ‘an additional 
extension period of up to 144 weeks (or until 
avalglucosidase alfa is approved in the 
patient’s country, whichever comes first; refer to 
Appendix C Section 17.3.4 for definition applicable for UK patients) will include 
bi-weekly visits (study drug infusion, adverse 
events (AEs) check and vital signs) as well as 
less frequent visits for other assessments 
(every 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 
48 
weeks). At the end of this period, the end of 
study visit/contact will be performed. 
If at the end of the recruitment, <4 pediatric 
patients aged 3 to <18 years are enrolled, up to 
2 additional pediatric patients will be enrolled directly in the open-label avalglucosidase alfa 
long-term follow-up phase where they will 
receive avalglucosidase alfa. 
For this subgroup of pediatric patients, the 
study will comprise 52 visits including the 
Screening Visit (V1: Day -14 to Day -
1) and the 
Enrollment Visit V2 (Day 1/Day 2); V3 (1 week after V2) through V52 for study drug infusion, PK, safety assessment, and efficacy 
evaluations in the open-label avalglucosidase 
alfa long-term follow-up phase; an additional 
extension period of up to 144 weeks (or until 
avalglucosidase alfa is approved in the 
patient’s country, whichever comes first; refer to 
Appendix C Section 17.3.4 for definition 
applicable for UK patients) will include 
bi-weekly visits (study drug infusion, AE checks 
and vital signs) as well as less frequent visits for other assessments (every 4 weeks, 12 
weeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks). At the end 
of this period, the end of study visit/contact will 
be performed. 
For all patients, all visits following V2 are 
calculated from day of first infusion of IMP in 14-
day increments with a window of ±7 days for 
infusions and safety assessments and ±14 days for all other assessments.’ To maintain internal consistency with other

for patients to remain in the hospital or in 
the infusion center for the observation period related to onset of AEs was 
revised from 2 hours to 1 hour with the 
following text:: 
“In case the patient does 
not stay for this observation period (eg, 
as part of contingency measures for 
a regional or national emergency that is 
declared by a governmental agency), the Investigator (or appropriate designee) will contact the patient 
or their 
legally authorized representative (for pediatric patients)  to ensure that no 
adverse event occurred during the 
observational period.”  Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, 
the observation period after the infusions 
were performed at the study site or 
infusion center was shortened or skipped 
for patient’s safety reasons. Also to 
lighten this period after the end of the 
pandemic and in order to obtain 
information in case this observation period is not performed, the observation 
time after the e
nd of infusion is reduced to 
1 hour. 
Section 1.2.1 Blinded treatment period; 
Section 9.2.2.7 Immunogenicity Information related to the assessment 
related to ADA (with neutralizing 
antibodies in ADA-positive patients)s, u 
was revised to add the following 
information: “In addition, patients in the 
alglucosidase alfa treatment arm will 
also be tested for anti-avalglucosidase 
alfa antibodies at V27/W49 to get their 
baseline value”.  To get the same level of information from 
patients receiving alglucosidase alfa treatment as compared with patients receiving avalglucosidase alfa treatment during the blinded treatment period. 
Section 8.1 Investigational medicinal

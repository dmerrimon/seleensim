4.4 S TUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase 3b single-arm, open -label multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
vedolizumab 300 mg intravenous ( IV) infusion over a 26-week treatment period using 
ileocolonoscopy for the assessment in subjects with moderately to severely active CD (Study 
Part A) followed by a 26-week treatment extension period (Part B). Biopsies will be collected for 
histological assessments per the schedule of events for all subjects. The study will be conducted 
at sites in North America and Europe. The 26-week treatment extension (Study Part B) is 
included as part of Protocol Amendment No. 04 (dated 27 April 2016), ongoing subjects at the 
time of the amendment will have the option to either stop treatment at Week 26 (Study Part A) or 
continue treatment into Part B. Subjects who enroll into the study after Protocol Amendment No. 
04 will be treated directly for 52 weeks (Study Parts A and B). 
Approximately 100 subjects with moderately to severely active CD who have failed treatment 
with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or biologics will be enrolled. Subjects who are 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist naïve as well as those who are TNF-α antagonist 
failures will be included, such that approximately 50% of enrolled subjects are TNF-α antagonist 
naïve.  
The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 26-week treatment period (Study Part A),  
followed by a 26-week extension treatment period (Part B from 7 days after Week 26 to 52 with 
last dose at Week 46), and an 18-week follow-up period following the last dose. The duration of 
the study will be approximately 44 weeks for subjects completing Study Part A and 70 weeks for 
subjects completing Study Part B. All subjects included in the study will also have a 6 month

 safety follow-up telephone call following last dose. End of trial will be the date of the last visit of 
the last subject at the Postdose 18 Week Safety Follow-up visit. 
Subjects that meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be dosed on 
site with vedolizumab 300 mg IV. Subjects will visit the site for dosing at Day 1, Weeks 2, 6, 14, 
and 22 for Study Part A and at Weeks 30, 38, and 46 for Study Part B. Ileocolonoscopy will be 
pe
rformed at the Screening, Week 14, Week 26 (Study Part A), and Week 52 (Study Part B) or 
early termination (ET) visits. Biopsies will be taken during the Screening, Week 26 (Study Part 
A), and Week 52 (Study Part B) or ET visit. All ileocolonoscopies will be evaluated by a blinded 
central reader.  
An MREn substudy will be conducted at selected qualified centers using a standardized magnetic 
resonance ( MR) acquisition and procedure to assess bowel wall activity. Only subjects from the 
pre-selected sites will be included in this study; these subjects will undergo an MREn assessment 
at the Screening, Week 26 (Study Part A), and Week 52 (Study Part B) or ET visit, unless they 
have contraindications to the procedure. All MREn results will be evaluated by a blinded 
independent central reader. 
Additional procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Appendix A ).

 7.0 MET HODS OF ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION 
7.1 G ENERAL PRINCIPLES  
Where appropriate, variables will be summarized descriptively by study visit and subgroups. For 
categorical variables, counts and proportions will be tabulated. Percentages will be calculated out 
of the total number of patients in the analysis set and by subgroups, when applicable. 
Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place. Every effort will be made to limit the amount 
of missing data; however, if any missing data is present in the clinical database, a Missing 
category will be added in the tabulation, unless otherwise stated. 
For continuous variables, the number of subjects with non-missing values, mean, median, 
standard deviation ( SD), minimum, and maximum values will be tabulated. Means and medians 
will be presented to 1 more decimal place than the recorded data. The SDs will be presented to 2 
more decimal places than the recorded data. Confidence intervals about a parameter estimate will 
be presented using the same number of decimal places as the parameter estimate. 
All confidence intervals will be reported as 2-sided and will be assessed at the α=0.05 
significance level. No inferential statistics are planned for this study. 
The data summaries will be accompanied by individual subject data listings. 
A windowing convention will be used to determine the analysis value for a given study visit for 
observed data analyses. Details are provided in section  7.1.5. 
All statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS System® Version 9.2, or higher. 
7.1.1 Study Terms and Definitions 
Study terms and definitions are provided below. 
Term  Definition  
Endoscopic Remission  SES-CD score ≤ 4  
Complete Mucosal Healing  Absence of ulcerations  
Endoscopic Response  SES-CD reduction by ≥ 50%  
Clinical Response  CDAI decrease from baseline of ≥ 100 points  
Clinical Remission  CDAI ≤ 150 points  
7.1.2 Definition of Study Days 
Study Day 1 is defined as the date on which a subject is administered their first dose of the 
medication, as recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) dosing page. Other study days 
are defined relative to the Study Day 1 with Day 1 being Study Day 1 and Day -1 being the day 
prior to Study Day 1. 
All protocol-specified study visit dates are defined relative to Study Day 1 (for example, the date 
for the scheduled Week 2 Visit should be Study Day 15). 
7.1.3 Definition of Baseline Values 
Unless otherwise specified, baseline values are defined as the last observed value before the first 
dose of study medication. Values measured on Day 1 must be prior to administration of study 
medication to be classified as Baseline.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of Takeda without a confidentiality agreement.  
 7.1.4 Definition of Screen Failure 
Screen failure subjects are subjects who signed the informed consent and were not enrolled in the 
study. The primary reason for screen failure is collected in the eCRF using the following 
categories: 
 Pretreatment Event (PTE)/AE 
 Did Not Meet Entrance Criteria 
 Significant Protocol Deviation 
 Lost to Follow-Up 
 Voluntary Withdrawal 
 Study Termination 
 Other 
7.1.5 Definitions of Study Visit Windows 
Day 1 will be analyzed as Day 1, provided that the date of the assessment matches the date of the 
first dose of study drug. Assessments recorded as Day 1 on the eCRF but occurring prior to the 
date of first dose will be windowed to Baseline. 
Unless otherwise specified the rules provided below in Table 7.a, Table 7.b , Table 7.c, and Table 
7.d will be used for all variables. The lower and upper bounds of each window are the 
approximate midpoints between the scheduled days for the current visit and its adjacent 
scheduled visits. The value used in analysis for by-visit summaries is the value within the 
specified window. If a patient has more than one measurement within an analysis window, the 
assessment closest to the target day will be used. In case of ties between observations located on 
different sides of the target day, the later assessment will be used in analyses. In case of ties 
located on the same side of the target day (i.e., more than one value for the same day), the mean 
of the values will be used for continuous parameters and the worst result will be chosen over a 
more positive one for categorical parameters (i.e., an abnormal electrocardiogram [ECG] value 
will be chosen over a normal ECG value).  
For safety measurements (laboratory tests and vital signs), descriptive statistics are presented for 
each scheduled visit including the Final Visit. Final Visit during the Treatment Period will be 
defined as the last visit (inclusive of both scheduled and unscheduled) which falls between 
Baseline and Week 26 or date of early termination, whichever comes first, using the visit 
analysis windows defined above. Final Visit during the Treatment Extension Period will be 
defined as the last visit (inclusive of both scheduled and unscheduled) which falls just after 
Week 26 and up to Week 52 or date of early termination, whichever comes first, using the visit 
analysis windows defined above. 
Data identified on the eCRF as coming from an “unscheduled” visit will be eligible for 
windowing and Final Visit summaries. There will not be a separate “unscheduled” categorization 
for the reporting of these observations. 
The visit windows and applicable study day ranges are presented below for study.

7.1.6 Convention for Calculation of SES- CD Scores 
The SES-CD has been shown to be comparable to the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of 
Severity and a straightforward scoring system for Crohn’s disease [ 2]. The overall SES-CD score 
ranges from 0 to 56 and is the sum of 4 variables (i.e., size of ulcers [cm], ulcerated surface [%], 
affected surface [%], and presence of narrowing) across 5 bowel segments (i.e., rectum, 
descending and sigmoid colon, transverse colon, ascending colon, and ileum). Each variable is 
coded from 0 to 3 based on severity, where 0 is none or not severe and 3 is the most severe case, 
with the sum of the scores for each variable ranging from 0 to 15, except for presence of 
narrowing. Presence of narrowing ranges from 0 to 11 since a severity of 3 represents a 
narrowing which a colonscope cannot be passed and, thus, can only be observed once among the 
bowel segments. The segmental SES-CD score is the sum of the 4 variables for each bowel 
segment and can range from 0 to 12, where each individual variable score ranges from 0 to 3 (see 
Appendix B ). 
7.1.7 Convention for Calculation of CDAI Scores 
The CDAI score is the summation of 8 components, including number of liquid or very soft 
stools, abdominal pain, general well-being, extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease, 
Lomotil/Imodium/opiates for diarrhea usage, abdominal mass, hematocrit level, and body weight 
(see Appendix C ). 
Number of liquid or very soft stools, abdominal pain, and general well-being are self-reported 
via subject electronic diary entries. To calculate subscores at each visit, the diary data from the 
10 days prior to the date of CDAI calculation were used and the following rules were applied: 
1. Take the 7 most recent days of diary data prior to the date of CDAI calculation. If the 
CDAI analysis visit is Screening and less than 7 days of data are present, a subscore 
cannot be calculated. 
2. For number of liquid or very soft stools only, if any of the 7 most recent days of diary 
data have stool frequency values greater than 24, set the value for the stool record for that 
day to missing. 
3. If less than 4 non-missing results remain, the subscore cannot be calculated, and the 
subject will be categorized as a non-responder. Otherwise, calculate the subscore by 
summing the values, dividing by the number of non-missing records included in the 
summation, and multiplying by the factor appropriate for the given subscore. 
a. For stool, the factor is 2. 
b. For abdominal pain, the factor is 5.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

 c. For general well-being, the factor is 7. 
Table 7.e provides examples of calculated CDAI scores using various eDiary scenarios 
(excluding eligibility). Table 7.f provides examples of calculated CDAI scores using various 
eDiary scenarios for eligibility. Patient diaries can be completed 14 days prior to the eligibility 
visit. Any on -study colonoscopies and/or MREn are taken into account such that the diary data 
from the day prior, day of, and day after are excluded from the visit’s CDAI calculation.

In addition to the subscores originating from the subject electronic diary entries, subscores for 
extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease, usage of Lomotil/Imodium/opiates for 
diarrhea, abdominal mass, hematocrit level, and body weight are calculated. 
Extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease include arthritis/arthralgia, iritis/uveitis, 
erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum/aphthous stomatitis, anal fissure fistula, or abscess,

 other fistula, and fever over 37.8 °C during the past week. The total number of extra- intestinal 
manifestations is summed and multiplied by a factor of 20. 
If a subject used Lomotil/Imodium/opiates for diarrhea, they have a subscore of 30. Otherwise, 
their usage of Lomotil/Imodium/opiates for diarrhea subscore is 0. 
For a definite, questionable, or no abdominal mass, a subject receives a subscore of 50, 20, or 0, 
respectively. 
Hematocrit results are subtract ed from 47 for males and from 42 for females to obtain the 
hematocrit subtotal. The hematocrit subtotal is then multiplied by a factor of 6 to determine the 
hematocrit subscore. If the hematocrit subtotal is 0, the hematocrit subscore is also 0. 
Lastly, the body weight subscore is obtained with the following formula: 
[1 − (Body Weight
Standard Weight)]×100 
where standard weight is calculated as (height in m)2×22.1 for males and (height in m)2×20.8 
for females. If the body weight subscore is < -10, the body weight subscore is set to -10. 
To calculate the total CDAI score for a study visit, sum all 8 component subscores at that 
particular study visit. If any of the 8 subscores are missing, the total CDAI score cannot be 
calculated for that study visit. 
7.1.8 Conventions for Missing Adverse Events Dates 
Every effort will be made to determine the actual onset date for the event or to obtain a reliable 
estimate for the onset date from the investigator. 
For AEs or SAEs, a missing or incomplete onset date will be imputed according to the following 
conventions: 
1. If an onset date is missing, the derived onset date will be calculated as the first non-
missing valid date from the following list (in order of precedence): 
 First study medication date 
 Informed consent date (for SAEs only) 
2. If an onset date is incomplete, the derived onset date will be calculated following: 
 Missing day, but month and year present: the day will be imputed as the 15th of the 
month. If the month and year are equal to the month and year of the first study 
medication dose and the first study medication dose occurs after the imputed date, the 
derived onset date will be set equal to the first study medication date. If the AE end 
date occurs prior to the imputed date, the derived onset date will be set equal to the 
AE end date. 
 Missing day and month, but year present: the day and month will be imputed as the 
30th June of the year. If the year is equal to the year of the first study medication dose 
and the first study medication dose occurs after the imputed date, the derived onset

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of Takeda without a confidentiality agreement.  
 date will be set equal to the first study medication date. If the AE end date occurs 
prior to the imputed date, the derived onset date will be set equal to the AE end date. 
 If the imputed AE onset date occurs after the database lock date, the imputed AE 
onset date will be imputed as the database lock date. 
For AEs or SAEs, a missing or incomplete end date will be imputed according to the following 
conventions: 
1. If an end date is missing, the derived end date will be imputed as the last assessment date, 
assuming that the last assessment occurs after the AE start. If the last assessment occurs 
prior to the AE start date, the derived end date will be imputed as the AE start date. 
2. If an end date is incomplete, the derived end date will be calculated following:  
 Missing day, but month and year present: the day will be imputed as the last date (for 
example February 2009 will be imputed as 28 February 2009) of the month. 
 Missing day and month, but year present: the day and month will be imputed as the 
31st December of the year. 
 If the imputed AE end date occurs after the database lock date, the imputed AE end 
date will be imputed as the database lock date. 
7.1.9 Conventions for Missing Concomitant Medications Dates 
Start and stop dates for all concomitant medications are collected on the eCRF. However, in case 
of missing or partial information in these dates, the following rules will be used: 
If the start date is missing or partial: 
 If the day is missing, the start day will be the first day of the month.  
 If the month is missing, the start month will be the month corresponding to 90 days prior 
to the first study medication date. 
 If the year is missing, the start year will be the minimum of the year of the first clinic 
visit or the year of the informed consent date. 
 If the entire date is missing, the start date will be the date of first study drug 
administration.  
If the stop date is missing, partial or “continuing”: 
 If the day is missing, the stop day will be the last day of the month reported. 
 If the month is missing, the stop month will be the month during which the last dose of 
treatment was administered. 
 If the year or the entire date is missing or if the medication is “continuing”, the stop year 
will be the year in which the last dose of treatment was administered. 
7.1.10 Conventions for Missing Previous Medications Dates 
No dates will be imputed for previous medications.

Printed or downloaded documents must be verified against the effective version.  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of Takeda without a confidentiality agreement.  
 7.1.11 Conventions for Calculation of Duration of CD 
Duration of CD is calculated as the number of years from CD diagnosis date to first dose date: 
1 + date first dose − date diagnosis
365. 25 
The duration of CD will be included in the baseline CD characteristics listing. If the date CD was 
diagnosed is partially missing, the following rules will take effect: 
 Missing day, but month and year are present: the day will be imputed as the 15th day of 
the month. 
 Missing day and month, but year is present: the day and month will be imputed as 30th 
June of the year. 
7.1.12 Calculation of Body Mass Index 
BMI will be calculated as the ratio of patient’s weight (in kilograms) to the square of the 
patient’s height (in meters): 
BMI (kg
m2) =weight (kg)
[height (m)]2 
7.1.13 Methods for Handling of Missing Efficacy Data 
Through the end of the treatment period, the missing efficacy data will be handled as follows: 
 Missing data for dichotomous (i.e., proportion-based) endpoints will be handled using the 
non-responder imputation method, i.e. any subject with missing information for 
determination of endpoint status will be considered as a non-responder in the analysis.  
 Missing data for continuous endpoints will be imputed using last available post-baseline 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method. 
7.2 A NALYSIS SETS 
 The Study Part A analyses will be performed on the following analysis sets: 
 The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug. 
 The FAS-MREn is the FAS within the MREn substudy. 
 The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS and consists of all subjects 
who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the study 
outcome significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject from the PPS are 
listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints using the 
PPS population may be provided as part of a sensitivity analysis. 
 The PPS-MREn is a subset of the FAS-MREn and consists of all subjects who do not 
violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the study outcome 
significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject from the PPS-MREn are

 listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analyses for the MREn endpoints using the PPS-MREn 
population may be provided as part of a sensitivity analysis. 
The Study Part B analyses will performed on the following analysis sets: 
 The FAS-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS who consented to Part B. 
 The FAS-MREn-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS-MREn who consented to 
Part B. 
 The PPS-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS-Extension and consists of all 
subjects who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the 
study outcome significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject from the 
PPS-Extension are listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analysis for the primary and secondary 
endpoints using the PPS-Extension population may be provided as part of a sensitivity 
analysis. 
 The PPS-MREn-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS-MREn -Extension and 
consists of all subjects who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would 
impact the study outcome significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject 
from the PPS-MREn-Extension are listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analysis for the MREn 
endpoints using the PPS-MREn-Extension population may be provided as part of a 
sensitivity analysis. 
The FAS and FAS-Extension will be used in both efficacy and safety analyses. The FAS-MREn 
and FAS-MREn-Extension will be used in the MREn analyses. Analyses using PPS,  PPS-
Extension, PPS-MREn, and PPS-MREn-Extension populations may be provided as sensitivity 
analyses.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints using PPS/PPS-Extension 
will be conducted only if more than 15% of the subjects in the FAS/FAS-Extension have at least 
1 significant protocol deviation. 
7.3 D ISPOSITION OF SUBJECTS 
Disposition will be evaluated for the following study periods: screening and treatment period.  
Disposition of all screened subjects (denominator) will be tabulated (count and percent).  
Disposition of screen failures (denominator) will be tabulated according to primary screen failure 
reason (e.g.,  pretreatment event, major protocol deviation, lost to follow-up, etc.) as entered on 
the eCRF. 
Disposition of all enrolled subjects will be tabulated as :  
 All enrolled subjects (denominator)  
 Subjects who were enrolled but not treated, if applicable  
 All subjects who completed the study drug/visits 
 All subjects who prematurely discontinued (permanently) study drug/visits

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of Takeda without a confidentiality agreement.  
 Medical history and concurrent medical conditions will be coded using the MedDRA (Version 
19 or higher) coding system. Medical history and concurrent medical conditions will be 
summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The tables will be sorted in 
alphabetic order by SOC and in decreasing frequency based on the total number of reports by 
preferred terms in each SOC. The number and percentage of subjects with any significant 
medical history and concurrent medical conditions will be summarized for each SOC and 
preferred term. The denominator used for calculating the percentages will be the total number of 
subjects. For the tables, if a subject reports the same preferred term multiple times, then that 
preferred term will be counted only once for that subject. Similarly, if a subject reports multiple 
conditions within the same SOC, then that SOC will be counted only once for that subject in the 
tables.  
All medical history and concurrent medical condition data will be listed by site and subject 
number. The listing will contain subject identifier, treatment, SOC, PT, whether there was any 
medical history or concurrent condition, and if yes, a detail of the medical history or concurrent 
condition. 
7.8 M EDICATION HISTORY AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Summaries of medication history and concomitant medications will be tabulated based on the 
FAS.  
Medication history information to be obtained and recorded on the eCRF includes any 
medication relevant to eligibility criteria that stopped at or within 30 days prior to signing of 
informed consent. The CD prior biologic medication which have been stopped are recorded on 
the eCRF as well. 
Concomitant medications are recorded on the eCRF and include any medication other than study 
drug taken at any time between the times of informed consent through the end of the study. Any 
ongoing CD biologic medications are included with the Concomitant Medications.   
Medication history, CD prior biologic medications,  and concomitant medications will be coded 
using the WHODrug dictionary (Version 01March 2015 or higher).  
Concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic classification and preferred 
medication name and will include only those medications taken at any time between the times of 
informed consent and on or prior to the last dose date of study drug. Concomitant medications 
will be classified and summarized separately as follows:  
 Concomitant medications that started and stopped prior to baseline: any medication 
stopped after time of informed consent and prior to the first dose of the study medication.  
 Concomitant medications that started prior to and were ongoing at baseline: any 
medication that started before and was not stopped prior to the first dose of the study 
medication.  
 Concomitant medications that started after baseline: any medication that started at or after 
the first dose of the study medication.

  Concomitant medications that were ongoing and  started after baseline: any medication 
that started before and was not stopped prior to the first dose of the study medication or 
any medication that started at or after the first dose of the study medication. 
The tables for medication history and  CD prior biologic medications will present the number and 
percentage of subjects by preferred medication name using the total number of subjects in the 
treatment arm as the denominator. Preferred medication names are sorted by decreasing 
frequency based on the total number of subjects. 
Separate listings for medication history, CD prior biologic medications, and concomitant 
medications will be produced by site and subject number. The listing for medication history will 
contain site number, subject number, treatment, WHODrug preferred medication name, dose, 
frequency, unit, route, end date, and whether the medication was ongoing. The listing for CD 
prior biologics medications which have been stopped will contain site number, subject number, 
treatment,  WHODrug preferred medication name, dose, unit, frequency, route, start date, end 
date, reason for discontinuation, and primary reason for intolerance. The listing for concomitant 
medication will contain site number, subject number, treatment, WHODrug preferred medication 
name, dose, unit, frequency, route, start date, end date, study day, and whether the medication 
was given to treat PTE/AE. 
7.9 S TUDY DRUG EXPOSURE AND COMPLIANCE  
Study drug exposure will be summarized based on the FAS and the FAS-Extension.  
Exposure will be presented as the frequency and percentage of subjects who received complete 
infusions. A subject has received complete infusion if the total amount was infused as per data 
collected in eCRF.  
Duration of exposure will be calculated as (date of last dose –  date of first dose) + 127. Duration 
of exposure will be summarized continuously and categorically. For Study Part A, duration of 
exposure will be summarized in the following categories : <20 Weeks, 20 – <24 Weeks, 24 - <32 
Weeks, 32  – <40 Weeks, and ≥ 40  Weeks. For Study Part B, duration of exposure will be 
summarized in the following categories: <56 Weeks, 56  - <64 Weeks, and ≥ 64  Weeks. 
Since all doses will be administered at in-clinic visits compliance will not be presented.  
All study drug administration and accountability data will be listed by site and subject number. 
The following variables will be listed: subject number, treatment, dose dates and times, dose 
interruption dates and times (if applicable), and completion status of infusion and reason for 
incomplete infusion.

7.10.2.1  Complete Mucosal Healing 
The proportions of subjects with ulcerations at Baseline who achieve complete mucosal healing 
at Week 26 and Week 52 and their 2-sided 95% CI will be calculated. Complete mucosal healing 
is defined as the absence of ulceration, which is demarcated as an SES-CD variable ‘Size of 
Ulcers’ score of 0 ( Appendix B ), from the presence of ulceration at Baseline. Subjects with any 
missing ’Size of Ulcers’ score at Week 26 or Week 52 will be considered as non-responders. 
Complete mucosal healing will also be summarized for the subgroups listed in section 7.10.1.2 
based on the FAS, FAS-Extension, PPS, and PPS-Extension. 
7.10.2.2 Endoscopic Remission  
Endoscopic remission at Week 14 and Week 52 will be analyzed following a similar approach 
outlined in section 7.10.1. 
7.10.2.3 Endoscopic Response 
The proportions of subjects with endoscopic response (defined as SES-CD reduction by at  least 
50% from baseline) at Week 14 , Week 26, and Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated by 
bowel segment and overall. Subjects with a missing SES-CD at Week 14, Week 26, and/or Week 
52 will be considered as non-responders.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed for the 
proportion of subjects with endoscopic response and its 2-sided 95% CI using the LOCF method.

colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and terminal ileum) and more 
proximal bowel segments (i.e., jejunum J-1, jejunum J-2, proximal ileum PI-1, and proximal 
ileum PI-2), if evaluable, will be summarized descriptively at Baseline, each post-Baseline visit, 
and change from Baseline to each post-Baseline visit. 
Shifts in categorical individual MREn parameters (i.e., ulceration, edema, presence of fistulas, 
fistulas description, presence of obstructive lesions, fluid collections, fluid collection change, 
inflammatory mass, and inflammatory mass change ) between baseline and each post-baseline 
visit for each ileocolonic segment and more proximal bowel segments, if evaluable, will be 
presented as cross-tabulations of responses with missing, if applicable, and total categories.

 7.10.3.2  MaRIA Scores 
The proportions of subjects achieving segmental MaRIA score <7 at Baseline, Week 26,  and 
Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated.  The proportions of subjects achieving segmental 
MaRIA score <11 will be calculated similarly. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving 
ileocolonic remission and response by MREn and overall remission and response by MREn at 
Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated. The MREn-based measures of 
interest are defined as follows: 
 Ileocolonic remission is defined as a post-Baseline segmental MaRIA score <7 in every 
ileocolonic segment from a Baseline segmental MaRIA score ≥7 in any ileocolonic 
segment. 
 Overall remission is defined as a post-Baseline segmental MaRIA score <7 in every 
segment, whether ileocolonic or proximal, from a Baseline segmental MaRIA score ≥7 in 
any segment.  
 Ileocolonic response is defined as a post-Baseline segmental MaRIA score <11 in every 
ileocolonic segment from a Baseline segmental MaRIA score ≥11 in any ileocolonic 
segment. 
 Overall response is defined as a post-Baseline segmental MaRIA score <11 in every 
segment, whether ileocolonic or proximal, from a Baseline segmental MaRIA score ≥11 
in any segment.  
The proportion of subjects with 25%, 50%, and 75% reduction in ileocolonic MaRIA score at 
Week 26 and Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated by ileocolonic bowel segment. 
In addition, the correlation between the SES-CD size of ulcers parameter and the MaRIA 
ulceration parameter (Yes/No) at Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 will be explored by bowel 
segment using the chi-squared test. For comparison purposes between SES- CD, GHAS, and 
MaRIA, the following assumptions will be taken: 
 The SES-CD size of ulcers parameter will be dichotomized with ‘None’ and ‘Aphthous 
ulcers’ as ‘Aphthous or None’ and ‘Large ulcers’ and ‘Very large ulcers’ as ‘Ulcers > 0.5 
cm’
. 
 The MaRIA ulceration parameter for the descending colon and sigmoid colon will be 
combined into ‘descending and sigmoid colon’, where a ‘No’ response requires a lack of 
ulceration in both the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. 
 The MaRIA scores for the descending colon and sigmoid colon will be added together to 
create ‘descending and sigmoid colon’ for continuous comparisons. 
7.10.3.3 SES-CD Score Reduction 
The proportions of subjects with 25% and 75% reduction of SES-CD at Week 14, Week 26, and 
Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated by bowel segment and overall.

presence of lamina propria neutrophils and/or neutrophils in the epithelium, which are described 
in Section 7.10.3.5. In addition, the proportion of subjects with no granulocytes present in the 
bowel biopsy at Week 26 and Week 52 will be presented for subjects with granulocytes present 
at Baseline. 
7.10.3.5 Histology Change 
Histology parameters, classified as features of chronicity or features of activity, are given a score 
by a pathologist as follows: 
Classification  Parameter  Score  
Features of Chronicity  
 Structural ( Architectural) Change 0 None 
 1 Not severe  
 2 Severe 
Chronic Inflammatory Infiltrate 0 None 
 1 Increased but not very dense infiltrate  
 2 Very dense infiltrate  
Features of Activity  Lamina Propria Neutrophils  0 None 
 1 Some but not readily detectable  
 2 Easily detectable at low magnification  
Neutrophils in Epithelium  0 None 
 1 In surface epithelium  
 2 In crypt epithelium, with or without 
abscesses  
Epithelial Damage  0 None 
 1 Some degenerative or regenerative 
changes, less than half of epithelium, 
irrespective of surface or crypts  
 2 Some degenerative or regenerative 
changes, more than half of epithelium, 
irrespective of surface or crypts  
Erosion or Ulceration 0 None 
 1 Strictly defined by the presence of 
granulation tissue  
Epithelioid Granuloma  0 None 
 1 Present 
The modified GHAS is calculated as the sum of all individual scores for each parameter listed 
above, for each individual biopsy [ 4]. The features of chronicity GHAS, features of activity 
GHAS, and total segmental GHAS will be calculated for each bowel segment using the highest 
total score in that segment. The ileal GHAS (IGHAS) is defined as the segmental GHAS for the 
ileum. The colonic GHAS (CGHAS) is defined as the highest segmental GHAS amongst the 
rectum, descending/sigmoid colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon. The features of 
chronicity score ranges between 0 and  4, and the features of activity score ranges between 0 and 
8. The IGHAS, CGHAS, and segmental GHAS range between 0 and 12.

The proportion s of subjects with any corticosteroid use at Baseline who discontinue all 
corticosteroids by Week 10, Week 14, Week 26, and Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated. 
The proportions of subjects with corticosteroid-free remission at Week 10, Week 14, Week 26, 
and Week 52 and their CIs will be calculated. Corticosteroid-free remission is defined as the 
achievement of clinical remission with the discontinuation of corticosteroid use post-Baseline 
from the use of corticosteroids at Baseline. 
7.11 P HARMACOKINETIC /PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSIS 
There is no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic analysis planned for this study. 
7.12 O THER OUTCOMES  
The patient reported outcomes (PRO ) analysis includes the change from baseline in QOL 
measures that will be summarized descriptively overall and by endoscopic remission status. 
Subjects will complete the IBDQ, EQ-5D, and WPAI- CD health related QOL questionnaires at 
Baseline, Week 14, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52. The QOL questionnaires will be 
summarized at Baseline, each post-Baseline visit, and change from Baseline to each post-
Baseline visit. Missing data will be imputed using the LOCF method. 
Derivation guidelines for IBDQ, EQ-5D, and WPAI-CD are documented in Appendix G  of the 
SAP. 
The responses collected on each of the QOL questionnaires will be listed. 
7.12.1 IBDQ 
The IBDQ is a valid and reliable instrument used to assess quality of life in adult patients with 
IBD. It includes 32 questions on 4 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL): Bowel 
Systems (10 items), Emotional Function (12 items), Social Function (5 items), and Systemic 
Function (5 items). Patients are asked to recall symptoms and quality of life from the last 2 
weeks and rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale (higher scores equate to higher quality of life). 
A total IBDQ score is calculated by summing the scores from each domain; the total IBDQ score 
ranges from 32 to 224.

 7.12.2 EQ-5D Questionnaire 
The EQ-5D questionnaire, developed by EuroQol, is a simple, valid, and reliable instrument used 
to measure general health-related quality of life in patients and includes five domain items - 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Patients choose the 
level of health problems they currently have on each item as “None”, “Moderate”, or “Extreme” 
and are scored a 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated from the 
individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. The EQ-5D VAS score is a self-assigned rating of 
overall health using a 20 cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as the worst and 100 as best 
possible health. The EQ-5D total score and EQ-5D VAS score have been shown in many studies 
to be valid and reliable instruments for measuring HRQOL in patients with GI diseases. 
7.12.3 WPAI-CD 
The WPAI questionnaire is a valid and reliable 6-item instrument that consists of four metrics: 
absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one’s health in the past seven days), 
presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in the past seven days 
because of one’s health), overall work productivity loss (an overall impairment estimate that is a 
combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity impairment (the percentage of 
impairment in daily activities because of one’s health in the past seven days). WPAI outcomes 
are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and 
less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes. WPAI-CD is the specific disease version of the 
questionnaire for Crohn’s Disease. 
7.13 S AFETY ANALYSIS 
Safety analyses include AEs, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs. All safety 
summaries will be based on the FAS and FAS-Extension. The analysis of safety data will be 
restricted to descriptive statistics only,  unless otherwise specified.  
7.13.1 Adverse Events 
A PTE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject who has 
signed informed consent to participate in a study, but prior to administration of any study 
medication; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. Pretreatment events and AEs will be coded using MedDRA Version 19 or higher. AEs 
will be summarized using the MedDRA SOC, high level term (HLT),  and PT. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as any AE that occurs after the first 
dose of study drug and up to the last dose or early termination plus applicable follow up (i.e., 18 
weeks). 
If the onset date of an AE is equal to the date of first dose of study medication and the AE was 
documented as a PTE on the eCRF, the AE will be classified as a PTE. Otherwise, the AE will 
be flagged as a TEAE.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of Takeda without a confidentiality agreement.  
 When calculating the frequency and percentage of subjects who reported TEAEs, a subject will 
be counted only once for each SOC or HLT or PT when multiple TEAEs are coded to the same 
SOC or HLT or PT. Thus, if a subject has two distinct AEs, each of which corresponds to a 
distinct PT but both of which correspond to the same HLT, then that subject will be counted once 
at that HLT  subject-count summary level and once at each of the two preferred-term subject-
count summary levels within an HLT. This same logic is extended to all PT nested within HLT 
that is in-turn nested within an SOC. For the intensity summaries, if a subject reports multiple 
treatment-emergent AEs coded to the same SOC or HLT or PT then the TEAE with maximum 
intensity will be included in the summary.  
TEAEs with missing intensity will be listed as such in the TEAE listings, however, will be 
summarized as severe in summary tables. If the relationship of a TEAE is missing, the 
relationship for the TEAE  will be considered to have been related. In the cases where a subject 
has multiple TEAEs with the same SOC or HLT or PT, the TEAE with the maximum intensity or 
strongest relationship will be summarized.  
Most frequent TEAEs are defined as events that occur in at least 3% of subjects within the 
treatment group.  
TEAEs will include the number and percentage of subjects as follows:  
 Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events  
 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class, High Level Term, and 
Preferred Term 
 Subject Mappings of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events

7.13.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated and presented using the International System of Units 
(SI) unless otherwise stated. Refer to Appendix A  for scheduled measurements for clinical 
laboratory tests and to Table 7.i for a list of all Protocol-specified clinical laboratory tests. The 
central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for serum chemistries, hematology, and 
urinalysis. All laboratory test parameters will be displayed in individual subject data listings in 
SI units. For test results not in SI units, the conversion to SI units will be done in the derived 
analysis data sets using the known conversion factors. If necessary, SI units from the central 
laboratory may be converted to Takeda’s preferred SI units in the derived dataset. All summaries 
and analyses will be based on the values using these preferred SI units. If a lab test with 
quantitative results has a value that is reported using a non-numeric qualifier (e.g., less than (<) a

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of Takeda without a confidentiality agreement.  
 certain value, or greater than (>) a certain value), the given numeric value will be used in the 
summary statistics, ignoring the non-numeric qualifier. 
The following summaries of hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis lab tests will be 
presented for each scheduled time point (Baseline, each post-Baseline visit, and Final Visit). 
The observed and change from Baseline values will be based on a single data value selected 
according to the window conventions described in Table 7.a , Table 7.b, Table 7 .c, and Table 7.d. 
Note that “character” urinalysis parameters will only be listed. 
Shifts in laboratory test values will be presented as cross-tabulations (Baseline versus each post-
Baseline visit and Final Visit) of numbers of subjects with low, normal,  and high values relative 
to the normal range used at the central laboratory. This classification will be based on the low, 
normal, and high alert flags reported by the central laboratory. If a subject has multiple values 
within a particular visit window, the most extreme result will be used for summary. Shift tables 
will be produced for all clinical laboratory tests with reference ranges.  
Listings of all clinical safety laboratory data will be provided, including hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis. Laboratory data outside of the normal reference range will be 
indicated in the listings. In addition, markedly abnormal values (MAVs) will be flagged. The 
listing will also include the site, subject number, age (at informed consent), gender, treatment 
group, study visit, and sample collection date.

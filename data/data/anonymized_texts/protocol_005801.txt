Version dated 8-JU LY-2019  1.INTRODUCTION
In s
igmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, radiographic examination and other medical or diagnostic 
procedures on the colon, it is important that the colon be thoroughly purged and cleansed. In 
particular, it is essential that as much fecal matter as pos sible be removed from the colon to 
permit adequate visualization of the intestinal mucosa.  
La
rge volume (e.g. 4L) orally administered compositions have been developed for use as 
gastrointestinal “washes” for diagnostic purposes. Such orally administered preparations are usually formulated as dilute or isotonic solutions of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG -3350) and 
electrolyte containing salts such as sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride ( 1). These orally administered co mpositions are useful in the rapid cleansing 
of the colon for diagnostic purposes.  However, due to the large volume of poorly tasting fluid that must be ingested, patient compliance is often poor. 
One
 attempt to answer this problem has been to reduce the  volume of preparation and improve 
its palatability. To this end, a sulfate -based bowel preparation kit, SUPREP ® Bowel Prep Kit 
(sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) Oral Solution , was cleared by FDA 
in 2010. SUPREP requires the patient to consume two separate administrations of this oral sulfate solution (OSS).  Each administration purges the colon of fecal material.  The colon is cleansed after the second administration. Each administration is followed by 946 ml supplemental water to prevent dehydration.  The total volume of fluid intake (including 
SUPREP) is about 3L.  SUPREP was specifically formulated to prevent fluid and electrolyte disturbances, unlike the phosphate preparations ( 2).   
Ne
vertheless, some physicians have adopted a bowel preparation that consists of PEG-3350 
combined with a “sports drink” such as Gatorade® (PEG -SD).  It combines PEG-3350 
(available over -the-counter and one of the active ingredients of several FDA-approved bowel 
cleansing preparations), with the electrolytes and sugar found in the sports drink. It is an osmotically unbalanced formulation and its effects on fluid and electrolyte balance have not been studied. It appears that the patients’ perception of this product is so acceptable that physicians recommend its use, despite evidence that it is less effective and perhaps less safe than those cleared by FDA ( 3,4,5).  
Tab
le 1 shows that the quantities of the electrolytes in PEG -SD are much less than in marketed 
bowel preparation products, which is not surprising as the sports drink was developed to replace electrolytes lost in sweat, not from diarrhea.

though it is unapproved by the FDA, doctors make this decision because of a variety of 
factors, such as cost, taste and patient requests.  
Fo
r example, Matro et al (2014) randomized patients to receive PEG -SD (N = 180) or PEG-
EA (N=184), which is an approved bowel preparation (MOVIPREP®), and collected  clinical 
chemistry data at baseline and on the day of colonoscopy. Although the incidence of 
hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mmol/L) was higher in the osmotically unbalanced PEG-SD group, (3.9%) vs the PEG-EA treated group (2.2%), it did not differ statistically.  For other electrolytes, small but statistically significant changes from baseline to colonoscopy occurred with PEG -SD for sodium, potassium and chloride (P = 0.001, 0.012, 0.001, respectively).  
Re
garding the efficacy of PEG-SD, properly powered studies such as that of Matro et al 
conclude that PEG-SD is inferior in the rate of preparations considered “excellent” by the endoscopist. Patients consuming the PEG-SD also drink additional fluids and are usually instructed to receive a de -bulking laxative such as OTC bisacodyl prior to the PEG- SD 
consumption. Bisacodyl is a poorly absorbed stimulant laxative that acts to stimulate peristalsis in the colon resulting in stool evacuation.

Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI 4900-201 Amendment 2 Page 11 of 28 
Version dated 8-JU LY-2019  A ur
ine pregnancy test will be performed on female subjects of childbearing potential (see 
Section 4.7). Subjects meeting all entry criteria will be eligible for enrollment.  
4.1.1. I
nformed Consent  
Following the informed consent process, study subjects will sign a current IRB approved 
consent form. No study procedures may be performed prior to the subject providing informed consent. The subject’s original signed and personally dated Informed Consent Form (together with any subsequent IRB approved amended versions) must be retained by the Investigator in the subject’s file.  A copy  of the original signed and dated Informed Consent Form must be 
given to the subject. 
4.1.2. Bowel Preparation Assignment  
Eligible  subjects will be provided with instructions on how to use the study preparation. The 
first 20 subjects will receive BLI4900. The second 20 subjects will receive PEG- SD. A third 
group (approximately 40 subjects) will receive BLI4900-5. A fourth group (appr oximately 40 
subjects) will receive BLI4900-6. 
Subjects will self -administer the study  preparation starting on the day prior to their scheduled 
colonoscopy according to the instructions provided by the study site (full preparation instructions are included in Appe
ndix B ). Subjects will be instructed to bring the used 
pre
paration components when they return for colonoscopy.  
Sub
jects that have clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities, in the opinion of the 
principle investigator, based on Visit 1 laboratory results must be discontinued from the study. Subjects must be notified and instructed to return their unopened bowel preparation to the study center. Returned un-used study drug kits will not be re-dispensed to another subject.    
4.1.3. Dietary Restrictions  
Subjects may have a low residue breakfast on the day before colonoscopy, followed by clear liquids until the colonoscopy is completed the following day. Examples of acceptable low residue items are found in the preparation instructions. 
Examples of acceptable clear liquids are provided below: 
Water
Strained fruit juices (without pulp) including apple, orange, white grape, etc.
Limeade or lemonade
Gatorade/ Powerade
Ginger ale
Coffee or tea (do not use any dairy or non- dairy creamer)
Chicken broth
Gelatin desserts without added fruit or topping
Note: Purple/Red liquids, Milk and Alcoholic beverages are not permitted.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI 4900-201 Amendment 2 Page 12 of 28 
Version dated 8-JU LY-2019  Non-compliance with the dietary restrictions will be documented, but will not require separate 
reporting as a protocol violation. 
4.1.4. S
ubject Questionnaires  
Subjects will be provided with a Preparation Questionnaire and Dietary Questionnaire to 
document their preparation and dietary intake (refer to Appe
ndix C  for full questionnaires), 
and t
o note any episodes of vomiting that may occur during the preparation. Subjects will 
complete t hese questionnaires starting on the morning they are scheduled to take their first 
dose of each preparation (Preparation Day 1) until they return to the study center the following day (Preparation Day 2). The time of food/fluid ingestion will be recorded. Site staff must 
review the descriptions and times recorded on the questionnaire at Visit 2 to confirm that subjects were compliant with the dietary restrictions outlined in Section 4.1.3. 
4.2. Bow
el Preparation Administration  
On the day prior to their appointment, subjects will begin following the protocol specified die
tary restrictions (as outlined in Section 4.1.3) and completing their Preparation and Dietary 
Questionnaires (refer to Appendix C ). In the evening, subjects will begin consuming their 
bowel preparation according to the instructions provided by the study center (refer to Appendi
x B). Subjects will take the second dose of bowel preparation the following morning 
(5 
– 8 hours prior to colonoscopy).   
4.3. Vis
it 2 
Subjects will return to the study center for colonoscopy following completion of the preparation. Sites should attempt to schedule subjects a minimum of 4 days from date of screening to allow for receipt and review of screening lab results up to a maximum of 30 days. Visits scheduled beyond 30 days from Visit 1 will be considered a protocol violation and subjects must have a repeat blood draw.  
Subjects will bring back their questionnaires and study personnel will review the questionnaires for completeness so that any missed responses can be captured. Subjects will complete a preference questionnaire. Any violations of the dietary restrictions must be confirmed with the subject. 
Vital s
igns (excluding height) will be repeated, a physical examination will be performed, and 
subject s will be queried for occurrence of adverse events and changes in concomitant 
medications. Blood samples will be collected for chemistry testing.   
The colonoscopy will be performed by a physician according to the site’s standard procedures and evaluated on a 4- point scale, as shown in Section 4.6. Sites with recording capabilities will 
record the colonoscopy procedure.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI 4900-201 Amendment 2 Page 13 of 28 
Version dated 8-JU LY-2019  Endoscopists should limit the use of water flush to that necessary to achieve the cleansing 
required to achieve adequate visualization. Water immersion and/or exchange technique should be avoided unless it is medically indicated. 
4.3.1. S
ymptom Scale  
At Visit 2 (prior to sedation), subjects  will report their experience with the preparation on the 
Symptom Scale for the most frequently occurring bowel preparation symptoms of stomach cramping, stomach bloating, and nausea. These symptoms will be rated by the subjects using the following categories “None”, “Mild”, “Bothersome”, “Distressing” a nd “Severely 
Distressing” .  
4.3.2. D
rug Accountability  
Subjects will be instructed to bring the used preparation components when they return for colonoscopy to determine compliance. Failure of a subject to return preparation components does not constitute a protocol violation. The staff members will perform drug accountability by counting used and unused preparation components and measuring any returned solution.  
Returned study preparation materials must be accounted for on the drug inventory log and will be returned to the Sponsor at the completion or termination of the study, unless instructed otherwise 
by the Sponsor. 
4.4. Follow up of Adverse Events and Laboratory Results  
Subjects who have ongoing adverse events related to the study preparation (except for those expected symptoms for which the subjects are prompted in their questionnaire) or abnormal laboratory values from Visit 2 blood draws that the investigator feels are  clinically significant 
will return approximately 7 days following colonoscopy. Subjects with prior clinically significant abnormal laboratory values should undergo repeat testing. Subjects returning due to ongoing adverse events related to study preparation should be assessed to determine if the event has resolved or is clinically stable.

Version dated 8-JULY-2019   4.6 Physician Assessments 
4.6.1. Segmental Cleansing Assessment  
The colonoscopist will rate each colon segment (proximal, mid, distal) using the 
following scale, factoring in the amount of effort required during both insertion and withdrawal.  
Score  Grade Description  
1 Poor Large amounts of fecal residue, additional 
bowel preparation required 
2 Fair Enough feces even after washing and suctioning 
to prevent clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. 
3 Good Feces and fluid requiring washing and 
suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. 
4 Excellent  No more than small bits of feces/fluid which 
can be suctioned easily; achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa 
4.6.2. Ov
erall Cleansing Assessment  
Following completion of the procedure and after each segment has been rated, the colonoscopist will provide a global rating of preparation quality for the entire colon (inclusive of their perception of all segments) using the scale outlined in Section 4.6.1.   
4.6.3. A
dditional Efficacy Measures  
In addition, the following data will be collected: 
1. Adequacy of preparation according to the colonoscopist. If the preparation
was not adequate, the need for re-preparation will be recorded.
2. Start time of colonoscopy
3.Time  of cecal intubation
4. Completion time of colonoscopy5. Impact of preparation quality on surveillance interval6. Volume of water used to improve visualization (investigator’s will need to
specify cases where a water immersion technique was utilized)

Version dated 8-JULY-2019   4.7. Pregnancy  
Subjects that are female and of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test 
done at screening. A positive result will rule out the participation of the subject in the study. 
Fe
male study subjects must be surgically sterilized or use oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double- barrier method, intrauterine device, or testify that she is 
monogamous with a vasectomized partner, or practices abstinence and will continue to do so during the duration of study. Subjects practicing abstinence must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control should they become sexually active during the study. Women who are post-menopausal (as defined in this section), or have had a partial or total hysterectomy or tubal ligation are not considered of child bearing potential. 
Or
al contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections should be stable for at least 1 
month before the study, until completion of the study.  Subjects are not allowed to change their birth control method during the course of the study. 
Me
nopausal status is defined when menses have been absent for 12 months in a woman 
of appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or identified cause of amenorrheaas.  
If
 a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subj ect must be removed from the 
study and followed until one month after the end of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy will not be recorded as an adverse event.  
4.8. C
oncomitant Medications  
The use of concomitant medication will be recorded from 7 days prior to screening until completion the study, including intravenous fluids administered during colonoscopy.  
5.ADVERSE EVENTS
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  Any symptom on the S ymptom Scale rated as “Mild” or more severe must be reported as an 
adverse event. Any reports of vomiting on the Preparation Questionnaire must be reported as 
adverse event (multiple episodes of vomiting should be reported as a single adverse event in the Case Report Form). Colonoscopy and biopsy findings are not considered adverse events unless considered by the investigator to be related to the preparation or colonoscopy procedure. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4900 -201 Amendment 2 Page 17 of 28 
Version dated 8-JULY-2019   Adverse event collection will commence at the time the patient provides informed consent. 
Subjects that have an ongoing treatment emergent adverse event (ex cluding the symptom scale) 
or clinically significant abnormal laboratory value will be followed up approximately one week after colonoscopy.  
Subj
ects will be instructed to promptly report adverse events to the Investigator. The Investigator 
will record d ate/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the adverse event, severity of 
adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's assessment of relationship of adverse event to study preparation.  
The
 Investigator should assess the severity of each adverse event using the following categories: 
Grade  Severity  Description 
1 Mild  Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 Severe  Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual 
Activities  
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death, Life threatening or disabling  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)  
5 Fatal  Causes death of the participant  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event)  
The
 Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event using 
the following categories: 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). 
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely . 
DEFINITE  There is clear  evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out .

Version dated 8-JULY-2019   5.2 Expected Adverse Events 
Because BLI4900 contains the same active ingredients as approved bowel preparations 
(PEG 3350 and sulfates), a similar adverse event profile is expected. In Phase 3 clinical trials of 
SUPREP (which includes sodium and magnesium sulfate), the most frequent adverse events reported by > 3% of patients included overall discomfort, abdominal pain and distension, nausea, 
and vomiting. The most frequently reported adverse events occurring in > 3% of patients taking 
NuLYTELY ( which contains PEG3350) are nausea, abdominal fullness and bloating.  
PEG -
SD contains the same active ingredient as BLI4900 (PEG3350), therefore a similar adverse 
event profile is expected. In addition, the preparation includes the commonly used OTC laxative bisacodyl. There have been rare cases of hyponatremia and ischemic colitis reported with versions of the PEG-SD combination ( 3,4,5).  
6.SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DISCONTINUATION
OF STUDY
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in at least one 
of the following outcomes: 
- Re
sults in death
- Is life -threatening
- Requires inpatient hospitalization o r prolongation of existing hospitalization
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to
conduct normal life functions
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or
damage
 SA
E collection will coincide with the patient providing informed consent to participate in 
the study and will conclude 30 days after colonoscopy. Pre -scheduled surgeries or 
elective surgeries (that do not represent a worsening of a pre- existing condition) will not 
be considered serious adverse events. Should a serious and/or unexpected adverse event occur, the Investigator will notify Braintree Laboratories immediately or no later than 24 hours after gaining knowledge of the event.  The Investigator will make a decision regarding continuing study participation, and may request input from Braintree Laboratories. The Investigator will be responsible for recommending or providing the patient with appropriate medical therapy. All patients experiencing serious adverse events will be followed until clinically stable.  
Br
aintree Laboratories must be kept apprised of all follow -up information related to ser ious adverse 
events. In addition, Investigators must comply with the SAE reporting requirements of the Institutional Review Board with oversight of the study.

7.INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) AND INFORMED
CONSENT
IRB review and approval of the study protocol and Informed Consent Form will be obtained prior to 
initiation of the study.  Amendments to the study protocol and consent form generated during the course of the study will also require IRB approval.  
8.MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS
8.1. Modification of Protocol
Neither an Investigator nor Braintree Laboratories will modify the protoc ol without first 
obtaining the concurrence of the other and the IRB. Investigators that continually violate the protocol or commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or B raintree Laboratories deems the incidence or 
severity of adverse events to be unacceptable.  
8.2. S
ubjects Discontinued from the Study  
Subjects may be dropped from the study for any of the following reasons:  
•An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study medication).
•Female participants who become pregnant during the study period.
•Major protocol deviation from the study design by the subject that is observed or suspectedby the Investigator
•Subject chooses to withdraw from the study, for whatever reason.

Protocol Number BLI4900 -201 Amendment 2 Page 20 of 28 
Version dated 8-JULY-2019   •Subject is lost to follow -up.
•The Sponsor initiates an early discontinuation of the study.
•The subject is withdrawn at the discretion of the Investigator.
Braintree should be contacted if possible prior to discontinuation of any subject. 
9.DATA ANALYSIS
9.1. Study Endpoints - Efficacy
Primary efficacy will be assessed on the basis of a binary outcome of overall preparation success 
or failure. The following definition of preparation success and failure will be used: 
Definition of successful preparation: 
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment by the colonoscopist ( Section 4.6.2) of “Excellent” or
“Good” and does not satisfy any of the following failure criteria.
De
finition of failed preparation:
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment of “Fair” or “Poor” by the colonoscopist.
2. Any subject who did not have a colonoscopy based on the Investigator’s
assessment of the cleansing (insufficient fecal output, unclear fecal discharge,
etc.) or due to preparation related adverse events.
3. Any subject for whom cleaning was not adequate for evaluation.
Unevaluable Patients:  
Subjects who were dispensed a kit but withdrew from the study prior to taking any preparation (including subjects who were disqualified subsequent to Visit 1 based on screening laboratory results) are excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses. Any subject who completely or partially took study preparation but did not have a colonoscopy due to non- preparation related 
reasons (e.g. lack of insurance, inability to return for colonoscopy) will not be included in the efficacy analyses. All treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis.  
Addi
tional efficacy endpoints will include: 
•Cleansing score by segment
•Number (%) of excellent preparations o verall and by segment
•Adequacy of clean sing and need for re- preparation
•Duration of colonoscopy
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4900 -201 Amendment 2 Page 21 of 28 
Version dated 8-JULY-2019   •Volume of intraprocedural water needed to irrigate the colon
•Number (%) of procedures that reached the cecum
9.2. S
tudy Endpoints - Safety  
Adverse Events:  
All subjects who took preparation in any amount will be included in the safety analysis. All 
adverse events will be summarized based on the principle of treatment emergence. A sign or symptom will be regarded as treatment- emergent if it was present prior to th e first dose and 
subsequently worsened in severity, or was not present prior to the first dose but subsequently appeared.  
In o
rder to define treatment emergence for events with missing start or stop dates the following 
additional criteria will be used: 
• if both the onset and resolution dates for a particular event are missing, then the
event is considered treatment -emergent;
• if the onset date for an event is missing and the resolution date falls after theinitiation of the first dose, then the event is cons idered treatment -emergent;
• if the onset date for an event falls after the initiation of the first dose and theresolution date is missing or  present, then the event is considered treatment-
emergent; and
• if the onset date for an event falls before the initi ation of the first dose and the
stop date is missing or  present, then the event is not considered treatment-
emergent.
Adve
rse events will be collected using MedDRA category designations for body system and 
preferred term. The number and percent of subject s who experienced each adverse event will be 
presented in a tabular form.   
Vitals Signs and Physical Examination: 
Vital signs and physical examination data will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Laboratory Data:  
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Screening) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Symptom Questionnaire Data: 
Symptom questionnaire data for individual symptoms for Overall Experience (Stomach Cramping, Stomach Bloating, and Nausea ) will be presented.

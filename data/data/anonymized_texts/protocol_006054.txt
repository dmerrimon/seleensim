 1.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Overview 
This preliminary, prospective, single-arm clinical  study will evaluate the safety and potential 
efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells fo r Urinary Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) for 
the treatment of male stress urinary incontinence (S UI) that develops following prostate surgery.  
 
Prostate surgery can induce iatrogenic sphincter damage resulting in long-term SUI. Therefore, 
augmenting sphincter function may be beneficial  to patients. Autologous  muscle cell therapy, 
which involves isolation of cells from skelet al muscle biopsies, ex vivo expansion, and 
subsequent injection into the ur ethral sphincter, may serve as a potential durable therapy. In 
animal studies, muscle derived cells have succe ssfully integrated within tissue to improve 
sphincter function. Intrasphincteric injection of  AMDC-USR is expected to produce localized 
tissue changes near the injection site and is  not expected to produce a systemic effect. 
 Patients will receive intras phincteric injection of a single treatment of 150 x 10
6 AMDC-USR. 
For entrance into the st udy, patients must meet the study inclus ion criteria and must not meet any 
of the exclusion criteria. Patient s will have quantitative and qualitative measures of incontinence 
assessed before treatment and at various times after treatment.  The study will treat up to 30 patients at up to 5 cl inical sites. Enrollment is expected to be 
completed within 2.5 years of initiating the study. Patients will be followed for 24 months post-treatment. The first 3 patients at each site must reach 1-month follow-up before subsequent 
patients can be treated at that site.  Male patients at least 18 years of age who have undergone prosta te surgery at least 12 months 
prior to screening and who present with symptoms  of SUI will be screened for eligibility for 
study participation. To participate, patients must  meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  Eligible patients will have  muscle tissue harvested using a needle biopsy 
technique during an outpatient procedure. The harvested muscle tissue will be placed in a hypothermic medium and transported to the manuf acturer for cell processi ng in their laboratory 
in Pittsburgh, PA (USA). The muscle derived cells (MDC) will be isol ated and expanded in 
culture over several weeks to a final dose of 150 x 10
6 ± 20% AMDC-USR.  
 Due to the personalized nature of each autologous product, some products may not meet all

 release specifications of purity a nd dose.  If a product meets all predefined safety criteria, the 
product may be offered to the patient at the phy sician’s discretion. Affected patients will be 
notified prior to their injecti on procedure and must provide c onsent of their willingness to 
receive an injection of product that does not meet all target criteria. 
 
After reaching the desired concen tration, the isolated and expa nded AMDC-USR will be frozen 
and shipped back to the investigating physic ian. The physician will thaw the AMDC-USR and 
dilute the sample with an approximately equal volume of physiological  saline. Under direct 
vision, the resulting suspension will be injected into the patient’s urethral  sphincter in a brief 
outpatient procedure.  Patients will be assessed for safety and impr ovement in urinary incontinence symptoms at 
1, 3, 6 and 12 months following treatment. Adverse events will be assessed at all follow-up visits, as well as during follow-up calls at 1-2 days, 1 week, and 24 months. A study overview is 
depicted in Figure 1.1.  The primary safety measures will be the in cidence of study product-re lated serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and the incidence of study product-related, biopsy procedure-related, and injection procedure-related a dverse events and post-void re sidual (PVR) urine volume. 
Secondarily, potential efficacy will be evaluate d based on reduction in the amount of urine 
leakage, as assessed by a 24-hour pad test at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mont hs following treatment. Changes 
in patient-reported incontinence symptom seve rity, quality of life (QOL), and erectile 
dysfunction (ED) symptoms will also be assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following treatment.

 24 months following treatment of SUI in male  patients who have undergone prior prostate 
surgery. 
 Safety will be determined by the frequency and severity of adverse ev ents related to study 
procedures and study product th rough 24 months following treatment of SUI in male patients 
who have undergone prior prostate surgery. PVR volume will be assessed through 12 months post-treatment to monitor potentia l retention or obstruction. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
In addition to the primary objective listed a bove, the following secondary objectives will be 
evaluated in this clinical study:  
 
 Efficacy of AMDC-USR in the reduction of  SUI symptoms at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months 
post-treatment 
 Effect of AMDC-USR on QOL at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment 
 Additionally, information on ED symptoms will be collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. 
3.0 Product Description and Intended Use 
3.1 General Product Description 
Please reference the Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of  the product and dose to 
be used in the clinical study. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Cook MyoSite, Incorporated will perform cell pro cessing and preparation of cell suspensions for 
study use in their cell processing facility in P ittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA). Cell processing will 
begin with isolation of cells from the patient’s tis sue. The cells will then be grown in culture and 

Cook MyoSite, Incorporated  Version: 13-11-03 
  
AMDC-USR for Male SUI IND Clinical Trial  Version Da te: 17 November2015

 expanded in number. The culture process produces  a final cell culture th at is enriched in 
myogenic cell content. Cell culture will be perf ormed in medium consisting of physiological 
saline solution with cell nutri ents. Cell processing will follow current Good Manufacturing 
Practice (cGMP) methodologies to prevent cont amination and to preserve tissue function and 
integrity. These practices will include define d procedures for tissue and cell handling, 
processing, and identification. 
 Each AMDC-USR study agent vial supplied to th e clinical site will contain cryogenically 
preserved autologous muscle derived cells, prepared  to ± 20% of the stated  total viable cellular 
dose at the time of packaging,  
 
 
Each study agent vial will be thawed at the clinical si te prior to use and diluted with 
an approximately equal volume (2 mL) of inject able sodium chloride (saline) at physiological 
concentration,   
 Materials contacting the patient’s urethral tissu e will include the patient’s own muscle derived 
cells, the cryogenic medium in which the cells are suspended and shipped, and the physiological 
saline used to dilute th e mixture for injection. 
3.1.1 Dose Justification 
A dose of 150 x 10
6 AMDC-USR was chosen

Systemic adverse effects attributable to AMDC-USR have not been observed following 
intrasphincteric injection of AMDC in non-clinical1 and clinical2-4 studies. Therefore, delivery 
into the urethral sphincter of men is unlikely to produce systemic responses.  
 Because the risk to patients from adverse effects fr om the cells is expected to be the same as in 
other studies for sphincter-related indications, a dose with potential beneficial effect will be 
evaluated in the initial study. 
3.2 Indication for Use  
The AMDC-USR treatment is indicated for reduction in symptoms of urinary incontinence and 
improvement in patient QOL in men with stress urinary incontinence. 
3.3 Product Identification and Tracking  
Products under investigation will be tracked by the clinical site  throughout the course of the 
study through the use of a product log, which incl udes information such as lot numbers, quantity, 
and disposition of products. Additi onally, information such as th e quantity and lot number(s) of 
products used in patients will be recorded on Case Report Forms (CRFs). 
 Each product is manufactured individually and labeled with a unique product code for identification and traceability. All cell preparations  will be transported in identical vials with the 
same volume of transport medium and reconstituted to the same final volume prior to injection. 
Vials will be identified by a product code containing lot number, patient initials, and six unique 
digits. Additional procedures have also been established to ensure traceability. 
3.4 Instructions for Use   
 The study procedure guidelines, which will be provi ded to physicians and appropriate study staff 
at the time of training, must be followed for step-by-step instructions for performing the 
following:

  Obtaining the muscle biopsy 
 Packaging and shipping the muscle biopsy 
 Complete instructions including storage and handling requirements 
 Resuspending the final product (AMDC-USR) 
 
Muscle Biopsy 
 The biopsy procedure will involve minor surger y to collect approximately 50-250 mg of the 
vastus lateralis muscle using a sampling needle. Prior to the biopsy, patients who are currently 
taking any form of anticoagulant medication must stop using the medication as per standard of 
care for outpatient surgery procedures. Antianxiet y medication, analgesia, or minimal sedation 
may be provided according to each site’s standard of care.  
 
 Several passes of the biopsy needle may be requi red to obtain a satisfactory sample of muscle 
tissue. Additionally, if the first biopsy does not produce an adequate sample for product 
isolation, it may be necessary for the patient to return for another biopsy procedure. The 
maximum permissible number of biopsy needle passes and the total number of biopsies is contingent upon patient tolerance and the sa tisfactory procurement of muscle tissue.  
 Using aseptic technique, the biopsy tissue will be  transferred to the Biopsy Medium Vial. The 
Biopsy Medium Vial will be closed and packag ed according to the study procedure guidelines 
for shipment to Cook MyoSite, Incorporated.  Dilution and Preparation for Injection 
 The frozen product will be thawed for at least 8- 10 minutes at room temperature. The 2 mL of 
cell suspension will be diluted with  2 mL of physiological saline fo r an approximate total volume 
of 4 mL. The entire vial contents  will be used for injection. 
 Cell Injection 
 The study agent (AMDC-USR) will be injected into the urethral sphincter. A course of prophylactic antibiotics will be given prior to the injec tion procedure. Ultrasound may be 
performed to aid in the injection procedure. Under direct vision, multiple injections will be

 performed to circumferentially distribute AMDC-USR  within the striated muscle of the urethral 
sphincter. Materials contacting the urethral tissue will include the pa tient’s own AMDC-USR, 
the cryogenic medium in which the AMDC -USR are suspended and shipped, and the 
physiological saline used to dilu te the mixture for injection. Prio r to the injection, patients who 
are currently taking any form of  anticoagulant medication must stop using the medication as per 
standard of care for outpatient surgery procedur es. Antianxiety medication, analgesia, or minimal 
sedation may be provided according to each site’s standard of care or physician’s discretion. 
 
After the injection is completed, the injected area  will be examined for any excessive bleeding or 
excessive trauma. The patient will be asked to  void, and an ultrasound/bladder scan will be 
performed to determine PVR urine volume.

 6.0 Design of the Clinical Study 
6.1 Design of Study 
This preliminary, prospective, single-arm clinical  study will evaluate the safety and potential 
efficacy of AMDC-USR for the treatment of male SUI that develops following prostate surgery. 
 
The study will treat up to 30 patients (treated with 150 x 106 AMDC-USR) at up to 5 clinical 
sites. Enrollment is expected to be complete d within 2.5 years of in itiating the study. Patients 
will be followed for 24 months post-treatment. The first 3 patients at each site must reach 1-month follow-up before subsequent patie nts can be treated at that site. 
6.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Patient eligibility for enrollment shall be ba sed on known information at the time of the 
screening. Information obtained at a later date may contradict thes e criteria, but this will not be 
considered a deviation to the CIP. 
 Inclusion Criteria  
 A patient is deemed suitable for inclusion in th e study if the patient meets the following criteria: 
 
1. Male, at least 18 years old, with primar y symptoms of SUI following prostate 
surgery that occurred at least 12 months  prior to enrollment, as confirmed by 
medical history and clinical symptoms, including a focused incontinence evaluation. 
2. Patient has undergone prostate surgery, such  as radical prostatectomy or prostate 
resection, but has not undergone radiati on therapy, cryotherapy, or high-intensity 
focused ultrasound of the prostate. 
3. SUI severity must be ≥10 g and <400 g of urine leakage over 24 hours, as 
determined by a 24-hour pad test during screening.
 2 
                                                 
2 Moore, et al.5 suggest > 4 g as a minimum pad weight gain for incontinence in men, but that the upper limit for 
normal pad weight gain should be 8 g. Thus, > 8 g would be considered incontinence in men. Kumar, et al.6 suggest 
> 400 g/24 h is high-grade incontinence (or total incon tinence), and recommend men in this category receive an 
artificial urinary sphincter.

6.3 Endpoints 
6.3.1 Primary Endpoints 
The primary safety endpoints include: 
 
 Study product-related SAEs reported through 24-month follow-up; 
Cook MyoSite, Incorporated  Version: 13-11-03 
  
AMDC-USR for Male SUI IND Clinical Trial  Version Da te: 17 November2015

 Page 20 of 41 
  Study product-related, biopsy pr ocedure-related, and injectio n procedure-related adverse 
events reported through 24-month follow-up; and 
 PVR urine volume reported through 12-month follow-up. 
6.3.2 Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints include:  
 
 Reduction in amount of urine leakage, as assessed by 24-hour pad test at 1, 3, 6 and 
12 months post-treatment;  
 Change in patient-reported incontinence symp tom severity, as assessed by questionnaires 
at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment; and 
 Change in patient-reported QOL, as assesse d by questionnaires at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months 
post-treatment. 
 
Changes in ED symptoms will also be assess ed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
6.3.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
This is a preliminary study to assess the safety  of intrasphincteric inje ction of AMDC-USR in 
male patients. Safety assessment will be ba sed on the occurrence of product- and study 
procedure-related adverse events. Additionall y, PVR volume will be assessed throughout the 
study to monitor potential re tention or obstruction.   
 
Efficacy measurements will be used in this study to assess the severity level of an individual’s incontinence symptoms and the extent to which incontinence symptoms impair quality of life. 
Measures to assess incontinence include a 24-ho ur pad test, the International Consultation on 
Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ),
8,9 the Incontinence Quality of Life (IQOL) questionnaire,9,10 
the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S),11,12 the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement (PGI-I),11,12 and the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS).13,14 
 Since SUI and ED can be comorbidities that de velop following prostate  surgery, the 5-Item 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5)
15 questionnaire will be used to monitor 
symptoms of ED.

 6.4 Variables to be Measured to De monstrate Achievement of Endpoints 
Safety endpoints will be measured as follows: 
 
 Study product-related SAEs reported through 24-month follow-up;  
 Study product-related, biopsy pr ocedure-related, and injectio n procedure-related adverse 
events reported through 24-month follow-up; and 
 Ultrasound/bladder scan determination of PVR volume on the da y of injection and at 1, 3, 
6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
 The secondary efficacy endpoints will be measured as follows:  
 Reduction in amount of urine leakage from base line as assessed by 24-hour pad test at 1, 
3, 6 and 12 months; 
 Change from baseline in patient-reported ou tcomes for incontinence symptom severity 
and QOL will be measured by ICIQ, IQOL score and subscores, I-PSS, and PGI-S score at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months; and  
 Change in patient-reported incontinence symp tom severity will also be measured by PGI-
I score at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. 
 In addition, change from baseline in patient symptoms of ED will be measured by the IIEF-5 
questionnaire at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Patient c linical information incl uding details of prior 
procedures for prostate surgery, underlying reas on for prostate surgery, underlying disease 
severity, and any procedures or revisions following the incident procedure to address disease or 
SUI symptoms will be collected and evaluated as appropriate.  The clinical data will be colle cted on standardized Case Repor t Forms (CRFs). The schedule for 
assessments is summarized in Table 6.1.

 6.5 Measures to be Taken to  Avoid or Minimize Bias 
This preliminary, prospective, single-arm study is intended to collect information regarding the 
safety and potential efficacy of intrasphincteri c injection of AMDC-USR  for the treatment of 
male SUI that develops following prostate surgery. St udy patients will be enrolled at up to 5 sites 
and uniform definitions will be  used for study endpoints.  
7.0 Methods 
7.1 Patient Assessment and Screening 
Male patients who present with SUI symptoms th at developed following prostate surgery that 
occurred at least 12 months prior to enrollment may be considered for part icipation in this study. 
7.2 Patient Consent Patients who appear to meet the inclusion crit erion and none of the ex clusion criteria will be 
invited to participate in this study. All patients  eligible for entry into the study will have the 
clinical study, as well as potential  risks and benefits of their pa rticipation in the study, explained 
to them. Each patient who agrees to participate will be required to sign and date an informed 
consent document prior to any study -specific testing or procedure. If new information is obtained 
during the clinical study, any patient who has not exited the study will be informed about the 
new information, and will be reconsented at the discretion of the inves tigator or the site’s 
IRB/REB. 
7.3 Pre-enrollment (Visit 1) – Screening  
Screening tests may be completed in up to 3 sc reening visits to accommodate site-specific 
scheduling. It is recommended that  screening tests conducted in Visit 1 be completed within 
8 weeks preceding the biopsy visit. Bloodborne pathogen testing must be completed within 
30 days before the biopsy procedure. If more than  one visit is required, ad verse events that occur 
after the patient signs the consent form sha ll be recorded during s ubsequent visits.   
After providing informed consent, the patient will have a medical history (including a urinary 
incontinence-focused history), a physical examination (including assessment of vital signs), a 
clinical assessment, and a medication assessment. Urine samples will be collected to test for nitrites and leukocyte esterase. If th e urine test is positive for leukocyt e esterase or nitrites, then a

 urine culture may be pe rformed. The patient will undergo a bl adder stress test (please refer to 
Appendix A for the Instructions for the Bladde r Stress Test) and will complete a 24-hour pad 
test. Patients will be instructed on how to perfor m the 24-hour pad test (please refer to Appendix 
B for the Instructions for the 24-Hour Pad Test ) and will be provided with sufficient preweighed 
pads to complete the test. The completed 24-hour pad test must be returned before or at the next 
scheduled screening visit. A PVR urine volume will be measured with ultrasound/bladder scan. 
Patients will complete the following questionnai res: ICIQ, IQOL, PGI-S, I-PSS, and IIEF-5. 
Blood samples will be collected to assess for PSA levels, bloodborne pathogens, hematocrit, 
hemoglobin, WBC count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  or urea, and creatinine.  Patients will 
undergo cystoscopy for evaluation of the appearance of urethral and bladder tissue. An existing 
cystoscopy evaluation can be used if performed within  6 months prior to the ti me of consent. It is 
recommended that screening tests be performed from the least invasive test to the most invasive. 
Adverse events reported by the patient after in formed consent is obtained will be recorded. 
7.4 Point of Enrollment 
Patients are considered enrolled in the study at the time of the biopsy procedure. 
7.5 Medications Patients may be given medication (including for pa in or anxiety) according to each institution’s 
standard of care or at the physician’s discreti on. Additionally, patients should be maintained on a 
stable dose or frequency of me dication known to affect lower ur inary tract func tion or erectile 
dysfunction, including but not limited to, anticho linergics, beta 3 adrenerg ic receptor agonists, 
tricyclic antidepressants,  SNRI or SSRI antidepre ssants, diuretics, or alpha-adrenergic blockers, 
or phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, for at least 2 weeks prior to screening assessments and 
throughout the study. A course of prophylactic antib iotics will be given prior to the injection 
procedure. 
7.6 Biopsy (Visit 2) 
After patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will return to the clinic fo r an outpatient procedure 
in which muscle tissue is obtained using a needle  biopsy technique. Note that several passes of 
the biopsy needle may be required to obtain a satisfactory sample of muscle tissue. Additionally, 
if the first biopsy does not produce an adequate sample for product isolation, it may be necessary 
for the patient to return for another biopsy procedure. The maximum permissible number of 
Cook MyoSite, Incorporated  Version: 13-11-03 
  
AMDC-USR for Male SUI IND Clinical Trial  Version Da te: 17 November2015 
 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL
 Page 25 of 41 
 biopsy needle passes, and the total number of bi opsies, is contingent upo n patient tolerance and 
the satisfactory procurement of mu scle tissue. If the biopsy procedure is scheduled for more than 
30 days after the most recently completed bloodb orne pathogen tests,  the bloodborne pathogen 
tests (i.e., Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, and Syphilis) must be repeated before the biopsy 
procedure to confirm the patient’s continued elig ibility for study participation. Additionally, the 
medication log will be updated if necessary. Any adverse events occurring since the last visit or before, during, or after the biopsy procedure will  be recorded and repor ted as appropriate.  
7.6.1 Post-Biopsy Follow-up (Phone) 
Within 5 business days after the biopsy procedure, patients will be contacted by phone to 
determine whether any adverse events have occu rred and whether any updates to the medication 
log are necessary.  
7.7 Procedure (Visit 3) – Treatment Day 0  
Approximately 12-13 weeks after the muscle biopsy, pa tients will return to the clinic for a brief 
outpatient procedure. At the start of the visit or before the visit, patients will provide a completed 
24-hour pad test and complete the ICIQ, I QOL, PGI-S, I-PSS, IIEF-5 questionnaires. The 24-
hour pad test and questionnaire data collected on the day of injection will be used as the baseline 
data. Prophylactic antibiotic s will be given prior to the inject ion procedure. Prior to injection, 
patients will have a urine sample collected to te st for nitrites and leukocyt e esterase. If the urine 
test is positive for leukocyte es terase or nitrites, a urine culture must be performed and the 
injection will be delayed. A nega tive urine dipstick for leukocyte es terase and nitrites is required 
in order to undergo AMDC-USR injection. Ultras ound may be performed to aid in the injection 
procedure. Under direct vision, multiple injections will be performed to circumferentially 
distribute AMDC-USR within  the striated muscle of the urethral  sphincter. After the injection is 
completed, the injected area will be examined for any excessive bleeding or excessive trauma. 
Prior to discharge, patients will demonstrate a normal void and will have their PVR urine volume 
determined by ultrasound/bladder scan. The me dication log will be upda ted if necessary. Any 
adverse events occurring since the last visit or  before, during, or after the injection procedure 
will be recorded and reported as appropriate.

 7.9 Duration of Study and Patient Participation 
Patients are expected to particip ate in this study for approximately 2.5 years from the time of the 
first screening visit. This dur ation includes time for screening, biopsy, injection, and 24 months 
of follow-up. 
7.10 Criteria and Procedures for Withdrawal 
A patient may decide to withdraw from the study at any time either befo re or after undergoing 
study procedures without prejudice or loss of care . The patient should notify the investigator of 
his desire to withdraw. The inve stigator will notify the sponsor. The investigator may also decide 
to withdraw a patient from the study at any time  based on medical judgment.  In all instances of 
withdrawal, data collected up to the time of patient w ithdrawal, including th e study exit form and 
the appropriate study visit, shall be submitted to  the data coordinating center and shall include 
the reason why the patient has been withdrawn from the study. Patients will be asked to allow 
access to their medical records for 30 days after the date of withdrawal. Any data collected on 
the patient up to the point of withdrawal  plus 30 days may be used in the study. 
 
In the event a patient cannot be contacted for post-treatment assessments, at least 3 attempts may 
be made to locate the patient, and these effo rts will be documented. If the patient cannot be 
located, a lost to follow-up entry will be submitted. 
7.11 Participation Endpoints of the Study 
A patient’s participation in the study  will end after any of the following: 
 
 Patient completed all scheduled c linical evaluations to 24 months; 
 Patient withdrew or was lost to follow-up; 
 Patient received nonstudy treatment for SUI (e.g., injection of  a bulking agent or 
completed surgery for a sling); 
 Study closed; or 
 Patient died.

 8.0  Statistical Considerations 
8.1 Hypothesis to be Tested 
This is a preliminary, prospective, single-arm study to assess the safety of AMDC-USR in males 
with SUI. The study is not powered statistically for any measurable outcomes. 
8.2 Sample Size 
The study will treat up to 30 patients at up to 5 clin ical sites. Because this is a preliminary study, 
no formal statistical determination of sample size was performed. 
8.3 General Analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® for Windows® (release 9.3 or higher) or other 
widely accepted statistical softwa re. Continuous variables will be reported as means and standard 
deviations unless otherwise noted. Categorical vari ables will be reported as  percents. Ninety-five 
percent (95%) confidence intervals for all endpoint variables will be presented. Survival analysis 
techniques such as Kaplan-Mei er or Cox Proportional Hazards ma y be incorporated if censoring 
of data occurs. 
8.4 Missing Data 
Missing data may be addressed using complete case analysis or multiple imputation. 
8.5 Limitations of the Study 
This preliminary study with a small sample size may limit the ability to generalize results to a 
larger population. The sample size is insufficien t to allow definitive statements regarding 
efficacy. Patients will serve as their own controls  with quantitative and qu alitative measures of 
incontinence assessed before treatment and compared  to the same measures at various times after 
treatment.

 9.0 Deviations from Clinical Investigation Plan 
Investigators are not allowed to deviate from this CIP without pr ior authorization by the sponsor 
except under emergency situations when necessary to  preserve the rights, safety, or well-being of 
study patients. 
 Deviations and noncompliances will  be recorded together with an explanation. Deviations or 
noncompliances that impact the ri ghts, welfare, or safety of pa tients shall be reported to the 
sponsor and the IRB/REB as requi red and as soon as possible. 
 If appropriate, corrective and preventive actions will be discussed by the sponsor, investigator, or 
the IRB/REB to determine a suitable course of action. 
10.0 Data Collection and Reporting 
10.1 Electronic Case Report Forms 
Patient data will be collected and entered by traine d personnel at the clinical site into electronic 
Case Report Forms (eCRFs) through an electronic data capturing (EDC) system. This is a secure, 
web-based system, allowing those with permission  to access data from any location at any time. 
Source data is to be retained for data en tered into the EDC system. Data obtained and 
simultaneously entered into the EDC system may also serve as source documentation. Site 
personnel are required to undergo data entry tr aining and will have unique login names and 
passwords in order to enter patient data. In accordance with 21 CFR Part 11, the EDC system 
creates a secure, computer-generated, time stamped audit trail to record the date and time of 
operator entries and actions that create, modify, or delete electronic records. 
10.2 Data Reporting  
Progress reports and a final report at the conclu sion of the clinical study will be submitted by the 
investigators and sponsor to the regulatory authorities and IRB/RE B as required by local 
regulations.

 11.0 Data Management 
11.1 Data Entry and Data Review 
Each principal investigator or a ppropriately trained designee shall enter the clinical data into the 
EDC system on standardized CRFs. Investigators will provide all applicable clinical data and 
documentation to the sponsor. Patient data and doc uments pertaining to the study will be kept 
and archived by the sponsor. Data will be reviewed for missing data, data consistency, and 
reasonableness of responses. Discrepancies wi ll be resolved through a formal query process 
involving direct contact with inve stigators or research coordinato rs. The data coordinating center 
is responsible for database management, data ve rification, data archivi ng, and data retention. 
 As needed to assist the sponsor in its research (e.g., during evaluation of an adverse event), data 
will be accessible to the spons or, the participating investig ators, the manufacturer, and 
companies or individuals the sponsor authorizes. 
 Cook Research Incorporated the data coordinating center, is p hysically located in the United 
States. Therefore, information collected within a country outside of the United States will be 
transmitted to the United States. Personal information will be protected by fair trade practices and in accordance with all applicable laws.  
11.2 Data Monitoring Arrangements 
The conduct of the clinical study will be supervised through a process of centralized and on-site 
monitoring. The data coordinating center will remotely monitor th e study for data completeness 
and for adverse events. On-site monitoring will  be implemented as ne cessary throughout the 
course of the study. The investigator/institu tion will provide direct access to source 
data/documents for study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/REB review, and regulatory inspection. Written procedures for monitoring the study are maintained by the data coordinating 
center and are summarized in Appendix C. 
12.0 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events 
Adverse events are to be reported to the data coordinating center using the appropriate CRF. In 
cases of adverse drug reactions or SAEs, completed forms will be submitted to the data

 coordinating center as soon as possible upon knowl edge of the event. The data coordinating 
center will review the information submitted fo r possible reporting to the sponsor. Adverse 
events will be assessed in terms of relationshi p to product, relationshi p to biopsy procedure, 
relationship to injection procedure, severit y, subsequent treatment/intervention required, and 
resolution status. Follow-up of all adverse events  will be conducted per institutional standard of

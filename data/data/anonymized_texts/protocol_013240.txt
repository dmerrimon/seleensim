Title: A Pilot Study of Oral Calcitriol in Patients at High Risk for Lung Cancer
Sponsor:  NCI
Phase:Primary Objectives
To determine the toxicity profile of an oral dose of calcitriol 45 mcg every other week (QOW) in patients at high risk of lung cancer.
Overview of the Study Design:  The FDA has requested that a toxicity trial of calcitriol be 
completed in subjects without cancer using a 45 mcg dose at a lower frequency than was proposed in the previously approved Phase II lung cancer prevention trial. The FDA concerns focus on the lack of evidence of the safety of calcitriol in “healthy” patients who do not have cancer. However, the high risk lung cancer cohort at RPCI is comprised of patients with moderate to severe COPD. In order to document both the toxicity profile of calcitriol at this dose and frequency in high risk subject we have designed a Pilot study. This design incorporates a single-arm toxicity study of 20 patients.
In the proposed “Pilot single-armed pilot study” of 45 mcg of calcitriol, PO, QOW, 
dosing will continue for 3-months with a defined toxicity monitoring schedule outlined below. A total of 40 patients will be recruited from the High Risk Lung Cancer Screening Clinic and once screened and consented; they will be assigned to calcitriol (n=40). Once 20 patients on calcitriol have completed the 3-month treatment, an interim analysis of adverse events will be performed.  Specific criteria for early stopping are outlined below. If the DSMB review of the interim analysis supports proceeding, the remaining 20 patients will be recruited into the trial. A follow-up bronchoscopy will be performed on all subjects after the end of the intervention period according to their routine follow-up schedule.

Target Study/Duration : A total of 40 patients will be recruited. The intervention is planned 
for 3 months and the total duration of the study is expected to last 11 years.
Patient Population: Male or female patients at least 40 years old and younger than 80 
years old, former and current smokers, who on a previous bronchoscopy had at least on metaplasia or dysplasia diagnosed, who do not have lung cancer and who are eligible for a second bronchoscopy.
Primary Endpoints:
To determine the number of patients with Grade III-IV toxicities or any Grade II toxicities that last more than two weeks  associated with a 45 mcg dose of calcitriol administered 
every other week (QOW) in this population of patients at high risk of lung cancer.
Brief Statistical Section:
We will test the null hypothesis that the proportion of grade 3-4 toxicities and grade 2 toxicities lasting more than 2 weeks will be 10% versus the one-sided alternative that the proportion of grade 3-4 toxicities will be greater than 10%.  Given a sample size of n=40, assuming an alpha level 0.05, we will have 80% power to detect the proportion of toxicities of 15% or larger.  An interim analysis will be performed after the first 20 subjects on calcitriol have completed the study.   The study can be stopped early if the requirements of the null hypothesis (that this dose of calcitriol dose not result in an excess of DTL reports) are met that <= 1 toxicity is observed. After a full review of the data is completed by the DSMB the results will be reported to the FDA.  Otherwise, the remaining 20 subjects on calcitriol will be recruited and at treated the end of the study period (3 months), at which point we will either reject the null hypothesis (if 8 or more toxicities are observed) or not reject the null hypothesis if 7 or less toxicities are observed.APPROVED RP CI IRB

The primary aim of this proposal is to establish the safety of calcitriol in this population of 
high risk lung cancer patients, who do not have cancer. With the safety data generated from this trial, these investigators will be able to proceed with a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial of 45 mcg of calcitriol QW, as previously approved.
Occurrence of Lung Cancer: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the 
United States, and is a massive public health problem worldwide. It is estimated that 1.2 million people are diagnosed with lung cancer on an annual basis (1). Although there is clinical evidence that the survival of lung cancer dramatically improves with the diagnosis of disease at earlier stages (2-5) and the staging system for lung cancer is based on this relationship (6), the overwhelming majority of lung cancer patients have advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival for lung cancer is only 15%, despite the integration of new chemotherapy agents into surgical and radiotherapy treatment (1).
Target Population for Lung Cancer The increase in lung cancer since 1923 is directly 
related to cigarette smoking (7). At present, approximately 25% of the US adult population smokes, and 40-50 million Americans are former smokers. Although reduction of cigarette smoking will be helpful to reduce lung cancer incidence, the risk of developing lung cancer for former smokers does not decay for decades after smoking cessation (8, 9). Smokers who develop chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) have additional risk for the development of lung cancer (10-12). 
 The relative risk of lung cancer in individuals with high 
levels of exposure to asbestos is 15:1 and the observed risk for those with both tobacco and asbestos exposure is dramatically higher (13). 
 Prior aerodigestive tract cancers may 
also be thought of as risk factor for the development of a second primary lung cancer (14-16). Patients who are current or former smokers with multiple risk factors including COPD, asbestos exposure, or prior aerodigestive tract cancer are at high risk for lung cancer, and are the most likely to benefit from early detection strategies,(17) and ultimately from chemoprevention interventions (18).
Chemoprevention Trials in Lung Cancer: Primary chemoprevention trials have examined 
the use of vitamin E and vitamin A (19, 20), which failed to demonstrate benefit in the prevention of lung cancer in smokers. Tertiary chemoprevention  trials are aimed at the 
prevention of second primary cancers in individuals who have been previously treated for cancer showed that 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) seemed to prevent second primary tumors in resected head and neck cancer patients (21)
 and retinol palmitate reduced 
second primary tumors in patients with resected lung cancer. (22). A large randomized follow up study by EUROSCAN failed to confirm benefit from retinol palmitate in the prevention of second primary lung cancers (23). In a subsequent NCI multicenter Phase III placebo-controlled, randomized trial of isotretinoin, the rate of second primary tumors, recurrences, and mortality were not reduced in 1166 patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)(24). Furthermore, secondary multivariate and subset analyses suggested that isotretinoin was in fact harmful in current smokers and beneficial only in never smokers. Primary and tertiary chemoprevention trials are typically large randomized phase III efforts that require expenditure of considerable resources, and it is reasonable to propose that candidate chemoprevention agents first show activity on a smaller scale. Lee conducted a secondary chemoprevention trial in 152 smokers with biopsy-confirmed metaplasia or dysplasia of the lung epithelium, and found that isotretinoin (13-cRA) (I APPROVED RP CI IRB
8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 8 of 42mg/kg) did not cause regression of the lesion when compared to placebo (25). A summary 
of secondary chemoprevention trials for lung cancer is shown in Table 1.
In a more recent study from the same institution (26) 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) was 
compared with 13-cRA plus α-tocopherol, or placebo. This group of 226 former smokers 
were randomly assigned to treatment groups and re-evaluated in 3 months. Six biopsies 
from predetermined sites were evaluated. The results showed that while neither treatment 
affected that histology of the sites, 9-cis-RA did restore the RAR β (retinoic acid receptor) in 
a significant number of lesions. Another generic difficulty with bronchoscopy-based 
secondary prevention trials is the possibility that the endobronchial biopsy itself may alter the natural history of metaplasia, or even be “curative” of small areas of dysplasia. Biomarkers are keenly sought as surrogate endpoints for chemoprevention trials (27). On the other hand, it is problematic to find agents that activate biomarkers but fail to reverse intraepithelial premalignant lesions (28, 29). For this reason, it is critical to evaluate biomarkers taken from targeted areas of abnormal epithelial proliferation, as detected by AF bronchoscopy (30).

Date: 07/11/2017 Page 9 of 42Vitamin D (Calcitriol) Characteristics and Metabolism: Vitamin D is a steroid hormone, 
which modulates calcium homeostasis through actions on kidney, bone and the intestinal tract (40). Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydro-cholesterol in response to ultraviolet light, is 25-hydroxylated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in the liver and 1-hydroxylated to the active  form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) in the kidney (40). 
In addition to classical effects on bone and mineral metabolism, calcitriol is also involved in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of different cell types and tissues (41, 42). Physiologic daily production is normally 0.5 to 1.0 mcg and is usually higher during periods of active bone synthesis (40).
Vitamin D as a Chemopreventive Agent: Calcitriol is also a potent anti-proliferative agent in 
a wide variety of malignant cell types. Calcitriol and other vitamin D analogues have clear chemopreventive and pro-differentiative effects in prostate, breast and leukemic cancer models (43-45)  as well as lung cancer cell systems (46, 47).
  It is well documented that 
calcitriol is anti-proliferative to numerous tumor cell types, including lung cancer cell lines by our group and others (see references in background of project 2). Tumor cells, especially epithelial tumor types express significant levels of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and even at relatively low doses of calcitriol (both in vitro and in vivo), cells undergo apoptosis and significant cell cycle arrest. The actions of calcitriol formulations, and not specific to the form used in this trial may be mediated by non-genomic mechanisms (48).
  
Like the retinoids, the actions of vitamin D analogues in general are mediated, in part, through a nuclear receptor, and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is commonly expressed in lung cancer cell lines (49-52).
  In the lung, Vitamin D contributes to genomic stability, and 
also stimulates DNA synthesis in adult alveolar II cells and provides a novel mechanism of modulation of epithelial cell proliferation in the context of lung development and repair against injury (48).
Studies highlight 2 pathways that are important in the metabolism of calcitriol. The first 
pathway involves the 24-hydroxylase as the first step in catabolism of calcitriol. This enzyme is present in the kidneys as well as in other target organs that express VDR such as the intestine. The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield 1 α, 25R- (OH)
 2-26, 23S-
lactone D3. The lactone form is the major circulating metabolite in humans. Enterohepatic recycling and biliary excretion of calcitriol occurs. The metabolites of calcitriol are excreted primarily in feces. After a 1 mcg oral dose of radiolabeled calcitriol was given, 10% of the radiolabeled dose appeared in urine with 24 hours. No data is available on the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol in patients with hepatic dysfunction. The elimination half-life in patients with chronic renal failure increased by at least 2 fold compared to patients with normal renal function.
2. PRELIMINARY DATA
In this section we will describe our work with calcitriol as a potential drug for 
chemoprevention, including the rationale for the proposed dosage schedule.
Studies with Calcitriol:  Our research group has extensive experience in the development of 
vitamin D-based approaches to cancer therapy. We have recently initiated trials in early prostate cancer with an eye toward chemoprevention and early disease therapy APPROVED RP CI IRB
8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 10 of 42applications. By employing an intermittent dosing schedule we have been able to 
administer extremely high doses of calcitriol without dose-limiting toxicity. 
Calcitriol and Cancer Biomarkers: The antiproliferative activity of calcitriol in squamous cell 
carcinoma lines (SCC) is associated with decreased p21 expression in vitro and in vivo (53). Recent studies indicate that p21 suppression increases sensitivity to paclitaxel (54, 55). We have examined the molecular accompaniments of paclitaxel cytotoxicity with and without calcitriol in the human prostatic adenocarcinoma, PC-3.  The in vitro  effects of 
calcitriol and paclitaxel on p21, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in PC-3 were evaluated by Western blot. Treatment in vitro  with calcitriol resulted in 
a decrease in p21 expression in PC-3. Paclitaxel induced apoptosis in PC-3 as evidenced by the time-dependent loss of procaspase-3 and full-length PARP. Paclitaxel caused increase of p21 and loss of Bcl-2.  An increase was observed in PARP cleavage in PC-3 treated with calcitriol/paclitaxel as compared to paclitaxel alone (53).
We found that levels of the pro-survival molecule phospho-Akt were reduced by the 
combination of calcitriol and paclitaxel to a greater extent than either agent alone (46). However, expression of the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule MEKK-1, while being little affected by paclitaxel, was modestly up-regulated by calcitriol alone, and much further up-regulated by the combination. The synergistic increase in MEKK-1 expression for the combination was accompanied by the generation of a slightly faster migrating MEKK-1 species (to form a doublet), as well as multiple MEKK-1 species of lower molecular weight.  These species of MEKK-1 appear to result from N-terminal proteolysis and may represent constitutively active forms of MEKK-1 (46).
Calcitriol can modulate the expression of the EGFR (56)  and also increases EGF 
binding. We have observed that treatment of SCC cells with calcitriol leads to an increase in EGFR protein levels, (57) particularly in the population of cells that remain adherent to the tissue culture flask. The up regulation of EGFR protein correlates with a recent report indicating that calcitriol inhibits the degradation of EGFR mRNA (44).  In addition, while the levels of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt, two downstream targets of EGFR signaling, are markedly reduced in the subset of cells that detach from the tissue culture plate and are apoptotic after treatment with calcitriol; these effects are much less pronounced in the cells that remain adherent (45).
The cdk inhibitors p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip are implicated in G
1 phase arrest (58). 
In HL-60 cells, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, calcitriol arrests cells in G 1; this 
effect is mediated through an increase in p27 (59). Calcitriol mediated arrest in G 0/G1 is 
also observed in human breast cancer lines (45). Calcitriol induces apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (55)
 as well as in HL-60 leukemic cells (42) and the expression of Bcl-2 
is down-regulated by calcitriol in HL-60, and in retinoblastoma cells (60).
Animal studies with calcitriol:  In multiple model systems (murine/human SCC, 
metastatic Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma (MLL) and the human xenograft PC-3/LnCAP prostate, MV522 lung, Capan-1 pancreatic), calcitriol has significant antiproliferative effects in vitro and in vivo (53, 61-63).
We have shown that an increase in vivo clonogenic cell kill actually results in a 
decrease in the fractional tumor in a murine model of squamous cell carcinoma. Using a direct measurement of clonogenic cell kill, we have been able to show that the administration of Vitamin D
3 for 3 days in tumor bearing mice resulted in a significant 
increase in cell kill, which was enhanced by dexamethasone (64). We have also shown similar antitumor activity with Vitamin D
3 analogues, Ro23-7553, and Ro25-6760 in both 8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 11 of 42murine squamous cell carcinoma, and also in the rat Dunning adenocarcinoma prostate 
model system (61). When Ro23-7553 is given intraperitoneally (IP) to C3H/HeJ mice bearing squamous cell carcinoma, there is a modest decrease in the surviving fraction of tumor cells, and an increase in the delay of regrowth of the tumor cells, and this antitumor effect is enhanced by cisplatin (65). We have found that even a single dose of D
3 was 
enough to slow tumor growth significantly in the murine model.  When these animals received a daily dose of D
3 for 3 days, even further decreases in fractional tumor volume 
are observed, when compared with saline control injections (53)
In the prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line, PC-3, in nude mice, neither paclitaxel nor 
Vitamin D 3 does appear to have independent anti-tumor activity. When given together for 
prostate adenocarcinoma, the regimen did result in a decreased rate of tumor growth, even in previously treated tumors. In the murine squamous cell carcinoma model, the single-agent anti-tumor activity of D
3 was not only confirmed when compared with saline 
injections, but also appeared to be synergistic with paclitaxel (63).
The mechanism of antitumor activity may be independent of the Vitamin D receptor.  
When VDR knockout mice with high endogenous levels of D 3 are transfected with the 
Lewis lung carcinoma gene, there is a significant inhibition of metastatic growth of lung cancer cells (66). In the metastatic rat Mat-LyLu (MLL) model, calcitriol not only causes inhibition of tumor growth, but significant reduction in the number and size of lung metastasis (62). These findings suggest that D
3 may work as an intrinsic factor for lung 
cancer prevention in intact animals. Promotion of tumor growth by calcitriol has not been observed in animal models.
Clinical Trials with calcitriol: The early clinical trials of calcitriol were in leukemia and 
myelodysplasia and utilized low dose calcitriol QD or QOD. Although some evidence of response was seen, the results were largely disappointing due to hypercalcemia (67-69).  Calcitriol causes hypercalcemia by increasing intestinal calcium absorption and mobilizing bone stores (70). Schedule and administration of calcitriol appear to impact in the ability to give larger doses of drug. While substantial dose escalation is possible without toxicity, the oral route of administration is complicated by concerns regarding inter-patient variability and apparent saturability of oral absorption. Since 1999, we initiated six clinical trials and completed five with one ongoing as detailed below.  The first trial was a phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and MTD of calcitriol following subcutaneous (sc) QOD 
administration (71). Thirty-six patients were entered at doses ranging from 2 μg to 10μg 
QOD; dose-limiting toxicity (hypercalcemia) occurred in 3 of 3 patients entered at the 10 μg 
QOD dose. Hypercalcuria occurred at all dose levels examined. No other toxicity was seen. 
Serum calcitriol levels by radioimmunoassay revealed a decrease in concentration-time curves on the seventh day compared to the first day of therapy. A dose dependent increase in peak serum level and estimated area under the curve (AUC) were seen; the maximum 
serum levels occurred at the 10 μg QOD dose: 288 ± 74 pg/mL and 321 ± 36 pg/mL days 1 
and 7 respectively. The normal range of calcitriol serum concentrations using this assay is 
16-56 pg/mL. Serum calcitriol levels were maintained at near peak concentrations for at least 8 hr following sc. injection. Other studies have evaluated oral calcitriol pulse dosing once weekly. In a phase I dose escalation of weekly oral calcitriol, no dose limiting toxicities were noted (72). Dose escalation was halted at the 2.8 mcg/kg level. No increases in serum calcitriol concentrations were noted at dose levels exceeding 0.48mcg/kg suggesting saturation of vitamin D gastrointestinal absorption. This phase I trial demonstrated that 
patients could tolerate weekly oral dosing of calcitriol at 0.5 μg/kg or 40 μg per 70kg patient 
without significant toxicity (72).APPROVED RP CI IRB

(80μg/m2 weekly x 6) + escalating doses of calcitriol, once daily for three days per week 
(TIW) for 6 weeks. The starting dose of calcitriol was 4 μg orally TIW, and we have entered 
patients through the 38 μg dose level where it appears that we have reached saturable 
concentrations at 16 -20 μg. No limiting toxicity has been encountered. The study design 
called for administration of paclitaxel on day 1 cycle 1 of therapy prior to any calcitriol 
therapy and on day 3 with the third dose of calcitriol week two and all-subsequent weeks. This permitted the evaluation of the effect of calcitriol on paclitaxel pharmacokinetics – week 1 versus week 2. No changes in peak concentration, AUC or T 1/2 have been noted.
Calcitriol Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were required in at least 2 
of 3 patients at each dose level of the calcitriol/paclitaxel clinical trial and were performed in 
26 of the 36 patients; six patients at the highest dose level (38 μg) underwent PK studies 
(74). Baseline plasma calcitriol concentrations of the 26 cancer patients resulted in a 
median concentration of 26 pg/ml (range 13-81). The normal range for this assay is 16-74pg/ml.  Serum calcitriol concentrations higher than baseline occurred within an hour of oral calcitriol administration. A scatter plot of the maximum concentration of calcitriol (Cmax) for each patient studied at each dose level is portrayed in Figure 1.
As shown in Figure 2, baseline-subtracted serum calcitriol AUC0->24hr (area under 
the concentration-time curve for the 24 hour period after calcitriol administration) is plotted 
against dose. A fit to the Michaelis Menten function (AUC = a ×dose/ (1 + b ×dose) indicates 
that AUC0->24hr is not proportional to dose (a = 540 ± 140 pg-hr/ml- μg; if AUC were 
proportional to dose, b would equal 0). A statistical test for proportionality gives a p-value of 
0.0014.APPROVED RP CI IRB

serum calcium and dose. No patient became hypercalcemic. We initiated a phase I clinical

15, 20, 26,35,47,63 μg) to toxicity (hypercalcemia) with PK performed at each dose level.  
This study is currently at the 34 μg and continues to accrue. To assess the calcitriol 
bioavailability issue and to determine PK differences with regard to dose and route of 
administration, we compared the PK data from our oral calcitriol phase I studies, as described above, with the DN101 (an oral reformulation of calcitriol, a product of Novacea) phase I trial (75) and our current ongoing phase I trial using IV calcitriol. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, both Cmax and AUC increased in a dose-dependent manner using both intravenous (IV) calcitriol and DN101 with IV calcitriol resulting in a higher Cmax and AUC at each dose level tested. The administration of oral calcitriol did not increase proportionally at equivalent doses when compared to either IV calcitriol or DN101. Key to clinical trial design is relating serum calcitriol levels in animals that resulted in a significant antitumor effect to human serum levels. In both mice and rats, the AUC for calcitriol from both IV and intraperitoneal (IP) routes of administration was not significantly different with IV resulting in a higher Cmax as compared to IP (76). Peak levels are reached at 1 hr and return to 
normal at 24 hr following 0.125 and 0.5 μg of calcitriol. Both 0.125 and 0.5 μg when 
administered to tumor-bearing mice, result in a significant anti-tumor response. No diurnal 
variation was observed in serum calcitriol levels during the 24 hr sampling period.  A similar pattern was obtained for PK parameters of calcitriol in tumor-bearing mice (data not shown). To determine whether the mouse serum calcitriol levels that resulted in an anti-tumor effect could ever be achieved in man, we compared AUC and Cmax levels obtained 
in the calcitriol/paclitaxel Phase I clinical trial where we have administered 38 μg daily x 3 
without toxicity. As shown in Table 3, at 0.125 μg (the lowest dose to consistently result in a 
significant antitumor effect in mice), the AUC was 37.3 ng/hr/ml and this compares in man 
at 38 μg to 7.5 ng/hr/ml. Similarly, in mice the Cmax was 9.2 ng/ml and this compared to 
1.4 ng/ml in man. At the 0.042 μg dose in mice, an antitumor effect could be seen but was 
not consistently observed. Therefore, effective serum calcitriol levels are 5-7 times higher in 
mice than compared to highest oral dose administered in man (38 μg). As described above, 
this dose, by this route of administration may not result in higher serum calcitriol levels due 
to decreased bioavailability.

The toxicity from chronic administration of calcitriol 45 mcg PO QW is unknown in a 
healthy cancer-free population, but it is the dose that has been well-tolerated with little toxicity in other trials. Single dose of calcitriol as DN-101 in healthy volunteers and repeat dosing DN-101 in cancer patients has been well tolerated (77). In the single dose study in patients with advanced malignancies, hyponatremia was observed in 32%.  In the same study, when calcitriol was given weekly (78), hyponatremia was only observed in patients receiving docetaxel and was not observed in patients receiving docetaxel with calcitriol (77).

Conclusions regarding calcitriol studies: Calcitriol regulates the transcription of a 
large number of target genes via its interactions with the vitamin D receptor, and exhibits modulation of many targets including Bcl-2, EGFR, and AKT. Calcitriol exhibits antiproliferative activity in a broad range of tumors, including lung cancer cell lines. Our animal data for lung cancer is based on squamous cell carcinoma models (rather than adenocarcinoma models), and provides a rationale for using calcitriol in the chemoprevention of central squamous-based premalignancy. Oral calcitriol given QD 3X weekly at the 16mcg level provides tissue saturation and has virtually no toxicity. Calcitriol given as 45mcg QW has been well tolerated in cancer patients but the toxicity profile in non-cancer patients must be documented.
Lung Cancer: Early Detection Research: Our research group has extensive with the early 
detection of lung cancer. We have developed a lung cancer screening clinic for high risk patients, and have implemented an ongoing clinical trial, which utilizes autofluorescence bronchoscopy and low-dose spiral CT of the chest for early detection of lung cancer. We prospectively follow a cohort of high risk patients with premalignant epithelial abnormalities with an eye toward chemoprevention and early disease therapy applications.
Overview: The High Risk Lung Cancer Cohort at RPCI: The lung cancer-screening program 
at RPCI was established in 1998. This screening program incorporates an epidemiologic questionnaire, physical examination, and chest x-ray, low-dose spiral CT of the chest without contrast, induced sputum, and autofluorescence (AF) bronchoscopy with white light (WL) bronchoscopy. High risk patients have been recruited from several sources:  1) asbestos litigation firms refer asbestos clients with radiographically confirmed asbestosis 8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 16 of 42for medico-legal evaluation at RPCI. Many of these individuals are smokers with a very 
high risk of lung cancer 2) patients with surgically treated aerodigestive tract cancers who are disease-free are referred by the department of surgery at RPCI for evaluation in the lung cancer screening program, and 3) Community patients with moderate or severe COPD and are referred by pulmonologists and primary care physicians in the community for evaluation in the lung cancer screening program. The outreach effort associated with this prevention and screening program has included public speaking, press releases, media interviews and the production of a color brochure that is distributed to local pulmonary and oncology offices in the community. Of the high-risk patients who have undergone AF bronchoscopy at RPCI, at least 58% have been identified with bronchial epithelial metaplasia or dysplasia. These individuals are followed in the lung cancer-screening clinic with serial AF bronchoscopy.  Based on our experience, there are sufficient numbers of patients currently in the cohort to meet the recruitment needs of this pilot study.
3.  METHODS
1. STUDY PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES
The Primary Hypothesis  for this study is that high-dose calcitriol 45 mcg. QOW will be 
well tolerated in a group of patients at high risk of lung cancer. 
The Primary Objectives  for this trial are as follows:
1. To establish the safety of a 45 mcg dose of oral calcitriol QOW in non-cancer 
patients. Forty patients from the RPCI high risk lung cancer cohort will be recruited to 45 
mcg of oral calcitriol QOW (n=40) for a period of 3 months. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported to the FDA at the end of the study, regardless of relationship to the expected side effects of calcitriol.  Patients will be on the study for 3 
months. When the first 20 patients on calcitriol have completed the 3-month treatment, an interim analysis will be performed to determine the degree of dose-limiting toxicities associated with every other week administration.

Eligibility Determination: Subjects will be seen at the RPCI screening clinic and their 
eligibility for the pilot study will be determined. If they agree to participate, they will be asked to sign the IRB approved informed consent. At this time (Month 0) they will have blood, collected, complete the study questionnaires. Vitamin D status will be measured at baseline. A medical history, a complete smoking exposure history as per standard clinic routine, enrollment into the DBBR and vitamin/supplement use information as per EMR medication record will also be completed at this time.
Month 0, Day 1 Subjects will receive their 3-month supply of capsules in a labeled blister 
pack at this time from the study nurse. At this time the PK/PD studies will be initiated.
Pharmacokinetics:
Pharmacokinetics Sampling Times: PK samples will be collected at pre-dose and at 
hours 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and post-dose 24 hours on Day 2. Samples of blood (4 ml) will be 
collected in EDTA tubes centrifuged at 4° C and serum is stored frozen at -80°C until analysis by RIA (see attached protocol for analytical details). Derivation of PK parameters and modeling is described below. Serum Chemistry for 25-D3 levels will be measured at baseline. The measurement of the calcitriol levels will be performed in the PK/PD facility at RPCI. One aliquot of buffy coat (lymphocytes) will be collected from these samples and stored at -80C. These aliquots will be sent to the Prevention Laboratory and stored until requested by Dr. Dhillon for pharmacogenomics analysis.
Blood samples will be made available through DBBR Vitamin D (BIOKIT IV) (RPCI 
approved protocol I 03103), after the patient has been consented for DBBR. All samples and associated data from DBBR will be stripped of PHI and provided with a new study ID prior to receipt.  Per protocol, the DBBR will maintain the key between the participant's PHI and study ID. Only the DBBR staff (Principal Investigator and Data Manager) associated with operating the bank have access to this link.  The key will never be given to the investigator of this study.Blood samples will be collected and stored for future studies by the RPCI Data Bank and Bio Repository (DBBR), per Standard Operating Procedures for vitamin D trial banking. The DBBR is a shared resource (RPCI protocol I 03103), where participants are consented to donate blood for research (prior to and following treatments), to complete an epidemiologic questionnaire, and to give permission to have their blood specimens linked to the questionnaire and clinical data including diagnosis and laboratory test results for research. Collected biospecimens and/or data are provided to investigators with RPCI IRB approved research protocols.
Other samples will be made available through Lung Cancer Screening Program 
(EDR 11003). The samples and associated data from Lung Cancer Screening Program will be stripped of PHI and provided with a new study ID prior to receipt.  Lung Cancer Screening Program will maintain the key between the participant's PHI and study ID.

information from DBBR will be linked to Lung Cancer Screening Program database by staff members in Lung Cancer Screening Program.
Weekly Blood Evaluations:  After the first dose on calcitriol is taken on Day 1, and the PK 
study has been done, the patients will return for blood collection on Day 2 (24 hours after the first dose) and on the same day of the week after the pill is taken (Day 16) for the first month of treatment (encompassing two doses) and then monthly for the remainder of the 3-month study period. The patient will not be seen in the clinic but will go directly to phlebotomy. Blood collection will then be done at the end of Months 2 and 3, when the patient is seen by the clinic nurse for toxicity assessment (Weekly blood evaluations may be collected at participating sites).
Phone Calls for Pill Reminders and Toxicity Monitoring:   The CRC will call each patient 
the day before the pill is due to be taken and on the day after the calcitriol is taken, to ask about all potential AE and SAE reactions. If the patient has started taking the treatment on Monday, the nurse may call the patient on Friday before. During these phone calls, the CRC will also assess compliance to the treatment schedule.
Study Clinical Visits and Closeout Visit (Months 1, 2 and 3):  Each month that patient 
will come into the clinic at RPCI (or participating sites) and have a toxicity evaluation performed by the clinic nurse. At the end of the three month period, patients will return to the clinic at RPCI (or participating site) and have a final blood draw and toxicity evaluation. The blood collected will be immediately processed to yield the samples for calcium. All remaining samples will be archived at –86 degrees for future analyses. At each clinical visit, the clinic nurse will interview subjects for the onset of new illnesses or hospitalizations, changes in smoking, vitamin supplement use, and potential symptoms related to calcitriol toxicity as per standard clinic routine. The bronchoscopy will be done after the cessation of the intervention and according to the patient’s routine follow-up schedule.
Procedures for Toxicity Monitoring and Reporting:  The study nurse will assess 
potential toxicities during each phone call. If a subject reports changes in any of these symptoms, they will be documented as an AE and graded according to CTCAE 4.0. If the patient reports an AE of > 3 grade, it will be reported to the PI or the treating physician to 
determine if they need to be evaluated at Roswell Park. The complete toxicity information will be reported to the medical director, Dr. Samjot Dhillon, at the time of continuing review. Reports regarding toxicity, patient safety, and study progress will be submitted to the RPCI Institutional Review Board (IRB), FDA and to the NCI at the end of the study. The risks and side effects that have been reported to be associated with calcitriol include:

Calcitriol (1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is the biologically active form of vitamin D. It is 
commercially available as an oral formulation of calcitriol designed specifically for high-dose, intermittent administration. In this protocol it will be studied in individuals at high-risk to develop lung cancer.
Because of the substantial preclinical data documenting the potent anti-cancer activity of 
calcitriol, clinical studies were conducted in various solid tumors with the currently marketed formulation of calcitriol using various routes and regimens. While efficacy was suggested in APPROVED RP CI IRB
8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 27 of 42several studies, hypercalcemia was dose limiting in these studies. Moreover, plasma levels 
did not reach those that would be predicted to have anti-cancer activity.
Investigators discovered that intermittent dosing with calcitriol permits substantial dose
escalation. The maximum dose of calcitriol tested was 2.8 μg/kg PO. Plasma calcitriol 
reached a plateau at doses ≥ 0.5 μg/kg PO at levels predicted to be associated with anti-
cancer activity without causing dose limiting hypercalcemia. The safety of 0.5 μg/kg 
calcitriol PO qw was supported by clinical data in over 70 subjects with prostate cancer in three Phase 2 studies. The efficacy of calcitriol was suggested by open-label studies in subjects with AIPC when the drug was administered as either a single agent or in combination with docetaxel.
A Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study of DN-101 was carried out to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of DN-101 (another formulation of calcitriol) in 38 subjects with advanced malignancies. An initial dose of up to 165 μg DN-101 PO was not 
associated with DLTs, so the MTD was not determined. The MTD for repeat weekly dosing in this study was defined as 45 μg PO qw based on the occurrence of transient, 
asymptomatic Grade 2 hypercalcemia in two subjects who were treated at 60 μg PO qw for 
nine weeks. The PK of DN-101 was linear and predictable; there was no evidence of saturation of absorption.
Enrollment and treatment in a Phase 2 study of DN-101 in subjects with MDS has been 
completed. DN-101 was well-tolerated in the 37 subjects treated in this study. The study was closed to further enrollment when the Simon optimal two-stage analysis, which allowed an early study stop if the true rate of erythroid response was ≤ 30%; did not demonstrate 
the pre-specified number of responses for allowing continuation of the study.
Risks to Subjects Participating in Clinical Studies of Calcitriol Observed Risks: In 
monotherapy studies in subjects with malignancies, calcitriol has been well-tolerated. Low grade hypercalcemia (generally Grade 1) was the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) in 22% of subjects. Two of 6 subjects treated with 60 μg DN-101 weekly in the Phase I 
study and 3 of 37 subjects with MDS treated with 45 μg DN-101 weekly developed transient 
Grade 2 hypercalcemia. Other commonly reported AEs of low grade (Grade 1) include fatigue (14%), nausea (6%), increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (5%), increase in serum creatinine (5%), hyperglycemia (5%), and anorexia (5%). Three different subjects reported a Grade 3 hyponatremia, proteinuria, or hypercholesterolemia, and one subject reported a Grade 4 hypercholesterolemia.
Adverse Events Related to Calcitriol: Based on the available safety data, the following 
treatment emergent AEs classified by participating Investigators as possibly or probably related to calcitriol have been reported for subjects treated with calcitriol in clinical studies. Most of these AEs were Grade 1 or 2; calcitriol -related Grade 3 or 4 AEs were rare.

Risks Warranting Further Discussion:
1.Hypercalciuria: Many subjects treated with calcitriol develop hypercalciuria 
(elevated urine calcium) but acute nephrolithiasis has been very rare. The risk of nephrolithiasis due to hypercalciuria is minimized by increasing fluid intake.
2.Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia has been identified as the DLT in non-clinical and 
clinical studies of calcitriol, and occasional subjects taking calcitriol have had Grade 1 or 2 hypercalcemia. In the Phase 1 study of calcitriol in subjects with advanced malignancies, transient asymptomatic hypercalcemia (Grade 2) occurred in two subjects who received 60 μg calcitriol PO qw for nine weeks. The risk of 
hypercalcemia is minimized by increasing fluid intake, monitoring serum calcium, evaluating symptoms of hypercalcemia, excluding certain medications or supplements, and excluding subjects with a history of cancer-related hypercalcemia. Long-standing hypercalcemia may result in hypercalcemic nephropathy (interstitial 8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 29 of 42nephritis), a disease characterized by loss of distal tubule and collecting duct 
function, a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, and tubulointerstitial damage. Early recognition is important because damage can often be arrested or even reversed with discontinuation of the offending agent. Therefore, periodic monitoring of serum creatinine is recommended for subjects receiving high-dose calcitriol, including calcitriol. The interstitial nephritis seen in the 28-day repeated dose toxicity study of calcitriol in dogs was consistent with hypercalcemic nephropathy.
3.Transient Renal Insufficiency: Occasional subjects have had elevations of BUN or 
serum creatinine, or decreased creatinine clearance while taking calcitriol. The risk of renal toxicity due to calcitriol is minimized by excluding subjects with ≥ Grade 2 
elevations of serum creatinine and monitoring renal function during clinical studies with calcitriol.
4.Hyperuricemia: The possibility that calcitriol causes hyperuricemia cannot be 
excluded at this time. In the Phase 2/3 AIPC study (Study DN101-002), Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricemia was reported for two subjects (1.6%) in the group treated with calcitriol and docetaxel; hyperuricemia was not reported for subjects treated with docetaxel and placebo.
5.Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation: The possibility that calcitriol may cause 
disseminated intravascular coagulation cannot be excluded at this time. In the Phase 2/3, AIPC study (Study DN101-002) fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation, deemed related to study drug by the investigator occurred in one subject.
6.Calcifications of soft tissue : The possibility that repeat chronic dosing with high-
dose calcitriol causes calcification of soft tissues cannot be excluded at this time.
Overdose: There is no specific antidote to calcitriol. If overdose were suspected, 
administration of study drug, calcitriol, should be stopped and general supportive measures instituted, including close monitoring of arrhythmias and serum calcium. The risk of overdose is minimized by the standard dose and written dosing instructions for subjects.
Administration:  Total duration of therapy will be 3 months. Take one capsule of study drug 
every other week for a total of 3 months. Patients should be instructed to maintain adequate fluid intake.
Availability: calcitriol is a new formulation of calcitriol. For this study a 45 mcg capsule will 
be dispensed.
Storage: calcitriol should be protected from light and stored in the refrigerator.
Potential Risks:  Potential risks from the intervention are minimal. The most prominent 
risks are those associated with the potential for hypercalcemia. A bronchoscopy will be performed at the end of the 3-month intervention. This is generally a safe and painless procedure, performed under sedation. The risks associated with bronchoscopy include the following:  bleeding (usually mild and self-limiting), drug reaction from sedation, infection – pneumonia or bronchitis (rare), collapse of the lung (pneumothorax) (rare with endobronchial biopsies), and wheezing, breathing trouble or a low oxygen level. These problems are uncommon and are entirely treatable. There is a possible, but rare risk of death with bronchoscopy. Additional minimal risk is associated with blood collection, as APPROVED RP CI IRB

These procedures are part of the routine screening for lung cancer. Potential risks of calcitriol administration include hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria.
Procedures for Protecting against Potential Risks: It is unlikely that participants will 
display symptoms of hypercalcemia. However, all adverse and serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, FDA and NCI. Minimal risks are associated with blood sample collection. These potential risks will be fully described in approved consent forms.
Anticipated Benefits versus Potential Risks:  Benefits from this study include lung 
cancer screening with bronchoscopy and evaluation of premalignant lesions of the lung. While it is hypothesized that calcitriol will positively modulate the biomarkers for lung cancer (and presumably risk associated with lung cancer), this cannot be viewed as a benefit of the study. Society as a whole will benefit from the knowledge gained in this study, as the toxicity profile in non-cancer patients will be better understood. Given the low level of risk for participants in this trial, the costs and risks are justified.

12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PK/PD Modeling  - Using a sequential approach (136), a PK/PD structural model will be 
developed for calcitriol, based on toxicity responses in previous trials. A variety of compartmental population pharmacokinetic structural models will be evaluated to characterize the serum concentration versus time profile following the oral administration of calcitriol. The physiologic pharmacokinetic models explored will be described by the estimation of mean structural model parameters (e.g., plasma volumes of distribution and clearances), the magnitude of inter-individual variability (IIV) in these parameters, and the magnitude of residual variability (RV). To date, a population PK model of calcitriol has not been developed but prior experience of Dr. Muindi revealed that plasma concentrations may either follow a mono- or biexponential decay. Thus, it is anticipated that the appropriate PK model will initially include either a one- or two-compartment model with first-order absorption and (linear) elimination. The PK model could expand to include mechanistic attributes, such as a receptor-mediated clearance mechanisms since calcitriol binds to the VDR receptor and  may in part, get internalized as a complex, undergoing receptor-mediated clearance as one of the primary clearance mechanisms. As a result, a series of more complex PK models may be sequentially evaluated if required to adequately describe the pharmacokinetic profile of calcitriol.
According to the basic tenets of target-mediated drug disposition, distribution phases for 
lower doses are expected to be steeper than that of larger doses. Some compounds that exhibit such behavior also may show regions of convexity in various sections of the plasma concentration-time curve at relatively high doses. If needed, the unique incorporation of receptor-mediated disposition will represent a more mechanistic model to examine the biodisposition of calcitriol following oral administration. Patient demographics, racial group, along with CYP24A1 phenotype, smoking status, and other laboratory measurements will be evaluated as potential patient covariates that contribute to the inter-individual variability 
in pharmacokinetics. Typical metrics of model predictive performance will be used to assess the accuracy and precision with which the best model predicts the calcitriol concentrations, including: traditional global metrics, such as predicted area under the concentration-time curves, apparent oral clearance, apparent volume of distribution, terminal elimination half-life, and other PK parameters, will be compared to values obtained 
from a non-compartmental analysis of the raw data. The final model will be used to conduct simulations to predict pharmacokinetic outcomes and the time-course of inaccessible system variables, as well as providing suitable driving functions for the development of mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models of toxicity endpoints (137, 138).

8/7/2017
I 90206 Amendment # 18
Date: 07/11/2017 Page 35 of 42Subsequently, a population PK/PD model will be developed to describe the potential 
relationship between calcitriol exposure and toxicity endpoints, such as hypercalcemia, as indicators of pharmacodynamic response. This analysis will include both structural model development and evaluation of the influence of a limited number of patient covariates, such as patient demographics along with EGFR and smoking status, on the variability in select PK/PD parameters. The relationship between calcitriol concentrations and toxicity endpoints will be explored graphically and various structural models will be applied to the data and evaluated. It is assumed that a sigmoid-E
max model or an effect-site PK/PD model, 
accounting for severity in graded response of the particular toxicity endpoint, may be appropriate to describe the PK/PD relationship. Similar to the PK model development, criteria such as the precision of parameter estimates, magnitude of residual variability and goodness-of-fit will be utilized for PK/PD model selection.
Optimal Biologic Concentration Determination - The optimal biologic concentration will 
be defined as the steady state concentration range that is associated with less than grade 2 toxicity and leads to target inhibition in 90% or greater of patients. Because there are inter-individual variations in absorption and metabolism of calcitriol, a more rational approach will be to evaluate the feasibility of relating concentrations of calcitriol rather than administered dose, to pharmacodynamic markers and toxicity. Thus, we will examine the relationship between exposure levels (Cp or AUC) of calcitriol with pharmacodynamic endpoints and polymorphisms in CYP24A1 and calcitriol metabolizing enzymes. Determining the strength and direction of the association between genotype(s), PD endpoints and calcitriol exposure levels will allow the construction of a preliminary model that will allow personalized dosing to a target drug exposure range (Cp or AUC) for validation in future chemoprevention studies. Based on these data, patients could be initially started on therapy on a non-toxic median dose that leads to target exposure levels. Eventually, doses could be adjusted during treatment to reach target concentrations, as is done with other drugs that have narrow therapeutic indexes such as vancomycin and busulfan for bone marrow transplantation.
We will test the null hypothesis that the proportion of grade 3-4 toxicities or grade 2 
toxicities that persist more than two weeks will be 10% versus the one-sided alternative that the proportion of these toxicities will be greater than 10%.  An interim analysis will be performed after the first 20 subjects on calcitriol have completed the study.   The study can be stopped early at the interim point and the null hypothesis will not be rejected if <= 1 toxicity is observed, at which time the DSMB will summarize the findings and the results, including all toxicity reports will be submitted to the FDA.  Otherwise, the full 40 subjects will be recruited into the study. At the end of the study period, we will again either reject the null hypothesis (if 8 or more DLT toxicities are observed) or not reject the null hypothesis if 7 or less toxicities are observed.
Sample Size Calculations:
Given a sample size of n=40, we will 80% power be able to detect the proportion of toxicities of 15% or larger different from 10%, assuming an alpha level 0.05.  APPROVED RP CI IRB

OVERALL RATIONALE FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 03:
The addition of bempegaldesleukin to nivolumab did not result i n a statist ically signi ficant 
improvement in progression free survival (PFS) (Hazard Ratio [HR ] 1.09, 97% Confidence 
Interval [CI], 0.88-1.35) or objective re sponse rate (ORR) compared t o nivolumab monotherapy, 
and the significance threshol d for over all survival (OS) was also not crossed at an interim analysis.
Given there was no additional clinical benefit in the doublet t herapy arm compared to the
monotherapy arm for the primary endpoints of PFS and ORR, Brist ol-Myers Squibb Company 
(BMS) and Nektar, in consultation with the Data Monitoring Commi ttee (DMC), decided to 
unblind the trial and to perform no additional formal analyses for the OS endpoint. Furthermore, 
there was added toxicity with bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab compared to nivolumab 
monotherapy, including a higher incidence of drug-related advers e events (AEs), drug-related 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and drug-related AEs leading to s tudy treatment discontinuation.
Given that additional toxicities with no added efficacy were ob served in the experimental arm, 
participants receiving bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab are requ ired to discontinue 
bempegaldesleukin and may continue nivolumab monotherapy.
On 14-Apr-2022, BMS and Nektar announced a joint d ecision to end the clinical development 
program for bempegaldesleukin in combination with nivolumab.Minor formatting and typographical corrections have been made; t herefore, they have not been 
summarized.This protocol amendment applies to all participants.

1 SUMMARY
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-label Study of NKTR-214 Combined wi th 
Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab in Participants with Previously Untr eated Unresectable or 
Metastatic Melanoma
Study Phase: 3
Rationale:Activation of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) pathway in hibits the 
cluster of differentiation 28 (CD-28)-mediated upregulation of cyto kines, inhibits T cell 
activation, and inhibits the expansion of previously activated cells. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway 
has demonstrated clinical activity across multiple tumor types including melanom a. An 
accumulating body of evidence supports that low levels of tumor infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs) 
in pretreatment biopsies pred ict poor clinical res ponse to PD-1  pathway blockade. NKTR-214 
(bempegaldesleukin) promotes biased sign aling through the IL-2 intermediate affinity receptor (IL 
2Rβγ) as opposed to the high affinity receptor (IL-2R αβγ) found on regulatory  T-cells ( Tregs). 
Bempegaldesleukin increases intra-tumoral CD8+ lymphocytes and n atural killer cells as well as 
the number of PD-1+ CD8+ cells in the tumor and peripheral bloo d. The biologic activity of 
bempegaldesleukin makes it a potentially promising immunotherapy to combine with checkpoint 
inhibitors that target and inhi bit the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the text below related to bempegaldes leukin is not applicable.
The current study aims to demonstrate that tr eatment wit h bempegaldesleukin in combination with
nivolumab will be eff icacious in participants with unresectable or metastatic melano ma that is 
previously untreated. 
The addition of bempegaldesleukin to nivolumab did not result i n a statist ically signi ficant 
improvement in PFS (HR 1.09, 97% CI, 0.88-1.35) or ORR compared to nivolumab monotherapy
as assessed by Blinded Independent  Central Review (BICR), and the significance threshold for OS 
was also not crossed at the combined first and second OS analyses. Furthermore, there was added 
toxicity with bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab compared to nivo lumab monotherapy including

a higher incidence of drug-related adverse events (AEs), drug-r elated serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and drug-related AEs leading to study treatment disconti nuation.
Given that additional toxicities with no added efficacy were observed in the experimental arm, per 
Protocol Amendment 03, participants who are currently receiving  bempegaldesleukin plus
nivolumab are required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and may continue nivolumab 
monotherapy. Participants in Arm A and Arm B will receive nivolu mab monotherapy at 480 mg 
IV Q4W. Participants < 40 kg will be administered a body weight adjuste d nivolumab dose of 6 
mg/kg IV Q4W.
Study Population: Males and females, ages 12 years or older, except where local r egulations 
and/or institutional  policies do not allow for participants < 18 years of age (pediatri c population) 
to participate. For those sites, the eligible participant popul ation is ≥18 years of age, or age of 
majority. Adolescents are not eligible for the due to the blood sampling 
and biopsy requirements.
Key eligibility criteriaInclusion
•Participants must have an Eas tern Cooperative On cology Group (ECOG) performance status 
of ≤ 1 (adults 18 years or older)/Lansky Performance Score ≥ 80% (min ors ages 12-17 only)
•Histologically c onfirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV m elanoma, as per American Joint 
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, 8
thedition 
•Treatment-naïve participants (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma) with the exception of prior adjuvant and/o r neoadjuvant treatment for 
melanoma with approved agents (eg, proto-oncogene B-Raf [BRAF]/m itogen-activated 
protein [MEK] inhibitors, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or  interferon). Participants 
who have had recurrence within the 6 months of completing adjuv ant or neoadjuvant treatment 
are not eligible.
•Measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso nance imaging (MRI) per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criter ia
•All participants must have tissue submitted during the screenin g period to allow for participant
enrollment into the study. Tissue submitted should be from an u nresectable primary tumor 
lesion or any metastatic site. The tumor tissue s hould be from a site not previously irrad iated 
and with no intervening treatment between time of acquisition and enrollment. Central lab must 
provide IRT with the results  of PD-L1 testing prior to randomiz ation. Either a formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or 20 unstained tumor tis sue sections, with an 
associated pathology report, must  be submitted to the core labo ratory for inclusion. FFPE tissue 
block and unstained slides submitted should be from biopsy obta ined within 6 months prior to 
enrollment. Unstained slides should be sectioned within 3 months  prior to submission. 
Submission of an FFPE block is strongly prefe rred but unstained  slides are also acceptable.
Tissue may be from a core biopsy, punch biopsy, excisional or i ncisional biopsy, or surgical 
specimen; fine needle aspiration and other cytology samples are  not acceptable. Biopsies of 
bone lesions that do not have a s oft tissue component are also unacceptable for submission.

Medical Monitor (or designee) can be consulted for eligibility if subjects have less than 20 
unstained slides.
−In order to be randomized, a participant must be classified as PD-L1 positive ( ≥1% tumor 
cell membrane staining) vs PD-L1 negative (< 1% tum or cell membrane staining) or PD-
L1 indeterminate (tumor cell membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining or 
melanin content) based on the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 28-8 pharmDx assay. 
If only an insufficient amount of tumor tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site is 
available from prior to the star t of the Screening phase, then a fresh biopsy will be required 
during the screening phase for performance of biomarker analyses. Non-evaluable participants are not eligible for rando mization.
•  
 
 Note:  If the  participant has > 1 lesion, 
the lesion planned for biopsy while on tr eatment cannot be designated as a target lesion at 
baseline. Additional targ et lesions should be av ailable for radiographic efficacy assessments. 
If the participant has only 1 lesion that is measurable and amen able to biopsy, the lesion must 
be greater than 2.0 cm and the biopsy cannot be excisional. (Note : These same lesion criteria 
apply for patients who consent to the optional biopsy in the main study.)
•Participants must have known BRAF V600 mutation status or conse nt to BRAF V600 mutation 
testing per local institutional standards by approved methodology during the Screening period.
Exclusion
•Active brain metastases or leptomening eal metastases. Participants with brain metastases are 
eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic re sonance imaging (MRI) evidence 
of progression for at least 8 weeks after tr eatment is complete and within 28 days prior to 
randomization. There must also be no requirement for immunosupp ressive doses of systemic 
corticosteroids (> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at leas t 2 weeks prior to study 
treatment administration. Stable dose of anticonvulsants is all owed. Treatment for central 
nervous system (CNS) metastases m ay include stereotactic radiosu rgery (eg, GammaKnife, 
CyberKnife, or equivalent) or neurosurgical resection. Particip ants with CNS metastases 
treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed wi thin 28 days prior to 
randomization are not e ligible. Participants who received whole b rain radiation therapy are not 
eligible.
•Uveal melanoma is excluded.

Eligibility Assessments
Informed Consent X Register in Interactive Response System to obt ain participant number. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria X Must be confirmed prior to randomization. 
Medical History XAll medical history relevant to the disease under study includi ng smoking history, alcohol use, 
AJCC M stage, and BRAF mutation status.
Tumor Sample Submission XAll participants must have tissue submitted during the screening period to allow for participant 
enrollment into the study. Tissue submitted should be from an unresectable primary tumor lesion or 
any metastatic site. The tumor tissue should be from a site not  previously irradiated and with no 
intervening treatment between time of acquisition and enrollment. Central lab must provide IRT with the results of PD-L1 testing prior to randomization. Either a formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue block or 20 unstained tumor tissue sections, with an associated pathology 
report, must be submitted to the core laboratory for inclusion.  FFPE tissue block and unstained 
slides submitted should be from biopsy obtained within 6 months prior to enrollment. Unstained slides should be sectioned within 3 months prior to submission. Submission of an FFPE block is 
strongly preferred but unstained slides are also acceptable. Ti ssue may be from a core biopsy, 
punch biopsy, excisional or incisional biopsy, or surgical specimen; fine needle aspiration and other 
cytology samples are not acceptable. Biopsies of bone lesions t hat do not have a soft tissue 
component are also unacceptable for submission. The Medical Mon itor (or designee) can be 
consulted for eligibility if subjects have less than 20 unstained slides.
In order to be randomized, a participant must have quantifiable  PD-L1 tumor expression (≥ 1% 
[positive] or < 1% [negative] tumor cell membrane staining) or be classified as PD-L1 
indeterminate. Non-evaluable participants are not eligible for randomization. The analytical 
laboratory must provide IRT with confirmation of the related re sults prior to randomization.
 
 Note: If the participant has > 1 les ions, the lesion 
planned for biopsy while on treatment cannot be designated as a target lesion at baseline. Additionaltarget lesions should be available for radiographic efficacy as sessments. If the participant has only 
one lesion that is measurable and amenable to biopsy, the lesion must be greater than 2.0 cm and the biopsy cannot be excisional. Note: These same criteria that apply for lesion selection also apply to 
participants who consent to the op tional biopsy in the main stud y. Please refer to Section 9.8.3 for 
additional information.

3 INTRODUCTION
CA045001 is a Phase 3 randomized s tudy of NKTR-214 (bempegaldesl eukin) combined with 
nivolumab vs nivolumab monotherapy in participants with unresec table or metastatic melanoma 
that is previously untreated. Bempegaldesleukin consists of inter leukin-2 (IL-2; See Appendix 1 : 
Abbreviations), which has the same amino acid sequence as aldes leukin, conjugated at a defined 
region within the protein to releasable PEG chains. The six PEG  chains render the molecule 
inactive. After administration in vivo, the PEG chains are slow ly hydrolyzed to generate active 
cytokine conjugates. The most active IL-2 conjugates are 2-PEG- IL-2 and 1-PEG-IL-2. The 
location of the PEG chains on the  active conjugated-IL-2 reduce s affinity to the IL-2 receptor alpha 
subunit (IL-2Ra), reducing the activation of the high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R αβγ) found on 
Tregs. In the tumor, bempegaldesleukin preferentially activates CD8+ T and NK cells over Tregs. 
This Phase 3 study will allow for dir ect comparison of bempegaldesleukin combined with 
nivolumab vs nivolumab monothe rapy as measured by ORR, PFS, OS, and other clinical endpoints 
in treatment naive participants with unresectable or metastatic  melanoma.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, part icipants who are currently recei ving bempegaldesleukin plus
nivolumab are required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and will  receive nivolumab 
monotherapy.
3.1 Study Rationale
Activation of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) pathway in hibits CD-28-mediated 
upregulation of cytokines, inhi bits T cell activation, and inhi bits the expansion of previously 
activated cells. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway has demonstrated c linical activity across multiple 
tumor types including melanoma. An accumulating body of evi dence s upports that low levels of 
tumor infiltr ating lymphocytes (TILs) in pretreatment biopsies predicts for poor clin ical response 
to PD-1 pathway blockade .1,2,3Bempegaldesleuki n promotes biased  signaling th rough the IL-2 
intermediate affinity receptor (IL-2Rβγ) as opposed to the high  affinity receptor (IL-2R αβγ) found 
on regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Bempegaldesleukin increases intra tumoral CD8+ lymphocytes and 
natural killer cells as well as the number of PD-1+ CD8+ cells in the tumor and pe ripher al blood. 
The biologic activity of bempegaldesleukin makes it a potentiall y promising immunotherapy to 
combine with checkpoint inhibitors that target and inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.
The current study aims to demons trate that tr eatment w ith bempegaldesleukin in combination with 
nivolumab will be eff icacious in participants with unresectable or metastatic melano ma that is 
previously untreated. Additional objectives of the study includ e characterization of safety and 
tolerabilit y, as well as  potential predictive  biomarkers
.

3.2 Background
3.2.1 Melanoma Background / Current Therapies
Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer and the incidence  varies globally. Melanoma
accounts for approximately 3% of all cancer deaths in Australia and 1% and 2% of all cancer 
deaths in Europe and the United States (US).4,5In 2020, it is estimated t hat approximately 29,000
patients worldwide will prese nt with unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma, where the 5-
year survival rate is 18% for late-stage disease .6
Prior to 2011, approved therapie s for the treatment of metastat ic melanoma were limited and 
included chemotherapy (dacarb azine) and immunot herapy (IL-2). H istorically chemotherapy was 
used as palliative therapy for melanoma with modest response ra tes and responses that were 
usually short lived. Treatment of melanoma patients with high d ose IL-2 demonstrated a response 
rate of 10%-15% with approximately 5% of patients developing a complete response and a portion 
of the responders achieved durable long-term responses .7The use of high dose IL-2 is restricted 
to specialized centers, as the treatment requi res hospita lizatio n for drug administration and toxicity 
management by a specially trained team.
Since 2011, agents in 3 new therapeutic classes received approva l for the t reatment  of unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma as monotherapy  or in combination. The approved agents include 1) anti-
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking an tibodies, such as ipilimumab; 
2) anti-PD-1 receptor blocking antibodies, which include nivolu mab and pembrolizumab; and 3) 
small molecules  targeting the intracellular kinase pathways of BRAF and MEK in BRAF V600E 
positive melanoma. BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors 
(cobimetinib or trametinib) either alone or in combination, sho w improved OS or median PFS 
compared with chemotherapy, but patients often develop resistan ce to therapy.8,9,10,11Importantly, 
effective treatment with  these agents is limited t o patients with BRAF mu tation positive tumors 
(approximately 40%-50% of patients).According to the most recent National Comprehensive Cancer Netw ork (NCCN) Guidelines, 
checkpoint immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 therapies, which are ef fective regardless of BRAF 
mutation status, is reco mmended first-line therapy for treatment of unresectable or meta static 
melanoma. Options in this category include pembrolizumab, nivolu mab, or nivolumab/ipilimumab 
combination therapy
.1PD-L1 expression in pretr eatment tumor biopsy correlates with clinical 
benefit to anti-PD-1 based treatment;12however, PD-L1 expression has not been recommended to 
guide melanoma tr eatment decis ions given that low expressers ma y still have durable 
responses .1,13Although checkpoint inhibitors significantly improved clinical o utcome, a significant 
portion of patients progress and treatment-related toxicities o ften require patients to discontinue 
therapy.

3.2.2 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the  premise that tumors can be re cognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune resp onse and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of tra its that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses .14,15,16
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tol erance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by eith er introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory checkpoints  of the immune s ystem. T-cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negat ive co-stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the TCR .17Collectively, these signals govern the balance 
between T-cell activat ion and tolerance. 
PD-1 is a member of the CD 28 family of T-cell co -stimulatory re ceptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA-4, ICOS, and BTLA .18PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD-28-mediated 
upregulation of IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expr ession also been noted to inhibit 
T cell activation, and expansion of previously activ ated cells. Evidence for a negative regulat ory 
role of PD-1 comes from studies  of PD-1 deficient mice, which develop a variety of autoimmune 
phenotypes .19These results suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential to activate anti-self T-
cell responses, but these responses are variable and dependent upon various host genetic factors. 
Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a uni versal loss of tolerance to self-
antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS-936558) binds to PD-1 with high affini ty (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC 50 ±1 nM). Nivolumab binds 
specifically to PD-1 and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA-
4 and BTLA. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab results i n a reproducible enhancement 
of both proliferation and IFN-γ release in the MLR. Using a cyt omegalovirus (CMV) re-
stimulation assay with human PBMC, the effect of nivolumab on a ntigen specific recall response 
indicates that nivolumab augmented IFN-γ secretion from CMV spe cific memory T cells in a dose-
dependent manner versus isotype-matched control. In vivo blocka de of PD-1 by a murine analog 
of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune response and result  in tumor rejection in several 
immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).20
3.2.3 Bempegaldesleukin Mechanism of Action
Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) is a  prodrug of a conjugated cancer immunotherapy cytokine 
that exerts its biological activity by binding to the interleuk in-2 (IL-2) receptor and subsequent 
activation of effector T cells. As a PEGylated human recombinan t IL-2 molecule of aldesleukin 
with an average of 6 releasable polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, bempegaldesleukin can be 
administered conveniently in the outpatient setting using an an tibody-like dosing regimen. The 
polymer conjugation renders the cytokine initially inactive. Up on intravenous (IV) administration, 
the PEG chains slowly release to generate the active cytokine s pecies (mainly 2-PEG-IL-2 and 1-

PEG-IL-2) that have a peak plasma concentration of 24 to 48 hours  after infusion. The slow 
generation of the 2-PEG-IL-2 and 1-PEG-IL-2 significantly mitig ates the rapid-onset, systemic 
cytokine-related toxicities associated with high dose IL-2.
The polymer conjugation of bempegaldesleukin promotes biased si gnaling through the IL-2 
receptor beta g amma (IL-2Rβγ ). Specifically, the location of the bempegaldesle ukin PEG chains 
interferes with the binding to the IL-2 alpha receptor subunit responsible for the undesirable effect 
of activating regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor while con tinuing to permit binding to the IL-
2Rβγ (CD122) receptor. Upon i nfusion, bempegaldesleukin preferentially increases the 
proliferation, activation, and effector function of tumor antig en-specific CD8+ T cells and natural 
killer (NK) cells within the tu mor microenvi ronment (TME) over expansion of unwanted intra-
tumoral Tregs that are activated through the IL-2 receptor alph a beta gamma (IL-
2Rαβγ).21,22,23,24,25Consistent with this mechanism of action, recent nonclinical st udies 
demonstrate strong synergy of bempeg aldesleukin with adoptive T  cell therapy (ACT), with PD-
1 checkpoint blockade, and with tumor antigen-specific vaccinat ion, in a variety of mouse 
models.24,25This synergy was mediated by expansion of tumor-specific CD8+ T  cells in the 
periphery and tumor, w ithout strong expansion of Tregs in the tumor tissue. 
Bempegaldesleukin also correspondingly promotes e xpression of PD-1 on the surface of CD8+ 
T cells and induction of a Type II interferon gene signature in the TME, driving cell s urface 
expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor c ells.26
The immunological properties of bempegaldesleukin with the indu ction of tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes and upregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis makes bempe galdesleukin a potentially 
promising combination therapy for use with chec kpoint inhibitors that target and inhibit the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway. Moreover, the safety profile of bempegaldesleukin generally does not overlap with that of checkpoint inhibitors, further supporting the use of bempegaldesleukin as a potentially 
complimentary combination partne r with checkpoint inhibitors .
3.2.4
Clinical Experience with Nivolumab
Nivolumab has demonstrated safety and efficacy as monotherapy i n the treatment of advanced 
melanoma in tr eatment naive patients in two Phase 3 trials. In CheckMate-066 previously 
untreated melanoma patients with advanced melanoma without BRAF  mutations were randomized 
treatment with either nivolumab v ersus dacarbazine. There was a  58% reduction in the risk of 
death with nivolumab treatmen t group (hazard ratio [HR] for deat h, 0.42 [99.79% CI, 0.25–0.73]
P < 0.001).27CheckMate-067 was a double-blind, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab plus ipilimumab combinat ion therapy compared to 
ipilimumab monotherapy in metastatic or unresectable melanoma r egardless of BRAF mutation 
status. Nine hundred forty-five participants were rando mized 1:1:1 to receive either 3 mg/kg of 
nivolumab every 2 weeks (plus ipilimumab-matched placebo); 1 mg /kg of nivolumab every 3 
weeks plus 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 doses, foll owed by 3 mg/ kg of nivolumab 
every 2 weeks; or 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 dose s (plus nivolumab-matched 
placebo). The overall response rate was 44% in the nivolumab monotherapy arm and 19% in the 
ipilimumab monotherapy arm. The hazard ratio for progression or  death was  0.55 (95% CI, 0.45

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
3.3.1 Bempegaldesleukin Safety Profile
Bempegaldesleukin was designed to mitigate the severe toxicitie s associated with rapid systemic 
immune activation seen with administration of aldesleukin. The identified risks of 
bempegaldesleukin include hypoten sion, IL-2 mediated AEs (eg, f lu-like symptoms, rash, pruritus, 
fatigue, hepatic transaminase elevations, and serum creatinine elevations), infusion-related 
reactions/hypersensitivity reactions, thyroid dysfunction, eosi nophilia, and arthralgia. The 
majority of these AEs are mild to moderate in severity and can be monitored and managed in the 
clinical setting. The goal of engineering a PEGylated form of I L-2 that reduces the treatment-
limiting toxicities of aldesleukin, that is, those necessitating  in-hospital administration, appears to 
have been realized with bempegaldesleukin at the doses tested. 
Additional details on the clinical experience with bempegaldesl eukin are provided in the 
bempegaldesleukin Investigator’s Brochure.
3.3.2 Nivolumab Safety Profile
Extensive details on the safety profile of nivolumab are availa ble in the Investigator’s Brochure 
and will not be repeated herein.
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy as well as  in combination with ipilimumab 
is manageable and generally consistent across completed and ong oing clinical trials with no MTD 
reached at any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-gra de (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivoluma b dose level.
A pattern of immune -related adverse events has been defined, fo r which management algorithms 
have been developed; these are provided in Appendix 6 . Most high-grade events were manageable

with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy ( endocrinopathies) as instructed 
in these algorithms.
Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, includin g results from other clinical studies, 
are also available in the nivolumab IB.
3.3.3 Bempegaldesleukin and Nivolumab Benefit and Risk Assessment
Bempegaldesleukin has been generally well-tolerated in the clini cal studies to date, both as 
monotherapy as well as in combination with nivolumab, with prom ising evidence of clinical 
efficacy and a potentially favorable benefit-risk profile. Bemp egaldesleukin has been safely 
administered in an outpatient setting supported by appropriate clinical monitoring.  
Hypotension has been identified as a clinically significant adv erse effect of bempegaldesleukin, 
and can be effectively mitigated by prophylaxis and hydration g uidelines. Other risks associated 
with bempegaldesleukin incl ude IL-2 mediated AEs (eg, flu-like symptoms, rash, pruritus, fatigue, 
hepatic transaminase elevations, and serum creatinine elevation ), infusion r elated reactions, 
thyroid dysfunction, eosinophilia, and arthralgia; these AEs ar e generally mild or moderate in 
severity, and can be monitored and managed in clinical setting.  Cases of thyroid dysfunction 
(hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis), dermatitis, pne umonitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, 
myositis/myasthenia gravis, and vitiligo/hypopigmentation consi stent with immune-mediated 
mechanism have been observed in patients receiving bempegaldesl eukin plus nivolumab, and 
some of these cases shared clin ical char acteristics consistent with immune-mediated AEs 
associated with checkpoint inhibitors.The continued development of bempegaldesleukin in combination w ith nivolumab for the 
treatment of various cancers is warranted based on a positive b enefit-risk profile. In addition, the 
early efficacy data along with the correlative biomarker showin g conversion of PD-L1 negative 
patients to PD-L1 positive patients suggests that the addition of bempegaldesleukin to a checkpoint 
inhibitor (nivolumab) may change the tumor microenvi ronment in PD-L1 negative patients such 
that the combination may contribute to anti-tumor activity with  an acceptable safety profile.
In conclusion, the currently available safety data demonstrates that bempegaldesleukin and 
nivolumab is a well-tolerated immuno-oncology combination therapy. Given the encouraging 
clinical activity and manageable and generally non-overlapping toxicity profile, the potential for 
direct benefit in patients warrants continued evaluation of the  combination bempegaldesleukin and 
nivolumab in the clinical setting and supports further developm ent of combination of 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab regimens in patients with cance r. If a participant had severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the trial, then the 
benefit and risk considerations remain the responsibility of the Investigator.
The final ORR and PFS analyses, and the first OS interim analys is (combined with the second OS 
interim analysis) have been completed using the locked database with a database lock date of 01-
Feb-2022. The addition of bempegaldesleukin to nivolumab did not result in a statist ically 
significant improvement in PFS (HR 1.09, 97% CI, 0.88-1.35) or ORR compared to nivolumab 
monotherapy, and the significance threshold for OS was also not  crossed at the combined first and 
second OS analyses. Given there was no additional clinical bene fit in the doublet therapy arm

compared to the monotherapy arm for the primary endpoints of PF S and ORR, the Sponsor, in 
consultation with the DMC, decided to unblind the trial and to p erform no additional formal 
analyses for the OS endpoint. 
After the Sponsor reviewed the topline results from the ORR and PFS final analysis, additional 
toxicities with no added efficacy were observed in the experime ntal arm. Therefore participants 
are required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and may continue n ivolumab monotherapy for the

For participants whose BRAF mutation status is unknown, BRAF st atus must be determined by 
local testing prior to study rando mization.
Sufficient, recent tumor tissue submitted should be from an unresectable primary tum or lesion or 
any metastatic site. The tumor tissue should be from a site not  previously irradiated and with no 
intervening treatment between time of acquisition and enrollmen t. Either a formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or 20 unstained tumor tissu e sections, with an associated 
pathology report, must be submitted to the core laboratory for inclusion. FFPE tissue block and 
unstained slides submitted should be from biopsy obtained withi n 6 months prior to e nrollment. 
Unstained slides should be sectioned within 3 months prior to s ubmission. Tumor tissue s hould be 
obtained from core biopsy, punch biopsy, excisional or incision al biopsy, or surgical specimen and 
then submitted to the central laboratory. The Medical Monitor ( or designee) can be consulted for 
eligibility if subjects have less than 20 unstained slides. The  central laboratory must provide IRT

randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
5.3 End of Study Definition
The start of the trial is defined as first visit for first participant screened. End of trial is defined as 
the last visit or scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities for the last participant. 
Study completion is defined as the final date on which data for the primary endpoint was or is

approximately 68 months after the date of the first participant to be randomized (See  Section 10). 
Additional follow-up for PFS and OS may be conducted up to approximately 5 years after the randomizatio n of the last participant.
5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
5.4.1
Rationale for the Combination of Bempegaldesleukin and Immune 
Checkpoint Inhibitors
The ongoing PIVOT-02 study of nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin in cludes an expansion cohort 
in patients with treatment-naive melanoma. In the most recent a nalysis of the dose escalation part, 
the response rate in this cohort is 69% (11 out of 16 participant s) with 1 complete response and 10
partial responses with all responders maintaining their respons e.27With 3 years of follow-up, 
nivolumab monotherapy in the CheckMate-067 study demonstrated an ORR of 44%, a 3-year PFS 
of 32% and a 3-year OS of 52%.13The 3-year analysis of CheckMate-067 reaffirmed that 
responses to checkpoint inhibitors continue to evolve with long e r  f ol l o w - u p  a s  t h e  n u m b e r  o f

participants achieving a complete response to nivolumab increase d from 28 to 52 participants out 
of 316 total (9% to 16%) with a median duration of response tha t has still not bee n reached. It is 
anticipated that a similar evolution of responses will be seen in the combination of 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab as evolution of responses over t ime has been reported in the 
setting of high dose IL-2.
5.4.2 Rationale for Study Comparator and Study Population
PD-1 blockade is the recommended first-line therapy for treatme nt of BRAF WT and BRAF 
Mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the NCCN Guideline s. Options in this category 
include pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or nivolumab / ipilimumab comb ination therapy.12Three year 
follow-up data from the CheckMate- 067 study in which participants received nivolumab or the 
combinatio n of nivoluma b and ipilimumab demonstrated PFS rates of 32% and 39% and OS rates 
of 52% and 58%, respectively.13Although first-line tr eatment with checkpoint inhibitors 
significantly improved clinical outcome for melanoma patients, a significant portion of patients 
progress or discontinue treatment due to treatment-related toxi cities.1These data support the need 
for combinations such as bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab that ma y yield greater clinical 
efficacy without adding significant treatment related toxicities. 5.4.3
Rationale for Inclusion of Adolescent Participants
Adolescent (generally aged 12-17 years) enrollment into clinica l trials has been historically lower 
than enrollment of their pediatric counterparts. Lack of partic ipation in pediatric trials may be due 
to differences in tumors observed in adolescent participants vs  their pediatric counterparts, as 
tumors in adolescents may mirror those observed more often in a dults. For trials in adult 
participants with tumor types that also occur in adolescents, a dolescents are often excluded due to 
safety or regulatory concerns. Overall, this has led to a d elay in the study of new therapies in 
adolescents, and most problematically, a d elay in new efficacious therapies reaching this 
population. It has been recommended, therefore, that adolescent s be considered for trials in adult 
populations for tumor types that are observed in adolescents an d that share features common to 
those tumors that occur in adults.31,32
Although rare, the incidence of childhood and adolescent melano ma in the US has been increasing 
in the past 35 years. This trend is most prominent in the adole scent age range. A recent genomic 
analysis of pediatric melanoma demonstrates that conventional m elanoma in children and 
adolescents shares many of the genomic features that have been described in adult melanoma, 
including BRAF mutations.33Given the similarities observed in adolescent melanoma compared  
to adult, as well as the overarching need for inclusion of adolescents in clinical trials of potentially 
new efficacious therapies, adolescents w ill be included in this study where locally permitted.
Individual countries and sites have the option of opting out of  adolescent eligibility.
5.4.4 Rationale for Choice of Endpoints
CA045001 will use the  primary endpoints of ORR, PFS, and OS. ORR and PFS will be ass essed 
per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. ORR will further be described by the du rability and depth of responses, 
as those aspects are important characterizations of responses w ith immune-oncology treatments.

In the current melanoma clinical environment where multiple app roved agents (ipilimumab and 
BRAF inhibitors) are available to treat the patients who progress on nivolumab with or without 
NKTR, PFS will not be confounded by subsequent therapy.
5.4.5 Rationale for Open-Label Design
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Due to the hydration program and 
the special restrictions for wit hholding anti-hype rtensive medicati ons in the bempegaldesleukin
arm, a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study is not appropri ate for this study . 
5.4.6 Rationale for Stratification by M Staging, BRAF, and PD-L1
In order to minimize th e potential for imbalances across treatm ent arms, there will be 
3 stratification factors utilized i n this trial: American Joint Committee on Cancer  (AJCC) 8th 
edition M stage (M0 / M1any[0] (Stage III any LDH or Stage IV Norma l LDH) vs M1any[1]
(Stage IV Elevated LDH)), BRAF mutation status (mutation positi ve vs wild type), and PD-L1 
tumor expression ( ≥1% tumor cell surface expression [positive] vs < 1% tumor cell s urface 
expression [negative]/indeterminate). Prognostic implications o f M Staging are well established.34
BRAF mutations have likewise b een associated with adverse clini cal outcomes in melanoma 
patients, as well as differences in PFS and OS in patients trea ted with nivolumab.35
Previous clinical studies with nivolumab monotherapy have shown  patients with PD-L1 positive 
tumors may have higher response rates than those with negative or indeterminate expression.36
Participants in the current trial will therefore be stratified by PD-L1 tumor expression s tatus, as 
the effect of PD-L1 tumor expression on the response to nivolum ab and bempegaldesleukin
combination is not yet known.5.4.7
Duration of Treatment with Nivolumab/Bempegaldesleukin
The optimal duration of immunotherapy is an important question and continues to be investigated. 
Clinical trials across different tumors types in the nivolumab and ipilimumab development 
program indicate that most of the responses occur early, with a  median time to response of 
2-4 months,37,38,39,40,41,42and emerging data suggests that benefit can be maintained in th e absence 
of continued treatment. A recent analysis in a melanoma study s uggests the majority of patients 
who discontinue nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxicity mainta in disease control in the absence 
of further treatment.43Furthermore, a limited durati on of ipilimu mab, including only 4  induction 
doses, resulted in long term survival in patients with metastat ic melanoma, with a sustained plateau 
in survival starting around 2 years after the start of treatment.44
Accumulating data suggest that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhib itor treatment may be sufficient 
for long term benefit. CA209003, a dose-escalation cohort expan sion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivolumab in patients with previously- treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 participants with NSCLC), specified a maximum tr eatment duration of 2 years. 
Among 16 participants with NSCLC who discontinued nivolumab aft er completing 2 years of 
treatment, 12 participants were alive >5 years and remained progression-free without any 
subsequent therapy. In the CA209003 NSCLC c ohort, the overall s urvival (OS) curve begins to

plateau after 2 years, with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.45These survival 
outcomes are similar to Phase 3 studies in previously treated NS CLC, in which nivolumab 
treatment was continued un til progression or unacceptable toxic ity (2 year OS rates of 23% and 
29%, and 3 year OS rates of 16%-18% for squamous and non-squamo us NSCLC respectively).46
Similar res ults have been reported in clinical studies of pembr olizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor. 
Keynote-010 was a rando mized Phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab (at  either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel in participants with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced 
NSCLC which specified a maximum treatment duration of 2 years f or pembrolizumab. OS was 
significantly longer with both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.72, P = 0.00017) and 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/ kg (HR 0.60, P < 0.00001) compared to docetax el, with an OS plateau 
developing beyond 2 years in both pembrolizumab arms. Among 690 patients who received 
pembrolizumab, 47 patients completed 2 years of pembrolizumab and stopped treatment. Most 
were able to maintain their response, including those with stable disease, with only 2 patients (4%) 
having confirmed progression after stopping at 2 years.47
Keynote-006 was a randomized Phase 3 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma, which also specified a maximum 2 year d uration of pembrolizumab 
treatment. 104 (19%) of 556 patients rando mized to pembrolizumab completed  2  y e a r s  o f  
treatment. With a median follow-up of 9 months after completion of pembrol izumab, the estimated 
risk of progression or death was 9% in these patients.
48
Taken together, these data suggest that treatment beyond 2 year s is unlikely to confer additional 
clinically meaningful benefit and that the risk of progression after discontinuing treatment at 
2 years is low.
In contrast, a shorter duration of nivolumab of only 1 year was  associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously tr eated patients with NSCLC, s uggesting that treatment be yond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC who completed 
1 year of nivolumab therapy were  randomized to either continue or stop treatment, with the option 
of retreatment upon progression. Am ong 163 patien ts still on tr eatment at 1 year and without 
progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab ha d significant improvement in 
PFS compared to those who were  randomized to st op treatment, wit h median PFS (post-
randomizatio n) not reached vs 10.3 months, respectively; HR = 0. 42 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71). With 
a median follow-up of 14.9 months post-randomization, there als o was a trend for patients on 
continued treatment to live longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.33,  1.20]). Of note, the PFS curves 
in both groups plateau approximately 1 year after rando mization (ie, 2 years after tr eatment 
initiation), suggesting that there may be minimal benefit in ex tending treatment beyond a total of 
2 years.49
Collectively, these data suggest that there is minimal, if any, benefit derived from continuing 
immuno-oncology treatment be yond two years in advanced tumors. However, even th ough 
immunotherapy is well  tolerated, patients w ill be at risk for additional toxicity with longer term

treatment. Therefore, in this study, treatment will be given fo r a maximum of 24 months from the 
start of study treatment (regardless of number of cycles adminis tered).
This paragraph is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Given the hypothesis that co-
administration of bempegaldesleukin with nivolumab will potentiat e the pharmacological effects 
of nivolumab, the duration of bempegaldesleukin therapy will be restricted to 24 months to match 
the duration of nivolumab therapy.
5.5 Justification for Dose
5.5.1 Justification for Dose of Bempegaldesleukin
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. The dose for bempegaldesleukin is 
0.006 mg/kg Q3W for participants taking in consideration the clinical safety profile associated 
with the robust immune system activation observed in the PIVOT-0 2 study.  
5.5.2 Justification for Dose of Nivolumab
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in multiple tumor types, including 
melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and 
urothelial carcinoma, u sing body weight norm alized dosing (mg/kg), a nd has been safely 
administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W. Nivolumab is currently  approved for the treatment of 
various tumors, including melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and  urothelial carcinoma, 
using a regimen of either nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, nivolumab 3 mg/ kg Q2W, and nivolumab 480 
mg Q4W.
Nivolumab has been shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of nivolumab 10 mg/kg 
Q2W. Population PK (PPK) analyses have shown that the PK of niv olumab is linear with 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no  differences in PK across 
ethnicities and tumor types were observed. Using the PPK model,  the exposures following 
administration of several dosing regimens of nivolumab administ ered as a flat dose were 
simulated, including nivolumab 360 mg Q3W. The simulated steady state average concentration 
(Cavgss) following administration of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are p redicted to be similar to those 
following administration of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W administered 
to participants weighing 80 kg, the approximate median weight o f participants with NSCLC, 
melanoma and RCC used in the PPK analyses. Given that the Cavgs s estimates for nivolumab 360 
mg Q3W are predicted to be similar to those for nivolumab 240 m g Q2W and nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
Q2W, the efficacy is predicted to be similar for these regimens. It should be noted that the Cmaxss 
following nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are predicted to be less than those following the administration 
of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W provi ding sufficient safety margins. Further details on nivolumab 
360 mg Q3W dosing can be found in the IB.
Finally, nivolumab 360 mg Q3W i s currently being investig ated in combination with a number of 
other agents, including bempegaldesleukin in Study 16- 214-02 (PIVOT- 02), and platinum- doublet
chemotherapy dosing, with no new or increased safety events observed to date. Per Protocol 
Amendment 03, participants in Ar m A should disc ontinue bempegal desleukin and may continue

•The Safety Review Committee revi ewed the totality of data and c oncluded the following for 
all 5 combination dose cohorts with a data cut of 05-Oct-2017:
•Two patients at the bempegaldesleukin 0.009 mg/kg Q3W + nivolumab  360 mg Q3W dose 
level experienced dose limiting toxicities: Grade 3 hypotension and Grade 4 metabolic 
acidosis, each of which resolved within 5 days and the patients  continued on treatment at a 
lower dose of bempegaldesleukin.
•There were no Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs ) at bempegaldesleukin
0.006 mg/kg Q3W + nivoluma b 360 mg Q3W: the recommended Phase 2 dose.
•TRAEs that occurred in ≥ 50% of the patients included fatigue, flu-like symptoms (combined 
MedDRA preferred terms of influenza-like illness, pyrexia, and chills), rash (combined 
MedDRA preferred terms of rash, rash erythematous, rash macular , rash maculopapular, and 
rash pruritic), and pruritus.
•TRAEs were consistent across all five dose cohorts.

•Management guidelines implemented in the combination program fo r hypotension were 
effective to mitigate the risk for Grade ≥ 3 hypotension.
•No Grade ≥ 3 immune-mediated AEs were observed.
•Cytokine-related AEs such as fever, chills, pruritus, fatigue, and rash are predictable based on 
the mechanism of action and were generally of mild severity and  short duration.
•The addition of bempegaldesleukin did not exacerbate nivolumab-r elated AEs that are 
commonly classified as immune-mediated AEs.
•Bempegaldesleukin alone or in combination with nivolumab did not  produce capillary leak 
syndrome, which is commonly  observed in patients treated with high-dose IL-2.
At the time of the data cut, t umor response data were available  for 34 patients, including 10 with 
metastatic melanoma, 19 with RCC, and 5 with NSCLC. Of these 34 response-evaluable patients, 
24 were treated at 0.006 mg/kg bempegaldesleukin with nivolumab 360 mg flat dose Q3W; 17 
patients had partial or complete responses and 13 had stable di sease.
Given the totality of data, including safety/tolerability, repr oducible PK, dose-independent 
pharmacodynamic (PD) profile, immune cell activation, and promis ing efficacy data  
, the Safety Review Committee approved 
bempegaldesleuki n 0.006 mg/kg Q3W plu s nivolumab 360 mg Q3W as the recommended dose to 
be administered in the late phase studies.
5.5.4 Justification for Dose for Adolescents
The PK of drugs and many therapeutics proteins has been shown t o be similar between adolescent 
and adults once the effect of b ody size on PK is taken into cons ideration. Therefore, in general, 
adult doses would be expected to achieve similar systemic expos ures in adolescents. Population 
PK model based simulation has shown that exposures produced by nivolumab 360 mg Q3W were 
well below the exposure range of 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen, a clinic ally safe dose, over a dose range 
of 34-180 kg in adults. Therefore, a minimum body weight thresh old in adolescents (≥ 40 kg) is 
defined to receive the same adult flat dose to prevent exceeding target adult exposures.50,51
Participants ≥ 40 kg will be administered nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4 W. Participants < 40 kg body 
weight will be administered a weight-based dose of 6 mg/kg IV Q 4W that is equivalent to adult 
dose (typical subject of 80 kg body weight). The remainder of this paragraph is not applicable 
per Protocol Amendment 03. Participants ≥ 40 kg will be administered nivolumab 360 mg Q3W. 
Participants < 40 kg will be administered body weight adjusted nivolumab dose 4.5 mg/kg Q3W .
Additional details on dosing are provided in the nivolumab IB.

Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully conside red to ensure the safety of the study 
participants and that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that participants fully 
meet all elig ibility criteria.
6.3 Lifestyle Restrictions
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Please see  Section 7.1.1.1 for hydration 
guidelines and limitations on strenuous activities, long hot sh owers and sauna use. 
6.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as  participants who consent to part icipate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure informa tion is required to ensure transparent 
reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolida ted Standards of Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any 
serious AEs.
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening or Lead-In Period
Participant Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment  of a participant that has discontinued 
the study as a pre-t reatment failure (ie, participant has not been randomized / has not been treated). If 
re-enrolled, the participant must be re-consented.
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments wit hin any single Screening or Lead-in 
period will be permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirmatory value).
The most current result prior to Randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be assessed, 
as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state .
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2-1 may be repeated in an 
effort to find all possible well-qualified participants. Consul tation with the Medical Monitor (or 
designee) may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of a ny particular parameter is clinically 
relevant.
Testing for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infectio n, for example by reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral antigen is not required. However, some partici pants may develop 
suspected or confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, or be discovered to have 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the screening period. In such cases, participants may 
be considered eligible for the s tudy after meeting all inclusio n/exclusion criteria related to active 
infection, and after meeting the following criteria:
•At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical illness) have pas sed since symptoms first appeared 
or positive RT-PCR or viral antigen test result, and
•At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use o f fever-reducing medications, 
and
•Acute symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) have resolved, a nd
•In the opinion of the Investigator, there are no SARS-CoV-2 infection-related sequelae that 
may place the participant at a higher risk of receiving investi gational treatment, and

7 TREATMENT
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo or medical 
device intended to be administered to a study participant accor ding to the study randomization or 
treatment allocation.
Study treatment includes both I nvestigational [Medicinal] Product (IP/IMP) and Non-investigational 
[Medicinal] Product (Non-IP/Non-IMP) and can consist of the following:
•Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) Powder for 
Solution for Injection
•Nivolumab Solution for Injection
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the auth orized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further informati on about the authorized form.
Other medications used as support or escape medicati on for preventative,  diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diag nosis, may be considered as non-
investigational products.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, all participants r eceiving bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab are 
required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and may continue nivol umab monotherapy.
Participants in Arm A and Arm B will receive nivolumab monothera py at 480 mg IV Q4W for the 
remainder of the study treatment period. Participants < 40 kg will be administered a body weight 
adjusted nivolumab dose of 6 mg/kg IV Q4W.

7.1.1 Bempegaldesleukin Dosing
Per Protocol Amendment 03, participants receiving bempegaldesle ukin plus nivolumab are 
required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and may continue nivo lumab. Therefore, this section 
is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Each participant’s bempegaldesleukin dose will 
be determined by the participant’s weight in kilograms, which w ill be determined before the start 
of each cycle. If the participant’s weight is within 10% of the previous cycle Day 1 weight, the 
study drug doses do not need to be recalculated depending on in stitutional guidelines/preference.
Bempegaldesleukin will be admin istered first before nivolumab, and will be administered as an IV 
infusion over 30 (± 5) minutes at a starting dose of 0.006 mg/kg Q3 W (± 3 days, Cycle 2 and 
beyond). Bempegaldesleukin infusion must be promptl y followe d by a flush of diluent to clear the

administration should start at least 30 minutes from the end of th e bempegaldesleukin
administration. Participants may be dosed no less than 18 days from the previous dose. 
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reaction s during bempegaldesleukin
administration. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, partici pants should be managed according to 
Section 7.4.6 . If the participant experiences a  Grade ≥ 2 infusion-related re action or hypotension 
during the days after bempegaldesleukin dosing, the participant may be monitored overnight at the 
discretion of the Investigator; longer periods of monitoring may be implemented at the discretion 
of the Investigator.
Treatment with bempegaldesleukin may be delayed or reduced as described in  Section 7.4 . In the 
event that nivolumab is permanently discontinued due to toxicitie s, see Section 8.1.1 .
Bempegaldesleukin treatment can continue for participants random ized to the bempegaldesleukin
and nivolumab combination arm in the event that nivolumab is pe rmanently discontinued due to 
toxicities (see  Section 8.1.1).
Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) Powder for Solution for Injection, is to be administered as an IV 
infusio n following reconstituti on and dilution as described in the Pharmacy Manual . In-line filters 
(including in-line filter extension sets) must not be used to a dminister bempegaldesleukin due to 
the extent of drug losses by adsorption on the filter membrane.  Bempegaldesleukin infusion must 
be promptly followe d by a flush of diluent to clear the line. Care must be taken to assure sterility 
of the prepared solution as the product does not contain any an timicrobial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent. 
Bempegaldesleukin infusions prepared in 0.9% NaCl solution or 5% Dextrose in water are 
compatible with polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin containers and  infusion sets, as well as closed-
system transfer devices (CSTDs) when following specific instruc tions to ensure prepared dose 
accuracy.Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual/current Investigator’s Broch ure for details regarding

treatment with bempegaldesleukin. Advise participants with ortho static symptoms to call their 
treating oncologist and consider increasing oral hydration.
Between Days 3 and 5, inclusive, following administration of th e first two doses of 
bempegaldesleukin, site personnel must contact the participant (by telephone or clinic visit) at least
once to remind the participan t of the oral hydr ation guid elines , to assess for any symptomatology 
and compliance with the guidelines, and document the results of  the discussion ( Table 2-2). 
Following subsequent administration of bempegaldesleukin, the o ral hydration follow-up should 
be conducted as clinically indicated for participants receiving bempegaldesleukin.
Per clinical judgment, IV fluids may be administered at any tim e. The Investigator may decide to 
forego administering IV fluids to a participant if this is deem ed to be in the best interest of the 
participant (eg, evidence of fluid overload).
7.1.2 Nivolumab Dosing

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
Before the study is initiated, each user wi ll receive log-in in formation and directions on how to 
access the IRT. Each participant will be assigned a unique part icipant number after signing the 
ICF. Participant numbers will be used on all participants’ stud y information. Participant numbers 
will not be reassigned. An IRT will be employed to manage parti cipant randomization. The 
Investigator or designee will register the participant for enro llment by following the enrollment 
procedures established by BMS. The following information is required for enrollment
:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Year of birth
•Gender at birth

Once enrolled in IRT, enrolled participants who have met all el igibility criteria will be ready to be 
randomized through the IRT. The fo llowing information is required for participant randomization:
•Participant number 
•Year of birth 
•PD-L1 tumor expression status (PD-L1 positive vs PD-L1 negative /indeterminate), analyzed 
by the central laboratory vendor and transferred to the IRT
•BRAF V600 mutational status; local results to be entered into I RT by site.
•M Stage at screening (see Appendix 8)
•Participants meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by 
PD-L1 tumor expression status, BRAF status, and AJCC M stage as  described below:
•PD-L1 tumor expression status
−PD-L1 positive ( ≥1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable t umor 
cells) vs
−PD-L1 negative (< 1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor
cells)/indeterminate (tumor cell membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining 
or melanin content)
•BRAF status
−BRAF V600 mutation positive vs
−BRAF V600 wild type
•AJCC 8th edition M stage at Screening (See Appendix 8)−M0 / M1any[0] (Stage III any LDH or Stage IV Normal LDH) vs 
−M1any[1] (Stage IV Elevated LDH)
Note: All mucosal melanoma will be considered as M1 and the ass ignment of strata will be based 
on the baseline LDH level (M0 / M1any[0] for mucosal melanomas with normal LDH and 
M1any[1] for mucosal melanomas with elevated LDH).
The randomization procedures will be carried out via permuted b locks within each stratum, defined 
by combination of PD-L1 tum or expression status (positive ≥1%, negative [< 1%]/indeterminate), 
BRAF V600 mutational status (BRAF mutation positive, BRAF wild type), and M Stage 
(M0 / M1any[0], M1any[1]). The ex act procedures for using the IRT  will be detailed in the IRT

7.4 Dosage Modification
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the text below related to bempegaldes leukin is not applicable.
If bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab meets the criteria for dose del ay which apply for all drug-
related adverse events regardless of whether the event is attri buted to nivolumab or 
bempegaldesleukin or both, then a dministration of both drugs must  be delayed if any of the delay 
criteria in Table 7.4.1-1 and Table 7.4.1-2 are met. 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, either confirmed or suspected, requires d elay of nivolumab and 
bempegaldesleukin study treatment. 
Delay bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab dosing for any adverse even t, laboratory abnormality, or 
intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator , warrants delaying the dose of study 
medication until the criter ia to resume are met ( Section 8.1.2 ).
Note: Tumor assessments for all participants s hould continue as per protocol even if dosing is 
delayed.Participants who require delay of nivolumab and bempegaldesleuki n should be re-evaluated 
weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated and resume tr eatment with combination of 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab when re-treatment criteria are m et. Immuno-oncology agents 
are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duratio n from AEs caused by other 
therapeutic classes. Bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab are conside red an immuno-oncology agent 
in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs assoc iated with immuno-oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxicity.Discontinuation criteria for nivo lumab and bempegaldesleukin are found in Section 8.1.1 .
AE grading should be based on CTCAE version 5.

This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. These recommendations are for 
Cycle 1 only and are not intended to serve as rigid guidelines or to replace clin ical judgement. 
Subsequent cycles  should follow standard Hepatic Adverse Event Management Algorithm 
(Appendix 6 ).
Rule out non-inflammatory etiologies. If non-inflammatory cause , treat accordingly and continue 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab. Consider imaging for obstructio n. 
If during monitoring ALT/AST increases, follow the guidance for  the highest levels.

7.4.2 Monitoring and Management of Elevated Hepatic Transaminases
Elevated hepatic transaminases are an overlapping toxicity that  can occur for both 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab. The elevations in hepatic trans aminases associated with 
bempegaldesleukin typically occur at the time of peak active cyt okine concentration in the blood 
(Day 8), and are often accompanied by IL-2 mediated AEs such as flu-like symptoms, rash or 
pruritus. The transient elevations in hepatic transaminases are  usually asymptomatic, mild or 
moderate in severity, not associated with increased total b ilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, resolve 
spontaneously without treatment, and predominantly occur in Cyc le 1 and Cycle 2. The 
transaminase elevations are considered to occur in the context o f IL-2 mediated AEs. For 
transaminase elevations occurring in Cycle 1 consistent with a cytokine related effect without 
alternative etiologies, follow the Cycle 1 hepatic adverse even t management guideline ( Section  
7.4.1.1 and Appendix 6 ).
Hepatic events, including elevated liver function tests, have a lso been observed for nivolumab. 
Most cases were of low or moderate severity. Higher grade abnor malities are concerning for 
immune-mediated hepatitis, and typically occur with a l ater onset (m edian time to onset of 
3.3 months). Immune mediated hepatitis generally results in a qu ick rise in liver function tests, and 
responds to corticosteroids or immune-modulating agents. For transaminase elevations occurring  
in Cycle 2 onwards potentially involving an immune-mediated mec hanism, follow the immune-
mediated hepatic adverse event management guidelines in the niv olumab IB or OPDIVO product 
labeling for appropriate management.
7.4.3 Monitoring and Management of Eosinophilia
7.4.3.1 Bempegaldesleukin-induced Eosinophilia
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Frequent and significant 
eosinophilia has been observed in patients receiving bempegalde sleukin, primarily starting at 
Cycle 2 with levels plateauing after Cycle 3, consistent with t he known pharmacodynamic effect 
of IL-2 therapy. The eosinophilia pattern demonstrates a cyclic  waxing and waning pattern 
whereby eosinophil levels peak  approximately 7 day s after each infusion and wane before the 
participant’s next infusion.Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) s hould be closely monitored per  protocol. If a participant is 
suspected to have eosinophilic disorder (symptoms may involve skin, lungs, digestive tract, heart, 
blood, and nervous systems) with AEC at or above the 5,000/μL ( 5 × 10
9/L) level, delaying 
bempegaldesleukin treatment may be considered wh ile evaluating and treating the participant as 
clinically indicated.

Additional details regarding eosinophilia and eosinophilic diso rders are provided in the 
bempegaldesleukin Investigator’s Brochure.7.4.4 Monitoring and Management of Adrenal Insufficiency and Hypophys itis
Adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis have been observed in pa rticipants receiving nivolumab 
and ipilimumab. Consider prompt evaluation when participants have signs or symptoms of 
hypophysitis or adrenal insufficiency which includes levels of early-morning ACTH, cortisol, 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH ), and free thyroxine (T4). Co- management with an 
endocrinologist is recommended for participants with pre-existing adrenal insufficiency.

7.4.5.2 Management Algorithm for Cytokine-Release Syndrome
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) 
is a clinical diagnosis with a constellation of symptoms often characterized by fever, tachypnea, 
headache, tachycardia, hypotensi on, rash, and/or hypoxia caused  by the release of cytokines. In 
addition, diarrhea and end organ dysfunction ca n be seen in CRS. Many of these symptoms overlap 
with known AEs seen in bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab combinat ion therapy (ie, pyrexia and 
hypotension). These symptoms may b e seen in infusion reactions as well as other known 
syndromes, such as tumor lysis syndrome and macrophage activati on syndrome. For suspected 
CRS of Grade 3 or above, the Investigator is enc ouraged to contact th e Medical Monitor or 
designee. An algori thm for the management of CRS is provided in Appendix 11 (not applicable 
per Protocol Amendment 03).
7.4.6 Treatment of Bempegaldesleukin- Related or Nivolumab-Related Infusion 
Reactions
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the text below related to bempegaldes leukin is not applicable.
Infusion reactions have been reported during bempegaldesleukin a nd nivolumab infusions. If such 
a reaction were to occur with either the bempegaldesleukin or ni volumab infusion, it might 
manifest with fever, chills, ri gors, headach e, rash, pruritus, arthr algias, myalgia, hypotensi on, 
hypertension, bronchospasm, or other hypersensitivity/allergic- like reactions. 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at the bedside and moni tor the participant until recover y from symptoms. The 
following prophylactic premedications are recommended for futur e infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/parac etamol 325 mg to 
1000 mg at least 30 minutes before subsequent infusions. Subsequen t infusions may be 
administered at a reduced rate (eg, 50% of the original infusio n rate).
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interr uption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, nonstero idal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤ 24 hours):
•Stop the bempegaldesleukin or ni volumab infusion, begin an IV in fusion of normal saline, and 
treat the participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivale nt) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 mg to 1000 mg; remain at the bedsid e and monitor the 
participant until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may 
also be administered as appropriate.  If the infusion is interru pted, then restart the infusion at 
50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve. If sym ptoms recur after restarting 
the bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab infusion, then no further bempegaldesleukin or

nivolumab will be administered at that visit. Administer diphen hydramine 50 mg IV, remain 
at the bedside, and monitor the participant until resolution of  symptoms. 
•For future infusions, the fo llowing prophylactic premedications  are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before the i nfusion. If n ecessary, corticosteroids 
(up to 25 mg of methylprednisolone or equivalent) may be used. Su bsequent infusions may be 
administered at a reduced r ate (eg, 50% of the original i nfusion rate) (see Section 7.7.4.1 for 
corticosteroid dose equivalents).
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms (severe reaction, Grade 3: prol onged [ie, not rapidly responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or brief inter ruption of infusion]; r ecurrence of symptoms 
following initial improv ement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [e g, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: life-threatening; pressor or ve ntilatory support 
indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab. Begin an IV i nfusion 
of normal saline and treat the participant as follows: recommen d bronchodilators, epinephrine 
0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 
1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or  diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 
with methylprednisolone 100 mg I V (or equiv alent), as needed. Ni volumab and 
bempegaldesleukin will be permanently discontinued. The particip ant should be monitored 
until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Investigators should 
follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaph ylaxis. Remain at the bedside 
and monitor the  participant until recovery of the symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersen sitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment m ay be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability

•Immunosuppressive agents
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in  Section 7.7.5 )
•Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormo nal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-p alliative rad iation therapy , or standa rd or investigational agents for treatment 
of melanoma)
•Any botanical preparation (eg, herbal supplements or traditional  Chinese medicines) intended 
to treat the dis ease under study or provide supportive care. Use of marijuana and its derivatives 
for treatment of symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment  are permitted if obtained by 
medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical pres cription) has been legalized

All medications (prescription and OTC), vitamin and mineral sup plements, and/or herbs taken by 
the participant from screeni ng through the follo w-up (100 days f rom the last dose of the study
treatment) w ill be documented and recorded, including start and stop d ate, dose and route of 
administration, frequenc y, and indication. Medi cations taken for a procedure (eg, biopsy) should 
also be included.
7.7.3.1 COVID-19 Vaccination
A decision to vaccinate individuals is up to the individual and  the treating physician unless 
prohibited by the protocol. Of note, COVID-19 vaccine response and safety may have the potential 
to be affected by administration of a particular IP. When feasible, the full vaccination series (eg, both doses of a two-dose series) shoul d be comp leted 
prior to treatment until the vaccine-associated symptoms of the vaccine are stabilized and a delay 
in treatment would not put the study participant at risk. If a participant is already in the study, the full vaccination series is allowable. Study dose 
administration must be delayed until the vaccine-associated sym ptoms of the vaccine are
stabilized. The appropriate information should be captured to a ssess any potential vaccine-related 
adverse events. There does not need to be a minimum duration between the last a dministration of IP and 
administration of COVID-19 vaccine. If possible, avoid overlap o f administration (eg, at least 
2 days, preferably 7 days apart).COVID-19 vaccines have the potential to impact immunological ph armacodynamic biomarkers.

7.7.4 Other Restrictions and Precautions
7.7.4.1 Restricted Treatments
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with  either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medicat ions within 14 days of 
randomization are excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids, and ad renal replacement steroid doses 
10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.
7.7.4.2 Restricted Treatments
The guidance for anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapy for  the prevention and treatment of 
venous thromboembolic disease was included to mitigate the pote ntial increase d risk of isch emic 
cerebrovascular events (ICEs) observed in participants treated with bempegaldesleukin plus 
nivolumab. Per Protocol Amendment 03, participan ts will receive nivolumab monotherapy only. 
Nivolumab monotherapy does not appear to be associated with an i ncreased risk of ICE, and 
anticoagulation therapy will no longer be mand ated for participants enrolled on the study. There 
are no data suggesting how long the duration of  potential increased risk of ICE persists after the 
discontinuation of bempegaldesleukin. Decisions regarding antit hrombotic therapy should be 
based on the Investigator’s assessment of the benefit/risk for each individual participant.
The remainder of this section is not applicable per Protocol Am endment 03. Participants with 
a history of a venous or arterial thromboembolic event must be receiving a stable regimen of 
therapeutic anticoagulation (preferably LMWH or DOAC). Unless t here is a new medical 
contraindication observed after Cy cle 1 Day 1, a participant with a history of a venous or arteri al 
thromboembolic event must be maintained on therapeutic anticoag ulation throughout the 
participant’s time on study treatment.
Anticoagulation options include the following:
•Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
•Oral factor Xa inhibitors  (direct oral anti -coagulants [DOAC] such as rivaroxaban, apixa ban, 
or edoxaban).
•Use of warfarin (Coumadin) is permitted; however, therapeutic dosing should target a specific 
INR stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Because bem pegaldesleukin has the 
potential to down-regulate m etabolizing enzymes for warfarin for approximately 1 week after 
administration of each dose of bempegaldesleukin, frequent moni toring of INR and ongoing 
consideration of warfarin dose adjustments are warranted throug hout the participant’s 
participation on study.
If anticoagu lation is being newly introduced or adjusted, the Investigator may consider consulting 
the Medical Monitor (or designee) for guidance.
7.7.4.3 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility’ s responsibility to determine, based on participant attributes (eg, 
allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging mo dality and contrast

regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindications and con trast risks should be considered in 
this assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency  should b e assessed as to whether or not they 
should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contra st is appropriate. 
Specific to MRI, participants with severe renal insufficiency ( ie, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI 
contrast should not be given to this participant population. In addition, participants are excluded
from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. Gentle hydration before and 
after IV contrast should follow local standard of care. The ult imate decision to perform MRI in an 
individual participant in this study rests with the site radiol ogist, the Investigator and the standard 
set by the local Ethics Committee.
7.7.4.4 Blood Pressure Precautions
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Consideration should be given to 
discontinuing antihypertensive medications including diuretics,  as well as other drugs with 
hypotensive properties (eg, alpha blockers for benign prostatic  hypertrophy ) prior t o each dose of 
bempegaldesleukin, particularly when therapy involves multiple antihypertensive drugs and 
classes other than thiazide di uretics. If withholding antihypert ensive medications, wit hhold no less 
than 12 hours and no more than 48 hours pri or to each dose of bempegaldesleukin. Participants 
who are on medications with antihypertensive effects for the tr eatment of coronary artery disease 
(CAD; eg, beta-blockers, Ca channel blockers, nitrates, etc) sho uld be able to withhold these drugs 
prior to initiation of treatment.Antihypertensive medications may be reinstituted in between dos es of bempegaldesleukin at any 
time as clinically indicated (eg, based on blood pressure monit oring results).
In participants receiving beta-blockers, consider a step-wise t apering of doses before initiation of 
bempegaldesleukin to avoid reflex tachycardia. If Grade 2 or hig her hypertension is observed in
any cycle, participants should be monitored more frequently (at  least weekly until a new stable 
antihypertensive regimen is identified). Participants may be mo nitored more frequently at the 
discretion of the Inve stigator as clinically warranted.

Permitted Therapy
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable. 
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-ar ticular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with  minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily of prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for tr eatment of non-auto immune conditions (e g, delayed-
type hypersensitivi ty reaction cau sed by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Prophylaxis for flu-like symptoms with either  acetami nophen or ibuprofen is permi tted on study 
per the Investigator’s discretion. Prophylaxis for flu-like sym ptoms should be initiated on either 
Day 1 or Day 2 of t he dosing cycle and may continue through Day 5 or longer as  needed.
Prophylaxis for rash and/or pruritus with anti-histamines is pe rmitted on study per the 
Investigator’s discretion. Prophylaxis for rash and/or pruritus should be initiated on either Day 1

7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to de monstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied study treatment for the maximum treatment duration in Protocol 
Section 7.1 . Study treatment will be provided via an extension of the study, a rollover study 
requiring approval by responsible h ealth authority and ethics co mmittee or through another 
mechanism at the discretion of BMS.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied stud y treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b) th e development of nivolumab and 
bempegaldesleukin is terminated for other reasons, including but  not limited to lack of efficacy 
and/or not meeting the study object ives; c) the participant can  obtain medication from a 
government sponsored or priv ate health program. In all cases BM S will follow local regulations.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, BMS is terminating the development o f bempegaldesleukin in 
combination with nivolumab. If BMS decides to terminate the stud y all sites will be notified and 
given a period of time to discontinue study tr eatment and transition all participants to commercially 
available SOC tr eatment. The Sponsor may provide a lternative mechanisms to rece ive treatment 
for participants who cannot afford or access commercially avail able SOC treatments.
8 DISCONTINUATION AND RESUMPTION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Participants MUST discontinue  investigational product (and non- investigational product at the 
discretion of the I nvestigator) for any of the following reason s:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to be followed for pr otocol specified 
follow-up pro cedures. The only exception to this is when a part icipant specifically withdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to 
provide this information
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, ind icates that continued participa tion in the study is not in the best 
interest of the participant
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent t hrough imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of eit her a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious dis ease) illness. (Note: Under 
specific circumstances and only in countries where local regulations permit, a participant who has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participa nt. Strict conditions apply and 
BMS approval is required.)
•Disease progression in the absence of clinical benefit as deter mined by the Investigator.

RECIST 1.1
•SeeSection 8.1.1 for Nivolumab and Bempegaldesleukin Discontinuation Criteria.
•Noncompliance of the participant with protocol-mandated procedu res based on the judgment 
and agreement of both the Investigator and Sponsor
If a participant has not progressed following discontinuation o f study drug(s), every effort should 
be made to continue to obtain radiographic tumor assessments un til Investigator confirmed 
progression.
A participant may also be wit hdrawn from investigational produc t/study by the Sponsor, 
Regulatory Authorities, or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/ Independent Ethics Committees 
(IECs).Participants may choose to discontinue the study at any time, f or any reason, and without prejudice 
to further treatment.Refer to the Schedule of Activities for data t o be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation 
and follow- up and for any further evaluations that can be compl eted.
In the case of pregnancy, the Inve stigator must immediatel y, wi thin 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this even t.In all cases, the study 
treatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for participant safety). Refer to Section 9.2.5 Pregnancy.
All participants who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 2 . The only exception to this requirement is when a participant 
withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent fr eely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s c ompletion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s med ical records and en tered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.8.1.1
Nivolumab and Bempegaldesleukin Discontinuation Criteria
Per Protocol Amendment 03, participants receiving bempegaldesle ukin plus nivolumab are 
required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and will receive nivolu mab monotherapy.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the text below related to bempegaldes leukin is not applicable.
Participants meeting a ny of the following criteria w ill be required t o permanently discontinue all 
assigned study drug(s). However, with Medical Monitor (or desig nee) approval, treatment with 
bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab alone may continue if the toxiciti es listed below are considered 
related to bempegaldesleukin or to nivolumab only and once the cr iteria to resume are met ( Section  
8.1.2 ).

Nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin treatment should be permanently discontinued per criteria in 
Table 7.4.1-1 and Table 7.4.1-2 .
Discontinue study treatment for participants receiving bempegal desleukin in combination with 
nivolumab:
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the  judgment of the 
Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the partic ipant with continued nivolumab 
and bempegaldesleukin dosing.
•Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 8 weeks from the previous dose requires
discontinuation, with the following exceptions:
−Dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage d rug-related adverse events 
are allowed. 
−Dosing delays lasting > 8 weeks from the previous dose that occ ur for non-drug-related 
reasons may be allowed if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor ( or designee). 
Prior to re-initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing  delay lasting > 8 weeks, the BMS 
Medical Monitor (or designee) must be cons ulted. Tumor assessme nts should continue as per 
protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to as sess safety and laboratory studies 
should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing 
delays.
8.1.2 Criteria to Resume Bempegaldesleukin and/or Nivolumab
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the text below related to bempegaldes leukin is not applicable . 
Participants may resume tr eatment with study intervention if the y have completed AE management 
(ie, corticosteroid taper) or are on ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equiva lent, and meet the requirements 
per Table 7.4.1-1 and Table 7.4.1-2.
Participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection (either confirmed or sus pected) may resume treatment 
after all of the following:
1) At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical illness) have p assed since symptoms first appeared 
or positive test result (eg, RT-PCR or viral antigen),
2) Resolution of acute symptoms (including at least 24 hours has passed since last fever without 
fever-reducing medications),
3) Evaluation by the Investigator with confirmation that there are no sequelae that would place 
the participant at  a higher risk of receiving investigational t reatment, and
4) Consultation by the Medical Monitor (or designee). 
For suspected cases, treatment ma y also resume if SARS-CoV-2 in fection is ruled-out and other 
criteria to resume treatment are met.
If the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline > 8 weeks after t he last dose, but the participant 
does not otherwise meet the criteria for permanent discontinuat ion (see Section 8.1.1 ), and the 
Investigator believes that the participant is deriving clinical  benefit, then the participant may be 
eligible to resume the study drug(s) following the approval of the Medical Monitor (or designee).

8.1.3 Treatment Beyond Progression
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of participants trea ted with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of progressive  disease.20,52
Participants, regardless of study arm, will be permitted to cont inue treatment bey ond initial 
RECIST 1.1 defined progressi ve disease or clinical progression, assessed by the Investigator, as 
long as they meet the following criteria: 
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit
•Tolerance of study treatment
•Stable performance status
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Participant provides written informed consent prior to receivin g additional study treatment. All 
other elements of the main consent including description of rea sonably foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternative  treatment op tions will still apply.
Radiographic assessment should continue as per schedule ( Table 2-2) during treatment beyond 
progression. The assessment of clinical benefit s hould be b alanced by clinical judgment as to 
whether the participant is clinically d eteriorating and unlikel y to receive any benefit from 
continued study treatment.
If the Investigator feels that the participant continues to ach ieve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatment, the participant should remain on the trial and conti nue to receive monitoring according 
to the Schedule of Acti vities, Table 2-2.
For the participants wh o continue study therapy bey ond progression, further progression is defined 
as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase from time 
of initial progressive disease. Thi s includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions 
and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the  time of initial progressive disease.
Study treatment should be discont inued permanently upon documentation of further progression.
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial pro gression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least
15 mm). Any new lesion considere d non-measurable at the time of i nitial progressio n may become 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the lon gest diameter increases to at least 
10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a sh ort axis of at least 15 mm). In 
situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by  10% is solely due to inclusion of 
new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must dem onstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.
8.1.4 Post Study Treatment Study Follow-up
In this study, ORR, PFS, and OS are key endpoints of the study. Please refer to Section 5.1  for

safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who discont inue study treatment must continue 
to be followed (in this study or a rollover study) for collecti on of outcome and/or s urvival follow-
up data as required and in line with Section 5.1.3 until death or the conclusion of the study. The 
total duration of the study is  up to 5 years after randomizatio n of the last participant. 
The Sponsor may request that survival data be collected on all tr eated/randomized participants 
outside of the protocol-defined window (Schedule of Activities,  Section 2 ). At the time of this 
request, each participant will be contacted to determine their survival status unless the participant 
has withdrawn consent for all contacts or is lost to follow-up.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, this paragraph is not applicable . Additional subsequent cancer 
therapy details such as regimen, setting of the regimen, line o f therapy, start date and end date of 
each regimen, best response to the regimen, and date of progres sion after next lin e of therapy will 
be collected.8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Participants who request to disc ontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue 
to be followed up to 100 days for protocol specified follow-up procedures with documentation of 
last overall survival. The only exception to this is when a part icipant specifically withdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previou sly authorized by participant to 
provide this information. 
•Participants should notify the Investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
•The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical rec ords by the 
Investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further trea tment with study treatment only 
or also from study proce dures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the  
appropriate CRF page.
•In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information s hould be used to determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.
•If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future i nformation, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a wit hdrawal of consent.
8.3 Lost to Follow-Up
•All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to d etermine and report their ongoing 
status. This include s follow-up with pers ons authorized by the participant.
•Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the part icipant after a minimum of three
documented phone calls, faxe s, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in th e participant’s medical records.
•If it is determined that the participant has died, the site wil l use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death.

records.
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of A ctivities. 
•Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponso r immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to con firm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria before randomization . The Investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened an d to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clini cal management (eg, bl ood count) 
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be utilized  for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on-site/local 
labs until all study drug-related toxicities resolve, return to  baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
If a participant shows pulmona ry-related signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, 
fever) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the susp ected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS-936558 (nivolumab) Investigator ’s Brochure.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the CRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating ph ysician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary  or where required by institutional or lo cal 
regulations.

9.1 Efficacy Assessments
Per Protocol Amendment 03, BICR assessment of imaging will be d iscontinued. Response and 
progression will be determined by the Investigator.
9.1.1 Imaging Assessments for the Study
As of Protocol Amendment 03, images will no longer be submitted to an imaging core lab. Sites 
should be qualified prior to scanning the first participant and  understand the image acquisition 
guidelines as outlined in the CA045001 Imaging Manual provided by the imaging core lab. 
Screening and follow-up images should be acquired as outlined i n Section 2 , (Schedule of 
Activities).Evaluate any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor respo nse or p rogression (including 
scans performed at unscheduled time points and/or at an outside institution) for RECIST 1.1 tumor 
assessment. X-Ray and bone scans that clearly demonstrate interval progressi on of disease, most 
commonly as unequivocal lesions that are unmistakably new since  the prior CT/MRI, should be 
included in tumor assessment.
Any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor response or p rogression (including scans 
performed at unscheduled time points and/or at an outside instit ution) should be included for 
RECIST 1.1 tumor assessment.
9.1.1.1
Methods of Measurement
Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and all oth er known and/or suspected sites 
of disease should be performed for tumor assessments. Images sh ould be acquired with slice 
thickness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap (contiguous).  Every attempt shoul d be made to 
image each participant using an identical acquisition protocol on the same scanner for all imaging 
time points. Tumor measurements should be made by the same Investigator or radiologist for each 
assessment whenever possible. Change in tumor measurements and tumor response to guide 
ongoing study treatment decisions will be assessed by the Inves tigator using the RECIST 1.1 
criteria.
Should a participant have contraindication for CT intravenous c ontrast, a non-contrast CT of the 
chest and a contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and o ther known/suspected sites of 
disease should be obtained.
Should a particip ant have contraindication for both MRI and CT i ntravenous contrasts, a non-
contrast CT of the chest and a non-contrast MRI of the abdomen,  pelvis, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease should be obtained. Should a participant have contraindication for MRI (eg, incompa tible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindication to CT intravenous contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and 
other known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.

and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; theref ore, the recommendations outlined 
here may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation corr ection CT 
portions  of a combined PET-CT are of limited use in anatomically-based efficacy assessments and 
it is therefore suggested that they should not be substituted f or dedicated diagnostic contrast 
enhanced CT scans for anatomically-based RECIST 1.1 measurement s. However, if a site can 
document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identi cal dia gnostic qu ality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT portion o f the PET-CT can be used for 
RECIST 1.1 measurements. Note, how ever, that th e PET porti on of  the CT introduces additional 
data which may bias an Investigator if it is not routinely  or serially performed.
Bone scan or PET scan is not adequate for assessment of RECIST 1.1 response in target lesions. 
In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole mo dality used to assess cer tain 
non-target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated les s frequently .For example, bone 
scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is id entified in target disease or when 
progression in bone is suspected.
MRI of brain without and with contrast should be acquired as ou tlined in Section 2 (Schedule of 
Activities). CT of the Brain without and with contrast can be p erformed if MRI is contraindicated.
Bone scans may be collected per local standards, as clinically indicated.
9.1.1.2 Imaging and Clinical Assessment 
Tumor assessments should continue even if dosing is delayed or discontinued. Changes in tumor 
measurements and tumor responses will be assessed by the same I nvestigator using RECIST 1.1 
criteria. Investigators will re port the number and size of new lesions that appear wh ile on study. 
The time point of tumor assessments will be reported on the CRF based on the Investigator’s 
assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria (See Appendix 9 for specifics of RECIST 1.1 criteria to be 
utilized in this study). Assessments of PR and CR must be confir med at least 4 weeks (28 days) 
after initial response. A Best Overall Response (BOR) of stable d isease (SD) requires a minimum 
of 42 days on study from randomization to the date of the first  imaging assessment.
9.1.1.3 BICR Confirmation of Progression
Per Protocol Amendment 03, BICR will be discontinued and all stu dy treatment decisions will be 
based on the Investigator’s assessment of tumor images.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Sites should submit all scans to the imaging core 
lab on a rolling basis, throughout the duration of the study. B ICR of scans w ill occur on a rolling 
basis, blinded to treatment arm,  clinical d ata, and Investigator assessment of submitted scans. 
When progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria is assessed by the Inv estigator, the site will inform the 
imaging core lab, so that the BICR assessment of progression ca n be performed. The BICR review 
will be comp leted and the results provided to t he site as specified in imaging vendor documents, 
provided there are no pending imaging queries to the site. All details on the timelines and 
associated process requirements will be outlined in the Imaging  Manual.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Participants whose progression is not confirmed

The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE), per CT CAE version 5, can be fo und in 
Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized repre sentative). 
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and re porting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 9.2.1
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
All AEs (SAEs and nonserious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 
infection and all SAEs must be collected from the time of signi ng the consent, including those 
thought to be associated with protocol-specified procedures, and  within 100 days of 
discontinuation of dosing.
•Cerebrovascular accident (CVA; any grade) is considered an adve rse event of special interest 
(AESI/AEOSI) and should be assessed as an SAE. All CVAs are requ ired to follow the 
timelines for SAE reporting (eg, 24 hours).
SAEs to be collected after the 100-day safety visit if the SAE is deemed to be related or residual 
toxicities are persisting. •Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatme nt but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the CRF modules.
•All SAEs will be rec orded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as i ndicated

has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the ev ent reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, t he Investigator must promptl y notify the Sponsor.
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAE s and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be tak en not to introduce bias when 
collecting AE and/ or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgment in 
the context of known adverse events, when appropriate for the program or protocol.All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be trea tment-related) should be collected 
continuousl y during the tr eatment period a nd for a minimum of  100 days following discontinuation 
of study treatment.
 
 
9.2.3
Follow-up of AEs  and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be follo wed to resolution  or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treat ment as appropriate.
•All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities t hat are reported/identified du ring the course of the study.
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the c ondition stabilizes, un til the event is 
otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). 
After the initial AE/SAE re port, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each p articipant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs (SAEs and nonserious AEs ) associated with confirmed or 
suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will be followed until resolutio n, until the condi tion stabilizes, 
until the event is otherwise e xplained, or until the participan t is lost to follow-up (as defined in 
Section 8.3). For suspected cases, participants should be followed until SARS -CoV-2 infection is 
ruled out as per institutional policy on SARS-CoV-2.Further informatio n on follow- up procedures is given in Appendi x 3.

9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notificatio n by the Investigator to the S ponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants  and the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation are met.
An Investigator who receives an I nvestigator safety report desc ribing SAEs or other specific safety 
information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the S ponsor w ill file it along with the 
Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropr iate acc ording to local 
requirements.Sponsor or designee w ill be reporting adverse events to regu latory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including Europea n Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA 
Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR ( Suspected, Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be repor ted to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and Investigators following local and global guidel ines and requirements.
9.2.5
Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subseque ntly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposur e, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product administration, the Investigator must  immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3 .
Serum or urine pregnancy tests w ill be performe d on women of chi ldbearing potential (WOCBP) 
according to the Schedule of Activities. A negative pregnancy t est result must be obtained before 
the administration of the study drug(s).
A pregnancy test does not need to be performed on women who are postmenopausal. A definition 
of post-menopausal can be found in Appendix 4.
If a female participant becomes pregnant, administration of the  study drug(s) must be discontinued. 
Requirements for reporting a pregna ncy are provided in Appendix  3.
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study p articipant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collec t any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partne r, the fe male pa rtner must si gn an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this information. Information on th is pregnancy w ill be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.In cases where a study drug can be present in seminal fluid, at  exposures sufficient to potentially 
cause fetal toxicity, and if any sexual activity (eg, vaginal, anal, oral) has occurred between a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information sh ould be reported to the Sponsor

Information on the pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.
This paragraph is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Additional information may 
also be collected on select AEs primarily related to bempegaldesleukin , including hypotension, 
capillary leak syndro me, and eosinophilic disorders. A list of relevant AE terms will be maintained 
by the Medical Surveillance Team/Drug Safety Committee or equiv alent.
9.2.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI/AEOSI)
Cerebrovascular accident (CVA; any grade) is considered an adve rse event of special interest 
(AESI/AEOSI) and should be assessed as an SAE. All CVAs are required to follow the timelines 
for SAE reporting (eg, 24 hours). CVA management guidelines are provided in Appendix 7.
9.2.8 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the non-serious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms  are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the partic ipant to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the partic ipant to r eceive sp ecific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than  laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting Investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .
9.2.9 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) event. All occurrences 
of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be repor ted as SAEs (see Section 9.2 and

Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a non-serious or serious AE, as appropriate , and reported accordingly.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administ ration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses  that meet the regulatory 
definition of SAE will be reported as an SAE (see Appendix 3 ).All instances of accidental 
overdose and/or dosing errors should be reported on the Dosage Administration Record CRF.
9.4 Safety
Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in th e Schedule of Activities.
9.4.1 Vital Signs and Oxygen Saturation
Vital sign measurements will be  recorded according to the Sched ule of Activities (Section 2 ). Vital 
signs include pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure , and temperature. Pulse oximetry 
will also be included at baseline only. It is preferred that th e same arm be used for all blood pressure 
readings, if possible. Instructions for more frequent vital sig n monitoring after completion of study 
drug administration are provided in Section 2.

9.8.1 Additional Research Collection
This section is applicable only for samples collected prior to P rotocol Amendment 03. This 
protocol will include residual sample storage for additional re search (AR).
For All US sites:
Additional research participation is required for all investiga tional sites in the US.
If the IRB and investigative site agree to the mandatory additi onal research retention and/or 
collection, then the study participant must agree to the mandat ory additional research collection as 
a requirement for participation in the study.
For non-US Sites
Additional research is optional for all study participants, exc ept where retention and/or collection 
is prohibited by local laws or regulations, ethics committees, or institutional requirements. 
This collection for additional research is intended to expand t he translational R&D capability at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and will s upport as yet undefined research aims that will advance our 
understanding of disease and options for treatment. It may also be used to support health authority 
requests for analysis, and advancement of pharmacodiagnostic de velopment to better target drugs 
to the right patients. This may also include genetic/genomic ex ploration aimed at exploring disease 
pathways, progression and response to treatment etc. 
Sample Collection and Storage
All requests for access to samples or data for additional resea rch will be vetted through a diverse 
committee of the study Sponsor’s sen ior leaders in Research and Development (or designee) to 
ensure the research supports appropriate and well-defined scien tific research activities.
Residual  serum,  and plasma biomarkers, PBMC s, whole blood and extracted 
DNA/RNA, and tumor biopsy co llections Table 9.8.1-1 will also be retained for additional 
research purposes.Samples kept for future research w ill be stored at the BMS Biorepository  or 
an independent, BMS-approved storage vendor.
The manager of these samples wil l ensure they are properly used  throughout their usable life and 
will destroy the samples at the end of the scheduled storage pe riod, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study or the maximum allowed by appl icable law.
Transfers of samples by research sponsor to third parties will be subject to the recipient’s 
agreement to establish similar storage procedures.
Samples will be stored in a coded fashion, and no researcher will have access to the key. The key

9.8.3 Tumor Tissue Specimens
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected spec imens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
All participants must have tumor tissue submitted during the sc reening period to allow for 
participant enrollment into the study. Tissue submitted should b e from an unresectable primary 
tumor lesion or any metastatic site. The tumor tissue should be from a site not previously irradiated 
and with no intervening treatm ent between time of acquisition a nd enrollment. Central lab must 
provide IRT with the results of PD-L1 testing prior to randomiz ation. Either a FFPE tissue block
or 20 uns tained tum or tissue sections, with an associated pathology re port, must be submitted to 
the core laboratory for inclusion. FFPE tissue block and unstained slides submitted should be from 
biopsy obtained within 6 months prior to enrollment. Unstained s lides should be sectioned within 
3 months prior to submission. Submission of an FFPE block is str ongly preferred but unstained 
slides are also acceptable. Ti ssue may be from a core biopsy, pu nch biopsy, excisional or incisional 
biopsy, or surgical specimen; fine needle aspiration and other cytology samples are not acceptable. 
Biopsies of bone lesions that do not have a soft tissue compone nt are also unacceptable for 
submission. 
The Medical Monitor (or designee) can be consulted for eligibil ity if participants have less than 
20 unstained slides.PD-L1 stained tissue sections  will be assessed by a pathologist and membranous PD-L1 expression 
scored in tumor and immune cells if a minimum of a hundred (100 ) evaluable tumor cells are 
present. Participants with tumor samples containing less than 1 00 cells per tissue section w ill not 
be randomized, but participants with positive, negative, or inde terminate (membrane staining is 
obscured by high cytoplasmic staining or melanin content) PD-L1 tumor expression will be 
stratified based on their expression.
In addition, this pre-treatment tumor sample may be used to assess other pu tative predictive
biomarkers of nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin efficacy and/or to better characterize the
tumor-immune microenvironment.
Various molecular markers with potential predictive value for the treatm ent of melanoma with
nivolumab, bempegaldesleukin, and o ther immunotherapies are currently under investigation and
may be assessed in this study. These tumor tissue biomarkers include, but are not limited to
PD-1, PD-L2, TILs or subpopulations of TILs and any immune mRNA expression signature.
These pre-treatment tumor samples m ay also be used to further characteriz et h et u m o r -

radiographic efficacy assessments. These same criteria that app ly for lesion selection also apply to
patients who consent to the optional biopsy in the main study.
It is also highly recommended that tumor tissue samples be collecte d on-treatment and upon
recurrence when safe and feasible. These samples may be used for the as sessment of markers
implicated in resistance to immunotherapeutic agents, including but not limited to other T cell
checkpoint receptors and ligands (eg, Lag-3, Tim-3) and intratumoral imm une cell subsets,
including but not limited to, T regulato ry cells and myeloid derived s uppressor cells. These
samples may also be used to investigate the effect of nivolumab and bempeg aldesleukin on
the expression of potenti ally relevant predict ive and/or prognostic melanoma biomarkers,
including, but not limited to BRAF mutation and PD-L1 tumor expression and other immuno-
oncology-related events such as upregulation/downregulation of chemokines and cytokines. Both
the pre-treatment tumor sample and the sample collected on-treatment a nd upon recurrence
may be retrospectively assessed for BRAF mutation status, N-RAS mutation status, as well as
for the expression of other immune  or melanoma related genes, RNAs a nd/or proteins, or for the 
presence of immune cell populations using a variety of met hodolog ies inclusive of, but not limited

9.8.4 Tumor Gene Expression and Mutation Analyses
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However, 
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected specimens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) refe rs to the total number of nons ynonymous somatic mutations 
that exist within a tumor’s genome. A subset of these mutations , termed neo-antigens, may result 
in an expressed protein that is not recognized by the host’s im mune system as self, and therefore 
has the potential to be immunogenic, leading to an anti-tumor i mmune-mediated response. Tumors 
with a high mutation burden ma y have a higher rate of neo-antigens which, in principle, would  be 
expected to be more immunogenic than tumors with comparatively low mutation burden.54
Therefore, high TMB has been hypothesized to correlate with improved efficacy in pati ents treated 
with immuno-oncology therapies. This hypothesis has been support ed in multiple publications 
across immuno-oncology therapies, tumor types, and lines of tre atment. The first published study 
of TMB as a biomarker of clinical outcomes was reported by Snyd er et al (2014), where high TMB 
was found to be associated with efficacy in metastatic melanoma  patients treated with anti-CTLA-
4 therapy.55Further studies by Rizvi et al reported TMB as a biomarker of p embrolizumab efficacy 
in second-line NSCLC patients.55Additional studies of pembrolizumab and atezolizumab in 
NSCLC have been generally consistent with these results.56

Recently, TMB was evaluated in an exploratory post hoc analysis in the BMS-sponsored first-line 
NSCLC study, CheckMate-026, which represents the first Phase 3 s tudy to demonstrate the impact 
of TMB on efficacy of a PD-1/L1 inhibitor.57This analysis demonstrated that i n patients  with high 
TMB, ORR was numerically higher in t he nivolumab arm versus the  chemotherapy arm (47% vs
28%) and median PFS was longer in the nivolumab arm compared to the chemot herapy arm (9.7 
vs 5.8 months, HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). OS was notable, though similar (18.3 vs 18.8 monthsand 1 year OS rates of 64% vs 60%, respectively ), between the arms i n patients with high TMB, 
although of note, 68% of patients in the chemotherapy arm recei ved subsequent nivolumab.
58
Interestingly, the ORR and mPFS r ates observed in the high TMB subgroup within 
CheckMate-026 were s imilar to those reported in the first line NSCLC study of pembrolizumab 
(Keynote-024), where ORR and mPFS were 45% and 10.3 months, res pectively, in patients with 
≥50% PD-L1 expressi on treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy.58
The available data to date suggest that, in addition to PD-L1, TMB is also a biomarker of clinical 
efficacy to immuno-oncology therapy. Therefore, TMB w ill be included as an explorat ory 
biomarker of clinical efficacy of nivolumab with and without bem pegaldesleukin combination 
therapy.
To explore the potential association of tumor mutation burden w ith clinical outcomes, tumor tissue 
will be evaluated by targeted and/or whole exome sequencing.
Exploratory analyses of mRNA (and/or miRNA) will be completed u sing RNA isolated from 
tumor tissue. Targeted and/or whole transcriptome RNA-seq, micr oarrays, and/or similar 
methodologies will be used to assess gene expression signatures , such as but not limited to those 
associated with inflammatory proce sses and/or immune related signaling, for potential association 
with clinical outcomes.
9.8.5 Peripheral Biomarkers
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However, 
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected spec imens as detailed below may
be conducted.
A variety of biomarkers that ma y predict or impact th e treatment eff icacy with bempegaldesleukin

9.8.7 Exploratory Serum and Plasma Biomarkers
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected specimens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
Blood samples  for exploratory serum and plasma biomarker analyses will be dr awn at the specified 
time points indicated in the biomarker table. Additionally, ser um and plasma samples will be 
collected when clinically safe and feasible, upon occurrence of  a Grade 3 drug-related AE that 
results in a dose delay. Separate blood samples w ill be collected and processed for serum and 
plasma and then put in frozen storage. Serum and plasma samples  may be assessed by ELISA, 
seromics, microRNA profiling, ctDNA measurements, metabolomics a nd/or other relevant 
multiplex-based protein assay methods for immune -related facto rs that may predict for nivolumab 
and/or bempegaldesleukin benefit or AEs; such factors may includ e, but are not limited to levels 
of soluble PD-L1, anti-tumor antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory factors, NKG2D 
ligands (eg, soluble MICA), circulating tumor DNA, SARS-CoV-2 se rologic status, and 
microRNAs (eg, angiopoietin-2 and fibronectin). Serum and plasma may also be assessed for additional factors that may inform on the etiology of CVA events ; such factors may include, but 
are not limited to those associat ed with vascular damage (eg, v WF, soluble P-selectin), coagulation 
and platelet activation (D-dimer, prothrombin 1.2, fibrinogen, solCD40L), eosi nophil activation 
(eosinophil cationic protein) and inflammatory markers relevant  to CVA (eg, CRP, TNFα, IL-6, 
VCAM/ICAM).
9.8.8 Plasma ctDNA
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected speci mens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are small fragments of DNA that ar e shed from tum or and can 
be found circulating in the peripheral bloodstream. ctDNA derive d from malignant cells can be 
isolated and analyzed from blood-derived plasma for genetic fea tures including, but not limited to 
somatic mutations using targeted sequencing-based methods (eg, N ext Generation sequencing). 
To complement the planned genomics analyses outlined for tumor assessments, plasma will be 
collected at baseline and on-tr eatment to isolate ctDNA. Mutational data derived from these 
samples will be compared to those identified directly in the tu mor. Baseline and on-treatment 
changes in mutational burden (either global or individual genes)  will be evaluated for association 
with treatment outcomes. Correlation between mutational burden in blood and th e tumor will be 
explored.

9.8.9 Serum MicroRNA (miRNA)
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected specimens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are widely-expressed, small RNAs that regulat e the abundance of mRNA 
transcripts and their translation into protein. Global miRNA ex pression profiling has become 
increasingly common in cancer research, and miRNA signatures th at are correlated to stage of 
disease or to clinical outcomes are now available for a variety  of cancer types. Expression profiling 
of miRNA may be useful also in identifying molecular markers fo r the prediction of drug responses 
and for prospective stratification. Intriguingly, miRNAs are st able in serum and may represent 
miRNAs over-expressed in tumors and/or reflect immune system ac tivity. Serum taken at baseline 
and during treatment from participants randomized to each tr eatment arm w ill be analyzed for 
miRNA content by microarray or similar met hodology. The resulting miRNA profiles w ill be 
evaluated for changes in miRNA abundance that occurs following treatment and for associations 
with response and survival data. Ultimately, the goal w ill be to determine if unique 
immunerelevant and/or disease-specific miRNA signatures exist an d if they are potentially useful 
for identifying participants who are likely (or unlikely) to respond to nivolumab treatment.
9.8.10 Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected spec imens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are an immune cell population capable of suppressing 
T cell activation and proliferation. Low pre-treatment MDSC lev els in peripheral blood may be 
associated with better overall survival in melanoma participant s treated with nivolumab
combination. MDSCs will be measured at baseline and on-treatmen t to assess pharmacodynamic 
changes or associations with outcome.
9.8.11 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Whole Blood 
Immunophenotyping
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol  Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected specimens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
Whole-blood samples w ill be collected for isolation and cry opreservation of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both arms of the study. These cryop reserved samples may be used 
for functional activation tests, additional immunophenotyping a ssays, T-cell receptor sequencing, 
and DNA methylation.
Whole blood immunophenotyping by flow cytometry w ill be used to assess pre-tr eatment and 
serial on-treatment changes in composition/activation status of  peripheral immune cell subsets to 
determine PD changes and/or association with outcome. Cellular subsets evaluated w ill include, 
but not limited to, T, B, NK, natural k iller T cell (NKT), a nd T-regulatory cells. Cellular subsets

9.8.12 Microbiome Analysis
Biomarker sample collection will not be applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. However,
exploratory analysis of biomarkers on previously collected specimens as detailed below may 
be conducted.
The potential influence of the gut microbiome on melanoma treat ment outcome is not known. It is 
known that the microbiome can affect tr eatment of certain cancer types (ie, colorectal cancer) 
through several mechanisms, including promotion of disease via induction of chronic 
inflammation or catabolism of polyamines on other carcinogenic digestible material . In addition, 
the innate and adaptive immune system activation state and repe rtoire may be altered based on 
local microbiota leading to differential activity of nivolumab in cancer participants. DNA will be 
extracted from fecal samples taken prior to therapy and on-trea tment with nivolumab and 
nivolumab/bempegaldesleukin combination ( Table 9.8.2-2 ). A gene-sequencing approach will be 
utilized to survey microbial species in the gut in order to def ine microbiota as a function of efficacy 
and safety. Overall changes in the gut microbiota w ill also be character ized in individual 
participants that receive therapy.
9.9 Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. Healthcare resource utilization data 
will be collected for all ra ndomized participants using an internal CRF developed for use in  
previous trials. The form, which is completed by study staff, r ecords information about hospi tal 
admissions, including number of days spent in various wards and discharge diagnosis, as well as 
non-protocol specified visits related to study therapy, includi ng date of visit, reason for visit, and 
type of visit. The health care res ource utilization data will be used to support subsequent economic 
evaluations.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
In general, continuous data will be summarized by descriptive s tatistics, including number of 
participants, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical data will be 
summarized by the number and percentage of participants. Unless  otherwise specified, data will 
be summarized by treatment arm.
All efficacy evaluations will be analyzed using the intent-to-t reat (ITT) population, and all safety 
endpoints will be summarized using the Safety population.
A detailed description of analysis methods will be provided in the statist ical analysis pla n (SAP).
The final ORR and PFS analyses, and the first OS interim analysis (combined with the second OS 
interim analysis) have been com pleted using the locked database  with database lock date of 01-

Any further efficacy analyses, if conducted, will be descriptiv e.
10.1 Sample Size Determination
The sample size of the study accounts for the three primary eff icacy endpoints: ORR, PFS and OS. 
The overall alpha for this study is 0.05, which is split with 0 .001 to evaluate ORR, 0.03 to evaluate 
PFS and 0.019 to evaluate OS. All alphas are two-sided. ORR will be analyzed when the first 480 
randomized participants have a minimum follow-up of 6 months. PF S will be evalu ated for 
treatment eff ect at an alpha of 0.03 with at least 90% power; no interim analysis of PFS is planned. 
OS will be evaluated for treatment effect at an alpha level of 0.019. 
A fallback approach will be used to test ORR, PFS, and OS . If ORR is signif icant, the alpha of 
0.001 allocated to ORR will be passe d to OS. If PFS is signific ant, the alpha of 0.03 allocated to 
PFS will pass to OS. That is,
•If both ORR and PFS are significant, then OS will be tested at 0.05 level
•If PFS is significant but ORR is not, then OS will be tested at 0.049 level
•If ORR is significant but PFS is not, then OS will be tested at  0.02 level
•If neither ORR nor PFS is significant, then OS will remain to be tested at 0.019 level
It is estimated that approximately 764 previously untreated met astatic melanoma s ubjects will be 
randomized into two arms in a 1: 1 ratio. Table 10.1-1 summ arizes sample size design parameters

Note: Analysis time projections are updated based on updated en rollment projection in February , 2021. If final ORR 
and final PFS analyses occur close enough, they may be combined  into one analysis conducted at the final PFS analysis 
time. In this case, the ORR formal analysis will only be conducted for the ORR population.
10.1.1 Sample Size Justification for ORR Estimate
Given a two-sided alpha of 0.001, 48 0 subjects in nivolumab+bem pegaldesleukin and nivolumab 
arms will provide approximately 90% power to detect 21% ORR dif ference between the 2 
treatment arms, assuming ORRs of 66% and 45%, resp ectively, using a Chi-square test. If 
observed ORR difference is greater  than 14.9%, it will result a  statist ically si gnificant result. 
This ORR formal comparison will occur when the first 480 random ized participants have a 
minimum follow-up of 6 months. In the original protocol, the OR R formal comparison was 
projected to occur a pproximately 15.6 months after the first subject's randomizatio n date (9.6 
months of accrual of 480 subjects and 6 months of ORR follow-up ). That projection was based on 
the assumption that the accrual  duration of the study was appro ximately 15 months. 
Based on actual enrollment and updated projection in February 2021, where the accrual duration 
of the study is projected to be approximately  38.8 months, the ORR formal comparison is projected 
to occur approximately 35.9 months from the first subject's rand omization date (~29.9 months of 
accrual of 480 subjects and 6 months of ORR follow-up). If final  ORR and final PFS analyses 
occur close enough, they may be combined into one analysis cond ucted at the final PFS analysis 
time. In this case, the ORR formal analysis will only be conducted for the ORR population.
10.1.2 Sample Size Justification for PFS Comparison
Based on the PFS results for nivolumab from B MS Study CA209067 (ie, the CheckMate-067 
Study,36a non-constant PFS hazard was observed. Thus, for the sample si ze calculation, a 
piecewise exponential distribution was assumed in each treatmen t arm with a constant HR of 0.7. 
Specifically, in the nivolumab arm we assume PFS rates of 63%, 52%, 46%, and 37% at 3, 6, 9,

and 18 months, respectively. Under the assumptions of piecewise exponential distributio n for each 
arm and a constant HR of 0.7, the calculated median progression -free survival (mPFS) are
6.96 months and 17.8 months for the nivolumab and nivolumab+bempe galdesleukin arms, 
respectively. At a two-sided alpha level of 0.03, a total of 37 5 PFS events are needed t o detect a 
PFS hazard rati o (HR) of 0.7 with 90% power. In the original protocol, under the assumption of 
15 months of enrollment period, 7- months of minimum follow-up, and a 10% annual drop-out rate, 
a total sample size of 764 subjects is required to observe the needed 375 PFS events at 22 months. 
Under updated projection in February 2021, with 764 subjects an d 10% annual drop-out rate, the
PFS analysis time, ie, to observe approximately 375 PFS events,  is projected to occur at 
approximately 39.8 months from the first subject's randomization  date. It is projected that an 
observed HR of 0.799 or less would result in a statistic ally significant improvement in the final 
analysis of PFS.
10.1.3 Sample Size Justification for OS Comparison
For OS, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.019, a total of 419 events are needed to detect a HR of 0.70 
with 90% power. Assuming a median OS time for the nivolumab arm  (Arm B) of 37.6 months, 
with a total sample size of 764, in the original protocol it is  projected the total study duration is 59 
months (15 months for accrual and 44 months for follow up), with a critical boundary hazard ratio 
of 0.792. With updated enrollment projection in February 2021, i t is projected the total study 
duration (corresponding to the final OS analysis time) is appro ximately 76.3 months  from the first 
subject's randomization date. All projected OS interim analysis times are updated accordingly.
However, all PFS and OS analysis times are driven by the requir ed number of events. The actual 
analysis times depe nd on actual enrollment speed and events accrual, thus may be d ifferent from 
projections.
Three formal interim analyses of OS are planned for this study. T he first OS interim analysis is 
planned at the time point of the final PFS analysis, where OS wil l be tested at 0.0001 level, 
regardless of the outcome of the final PFS analysis. For instan ce, if 150 OS events are observed at 
the time point of the final PFS analysis, then the critical bou ndary on hazard ratio for the first OS 
interim is 0.53.All other formal OS analyses w ill be conducted when planned numb er of OS events specified 
below are observed.
The second OS interim analysis is planned when 230 OS events ar e observed (55% of the targeted 
OS events for final analysis, projected to happen 47.9 months from FPFV), and the third OS 
interim analysis is planned after observing 314 OS events (75% of targeted OS events needed for final analysis,  projected to happen 59 months from FPFV). Accounting for the alpha = 0.0001 
spent at the first OS interim, the remaining alpha level w ill be the over all OS alpha level (as 
described below) minus 0.0001 depending on the ORR and PFS results. If neither ORR nor PFS is significant, the remaini ng alpha level  of 0.0189 (al pha=0.019-0.0001) will be spe nt on the rest
of the OS interim analyses and the final OS analysis. The stopping boundaries for the second OS 
interim, the third OS interim, and the final OS analyses will be derived based on the actual number 
of deaths using the O’Brien and Fleming alpha-s pending function  in software EAST 6.4.1. If the

second, third OS interim analyses and the final OS analysis are 0.646, 0.729, and 0.792, 
respectively.
If the final ORR analysis is statist ically significant, the significance level of 0 .001 spent in the 
ORR analysis will be passed on to the OS analysis. Similarly, i f the final PFS analysis is 
statistically significant, the significance level of 0.03 spent  in the PFS analysis will also be passed 
on to the OS analysis. The alpha spent at the sec ond, third OS interim analyses and the final OS 
analysis will be adjusted accordingly and the overall alpha lev el for OS is described at the 
beginning of Section 10.1 .
If there are at least 230 OS events at the time point of the fi nal PFS analysis, then the first planned 
OS interim analysis and the second planned OS interim analysis (at 230 OS events) will be merged 
into one OS interim analysis, and will occur at the time point of the final PFS analysis. In this case, 
there will be no extra s pending of two-sided alpha  = 0.0001 for the firs t OS interim analysis, and 
the stopping boundaries for all OS analyses will be derived bas ed on the actual number of deaths 
using the O’Brien and Fleming alpha-spending function in softwar e EAST 6.4.1.
If the 419thOS event has not occurred 60 months after randomization of the last participant, then 
the final OS analysis will take place at that time. In such case, the final analysis boundary will be

10.2 Populations for Analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined :
Population Description
All Enrolled ParticipantsAll participants who signed an informed consent form and were r egistered 
into the IRT.
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
Population/All Randomized 
ParticipantsAll participants who were randomized. Participants are grouped within the 
ITT Population by the treatment to which they were randomized. This is the 
primary analysis set for baseline characteristics and all effic acy analyses.
ORR PopulationAll randomized participants who have at least 6 months of follo w-up at the 
time point of the final ORR analysis. A participant’s follow-up  time is 
defined here as the time between randomization date and clinica l data cut- off 
date regardless of participant disposition (ie, intent-to-treat  principle). 
This is the primary analysis set for the final ORR analysis, wh ich will occur 
when approximately the first 480 randomized participants have a t least 6

randomized participants who have baseline and at least one post -baseline 
biomarker data available.
All PD-L1 evaluable 
participantsAll randomized participants with quantifiable PD-L1 expression.
10.3 Statistical Analyses
A description of the participant population will be included in  the statistical output reported, including 
subgroups of age, gender and race.
Per Protocol Amendment 03, the secondary and exploratory object ives are not applicable.
However, exploratory analyses of biomarkers on previously colle cted samples as per Section 9.8
may be conducted. Any analyses of secondary objectives will be des criptive.
10.3.1 Efficacy Analyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary
ORRORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a confirmed best overall response of 
CR or PR in the ITT population by RECIST 1.1 per BICR.
A pre-planned analysis of blinded independent central review (B ICR)-assessed ORR (using 
RECIST v 1.1; confirmed at least 4 weeks later) and duration of  response is intended for 
both arms to evaluate the clinical activity of bempegaldesleukin in combination with 
nivolumab relative to nivolumab. 
BICR-assessed ORR will be compared using a Cochran-Mantel Haens zel (CMH) two-sided 
test stratified by the three stratification factors (PD-L1 stat us, BRAF status, and AJCC M 
stage) at 0.001 level to control the overall study type I error . An associated odds ratio and 
95% and 99.9% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. The OR R difference between 
the two treatment arms with its 95% and 99.9% CI will be reported. The ORR and its 
corresponding 95% exact CI will also be calculated by Clopper-P earson method for each 
randomized arm.
Primary
Progression-Free 
SurvivalProgression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and 
the first date of documented tumor progression using RECIST 1.1  per BICR (see 
Section 9.1.1.3 ), or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.
A log-rank test stratified by PD-L1 tumor expression status, BR AF mutation status, and M 
stage will be used to compare PFS between the 2 treatment arms in the ITT Population at 0.03 level. A Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as t he single covariate, 
stratified by the above factors, will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and corresponding 97% CI. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to further summari ze PFS, including PFS 
curves, medians with corresponding 95% CIs. The PFS rates at 6 and 12 months will also

be estimated. In addition, to account for potential non- proportional hazard for PFS, 
sensitivity analyses will be conducted to compare PFS per BICR between treatment groups 
using weighted log-rank test. Technical details will be given i n the SAP.
Participants who do not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who do not have any on-study tumor assessments and do not die will be censored on their date of randomization. Partic ipants who started a new 
anticancer treatment regimen prior to disease progression will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to receiving the new antineoplastic regimen. Participants who are lost to follow up will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment.
Primary
Overall SurvivalOverall survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date o f randomization and the date 
of death due to any cause. Participants who do not have a date of death will be censored on 
the last date for which a participant was known to be alive. OS will be analyzed using the 
stratified log rank test, Cox proportional hazards model, and K aplan Meier method, similar 
to PFS. The OS rates at 12 and 24 months will also be estimated.  In addition, similar 
sensitivity analyses to account for potential non-proportional hazard for OS will also be 
conducted.
Secondary
Clinical Benefit Rate, Duration of Response, Time to ResponseThe clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of p articipants with CR, PR, or 
SD per RECIST 1.1 by BICR will be summarized similarly to ORR.
Duration of response (DOR) is defined for participants who have a confirmed CR or PR as 
the date from first documented CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 to the d ate of the documentation 
of disease progression by BICR or  death due to any cause, whiche ver is earlier. Participants 
who do not have disease progression or die will be censored on the date of their last 
evaluable tumor assessment. The median DOR will be estimated usi ng the Kaplan-Meier 
method with corresponding 95% CI and range.
Time to response (TTR) is defined for participants who had a co nfirmed CR or PR as the 
time from the date of randomization to date of first documented  CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 
as assessed by BICR. The median TTR will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method 
with corresponding 95% CI and range.ORR, PFS, CBR, DoR, TTR assessed by Investigato r per RECIST 1.1 will be analyzed 
similarly to these endpoints assessed by BICR.
PFS per BICR, ORR per BICR, and OS in biomarker population (by PD-L1 status) will be 
analyzed similarly as stated above.
Exploratory
PFS2PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to objectively doc umented progression
after the next line of therapy , per Inves tigator assessment, or  to death, whichever occurs 
first. Participants who were alive and without progression after the next line of therapy can 
be censored at last known alive date. Details on the PFS2 analy sis will be described in the 
SAP.

10.3.3.3 Missing Data
Statistical considerations and methodology for handling missing  data, including sensitivity analyses 
for PFS and ORR, will be detailed in the SAP.
10.3.4 Interim Analyses
Several interim analyses are planned for this stud y. Table 10.3.4-1 gives an overview of their 
purposes and timing. The fi nal ORR and PFS analyses, and the first OS interim analysis (combined 
with the second OS interim analysis) have been completed using the locked database with a 
database lock date of 01-Feb-2022. Given there was no additional clinical benefit in the doublet 
therapy arm compared to the monotherapy arm for the primary end points of PFS and ORR, the 
Sponsor, in consultation with the DMC, has decided to unblind the trial. No additional OS formal 
analyses will be performed. Any further efficacy analyses, if co nducted, will be descriptive.

•Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects/partic ipants, pri or to the beginning of 
the study, and after any revisions are completed for new inform ation.
If informed consent is  initially given by a participant’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of m aking and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant's consent. The Investigator, or a p erson designated by the Investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to continue participation in the stud y. This commun ication should be 
documented. The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects/par ticipants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the 
subjects’/participants’ signed ICF and, in the US, the subjects’ /participants’ signed HIPAA 
Authorization.The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records. For minors, according to local legislation, one or both parents  or a legally acceptable representative 
must be informed of the study procedures and must sign the info rmed consent form approved for 
the study prior to clinical study participation. The explicit w ish of a minor, who is capable of

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation parti cipant administered study treatment
and that does not necessarily hav e a causal relati onship with t his treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematol ogy, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological sc a n s ,  v i t a l  s i g n s  
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific j udgment of the Investigator. Note  that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing conditio n including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-d rug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a s uspected overdo se of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose as a verbatim term (as re ported by the Investigator), 
should not be re ported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported  regardless of sequelae and 
should specify “intentional overdose” as the verbatim term.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participa nt was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
Requires inpatient hosp italization or cause s prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not  considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
•routine health assess ment requiring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other  than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of ho using, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administr ation of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (a pplies 
to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may requi re intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug indu ced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.8 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) must f ollow the same transmission timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.6 for reporting pregnancies).

Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anap hylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betwee n study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be ruled out.
•The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration 
will be considered and investigated.
•The Investigator will als o consult the Investigat or’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the In vestigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. Howeve r, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every e vent before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in lig ht of follow-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality asse ssment.
•The causality assessment is one  of the criteria used when deter mining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow- up reports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same Investigator term(s) initi ally reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy treatment or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmit ting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
•SAEs, whether related or not r elated to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
•SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
−The required method for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.
−The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as a back-up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system is unavailable/not functioning for tr ansmission of the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee).
♦In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confir med facsimile (fax) 
transmission
♦When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site
•Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female wi th 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or m edical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physiological cause s. In addition, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) ar e likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the Inves tigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, ge ls)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the  woman can be considered
postmenopausal.
End of Relevant Systemic Exposure
•End of relevant systemic exposure is the time point where the I MP or any active major 
metabolites has decreased to a concentration that is no longer considered to be relevant for 
human teratogenicity or fetotoxici ty. This should be evaluated i n context of safety margins 
from the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or the time r equired for 5 half-lives of the 
IMP to pass.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/o r additional contraception methods.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a
•Combined (estrogen- and progestoge n-containing) hormonal contrac eption associated with 
inhibition of ovulation and/or implantati on (This method of contr aception can only be used 
by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception i s permitted by the study 
protocol)b 
−oral (birth control pills)
−intravaginal (vaginal birth control suppositories, rings, cream s, gels)
−transdermal 
•Combined (estrogen-and progest ogen-containing) hormonal contrac eption must begin at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy
•Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibit ion of ovulation (This
method of contraception can only be used by WOCBP participants in studies where 
hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol)b 
−oral 
−injectable 
•Progestogen-only hormonal contraception must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of 
study therapy
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
•Implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation and/or implantation (This method of contraception can onl y be used by WOCBP 
participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitt ed by the study protocol)b
•Intrauterine device (IUD)
•Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) (This method of contra ception can only be 
used by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitted by the 
study protocol)b,c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
Male participants will be require d to always use a latex or oth er synthetic condom during any sexual 
activity (eg, vaginal, anal, oral) with WOCBP; even if the parti cipants have undergone a successful 
vasectomy or if their partner is already pregnant or breastfeeding.
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•Continuous abstinence must begin at least 30 days prior to init iation of study therapy
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception wh en complete abstinence is 
elected.

•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue  to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete ab stinence 
•Periodic abstinence (including but not limited to calendar, sym ptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, an d lactational amenorrhoea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive metho ds for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is  permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contracept ion 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that coul d be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods o f contraception in the absence of definitive drug 
interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness
Less Than Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent
Failure rate of >1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
•Male or female condom with or wit hout spermicide.  Male and fem ale condoms cannot be 
used simultaneously
•Diaphragm with spermicide
•Cervical cap with spermicide
•Vaginal Sponge with spermicide
•Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action (This method of contraception cannot be used by WOCBP 
participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception
•Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post- ovulation me thods)
•Withdrawal(coitus interruptus).
•Spermicide only
•Lactation amenorrhea method (LAM)

APPENDIX 6 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR STUDIES UNDER CTCAE 
VERSION 5.0
These general guidelines constitu te guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. N on-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a prima ry therapy for immuno -oncology drug- related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for am bulatory patients with low-
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroi ds should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.Consultation with a medical or surgical specialis t, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covere d by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT ADVERSE EVENT
MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM FOR THE COMBINATION OF
BEMPEGALDESLEUKIN WITH CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS
Appendix 7 is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. The table below provides a 
management algorithm for possible signs/symptoms of CVA for pati ents treated with the 
combination of bempegaldesleukin with a checkpoint inhibitor. Thi s general guideline constitutes 
guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by clinical  judgment of the Investigator 
and/or discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor.
CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT
ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM
This guideline pertains to all participants receiving bempegald esleukin (NKTR-214) in 
combination with nivolumab
For unexplained neurological symptoms  (such as hemiparesis, con fusion, dysarthria, or visual
disturbances) that may be associated with CVA: 
•Recommend following the Advance d Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Adult Suspected 
Stroke Algorithm that includes time-sensitive assessment and rtPA use guidanceª. 
•Perform neurological imaging with DW I MRI soon as feasible afte r the initial
presentation of symptoms, preferably within 24 hours, or as ind icated following an 
acute intervention. DWI MRI is preferred, but if contraindicate d, alternative imaging
modalities may be used.
If imaging is consistent with a CVA, proceed to the following:
1 For any new CVA event confirmed by imaging (DWI MRI preferred un less
contraindicated), regardless of neurological symptoms (eg, cryptogenic CVA), and
for suspected TIA without clear alternativ e etiology:
oDiscontinue study treatment for patients r eceiving bempegaldesleukin in
combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (ie, nivolumabb).
2 Neurology consultati on recommended.
3 Perform pertinent laboratory asse ssments including coagulation (D-dimer, complete blood 
count with differential, serum  blood urea nitrogen, and creatin ine) and exploratory 
biomarkers, preferably by central  laboratory testing. Local labor atory testing is allowed 
when central laboratory testing is not possible.
4 Consider cardiac echocardiogram (trans-esophageal as appropriat e) to evaluate for
potential source of emboli.
Abbreviations: ACLS = Advanced Ca rdiac Life Support; CVA = cerebr ovascular accident; DWI = diffusion-weighted
imaging; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; rtPA = recombinant tiss ue plasminogen activator; TIA = transient
ischemic attack.

May 2021]. Available from: https://acls-algorithms.com/adult-st roke-algorithm/. 
Additional consideration to the above CVA management guidelines for adolescent study population: rtPA use is not 
approved in this age group for acute ischemic stroke indication . Follow age-appropriate institutional guidelines for 
antithrombotic therapies for emergency ischemic stroke management.
bFor other treatment combinations, refer to the relevant protoco l(s).

Clinical stage includes microstaging of the primary melanoma an d clinical/radiologic/biopsy 
evaluation for metastases. By convention, clinical staging shou ld be used after biopsy of the 
primary melanoma, with clinical assessment for regional and distant metastases. Note that 
pathological assessment of the primary melanoma is used for bot h clinical and p athological 
classification. Diagnostic biopsies  to evaluate possible region al and/or distant metastasis also are 
included. Note there is only one stage group for clinical Stage III melanoma.

APPENDIX 9 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) 
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evalu ated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1) guideline .1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lym ph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•10 mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) , or ൒2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pat hologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node 
must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thic kness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT/MRI scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will con tribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by rad iologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two  dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the ax ial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node whic h is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis o f 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example,  20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with shor t axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short  axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including small  lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as w ell as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non-Target Lesions.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non-Target’ Lesions
When more than one meas urable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measur ed at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites invol ved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respectively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum of 
two lung lesions can be selected (selected from one lung or one  lesion from eac h). A maximum of 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In addi tion, it is possible to record  multiple non-target lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple en larged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesion s, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of  one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missi ng or poor quality i mages), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions ( if any) has not increased 
sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodesLymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case r eport forms or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a s eparate section 
where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a sho rt axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be inc luded in the sum of target lesions.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the meas urement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defa ult value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely that this rul e will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pre sent and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm s hould be assigned in this circumstance as well). This

default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potent ially non-reprodu cible, therefore 
providi ng this default value will prevent false responses or pr ogressions based upon measurement 
error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to pro vide an actual meas ure, that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitative ly at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of exist ing non-target lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of o ne or more non-target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to  qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites will not be followed as target or non-tar get lesions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease wi ll therefore be extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, h owever, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inte rpretati on of an increase in non- measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easil y quantified (by definition:

NKTR-214 / BMS-986321 Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) and Nivoluma b
if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden bas ed on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the inc rease that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor bur den representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase dia meter in a measura ble lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from loca lized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘u nequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that poi nt. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial .
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specifi c criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequi vocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in im aging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new ’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly  important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosi s of a liver lesion may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusio ns, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or p rogression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is seen on a post-baseline imagi ng exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessm ent of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anato mical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progressio n. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient ’s brain metastases are consider ed to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identif ied on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans con firm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of t he initial scan. While FDG-PET 
response assessments need additi onal study, it is sometimes rea sonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of pro gression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET im aging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:1) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at foll ow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up

CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the d ate of the initial a bnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
disease progression or th e last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation and censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy. T he patient’s best overall res ponse 
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depen ding on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory  measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2-1 provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurab le (therefore non-target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2-2 is to be used.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since  SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this categor y when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response
Best response determinati on of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3-1 . When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the pro tocol specified 
minimum time from the d ate of first treatment or randomization d ate.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subje ct is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on -study of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on stu dy).  If the subject is not on-study 
for at least this am ount of t ime, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this  time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease t o ‘normal’ s ize (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR sh ould be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tum or measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive or subsequent repeat assessment s that should be performed no 
less than 28 days after the criteria for response are first met.  Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provide confirmation of a previously identified CR even with  an intervening NE or PR (eg, 
CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a PR may provi de confirmation of a
previously identified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (eg,  PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation.
Verification of Progression : Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progr ession 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subje ct is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

CYTOKINE-RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) MANAGEMENT 
MEASURES/ALGORITHM
Appendix 11 is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 03. A management algorithm for 
cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) for participants treated with b empegaldesleukin is provided 
below. This general guideline constitutes guidance to the Inves tigator and may be supplemented 
by discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponso r.
As a general principle, differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to standard 
medical practice. Non-inflammatory etiologies should be conside red and appropriately treated.
For patients with suspected CRS:
•For Grade 1 or Grade 2 events, implement supportive care, including management of isolated 
symptoms based on institutional practices
•Consider admitting the patient for monitoring and to provide su pportive care, including management 
of isolated symptoms based on institutional practices and protocol management guideline (eg, hydration management guidelines in Section 7.1.1.1 ).
•For patients with a persistent or worsening clinical condition after initial treatment of CRS, 
re-evaluate for other contributing conditions. It is particularly important to reassess the patient for 
coexisting infections, cardiac, pulmonary, thromboembolic, and other complications.
Grading Assessment 
per CTCAE Version 5.0 Treatment Measures Recommended
CRS 
Grade 3•Hypotension 
managed with 
1 pressor
•Hypoxia requiring 
> 40% O 2•Vasopressin administration should be considered if the hypotensive event is refractory to > 3 L of fluid resuscitation.
•Oxygen therapy (nasal canula, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, etc.) for respiratory symptoms with consideration of intubation for a patient with severe respiratory 
manifestations.
•Supportive care for renal, hepatic, and other organ function 
deteriorations.
•Steroid therapy should be considered (eg, hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours, dexa methasone 10 mg up to 4 times 
daily, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisone IV or PO equivalent).
•High-dose steroid (eg, solumedrol 2 mg/kg up to 1 gram daily for 3 days) may be considered for severe CRS that failed to respond after repetitive steroid treatments.
•For severe CRS cases that require simultaneously aggressive management of hypotension, oxygenation, and cardiac telemetry, consult Intensivist for ICU evaluation.CRS Grade 4•Life-threatening consequences
•Pressor or ventilatory support indicated

APPENDIX 12 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for Protocol Amendment 02, 26-Aug-2021
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to update the sample size justification for progression-
free survival (PFS) comparison, add sensitivity analyses to account for poten tial non-proportional 
hazard for PFS and overall survival (OS) in the efficacy analys es, update analysis time projection 
based on updated enrollment project ion, and add provisional lan guages to trigger OS final analysis 
at 60 months of minimum follow-up if the total planned number o f OS events are not reached by 
then. Other updates have been made to align with changes to safety assessments including the 
implementation of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 5 (CTCAE v5), a revised cerebrovascular accident (CVA) algorithm, and the addition of 
a cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) algorithm. Guidance for sever e acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) status and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine has also 
been included. Details have been  provided to add clarity and co nsistency about aging of tumor 
biopsy between the inclusion criteria and tumor tissue specimen  sections. Modifications to the 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab program standards have been add ressed and protocol 
inconsistencies corrected. Revisions apply to future participants enrolled in the study, a nd where applicable, to all 
participants currently enrolled.
Administrative Letter 03 and Administrative Letter 04 were incorporated into Amendment 02.

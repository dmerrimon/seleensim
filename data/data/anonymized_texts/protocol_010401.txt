Study Title
MEDI4736-MM-005 (FUSION MM-005):  A Multicenter, Single-arm, Phase 2 Study to 
Determine the Efficacy of the Combination of Daratumumab (DARA) Plus Durvalumab
(DURVA) (D2) in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) who 
have Progressed on DARA While on a DARA-containing Regimen as the Most Recent MM 
Therapy.
Indication
Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) after treatment with at least 3 prior anti-
myeloma therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug 
(IMiD®) or after development of double-refractoriness to a both a PI and an IMiD.
!The most recent multiple myeloma (MM) treatment regimen should contain 
daratumumab (DARA) and subjects must have progr essed on DARA while on this 
regimen.
!Induction, bone marrow transplant with or without maintenance therapy is 
considered one regimen
!Refractory is defined as disease that is nonresponsive on therapy, or progresses 
within 60 days of last therapy. Nonresponsive disease is defined as either failure to achieve minimal response or development of progressive disease while on therapy.
!For subjects who received more than 1 regimen containing a PI their disease must be 
refractory to the most recent PI containing regimen.
!For subjects who received more than 1 regimen containing a IMiD their disease must 
be refractory to the most recent IMiD containing regimen
Objectives
Primary: 
!To determine the efficacy of DARA plus durvalumab (DURVA) in subjects with 
RRMM who have progressed on DARA while on a DARA-containing regimen as themost recent MM treatment.
Secondary:
!Determine the safety of DARA plus DURVA in subjects with RRMM who have 
progressed on DARA while on a DARA-containing regimen as the most recent MM treatment.
!Further evaluate the efficacy of the combination of DARA plus DURVA in subjects 
with RRMM who have progressed on DARA while on a DARA-containing regimenas the most recent MM treatment. Key eff icacy measures include  time-to-response
[TTR], duration of response [DOR], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall 
survival [OS].

Study Design
This is a single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
combination regimen of DARA plus DURVA (D
2) in subjects with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma after failure of prior therapies containing a PI, immunomodulatory drug and 
DARA. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Pa rt 1 and Part 2. Part 1 has a 2-stage design 
while Part 2 consists of an expansion phase. Subjects will receive intravenous (IV) DARA at 16 
mg/kg on the same dosing schedule (weekly [Q W], every 2 weeks [Q2W], or every 4 weeks 
[Q4W] of each 28-day treatment cycle) receive d during their last prior therapy containing DARA
at the time of DARA progression.  Dosi ng schedules, for the administration of DARA, may be 
adjusted during the course of the study, as detailed in Section 7.2, provided that the subject has a 
response of stable disease (SD) or better. Subjects will also receive IV DURVA at 1500 mg on Day 2 (Cycle 1) and on Day 1 (Cycles ≥ 2) of each 28-day treatment cycle. 
Part 1:
Stage 1
A cohort of 18 subjects will be enrolled to deter mine the safety and preliminary efficacy of
DARA plus DURVA. Once 6 subjects have been enro lled in MEDI4736-MM-005 and 
completed the first treatment cycle in Stage 1 of this study, the enrollment continuity would depend on the availability of additional safety data from the ongoing Phase 2 study 
(MEDI4736-MM-003) of DARA and DURVA in previously DARA-naïve subjects.
!If MEDI4736-MM-003 safety data are available and the tolerability profile of DARA 
plus DURVA is determined to be adequate, th en enrollment will continue as planned 
in Stage 1 of MEDI4736-MM-005.
!If safety data are not available in MED I4736-MM-003, enrollment in MEDI4736-
MM-005 will be paused for a review of the safety profile of DARA plus DURVA by

Confidential and Propri etary 8 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 2016a Dose Review Team (DRT), using the data from the first 6 patients. See Section
3.1.1.1.1.
Once the 18 subjects have been enrolled in ME DI4736-MM-005 (end of St age 1), an interim 
analysis for futility purpose will be conducted to determine if the study can proceed to Stage 2.
Stage 2
If 3 or more subjects achieved a response (partial response [PR] or better) out of the 18 
subjects at the end of Stage 1, an additional 32 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of DARA plus DURVA.
Part 2: 
Expansion
Upon completion of Part 1, if there are at least 9 subjects who achieved a response (PR or 
better) out of a total of 50 subjects and it is determined by the Sponsor to further confirm the efficacy and safety of DARA plus DURVA, an additional 70 subjects may be enrolled.
An Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC) will be set up for this trial to 
perform an independent assessment of the efficacy data. The IRAC will determine tumor response to therapy and to confirm the time of disease progression (PD) (if disease progressed) at 
scheduled or unscheduled visits for each subject. 
The safety and efficacy of the study will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) who are not involved in the trial conduct. The DMC will meet up and review 
study data at pre-specified intervals throughout the tr ial.  At time of the interim analysis, the 
DMC will assess the study data for fut ility. In addition to the DMC review, safety d ata will be 
monitored by the Celgene Medical Monitor and Safety Physician on an ongoing basis throughout 
the study. Should a significant safety issue be identified, the DMC will be convened to make a 
recommendation as to the future conduct of the study.
The study will be conducted globally and in compliance with the International Council on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).
Study Population
The study population w ill include subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 
3 prior lines of anti-myeloma regimens including a PI and an IMiD, or who are double-refractory 
to a PI and an IMiD. In additi on, eligible subjects must have had progressive disease while on a 
DARA-containing regimen as the most recent MM therapy.
Approximately 120 subjects will be enro lled into this study.

The study will consist of the following consecutive phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-
up. The Screening Phase may not exceed a 28-day window prior to start of study treatment 
(Cycle 1 Day 1). Subjects may continue on study  treatment until PD or unacceptable toxicity. All 
subjects will have an End of Treatment (EOT) visit within 7 days after discontinuation of all 
study treatment. Subjects are to return to the study site 28 (+3) days after the EOT visit and 90 
(+3) days after the last dose of DURVA or DARA, whichever is later, for safety follow-up visits.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as pre-specified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.
Study Treatments
All subjects will receive: 
!IV DARA at 16 mg/kg starting at the same dosing schedule as their immediate prior 
DARA regimen. (QW, Q2W, or Q4W of each 28-day cycle). The dosing schedule
may be adjusted during the course of the study as outlined in Section 7.2.

Statistical Methods
The study will be conducted in 2 parts. 
In Part 1, a 2-stage design is used with 1 interim analysis for futility at the end of Stage 1. 
In Stage 1, 18 subjects will be enrolled and if at least 3 subjects out of 18 achieve a response (PR 
or better) by end of Cycle 3, the study will continue to Stage 2. If there are 2 or less subjects 
who achieved a response out of 18 subjects in Stage 1, the study will be terminated for fut ility 
and will not proceed to Stage 2. 
In Stage 2, an additional 32 subjects will be en rolled.
If it is determined at the end of Part 1 to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
combination regimen of DARA plus DURVA, then up to an additional 70 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. In total, approximately 120 subjects will be included in this study. 
The primary statistical analysis  will be based on the full analysis set patient population, 
following the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle. For binary endpoints, the observed rate and 2-sided 
exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provi ded. For time-to-event type of endpoints, 
Kaplan-Meier method will be us ed. The Kaplan-Meier, as well as the median and its 95% CIs 
will be provided. Safety analysis will be based on all subjects who received at least 1 dose ofDARA plus DURVA.

1.1. Disease Background 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare and incura ble progressive neoplastic disease that accounts for 
10% of all hematological malignancies. It has been  estimated that 63,700 incident cases and 
79,410 deaths from MM occurred globally in 2013 ( GBD, 2015 ). 
Significant progress has been made in the treatment of MM with various combinations of 
melphalan, prednisone, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cisplatin, 
immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide), and proteasome 
inhibitors (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomab) or with autologous stem cell transplant following high-dose chemotherapy and more recently monoclonal antibodies (eg, daratumumab, 
elotuzumab) ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]-MM Guidelines, 2016 ). The 
main considerations for choosing an appropriate treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) are: risk level, prior therapy, dur ation of response to prior therapy, residual 
toxicity, age, physical condition, and whether the patient is a candidate for stem cell 
transplantation ( NCCN-MM Guidelines, 2016 ). 
Despite the progress in treatment options for MM, the disease follows a relapsing course in the 
majority of patients, regardless of treatment regimen or initial response to treatment. Multiple 
myeloma remains incurable using conventional treatments, with an overall 5-year relative survival rate of 48.5% ( Howlader, 2016 ). New therapies are needed to treat RRMM patients.
1.2. Compound Background 
1.2.1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab (MEDI4736; DURVA) is a human  immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) directed against human  programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein. 
Durvalumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 with high affinity and 
blocks its ability to bind to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein and cluster of differentiation 
(CD)80. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of DURVA contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component 
C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) ( Oganesyan, 2008 ).

1.2.2. Daratumumab
Daratumumab (DARA) is a human IgG1 kmonoclonal antibody that binds w ith high affinity to a 
unique epitope on CD38. It is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, in a variety of hematological malignancies including 
multiple myeloma. Daratumumab was approved under the accelerated approval regulations in the 
United States (US) on 16 November 2015, and in the European Union (EU) on 24 May 2016, for 
the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of 
therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are 
double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.
Daratumumab induces tumor cell death through diverse mechanisms of action, which include 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and induction of apoptosis ( de Weers, 2011; 
Lammerts van Bueren, 2014; Overdijk, 2015; Jansen 2012 ).

Krejcik, 2015
Daratumamab was shown as a single agent, in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, to have an overall response rate of 31% and a median overall survival of 20.1 months ( Usmani, 2016 ). In addition, daratumamab in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) as well as Revlimid® and dexamethasone (Rd) have been 
shown to be effective.  The DARA plus Vd (DVd) combination was tested in the CASTOR trial, where 498 patients were randomized between Vd and DVd ( Palumbo, 2016 ). A prespecified 
interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher 
in the DVd group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of PFS was 60.7% in the DVdgroup versus 26.9% in Vd group. After a median follo w-up period of 7.4 months, the median 
PFS was not reached in the DVd group and was 7.2 months in the Vd group (hazard ratio for 
progression or death with daratumumab versus control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28 
to 0.53; p<0.001). The rate of overall response (ORR) was higher in the DVd group than in the 
Vd group (82.9% versus. 63.2%, p<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response
(VGPR) or better (59.2% versus. 29.1%, p <0.001) and complete response (CR) or better (19.2% 
versus. 9.0%, p = 0.001).  In the POLLUX trial ( Dimopoulos, 2016 ), the DARA plus Rd (DRd) 
regimen was tested against Rd in a population of 569 patients with at least one prior therapy and 
maintaining sensitivity to Revlimid®. After a median follow-up of 13.5 months, DRd 
significantly improved patients’ median PFS, with the median PFS in the DRd group being not 
reached, compared with 18.4 months in the Rd arm (p<0.0001), translating to a 63% reduced risk 
of disease progression or death compared with Rd (hazard ratio = 0.3 7; 95% CI 0.27-0.52;

86 % for DRd and 76 % for Rd. Daratumumab led to a higher ORR, more than doubling the rate 
of CRs or better: ORR: 93% versus. 76% (p<0.0001), ≥ VGPR: 76% versus. 44% (p<0.0001)
and ≥ CR: 43% versus. 19% (p<0.0001).  The median duration of response was longer in the 
DRd group (not reached versus. 17.4 months) and the median time to response was shorter (1 
month versus. 1.3 months),

1.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recognized during the past decade (Hanahan, 2000 ). Failure of immune surveillance of pre-
neoplastic lesions and micro-metas tases is a key step in cancer development. Chronically 
immunosuppressed individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-com petent individuals are likely to be 
minimally immunogenic, allowing for passive escape from immune surveillance. Recent data 
suggest that this may be an oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, but actively suppress the local immune environment through production of immunosuppressive 
cytokines ( Shields, 2010 ). As such, the local tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic 
environment where most tumors grow and metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate antitumor immunity. The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple 
targets that may be manipulated to maximize the body’s inherent immune response to a tumor. 
Immune response may be augmented by directly  stimulating effector cells, indirectly stimulating 
effectors by augmenting antigen presentation activity or costimulation, or by suppressing 
immunosuppressive factors, cells, or messages ( Monti, 2005 ).
DARA acts through multiple immune effector-medi ated mechanisms, including CDC, ADCC, 
and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.  In addition to direct targeting of CD38+ 
myeloma cells, recently published data suggests an immune stimulating/modulatory role of 
DARA. Increases in CD8+, CD4+ T cell ratios, antiviral responses, and T cell clon ality were all 
observed after DARA treatment in a heavily pr etreated, relapsed, and refractory patient 
population not expect ed to have strong immune responses ( Krejcik, 2015 ). Improved clinical
responses were associated with changes in these parameters. In addition, DARA was shown to deplete regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express high levels of CD38. Reduction of these immune 
suppressive Tregs may promote expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells which could have 
additional anti-tumor effects.  These data sugge st an immune modulatory role of DARA that may 
contribute to its efficacy. ( Krejcik, 2015 ).
The mechanism of resistance to DARA remains to be fully explained, but immune escape by 
upregulation of PD-L1 signaling through PD-1 is hypothesized to contribute to resistance. 
Adding durvalumab, while continuing daratumumab is hypothesized to potentially reverse this 
mechanism of resistance.

Protocol MEDI4736-MM-005 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 22 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 2016Durvalumab (MEDI4736; DURVA) is a human IgG1 kappa mAb directed against human PD-L1
protein. Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 wi th high affinity and blocks its ability to 
bind to PD-1 protein and cluster of differentiation (CD) 80. PD-1 is highly expressed on MM 
patient’s T cells and natural killer (NK) cells; and both plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and MM cells express PD-L1. Dysfunctional T cells, NK cells, and functionally defective pDCs 
contribute to the immune suppression in MM ( Chauhan, 2009; Ray, 2015 ). It has been shown 
that pDCs produce T cell and NK cell immune suppression in the MM bone marrow (BM) milieu by engaging immune checkpoints via the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling axis ( Ray, 2015 ). Blockade of 
PD-L1/PD-1 using anti-PD-L1 antibody gener ates MM-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
activity, as well as enhances NK-cell-mediated MM cell cytolytic activity. 
As PD-L1-expressing pDCs are increased in MM bone marrow and localize with PD-L1-positive 
MM cells ( Chauhan, 2009 ), PD-L1 expression may c orrelate with progression of disease, with 
highest levels in relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM. Indeed, a recent study showed that PD-L1 expression positively correlates with increased proliferative potential of tumor cells and 
resistance to therapies in MM ( Tamura, 2013 ). Combination treatment of anti-PD-L1 mAb, like
DURVA, with other anti-MM therapies that modulate MM-host immune responses, like DARA 
will potentially enhance both host anti-MM immunity and clinical response and warrant further 
exploration in the relapsed/ refractory population being considered in this study.
The future of successful MM treatment lies in both the development of novel agents targeting the 
MM cells or the bone marrow microenvironment, and the development of rationally based 
combination therapies. As DARA use post approval, either alone, or in combination, increases, it 
is expected that patients who fail DARA-containing regimens will require new therapeutic options.
Targeted immunotherapy based on monoclonal antibodies against relevant tumor antigens has 
not only shown to be feasible, but also an effective approach in treating hematological malignancies. However, treatment options for heavily  treated patients are limited, especially for 
those with disease that is double refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD®)
(Laubach, 2016 ). To date, targeting MM cells by a combination-therapy approach has 
demonstrated superior clinical response as compared with that of single agents ( Cavo, 2011 ). In 
theory, combination treatment of anti-PD-L1 mAb,  like DURVA, with other anti-MM therapies 
that modul ate MM-host immune responses, like DAR A, may enhance both host anti-MM 
immunity and clinical response and warrant further exploration in a relapsed/refractory 
population being cons idered in this study.  The impor tance of the PD-L1:PD-1 interaction has 
been recently further substantiated.  In a recen t study, PD-L1–expressing myeloma cells treated 
with PD-1 molecules were shown to have induction of drug resistance through activation of the
Akt signaling pathway ( Ishibashi, 2016 ). These results suggest that in the bone marrow
microenvironment, the interaction between PD-L1 on myeloma cells and PD-1 on tumor-specific 
CTLs not only inhibits CTL activity via the PD-1 signaling pathway but also induces drug 
resistance via PD-L1mediated reverse signals.
Current treatments may mitigate, but are unable to completely circumvent, the inherent genomic 
instability and clonal heterogeneity that leads to r ecurrent relapses and ultimately refractory MM.  
In addition, in the era of novel agents, where MM patients are surviving longer, physicians are 
encountering more resistant and atypical relapses . Salvaging such patients becomes particularly

Confidential and Propri etary 23 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 2016challenging and their prognosis often remains dismal ( Phipps, 2015 ).  There remains an unmet 
need for novel therapies that target different mechanisms of action. 
The principle of overcoming resistance to an agent through continuation of that agent alone or in 
conjunction with the addition of a second agent or combination has been explored more extensively in the area of solid tumors.  In lung cancer, discontinuation of epidermal growth 
factor receptor inhibitors (erlotinib and ge fitinib) for radiographic progression resulted in 
increased rapidity of radiographic progression and onset of symptomatic progression that could be controlled by reinstitution of the same agents ( Riely, 2007 ) with reduction in maximum 
standardized uptake value measurements. In melanoma,  withdrawal of  treatment after isolated 
progression of MAPK inhibitors in preparation for a new clinical trial sometimes led to rapid growth of remaining disease which had been controlled prior to that time point ( Carlino, 2013 ).  
Multiple retrospective and prospective reports have described the clinical benefit potentially 
accruing from continuing particular agents in terms of PFS or overall survival (OS) in breast and colorectal cancers.  Specific examples include continuation of bevacizumab or cetuximab wh ile 
switching to differing chemotherapy regimens in colon cancer ( Masi, 2015; Ciardiello, 2016 ), 
and continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression in breast cancer ( von Minckwitz, 2011; 
Jackish, 2014 ).  
Overcoming resistance and restoring a functional immune- surveillance system requires 
leveraging multiple, complementary mechanisms of action and agents that act in multiple phases of the cancer-immunity cycle. As such, combination immunotherapies that involve various 
phases of the cancer–immunity cycle may enhance the ability to prevent immune escape by 
targeting multiple mechanisms by which tumor cells avoid elimination by the immune system and with synergistic effects that may offer improved efficacy in broader patient populations 
(Morrissey, 2016 ). As CD38 expression is tied to response in patients with prior DARA 
treatment, and loss of CD38 correlates with development of resistance ( Nijhof, 2016 ), it may be
the case that controlling disease after progression with DARA treatment may also require 
continuation of DARA to continue control of sensitive disease clones, with the addition of 
DURVA providing additional therapeutic benefit for control of remaining clones no longer expressing CD38.  
1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design
The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 and Part 2. 
Part 1 has a selected 2-stage design, where a limited number of subjects will be enrolled in Stage 
1 to ensure a sufficient efficacy signal is seen prior to enrolling additional subjects in Stage 2.
While durvalumab has been dosed to over 1,910 patients and is currently being evaluated in over 
30 Phase 3 clinical trials and daratumumab has received marketing approval, the combination of
these two agents has not yet been extensively studied. An ongoing Phase 2 clinical study,
MEDI4736-MM-003, is evaluating this two drug combination and is expected to provideevidence of safety and tolerability prior to the init iation of this study. However, if these safety
data to clearly support the expected Phase 2 dose and schedule are not available prior to initiation
of this study, a safety run-in phase will be conducted prior to further enrollment of this study.
Once 6 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first treatment cycle in Stage 1 of this 
study, the enrollment continuity would depend on the availability of safety data from the ongoing

patients. Details are provided in Section 3.1. 
If data are available and the safety profile of DARA plus DURVA has been evaluated as 
tolerable, enrollment in Part 1 Stage 1 will not be paused.
Part 2 will consist of an expansion phase and will be initiated once Part 1 has been completed 
and if a sufficient efficacy signal has been determined by the Sponsor at the end of Part 1, Stage 
2. 
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection1.3.3.1. Durval umab
Nonclinical safety of DURVA was assessed in  the pivotal Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 13-
week intravenous (IV) repeat-dose toxicity study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. 
Animals received an IV loading dose of 30, 60 or 200 mg/kg of DURVA on Day 1, followed by 13 weekly IV doses of 15, 30 or 100 mg/kg, resp ectively. Animals were euthanized 3 days after 
the final dose, or after an 8-week treatment-free period. In the majority of animals exposure to 
DURVA and pharmacodynamics (as assessed by serum levels of free soluble PD-L1) were maintained throughout the dosing period. The IV administration of DURVA was not associated 
with any treatment- related effects on any of the endpoints studied (including clinical signs, 
bodyweight s, ophthalmology, safety pharmacology endpoints (electrocardiograms [ECGs], 
respiratory rate, blood pressure and neurologi cal examinations), peripheral blood leukocyte 
counts, clinical pathology parameters or gross and microscopic histopathology). The no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for DURVA in this study was therefore considered to be the 200/100 mg/kg dose (area under the curve [AUC] = 34,900 μg·d/mL, maximum plasma 
concentration [C
max] of drug = 7,470 μg/mL), the highest dose tested. 
Based on the data from the GLP 3-month toxicit y study in cynomolgus monkeys and the 
resultant safety margins, the Sponsor believes that the safety of these doses is supported by the 
existing nonclinical safety data.
As per the latest IB (Version 9), with data cut off dates of 15 April 2015 to 18 September 2015, 
1,910 subjects have been treated across 30 ongoing DURVA studies, including 20 sponsored 
(6 monotherapy and 14 combination therapy) and 10 collaborative studies. Of the 1,910 
subjects, 1,279 received DURVA monotherapy, 468 received DURVA in combination with other agents, and 163 have been treated with blinded investigational product. No studies have been 
completed or terminated prematurely due to toxicity.
The maximally administered dose of DURVA to humans in clinical trials conducted to date has 
been 20 mg/kg, which is equivalent to the 1500 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) starting dose proposed 
in study MEDI4736-MM-003.  Doses of DURVA up to  20 mg/kg as monotherapy did not define 
a non tolerated dose.
1.3.3.2. Daratumumab
The DARA dose/schedule will be as per the current approved label in the US ( Darzalex PI ) and

There are no completed studies of anti-CD38 combined with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. These 
molecular targets do not have known mechanistic synergies, although variation in the co-
expression of CD38/PD-1 has been studied as a marker of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, as a possible sign immune activation ( Vollbrecht, 2010 ).  Related cases of 
pneumonia or interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported with DARA (11%) ( Darzalex
PI), targeting CD38, and durvalumab (2%) (DURVA IB), targeting PD-L1. However, infections, 
and specifically pneumonias and ILDs, are well known clinical conditions in MM patients. With 
the exception of infusion-related reactions, the addition of DARA to standard MM treatment 
regimens did not seem to add toxicity to the safety profiles previously reported with these backbone regimens ( Darzalex PI ).  No other known synergistic toxicities are expected with 
DURVA and DARA.

3.1. Study Design
This is a single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
combination regimen of daratumumab plus durvalumab (D2). The study will consist of 2 parts; 
Part 1 has a 2-stage design while Part 2 consists of an expansion phase. Subjects will receive 
intravenous (IV) DARA at 16 mg/kg on the same dosing schedule (weekly [QW], every 2 weeks 
[Q2W]or every 4 weeks [Q4W] of each 28-day cycle) received on their last prior therapy containing DARA. The dosing schedule for DARA may be adjusted during the course of the 
study as outlined in Section 7.2.2.1 . Subjects will also receive IV DURVA at 1500 mg on Day 2 
(Cycle 1) and on Day 1 (Cycles ≥ 2) of each 28-day treatment cycle. The dosing schedule is 
outlined in Table 3 .
3.1.1. Part 1: Selected 2-Stage 
3.1.1.1. Stage 1
A cohort of 18 subjects will be enrolled to determine the preliminary efficacy of DARA plus 
DURVA. Once the 18 subjects have been enrolled, an interim analysis for futility purpose will be conducted to determine if the study can proceed to Stage 2.
3.1.1.1.1. Early Safety Monitoring
Once 6 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first treatment cycle in Stage 1 of this 
study, the enrollment continuity would depend on the availability of safety data from the on-
going Phase 2 study (MEDI4736-MM-003) of DARA and DURVA in previously DARA-naïve 
patients.
!If MEDI4736-MM-003 safety data are available and the tolerability profile of DARA
plus DURVA has been determined to be adequate, then enrollment will continue as 
planned in Stage 1 without an early safety monitoring review of the data.
!If safety data are not available enrollment in this study will be paused for a review of 
the safety profile of DARA plus DURVA by a Dose Review Team (DRT), using the 
data from the first 6 patients.
∃If ≥ 1 of the first 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as outlined 
in Section 3.1.1.1.1.1 , the study will be halted for review and a change in the 
dosing regimen may be implemented.
∃The DRT will consist of the Celgene Medical Monitor, Celgene lead Safety 
Physician, Celgene biostatistician, other Celgene functional area representatives, as appropriate, and site investigator and/ or designees who have enrolled subjects 
to the study.
∃All available safety and, if applicable, PK/(  and 
preliminary efficacy data will be reviewed and can be considered in the DRT’s 
decisions.

continuity of the study. 
3.1.1.1.1.1. Dose-limiting Toxicity
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) may be evalu ated during the DLT evaluation period for the 
initial 6 patients in Part 1 of the study. The DLT evaluation period will be defined as the first 
treatment cycle. Subjects are considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if they:
!Receive at least 1 dose of study tr eatments and experience a DLT 
OR
!Receive 1 dose of DURVA, 4 doses of DARA and complete the safety follow-up 
through the end of the DLT evaluation peri od. 
Grading of DLTs will be according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03.
A DLT will be defined as below:
Hematologic DLT
a. Grade 4 neutropenia observed for greater than 5 days duration
b. Grade 3 neutropenia associated with fever ( ≥ 38.5 °C) of any duration.
c. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, or any 
requirement for platelets transfusion.
d. Any other Grade 4 hematologic toxicity that does not resolve to subject’s 
pretreatment baseline level within 72 hours
e. Grade 4 anemia, unexplained by underlying disease.
Non-hematologic DLT
a. Any nonhematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except for alopecia and nausea controlled 
by medical management
b. Any treatment interruption greater than 2 weeks due to an AE.
While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation are specified above, an 
AE not listed above may be defined as a DLT after consultation with the Sponsor and 
investigators, based on the emerging safety profile.
3.1.1.2. Stage 2
If 3 or more subjects achieved a response (PR or better) out of the 18 subjects at the end of Stage 
1, an additional 32 subjects will be enrolled to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of DARA plus 
DURVA. 
3.1.1.3. Part 2: Expansion
Upon completion of Part 1, if at least 9 subjects achieve a response (PR or better) out of a total of 
50 subjects and it is determined to further confirm the efficacy and safety of DARA plus 
DURVA, an additional 70 s ubjects may be enrolled.

study data. The IRAC will determine tumor response to therapy and to confirm the time of 
disease progression (PD) (if disease progressed) at scheduled or unscheduled visits for each 
subject. 
The safety and efficacy of the study will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) who are not involved in the trial conduct. The DMC will meet up and review 
study data at pre specified inte rvals throughout the trial. 
In the event that the trial is halted for early safety monitoring, as outlined in Section 3.1.1.1.1 , 
evaluation of the emerging safety data from the initial 6 patients enrolled in Part 1 will be 
performed by the Dose Review Team (DRT).  
Safety data will be monitored by the Celgen e Medical Monitor and Safety Physician on an 
ongoing basis throughout the study. S hould a significant safety issue be identified, the DMC will 
be convened to make a recommendation as to the future conduct of the st udy.
The decision to discontinue a subject, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor, 
remains the responsibility of the treating physic ian. However, prior to discontinuing a subject, 
the Investigator may contact the Medical M onitor and forward appropriate supporting documents 
for review and discussion.
The study will be conducted in compliance wi th the International Council on Harmonisation

serum pregnancy test for screening was performed within 72 hours of the first dose of study treatment.
b. Either practice true abstinence2from heterosexual contact (which must be 
reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able 
to comply with, effective contraception without interruption (eg, oral, injectable, 
or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier 
contraceptive with spermicide; true abs tinence; or vasectomized partner), 28 days 
prior to starting study treatment, during the study therapy (including dose 
interruptions), and for at least 90 days afte r discontinuation of study treatment. 
c. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 90

even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
b. Refrain from sperm donation for at least 90 days after the final dose of DURVA 
or DARA, whichever is later.
                                               
1A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not 
undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea 
following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had 
menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
2True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

aOn Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), safety laboratory assessments must be performed locally (central confirmation is not required) to confir m subject continues to meet the required 
safety laboratory values prior to initiating study treatment.  However, if screening assessments were performed within 72 hours  of C1D1, safety laboratory and physical 
examinations need not be repeated at C1D1.
bPer IMWG Uniform Response Criteria all response categories and progressive disease require 2 consecutive assessments.
cPre infusion medications to be given before all daratumumab infusions (if necessary, oral pre infusion medications may be adminis tered at the subject’s home on the day of the 
infusion, provided they are given within 3 hours prior to the infusion); post infusion medications to be given on the first and second days following all daratumumab infusions. 
dEvery effort should be made to keep subjects on the planned dosing schedule (QW, Q2W, or Q4W) as detailed in Section 7.2.2 . However, doses given within 3 days of the 
scheduled dose are permitted, as long as the interval between doses is at least 5 days. Blood pressure is to be measured at the  following time points on C1D1 and C1D8: 
immediately before the start of the infusi on; at approximately 30 minutes, 1 hour, 90 minu tes, 2 hours, and 3 hours 30 minutes af ter the start of the infusion; at the end of the 
infusion; and 30 minutes and 1 hour (+/- 5 minutes) after the end of the infusion. For all other DARA infusions, blood pressure wi ll be measured immediately before the infusion 
start and at the end of the infusion.
eFirst DURVA infusion:  blood pressure and pulse will be monitored, as follows (based on a 60-minute infusion): Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from 
approximately 30 minutes before up to 0 minutes [ie, the beginning of the infusion]); approximately 30 minutes during the infusio n (halfway through infusion); at the end of the 
infusion ( approximately 60 minutes ±5 minutes). If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then blood pressure and pulse meas urements should follow the principles as 
described above or be taken more frequently if clinically indicated.  For DURVA infusions on C2D1 onward, a +24 hour window is allowed and may be implemented per

6.1. Screening Period
The Screening Phase begins when the ICF is signed. Screening evaluations will be performed for all sub jects to determine study eligibility. These evalu ations must be completed within 28 days 
of first dosing unless noted otherwise below. 
Waivers to the protocol will not be granted during the conduct of this trial, under any 
circumstances.
Except for pregnancy tests, ECGs and urinalysis, all sa fety-related laboratory assessments will be 
performed centrally; however, tests that may result in dose interruption and/or modification may
also be performed locally to allow for treatment- related decisions during subject visits. All

6.4.2. Bone Marrow Aspiration and/or Biopsy
A bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and biopsy (BMB) is mandatory at the following time points:
!At screening, BMA and BMB for percent plasma cells, cytogenetics,  
!During treatment:
∃∃BMA and BMB at the time of complete response (CR) confirmation for percent 
plasma cells 
∃  
The analysis of bone marrow for percentage of plasma cells will be performed locally and at a 
central laboratory.  
6.4.3. Bone Lesion Assessment
Bone lesion assessment by x-ray (skeletal survey) or CT Scan will be performed at screening and 
when clinically indicated to confirm response or PD. The same method (x-ray or CT Scan) 
should be used throughout the study. All films will be analyzed locally by the site investigator/radiologist. If a bone lesion assessmen t by x-ray or CT Scan was performed within 
60 days prior to the start of Cycle 1, it ma y be used for the screening assessment.  
If assessment is done by x-ray, the following are the minimum plain radiological films required

6.4.4. Extramedullary Plasmacytoma Assessments 
Clinical assessment for extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) assessments will be performed at 
screening, on Day 1 of every cycle, and at the EOT Visit. 
For EMPs that are only assessable radiographically  (by x-ray and/ or conventional [spiral] 
CT/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan), scans are required at screening, at Cycle 3 Day 1, 
every 3 cycles thereafter (Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 9 Day 1, etc.) during treatment, at the EOT Visit, 
and when clinically indicated to confirm a response ( ≥ PR) or PD. The radiographic modality 
used at screening (eg, x-ray) will be repeated at each assessment time point throughout the study. 
All scans will be reviewed locally only. Celgene may request redacted copies of reports.
6.4.5. Assessment of Response
6.4.5.1. Investigator Assessment
Starting from Cycle 2, response will be assessed  by the investigators using the International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria ( Rajkumar, 2011 )(Appendix B )
at every cycle on Day 1 and at the EOT Visit. Response must be based on the central laboratory 
data to ensure consistency across investigative sites. All treatment discontinuation decisions due to disease progression will be made by treating physicians based on response as assessed using 
results from central laboratories by the IMWG criteria, except for new or increase in bone lesions 
or soft tissue plasmacytomas.
6.4.5.2. Independent Response Adjudication Committee Assessment
An IRAC will be formed by a group of experts in the MM disease area to review efficacy data. 
For each subject, the IRAC will determine tumor response at scheduled or unscheduled visits, and the time of PD (if disease progressed). In addition, the IRAC will determine the best overall 
response of each subject up to time of the data cut off for interim and final analyses. 
The IRAC will adjudicate efficacy  data incrementally according to IRAC Charter during the 
study.  The IRAC adjudicated response data will be used for efficacy analysis in all interim and 
final analyses.  Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted in tumor response data, including 
progressive disease (PD) that are assessed by the IRAC according to the IMWG Uniform 
Response Criteria ( Appendix B ).
NOTE: Per IMWG Uniform Response Criteria all response categories and progressive disease 
require 2 consecutive assessments except for radiographic or bone marrow assessments
6.5. Pharmacokinetics
Serum samples will be collected to assay concentrations of DURVA and DARA. On PK 
sampling days, dosing and sample co llection i nformation including dosing d ate, dosing time (24 
hour clock), and actual PK blood sampling time (24 hour clock) should be accurately 
documented on the appropriate eCRF pages.

Blood type, Rh, and IAT should be done before the first dose of DARA for the reasons detailed 
below. Subject RBC phenotyping (standard or extended) is an alternative option to the IAT test, 
if locally required. Either method must be completed prior to first DARA i nfusion.
DARA interferes with the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), which is a routine pre-transfusion test 
performed to identify a patient’s antibodies to minor antigens so that suitable donor blood can be 
given for transfusion. DARA does not interfere with ABO/RhD typing. CD38 is expressed at 
very low levels on erythrocytes. DARA binds to the CD38 on erythrocytes, which results in a

minor antigens and may prevent or delay blood banks from issuing donor blood for 
transfusion. This effect occurs during DARA t reatment and for up to 6 months after treatment 
ends. Subjects will receive a patien t identification w allet card for the study that includes the 
blood profile (ABO, Rh, and IAT or phenotyping) determined before the first infusion of DARA
along with information on the IAT interference for healthcare providers/blood banks. Subjects 
are to carry this card throughout the treatment period and for at least 6 months after treatment ends. Blood banks can eliminate the DARA interfe rence with IAT by tr eating reagent RBCs 
with dithiothreitol (DTT) ( Chapuy, 2015 ).
Possible methods for blood banks to provide safe RBCs for transfusion to subjects receiving 
DARA include:
a. Providing ABO/RhD compatible, phenotypically  (standard or extended phenotyping) 
or genotypically matched units
b. Providing ABO/RhD compatible, K-negative units after ruling out or identifying 
alloantibodies using dithiothreital-treated reagent RBCs
Uncrossmatched, ABO/RhD compatible RBC units should be administered if transfusion is 
needed emergently as per local blood bank practice.
Despite DARA binding to CD38 on erythrocytes, no indication of clinically significant 
hemolysis has been observed in DARA studies. For additional details, refer to the DARA IB.

On days when DARA and DURVA are dosed on the same day, the DARA infusion should be 
administered first, followed by the DURVA infusion. Simultaneous infusion of DARA and 
DURVA is prohibited. 
!Since the compat ibility of DARA or DURVA with other IV medications and solutions, 
other than normal saline, is not known, the DARA or DURVA solution should not be 
infused through an IV line in which other solutions or medications are being 
administered.
!If DARA and DURVA will be infused through the same port, the port must be flushed 
with saline prior to attaching dedicated DARA IV line.

Confidential and Propri etary 58 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 20167.2.1.1.2.2. Subsequent DURVA infusions
For the subsequent DUR VA infusions, vital signs  will be measured prior to the start of the 
infusion. Subjects should be  carefully monitored and blood pressure and other vital signs should 
be measured during and post infusion as per inst itution standard and as clinically indicated. Any 
clinically significant changes in vital signs should be entered onto an unscheduled vital signs 
electronic case report form (eCRF) page. 
In the event of a ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, th e infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and reinitiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion. For patients with a ≤ Grade 2 
infusion-rel ated reaction, subsequent infusions may be  administered at 50% of the initial rate. 
Acetaminophen/paracetamol and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent 
medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator. If the infusion-related reaction is ≥ Grade 3 or higher in se verity, study drug will be 
discontinued.
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to 
admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary.
7.2.1.2. Daratumumab (Darzalex)
Subjects should be carefully observed during DARA infusions. Refer to the full prescribing 
information for DARA ( Darzalex PI ).
Pre-infusion and post infusion medications for i nfusion reaction prophylaxis will be given as 
detailed in Table 6 for all sub jects.
7.2.1.2.1. Infusion-related Reactions of Grade 1 or Grade 2
If the investigator assesses an adverse event to be related to the infusion, then the infusion should 
be paused. When the subject’s condition is stable, the infusion may be restarted at the investigator’s discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of that employed before 
the interruption. Subsequently, the infusion rate may be increased at the investigator’s discretion.
If the subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher event of laryngeal edema, or a Grade 2 or higher 
event of bronchospasm that does not respond to systemic therapy and does not resolve within 
6 hours from onset, then the subject must be withdrawn from daratumumab treatment. 
7.2.1.2.2. Infusion-related Reactions of Grade 3 or Higher
For infusion-related adverse events that are Grade 4, the infusion should be stopped and the 
subject withdrawn from DARA treatment. 
For infusion-related adverse events that are Grade 3, the infusion must be stopped and the subject 
must be observed carefully until resolution of the adverse event or until the intensity of the event 
decreases to Grade 1, at which point the infusion may be restarted at the investigator’s discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of that employed before the interruption.

administration of DARA and DURVA is prohibited).
7.2.3. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to DURVA and DARA dosing only. On a per dose 
basis, an overdose is defined as the follo wing amount over the protocol-specified dose of 
DURVA and DARA assigned to a given subject, regardless of any associated AEs or sequelae.
!For IV, 10% over the protocol-specified dose
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as any am ount more frequent than the 
protocol-required schedule or frequency. On an infus ion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any 
rate faster than the protocol-specified rate. Complete data about drug administration, including 
any overdose, regardless of whether the overdose was accidental or intentional, should be 
reported in the eCRF. See Section 10.1 for the reporting of AEs associated with overdose.
7.2.4. Dose Modifications and Interruptions
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 or higher as a 
guide for the grading of severity.  
If the treatment has been interrupted and the next cycle is delayed beyond Day 28 of the prior 
cycle, then Day 1 of the next cycle will be de fined as the first day that study treatment is 
resumed.

Confidential and Propri etary 65 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 20169. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1. Overview
This is a single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
combination regimen of DARA plus DURVA in subjects with RRMM who have progressed 
while on last MM treatment (DARA-containing regimen)
This section defines the subject populations for the statistical data analyses, the justifications of 
sample size, and the methodologies that will be used for the efficacy and safety analyses. All 
statist ical analyses sp ecified in the protocol will be conducted using SAS Version 9.2 or higher 
unless otherwise specified. 
9.2. Study Population Definitions
For the purpose of statistical analyses and data presentation, the study populations are defined as follows:
9.2.1. Full Analysis Set Population
The full analysis set population (FAS) will include all enrolled subjects. The primary efficacy 
analyses will be performed on the FAS population. 
9.2.2. Efficacy Evaluable Population
The supportive efficacy analyses will be perform ed on the efficacy evaluable (EE) population, 
which will include all enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of D
2and who have 
measureable disease at baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement. 
9.2.3. Safety Population
The safety population will include all subjects who take at least one dose of D2. All safety 
analyses will be based on this population.  
9.2.4. Pharmacokinetic Population
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment and 
who have at least one measureable plasma con centration. For subjects who are determined to be 
noncompliant with respect to ad ministration of IP, or for subjects with incomplete data, a 
decision as to their inclusion in the population w ill be made on a case-by-case basis prior to the 
analysis. 
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The study consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, a two-stage design with one interim analysis for futility 
at the end of Stage 1 is used. PASS software, Version 13.03 has been used to calculate the 
sample sizes. Setting the Type I error rate at 0.05, a total sample size of 50 subjects provides a power of at least 80% to reject the null hypothesis of ORR less than 10% with a target response 
rate of 25%. In Stage 1, 18 subjects will be enrolled and if there are at least 3 subjects out of 18 
who achieved a response (PR or above) by end of cycle 3, the study will continue to Stage 2. If 
there are 2 or less subjects who achieved a response out of 18 subjects in Stage 1, the study will

will be enro lled. If there are at least 9 subjects who achieved a response out of a total of 50 
subjects from Stages 1 and Stage 2, the null hypothesis will be rejected. If it is determined at the 
end of Part 1 to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen of DARA plus DURVA, then up to an additional 70 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. This will bring the 
total number of subjects treated during the study up to approximately 120. The additional 
subjects will add to the certainty about the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy.  Table 9 shows the exact 95% CIs around the response rates observed based on different 
scenarios. For example, if the observed ORR is 25%, the lower limit of the 95% CI w ill be 
17.5%. If the observed ORR is 30%, the lower limit of the 95% CI w ill be 22.0%.

The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the tumor response, including PD, as assessed by 
an IRAC using the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria. 
The overall response rate (ORR) will be calculated as the number of responders (PR or better), 
divided by the number of subjects in the FAS population. The ORR together with the proportions 
in each category based on the IMWG criteria ( ie, stringent complete response [sCR], complete 
response [CR], very g ood partial response [VGPR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], 
and disease progression [PD] will be tabulated, together with the 2-sided exact 95% CI. 
This efficacy analysis will be conducted after the 18 subjects from Stage 1 have completed at 
least 3 cycles of treatment, Stage 2 of the Part 1 study and at the end of Part 2 of the study if the decision has been made to expand the study. 
9.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Time-to-res ponse (for responders only, per IMWG Uniform Response Criteria) is calculated as 
the time from treatment initiation of study tr eatment to the first date of documented response (PR 
or better). Time to response will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Duration of response (for responders only, per IMWG criteria) is defined as t ime from the 
earliest date of documented response (PR or bette r) to the first documentation of PD or death, 
whichever is earlier. Duration of response will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
method. Median duration of response along with the two-sided CI will be provided. 
Progression-free survival is defined as t ime from tr eatment initiation to the first date of 
documented PD or death from any cause during th e study, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects 
who do not have a PFS event will be censored on the last adequate assessment date. PFS will be summarized using the KM method. 
Overall survival is defined as time from treatment in itiation to death due to any cause. Subjects 
who are alive or lost to follow-up will be censored on the last-known-alive date. The OS will be analyzed using the KM method. Median OS and the corresponding 95% CI will be provided. 
9.7. Safety Analysis
All subjects in the sa fety population w ho receive at least 1 dose of DARA plus DURVA, will be 
included in the safety analyses. Adverse events, vital sign measurements, physical exam findings, clinical laboratory data, ECG interpretations, pregnancy tests for FCBP, concomitant 
medications and procedures will be tabulated and summarized. 
Adverse events will be coded using the Me dical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Adverse event listings will include the verbatim term and the MedDRA preferred 
tem. Adverse events will be graded according to the CTCAE Version 4.03 criteria.

subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once. Adverse events leading 
to discontinuation from treatment, leading to dose reduction/interruption/delay, classified as 
CTCAE Grade 3 or higher, DARA, DURVA-related events, and serious AEs will be tabulated and listed separately. By-subject listings of all AEs, serious AEs, and their attributes will be 
provided. 
Primary cause of death recorded on the eCRF death form will be coded according to MedDRA 
and summarized by SOC and PT. By-subject listing of death will also be provided. 
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized descript ively and will include a display of change 
from baseline. Laboratory values outside of the normal ranges will be identified. Laboratory data will be graded according to CTCAE Version 4.03 criteria for select analytes unless otherwise 
specified. The frequencies of the worst severity grade observed during treatment will be 
displayed in cross-tabulations by screening status. 
9.8. Interim Analysis
This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 consists of one pre-planned 
interim analysis for futility purposes at the completion of Stage 1.
9.9. Other Topics
9.9.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Noncompartmental PK parameters such as time to maximum concentration (T max), maximum 
observed concentration (C max), area under the curve (AUC), terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), 
clearance (CL/F), and volume of distribution (V z/F) will be estimated from the plasma 
concentration-time profile. All concentration data and PK parameters will be summarized 
descriptively.

9.10.1. Data Monitoring Committee 
An external and independent DMC with multidis ciplinary representation will be established to 
monitor the safety data regularly.
The DMC will review the safety and the efficacy data at the end of Stage 1. If the study is to 
proceed to Stage 2, the DMC will also review the safety and efficacy data at the end of Stage 2. 
The DMC chairman may convene formal DMC meetings if there are any unusual safety/efficacy 
concerns. The Sponsor can also request a DMC review of the safety data if unexpected safety 
concerns arise during the conduct of the trial. The DMC responsibilities, authorities, and 
procedures will be detailed in the DMC charter.  
9.10.2. Independent Review Adjudication Committee
An IRAC will be set up for this trial to  assess the response data for each subject using the 
IMWG Uniform Response Criteria. The IRAC will determine the tumor response to therapy and 
to confirm the time of disease progression (PD) (if disease progressed) at scheduled or 
unscheduled visits for each subject.

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomi tant impairment of the subject’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specifi ed by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a 
preexisting conditio n) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded 
on the AE page of the case report form (eCRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an IP should be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose eCRF (see Section 7.2.3 for the definition of overdose). Any sequela of an accidental or 
intentional overdose of an IP should be reported as an AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an 
overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of the event on the 
SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for DURVA, or DARA, 
overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the 
judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of 
any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, 
radiological or surgical findings, physical examin ation findings, or findings from other tests 
and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 90 days after the last dose of DURVA or DARA, whichever is later, as well as those SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to study 
IPs (DARA, DURVA). Adverse events and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF 
and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs mu st be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all AEs as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);

Protocol MEDI4736-MM-005 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 71 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 2016!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalization or 
prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
!routine treatment or monitoring of the stud ied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication. However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!a procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow  sampling). However, hospitalization or 
prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.
!hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the CRF. Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!an elective treatment of or an elective pro cedure for a pre-existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. 
!emergency outpatient treatment or observa tion that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.

Protocol MEDI4736-MM-005 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 72 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 201610.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must a ssess the severity/ intensity of the event. 
The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor version of the Common Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
Version 4.03 or higher); 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
Adverse events that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity/intensity 
according to the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activ ity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible
!Grade 4 = Life-threatening– extreme limi tation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death.
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IPs (DARA, 
DURVA) and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: A causal relationship of the AE to IPs (DARA, DURVA)
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IPs 
(DARA, DURVA) caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event.

Protocol MEDI4736-MM-005 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 73 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 2016Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information. Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IPs (DARA, DURVA) as a result of an AE or 
SAE, as applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of IPs, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or addition al treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study; or
!requires treatment, modification/ interrup tion of IPs (DARA, DURVA) dose, or any 
other therapeutic intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as an SAE.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be r ecorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thrombocyt openia rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject of childbearing 
potential or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events .

Protocol MEDI4736-MM-005 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 74 MEDI4736-MM- 005 Final: 03 Oct 201610.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-subunit human chorionic 
gonadotropin [ β-hCG]) or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential 
regardless of disease state) occurring while the sub ject is on study tr eatment, or within 90 days 
after last dose of DURVA / DARA, whichever occurs later are considered immediately reportable 
events. Investigational product is to be discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to 
return any unused portion the Investigator . The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by email, phone or 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. 
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In a ddition, any infant death after 28 days  that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IPs (DARA, DURVA) should also be reported to Celgene 
Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IPs (DARA, DURVA) becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking IPs (DARA, DURVA) should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms are accurate and consistent. 
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IPs [DARA, DURVA]) that occur during the study (from the time the subject signs informed consent until 90 days after the 
last dose of DURVA or DARA, whichever is later) or any SAEs made known to the Investigator 
at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IPs (DARA, DURVA). Seriousadverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.

of hospital records and other relevant documents . If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available. Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.
10.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is exp ected to be no more than five (5) business 
days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone.
10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to DUR VA and DARA based on their respective IBs.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics 
Committees concerned, SUSARs in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed 
Guidance on collection, verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on IPs for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific 
requirements. 
Events of disease progression for the disease under study (including deaths due to disease 
progression for indications that are considered to be fatal) will be assessed as expected AEs and 
will not be reported as expedited safe ty reports to regulatory authorities.
Celgene or its authorized representative sh all notify the Investigator of the following 
information: 
!Any AE suspected of being related to the us e of IPs (DARA, DURVA) in this study 
or in other studies that is both serious and unexpected (ie, suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR]);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copies of all pe rtinent safety information on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC (See Section 14.3 for record retention 
information).

Form Completion Guidelines or to the Pr egnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines.
10.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of DURVA(MEDI4736) and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of  these events in order to characterize and 
understand them in association with the use of durvalumab.
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These 
AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical  studies with durvalumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy. An immune-related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an AE that is 
associated with drug exposure and is consis tent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action 
and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Se rologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) 
data, as appropriate, should be used to support an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE.
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the Investigator should 
promptly contact the Medical Monitor.
Further information on these AESIs (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the DURVA IB (Section 5.5.2 Summary of Risks).

Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study w ill receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with 
applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator respons ibilities ar e set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in 
the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study .  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve quer ies and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by Celgene on public registry websites) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by Celgene on a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its institution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment a nd IB information is not to be made publicly

The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consen t occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date.  The original ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person 
consenting the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the study, must be maintained 
in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to  the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised version of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consenting the study s ubject must be maintained in the Investigator’s 
study files and a copy given to the study subject.
13.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protecti on against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.
13.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their 
dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with

All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs.
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigat or and his/her staff as  well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory authorities (eg, FDA, EM A, Health Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If the Inves tigator is contacted by any regulatory authority 
regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene immediately.

Normal serum free light chain (FLC) ratio and
Absence of clonal plasma cells by immunohistochemistry or 2- to 4-color 
flow cytometry
Complete Response 
(CR)Negative immunofixation of serum and urine and
Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and
≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow
In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: 
CR in such patients indicates a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in 
addition to CR criteria listed above. 
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on 
electrophoresis or
90% or greater reduction in serum M-pro tein plus urine M-protein level 
<100 mg per 24 hours
In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels:

If the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a ≥ 50% decrease in 
the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria.
If serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, and the serum free light 
chain assay is also unmeasurable, a ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells is 
required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma 
cell percentage was ≥ 30%

Criteria (Continued)
Response CategoryaResponse Criteria
Progressive disease (PD) Requires only one of the following:
Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any of the
following:
!Serum M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL), 
and/or
!Urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h), 
and/or
Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be ≥ 10 mg/dL)
Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M protein levels and 
without measurable disease by FLC levels, bone marrow plasma cell 
percentage (absolute percentage must be ≥ 10%)
Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or 
definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL) 
that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder
Additional Response Criteria
Molecular Complete 
ResponseCR plus negative allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain 
reaction (ASO-PCR), sensitivity 10-5
Immunophenotypic Complete Response Stringent CR plus
Absence of phenotypically aberrant plasma cells (clonal) in bone marrow 
(BM) with a minimum of 1 million total BM cells analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry (with > 4 colors)
Minimal Response (MR)
in patients with relapsed 
refractory myeloma 
adopted from the European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria≥ 25% but ≤ 49% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour 
urine M-protein by 50%-89%
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, 25%-49% 
reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of 
compression fracture does not exclude response)
aAll response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, and PD) require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before 
the institution of any new therapy; CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, and SD categories also require no known evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. VGPR and CR categories require serum and urine studies regardless of whether disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed. For PD, serum M-component increases of more than or equal to 1 g/dL are sufficient to define relapse if the starting M-component is ≥ 5 g/dL.

Note: The toxicity management guidelines in Appendix E-1, E- 2, and E-3 prepared by the Sponsor are to assist the 
investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities and should be applied to 
management of adverse events related to study treatment and not ANY adverse event.
Appendix E-1: Durvalumab Treatment Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune-related Adverse 
Events
Immune-Mediated Reactions
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Immune-related 
Adverse Events 
(Overall Management For toxicities not 
noted below)Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will 
be made to manage potential immune-related AEs based on severity 
of treatment-emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study 
drug/regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below),
permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen for the following 
conditions: 
!Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks after last 
dose of study drug/regimen
!Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment-
related AE following resumption of dosing.It is recommended that management of irAEs follow the 
guidelines presented in this table
-Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant medications, infections, etc.)
-In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events 
should be considered potentially immune related.
-Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered 
for low-grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events 
-For persistent (greater than 3 to 5 days) low-grade 
(Grade 2)  or severe (Grade ≥3) events promptly start 
prednisone PO 1-2mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent 
-If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid 
tapering 28 days of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [eg, up to 2-4mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (> 28 days of taper)
-More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF 
inhibitors (eg, infliximab) – (also refer to the individual sections of the immune related adverse event for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to systemic Grade 1 No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 
resolution to ≤ Grade 1
• If toxicity worsens then treat as Grade 3 or 
Grade 4
Study drug/study treatment can be resumed at the 
next scheduled dose once event stabilizes to Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require 
prolonged or continued steroid replacement

-Discontinuation of study drug is not mandated for 
Grade 3 / Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumour response (eg, inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes etc.). Continuation of study drug in this situation should be based upon a benefit/risk analysis for that patient 
Grade 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, may 
permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen. Please refer to guidelines below
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen 
Note:  For Grade 3 and above asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels hold study drug/regimen and if complete work up shows no evidence 
of pancreatitis, may continue or resume study drug/regimen
Pneumonitis/ILDGrade of 
Pneumonitis 
(CTCAE version 
4.03) General Guidance -Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis or ILD (new onset or worsening shortness 
of breath or cough).  Patients should be evaluated with 
imaging and pulmonary function tests including other diagnostic procedures as described below
-Initial work-up may include clinical evaluation, 
monitoring of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting 
and exertion), laboratory work-up and high-resolution 
CT scan. 
Grade 1 
(Asymptomatic, 
clinical or diagnostic observations only, 
intervention not 
indicated)No dose modification required. However, 
consider holding study drug/study regimen 
dosing as clinically appropriate and during 
diagnostic work-up for other etiologiesFor Grade 1 (Radiographic Changes Only)
-Monitor and closely follow up in 2-4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion) and laboratory work-up and then as clinically indicated
-Consider pulmonary and infectious disease consult

Diarrhea/ 
EnterocolitisGrade of Diarrhea 
(CTCAE version 4.03)General Guidance -Monitor for symptoms that may be related to 
diarrhea/enterocolitis (abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in bowel habits such as increased frequency 
over baseline or blood in stool) or related to bowel 
perforation (such as sepsis, peritoneal signs and ileus)
-Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, other medications, infections including testing for clostridium difficile toxin, etc.)
-Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear 
alternative etiology, even for low grade events, in order to prevent potential progression to higher grade event
-Use analgesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of 
perforation and peritonitis
Grade 1 diarrhea  
(stool frequency of 
<4 over baseline per day) No dose modification For Grade 1 diarrhea : 
-Close monitoring for worsening symptoms
-Consider symptomatic treatment including hydration, 
electrolyte replacement, dietary changes (eg, American Dietetic Association colitis diet), and loperamide. Use of probiotics as per treating physician’s clinical judgment.
Grade 2 diarrhea 
(stool frequency of Hold study drug/study regimen until resolution

behavior change, or weakness)
-Consider appropriate diagnostic tes ting (eg, electro myogram and 
nerve conduction investigations)
-Symptomatic treatment with neurological consult as appropriate
Grade 1 No dose modifications See “Any Grade” recommendations above.
Grade 2 !For acute motor 
neuropathies or 
neurotoxicity, hold study drug/study regimen dose until resolution to ≤ 
Grade 1
!For sensory 
neuropathy/neuropathic pain, consider holding study drug/study regimen dose until resolution to ≤ 
Grade 1.

Immune-
mediated 
peripheral neuromotor syndromes, such as Guillain-Barre and Myasthenia 
GravisGeneral Guidance -The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes is important, since certain patients may unpredictably 
experience acute decompensations which can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms which may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability
-Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, 
disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and medications, etc.). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological consult
-Neurophysiologic diagnostic testi ng (eg, electromyogram and nerve 
conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon suspicion of such conditions and may be best facilitated by means of a neurology consultation 
Important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary 
treatment of Guillain-Barre is not typically considered effective. Patients requiring treatment should be started with IVIG and followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IVIG

!MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
oSteroids may be successfully used to treat Myasthenia 
Gravis. Important to consid er that steroid therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient worsening of myasthenia and should typically be administered in a monitored setting under supervision of a consulting neurologist.
oPatients unable to tolerate s teroids may be candidates for 
treatment with plasmapheresis or IVIG. Such decisions are best made in consultation with a neurologist, taking intoaccount the unique needs of each patient.
oIf Myasthenia Gravis-like neurotoxicity present, consider 
starting acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitor therapy in 
addition to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also 
serve to reinforce the diagnosis.
!GUILLAIN-BARRE: 
oImportant to consider here that the use of steroids as the 
primary treatment of Guillain-Ba rre is not typically 
considered effective. Patients requiring treatment should be started with IVIG and followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IVIG.

Present amendment ( Version 8) to the protocol 04 November  2020  
This is a global amendment to protocol Version 7 and is regarded as a substantial amendment  
based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European 
Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FO R THE AMENDMENT   
The primary reason s for thi s amendment to Protocol BIVV009 -04 (Cadenza) , Version 8 are: 
• To include post -infusion vital  signs assessment  for patients who will receive undiluted 
infusion s, 
• To clarify that the hematology panel  and Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT)  are performed 
at the site local laboratory  and not at the central laboratory , 
• To change for Part A the statistical method for the primary efficacy endpoint (responder 
status) in using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test instead of the Fisher’s Exact 
test, 
• To remove reference to the study procedural manual and  replace it with the specific 
manuals .

Amendment Summary of 
Changes Table  Document formatting revision s. The change was made to reflect the update 
of the amended protocol version 8 and 
include  a previous  protocol version .  
Section 1 Synopsis: 
Safety Outcome 
Measures  “Post -infusion vital signs and” were added to the 
list of endpoints for the patients receiving 
undiluted infusions.  The change s were  made in relation to the 
inclusion of post -infusion vital signs  
assessment for the subset of patients 
receiving undiluted infusions  of the IMP . 
Section 1 Synopsis: 
Statistical Methods  Regarding the primary endpoint (responder 
status) analysis for Part A, t he Fisher’s Exact test 
was replaced by “Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  
(CMH)  test”. The primary efficacy analysis method was 
changed and will use the Cochran –Mantel –
Haenszel (CMH) test instead of the 
Fisher’s exact test  to apply a statistically 
more powerful method with regard to the 
small sample size setting, and to ensure 
consistency in primary analysis and 
sensitivity analyses for the primary 
endpoin ts. 
Section 4.3.5 Safety 
Endpoints  “Post infusion vital signs and” were added to the 
list of endpoints for the patients receiving 
undiluted infusions . The changes were made in relation to the 
inclusion of post -infusion vital signs  
assessment for the subse t of patients 
receiving undiluted infusions of the IMP . 
Section 6.1 Schedule of 
Study Procedures: Table 
3, footnote “l”  The following text was added:  
“or for post-infusion vital signs  in case of undiluted 
administration , after each undiluted infusion” .  The changes were made in relation to the 
inclusion of post -infusion vital signs for 
patients receiving undiluted infusions of the 
IMP for a subset of patients.  
Section 6.1.1.1 Screening 
assessments (initiating at 
Day -42) The following text in the Bone Marrow Biopsy was 
removed:  
“in the study procedural manual” and replaced by: 
“in Appendix A (Bone Marrow Biopsy Report 
Review Process) to the ‘Subject Eligibility Review 
Process Overview’”.  As study procedural manual was not 
created, reference s to this document 
across the protocol were either removed or 
replaced by references to the applicable 
study manuals.  
Section 6.1.1.3 
Confirmatory review of 
patient eligibility  The following text was removed: “forms and the 
adjudication process may be found in the study 
procedural manual” and replaced by “process may 
be found in the ‘Subject Eligibility Process 
Overview’”.  As study procedural manual was not 
created, references to this document 
across the protocol were either removed or 
replaced by refer ences to the applicable 
study manuals.  
Section 6.1.5.6 Infusion 
of the Undiluted Study 
Drug  This following text was added: “Post -infusion vital 
signs will be collected for these patients”.  The changes were made in relation to the 
inclusion of post -infusi on vital signs 
assessment for the subset of  patients 
receiving undiluted infusions of the IMP . 
Section 6.2.2 Patient 
number and identification  The following text was removed: “Details on 
patient number assignments will be available in 
the study procedural  manual.”  As study procedural manual was not 
created, references to this document 
across the protocol were either removed or 
replaced by references to the applicable

Section 6.2.3 
Randomization  The following text was modified:  
Details on the randomization process are will be 
available in the study procedural manual eCRF 
Completion Guidelines.  As study procedural manual was not 
created, references to this document 
across the protocol were either removed or 
replaced by references to the appl icable 
study manuals.  
Section 6.2.5 Blinding  The following text was removed:  
“Further details on blinding procedures will be 
provided in the study procedural manual”.   As study procedural manual was not 
created, references to this document 
across the pr otocol were either removed or 
replaced by references to the applicable 
study manuals.  
Section 6.3.7 Clinical 
Laboratory Evaluations  The following text was removed:  
“For efficacy evaluations results from the central 
laboratory (when collected and availab le) will be 
recorded in the eCRF and utilized for analyses.”  As the hematology panel tests are 
performed at the site local laboratory, the 
reference to the central laboratory was 
removed from this section.  
Section 7.1 Description of 
Objectives and Endpoi nts  The following text was modified:  
“For endpoints involving laboratory parameters, 
except for hematology panel, results from the 
central laboratory will be used. Local laboratory 
values were utilized for Direct Antiglobulin Test 
(DAT) for , among others , eligibility purposes and 
hematology panel that allow s both determination 
of eligibility and the medical management of the 
patient, with assessment of the hemoglobin 
criteria necessitating blood transfusions.”  As the hematology panel tests  and Direct 
Antiglobulin Test (DAT) are performed at 
the site local laboratory, this section was 
modified to  be consistent with what is done 
in the stu dy.  
Section 7.3.2 Methods of 
analysis   The following text was removed: “Fisher’s Exact 
test” and replace d with:  “Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test”.  The primary efficacy analysis method was 
changed from Fisher’s exact test to a 
stratified Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel test, 
to apply a statistically more powerful 
method in the small sample size setting, 
and to ensure re sult consistency between 
primary analysis and sensitivity analyses 
for the primary endpoints.  
Investigator Agreement  Document formatting revisions.  The change was made to reflect the update 
of the amended protocol version 8.  
Appendix A  Clinical 
Laborato ry Evaluations  The following text was added to Appendix A:  
“Detailed information on the allocation of samples 
for central or local laboratory processing is 
available in the Laboratory Manual.”  As the hematology panel tests  are 
performed at the site local l aboratory, this 
section was modified to be consistent with 
what is done in the study.  
Appendix B CI -CTC

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  1 SYNOPSIS   
Title of Study:  Cadenza Study: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Assess the 
Efficacy and Safety of BIVV009 in Patients with Primary Cold Agglutinin Disease Without a 
Recent History of Blood Transfusion  
Overview of Study 
Design:  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study in patients with primary 
cold agglutinin disease (CAgD) without a recent history of blood transfusion.  Eligible patients will 
receive study drug ( BIVV009  or placebo) and undergo saf ety and efficacy assessments for 
6 months (26 weeks) during Part A.  
Following completion of the initial 6 -month treatment period (Part A), patients will roll into the 
open -label long -term safety and durability of response extension phase (Part  B) during w hich they 
will receive BIVV009 .  
For the purpose of marketing authorization application , an interim analysis of safety and efficacy 
data will be performed after all patients have completed the double -blind treatment period 
(Part  A).  The Part B open -label extension study will run for 1  year following last patient out (LPO) 
under Part A.  
Objectives:  Part A  
Primary Objective:  
• The primary objective of Part A is to determine whether BIVV009  administration results 
in a ≥1.5  g/dL increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) level and avoidance of transfusion in 
patients with primary CAgD without a recent history of blood transfusion  
Secondary Objectives : 
Efficacy:  
• To assess the effect of BIVV009  on clinical events and laboratory parameters related to 
hemolysis and anemia in patients with primary CAgD   
• To assess the effect of BIVV009  on specific complications of CAgD (acrocyanosis, 
Raynaud’s syndrome, hemoglobinuria, and thromboembolism)

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  Methodology/Study 
Design:  This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy , 
safety , and tolerability  of BIVV009  in symptomatic patients with the complement -mediated 
disorder primary CAgD who do not have a recent history of blood transfusion.  
During the 6 -week Screening/ Observation Period, prospective patients will have a detailed 
medical history documented (including all available transfusion history), physical evaluations, and 
blood samples collected for characterization of CAgD biomarkers, including Hgb levels on 
3 occasions approximately every 2  weeks.  
Patients under screening for Cadenza who require a transfusion(s) during the Screening/  
Observation Period prior to the first study drug infusion (if medically indicated per the 
Investigator’s discretion  and wit hin the parameters of the protocol specified transfusion criteria, 
see Table  1) will remain eligible .  If a patient receives a transfusion(s) during the 
Screening/Observation Period prior to the first study drug infusion, the baseline visit (and first 
infusion of study drug) must occur at least 7  days following the transfusion.  
Part A  
The study will enroll approximately 40 primary CAgD patients who do not have a recent history of 
blood transfusion (ie , ≤1 transfusion during the last year and no transfusion during the last 
6 months prior to enrollment).  Eligible patients should have been diagnosed with primary CAgD 
at least 6 months prior to enrollment and should have had no history of transfusion during this 
period.  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of BIVV009  or 
placebo over approximately 60  minutes on Day  0, Day  7, and every 14  days thereafter through 
Week  25 (ie, Days 21, 35, 49, 63, 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147, 161, an d 175).  Patients who miss a 
dose (ie, outside the dosing window  or >17 days since last dose ) should return to the site for an 
unscheduled visit to receive another loading dose prior to their next scheduled visit.  Patients will 
have an End -of-Treatment (EO T) visit in Part  A on Day 182 (Week  26). 
Patients who meet the transfusion criteria in Table 1 during the 6 -month double -blind treatment 
period will receive a transfusion.   Patients who re ceive a transfusion during Part  A will not be 
withdrawn from the stu dy and will be eligible to participate in Part  B. 
Table  1: Transfusion criteria  
A patient will receive a transfusion during Part A  or Part B if his or her Hgb level meets either 
of the following criteria:  
• Hgb is <9  g/dL and the patient is symptomatic, or 
• Hgb is <7  g/dL and the patient is asymptomatic  
A responder analysis will be conducted following completion of  the EOT visit at Week  26. The 
responder definition is provided in Table  2.  
Table  2: Responder definition  
A patient will be considered a responder in Part A if:  
• Hgb increases ≥1.5  g/dL from baseline (defined as the last Hgb value before 
administration of the first dose of study drug) at treatment assessment endpoint 
(defined as mean value from Weeks 23, 25, and 26) and  
• The patient did not r eceive a blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26 (EOT), 
and 
• The patient did not receive treatment for CA gD beyond w hat is permitted per protocol 
from Week 5 through Week 26 (EOT)

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  A list of excluded concomitant medications, as well as allowed concomi tant medications with 
restrictions, is provided in the protocol.  Beyond the permitted concomitant medications, study 
drug, and transfusions, patients may receive no other therapies for the treatment of CAgD while 
enrolled in Part A of this study; patients  requiring other treatment for their CAgD in Part A will be 
withdrawn from the study and counted as non -responders.  These patients will not be eligible to 
participate in Part  B. 
Part B  
Following completion of dosing in the initial 6 -month treatment period , patients will roll into the 
long-term safety and durability of response extension phase and receive BIVV009 in an open -
label manner.  Part B will run for 1  year following LPO under Part  A.  Patients requiring treatment 
with permitted concomitant medicati ons and/or transfusions will not be discontinued from the 
study.  Patients in Part B will be transfused per the transfusion criteria in  Table  1.  Patients wh o 
receive a transfusion in Part  B will not be withdrawn from the study.   
Blinding will be maintained when rolling patients into the extension period by providing a 
crossover dose  at Week 26 to allow placebo patients to receive the BIVV009 loading dose at start 
of BIVV009 dosing.  Patients who were randomized to BIVV009 during the 6 -month treatment 
period will receive a placebo dose at Week 26 to maintain blinding.  
All patients wi ll then continue to receive BIVV009 dosing every 2 weeks starting at Week  27.  
Should patients deviate from their scheduled dosing, a repeat loading dose may be required.  
On-site visits will be completed ~ every 3 months (at a minimum) for collection of 
pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, ADA samples and additiona l safety 
and efficacy measures.  PK, PD and anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) samples will be collected 
9 weeks after administration of the last dose of study drug in patients who disc ontinue early, as 
well as in patients who experience a hematological breakthrough event.  
The study will be complete 12 months following LPO for Part A at which time all patients receiving 
on-going treatment will proceed to an End -of-Study (EOS) visit.

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  Sample Size:  With 40 patients (20 per group), there is 87% power to detect a statistically significant difference 
of 50% between the BIVV009  group and placebo group if the true response rates are 85% and 
35% for the BIVV009  and placebo groups, respectively.  This calculation assumes a 2 -sided 5% -
level test comparing the response rates between the BIVV009  and placebo groups.  A 50% 
improvement over placebo is considered clinically relevant.  
Statistical 
Methods:  Interim analysis:  
For the purpose of regulatory submission, an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data will be 
performed after all patients  have completed Part A.  
Analyses:   
The ef ficacy endpoints will be presented for both the ITT and PP populations.  All the per -protocol 
analyses will be considered supportive analyses.  All hypothesis tests will be performed at a two -
sided 0.05 significance level.  
For Part A, the primary efficacy endpoint (responder status) will be compared between treatment 
groups using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  (CMH)  test for the ITT population, consisting of all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Secondary endpoints , defined as follows, will be tested only when the primary endpoint is 
statistically significant : 
1. Mean change from baseline in Hgb at the treatment assessment endpoint (mean  of values 
at Week 23, 25, and 26)  
2. Mean change from baseline in bilirubin (excluding patients with Gilbert’s Synd rome) at the 
treatment assessment endpoint  
3. Mean change from baseline in QOL, as assessed by the change in FACIT -fatigue scale 
scores at the treatment assessment endpoint  
4. Mean change from baseline in LDH at the treatment assessment endpoint  
5. Incidence of solicited symptomatic anemia at EOT  
The change from baseline variables will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
baseline as covariate.  A multiple testing procedure will be specified in the statistical analysis plan  
to control the overal l Type I error rate among the secondary endpoints.  
For Part B, the analyses will be performed for all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in the extension period.  All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics 
and grap hically (where appropriate) by prior treatment group in Part  A.  All safety endpoints will 
be summarized for all patients.  
Further details regarding other endpoints and proposed analyses will be described in full in the 
Statistical Analysis Plans (SAP) for Part A and Part B.

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  2 INTRODUCTION   
2.1 PHARMACOLOGY O F BIVV009   
BIVV009 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against human complement 
factor C1s, which along with C1r and C1 q is a part of the C1 complex that sits at the apex of the 
complement classical pathway ( CP).  By binding C1s BIVV009 prevents the enzymatic a ction of 
the C1 complex on its substrates, complement factors C4 and C2, and thereby blocks formation 
of the C3 convertase.  Note that this site of action of BIVV009 lies above the level of C3 , which 
is the junction of all three pathways of complement acti vation.  This is important to the 
specificity of the mechanism of action of BIVV009 because it means that the two other 
complement pa thways, the alternative pathway  and the lectin pathway, remain functionally intact 
for the purpose of host defense in the p resence of BIVV009 .  Note, too, that the non -enzymatic 
role of C1q is left intact by BIVV009 ; this may be particularly relevant because of the 
importance of the pro -phagocytic “housekeeping” functions of the complement system including 
removal of apoptotic  cells.  
BIVV009 binds with high affinity and specificity to C1s of humans and no n-human primates 
(NHPs).  It has  no affinity fo r the related proteases of the lectin pathway , MASP -1, and MASP -2. 
As discussed above, BIVV009 has disease -relevant inhibitory activity against CP in a variety of 
human in vitro models of human disease (including cold agglutinin disease [CA gD], bullous 
pemphigoid  [BP] , and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia  [WA IHA]).  BIVV009 exerts its 
effect on the CP in a characteristic two -state behavior: complete in hibition at concentrations 
≥20 g/mL, and no inhibition at concentrations <20 g/mL,  with an abrupt transition between 
the two.  This behavior means that graded degrees of inhibition are not readily mea surable and 
that increasing BIVV009 concentration to ≥20 g /mL results not in greater degrees of 
inhibition, but only in  longer duration of inhibition ( ie, longer dwell time in the “off” state  of the 
CP).  In turn, this means that the dose -effect relationship is demonstrated in the duration of 
action, such that higher doses lead to longer possible inter -dose intervals while maintaining full 
pathway inhibition.  
2.2 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE   
The CP has been implicated in many diseases that are driven by the presence of a pathogenic 
antibody; CA gD is one such example.  Complement inhibition has proven to be a safe and 
effective treatment for another form of hemolytic anemia,  paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.  
Currently, there are approved complement inhibitors being used therapeutically for various 
indications, including Soliris® (eculizumab), a mAb targeting C5; Berinert® and Cinryze®, both 
C1 esterase inhibitors purified  from human plasma; and Ruconest®, a recombinant form of 
human C1 esterase inhibitor.  Unlike Soliris and the C1 esterase inhibitors, by specifically 
targeting C1s, BIVV009 inhibits only the CP, leaving the alternative complement pathway and 
the lectin complement pathway available for immune surveillance.  Furthermore, by blocking at 
the level of the C1 complex, BIVV009 is expected to prevent generation of all anaphylatoxins 
and opsonins ( eg, C3 fragments) that produce pathologic lesions in CP -mediated disorders.

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  CAgD is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by IgM -induced CP activation .  The IgM 
autoantibodies in CAgD are referred to as “cold agglutinins” given their inherent  property of 
increased binding as a function of decreased temperature.  The cold agglutinin thermal 
amplitude, which is the highest temperature at which the cold agglutinin can be detected to react 
with the red blood cell antigen approaches core body tempe rature in many patients  (1).  CAgD 
symptoms are  typically triggered by exposure to cold environmental temperatures  
(ie, temperatures at or be low core body temperature), viral infections , or inflammation  (2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7).  All patients with CAgD have active disease with varying levels of chronic, ongoing 
hemolysis resulting in anemia  (8).  CAgD patients without recent transfusion remain 
significantly compromised with symptoms associated with hemolytic anemia including shortness 
of breath, fatigue, lightheadedness, and ge neral weakness , in addition to vascular symptoms such 
as Raynaud’s and acrocyanosis.  The symptomatic impact of anemia is increased in CAgD 
patients due to the advanced age of the population  (1, 9) who tolerate anemia symptoms poorly.  
CAgD patients who have not recently been trans fused often have similar Hgb levels as 
recently -transfused patients and can have significant symptoms (9). These complications have a 
signific ant adverse impact on quality of life.  Patients with CAgD are also at increased risk of 
arterial and venous thromboembolic events, including potentially life -threatening events such as 
stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism  (10, 11, 12).  This increased risk of 
thromboembolic events occurs in CAgD patients with even mild anemia and is related to the 
ongoing hemolysis (10, 12).  Thus, CAgD patients who are not recently t ransfused remain at risk 
for severe complications of the disease.  
There are no currently approved therapies for CAgD.  CAgD is typically not responsive to 
treatment with steroids or splenectomy and can only be managed by supportive measures 
(avoidance of cold, blood transfusions as needed) , and/or immunosuppressive, cytotoxic 
therapies ( eg, rituximab with or without fludarabine or bendamustine)  (8).  Because all red blood 
cells express the antigen targets of the IgM autoantibody (13), transfused blood in CAgD patients 
is subject to  the same IgM -induced CP -mediated destruction as the patients’ own red blood cells 
and is of limited efficacy beyond short -term alleviation of acute anemia symptoms.  Chronic 
transfusion support can lead to iron overload and the need for additional chelati on therapy.  
Immunomodulatory and cytotoxic therapies are used based on the association of CAgD with a 
clonal lymphoproliferative d isorder found in most patients (8, 14).  Targeting an underlying 
clonal disorder with immuno - and/or cytotoxic therapy can have significant toxicity risks with 
variable treatment responses that are often delayed and/or non -durable (8).   
Patients with CAgD have disease activity that fluctuates over time.  In population -based natural 
history st udies on CAgD, approxi mately 35 -49% of patients did not receive transfusio n support 
despite being anemic  (9, 15).  However, approximately 21% of patients convert from transfusion 
independ ence to transfusion dependence (15) and almost all patients undergo recurrent episodes 
of more severe anemia exacerbations over time that require periodic transfusion support (9).  
Thus, the BIV V009-04 study patient population is a distinct population from CAgD patients who 
have been recently transfused, representing patients in a different phase of their disea se with 
respect to transfusion usage.  
CAgD patients without recent transfusion suffer from significant symptoms due both to anemia 
and hemolysis as described above and are at risk for thromboembolic events as well as severe 
VV-CLIN-0550477 3.0
 
Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 22 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  exacerbations of their disease.   Patients without recent transfusion remain symptomatic and at 
risk of disease complications, particularly those patients  with significant anemia (Hgb ≤ 10 g/dL).  
The Phase  1b clinical trial of BIVV009 in patients with CAgD showed that it can rapidly block  
hemolytic activity, induce complete remission of anemia, and prevent the need for blood 
transfusion (16, 17).  In this Ph ase 1b study, as well as in the completed healthy volunteer 
Phase 1 studies, BIVV009 was well tolerated.  Based on the lack of available therapies, the 
eligibility criteria requiring symptomatic CAgD with anemia, the known complications including 
thromboembolic event risk faced by the patient population, and that most pa tients experience 
episodic worsening of their disease requiring initiation of transfusion, there is a high unmet need 
for this patient population.  The ultimate goal in the treatment of CAgD is to control the 
underlying hemolysis, thus alleviating anemia a nd addressing the symptomatology that can have 
a significant impact on quality of life, as well as other complications such as hemolytic 
breakthrough  and thromboembolic events.  The absence of approved therapy and the clinical data 
available from prior stu dy of BIVV009 in CAgD supports the benefit:risk in this population.  
Patients with CAgD  are often elderly and/or have numerous co -morbidities affecting their 
mobility. Moreover, clinical centers specialized in the management of CAgD  are infrequent and 
may b e located far from patients’ home. Consequently , some patients may find the option of 
home infusions  with drug against CAgD  beneficial. To this end a group of patients at preselected 
sites/countries will be offered the possibility of home infusions during Part B, assisted by trained 
health care professional. For the US, the Netherlands, Norway,  France, Italy, Austria, Germany, 
and Spain  specific amendments  (Appendix K ). 
In addition, in Part B, a subset of at least 15 patients  will be administered the study drug 
undiluted with saline  solution . An u ndiluted infusion gives the opportunity to administer study 
drug without diluting with normal saline.  The volume of injection can be reduced from 500 mL 
to 150 mL or 130 mL, depending on body weight. Consequently, administration of undiluted 
study  drug may be found beneficial b y patients and pharmacy staff.  
2.2.1  Non-clinical experience   
The non -clinical safety foundation for this study includes a completed 6 -month toxicology study 
in which NHPs were treated with weekly  doses of BIVV009 as high as 180  mg/kg for 26  weeks. 
Non-clinical safety studies of BIVV009 have demonstrated no toxicologically adverse findings 
related to BIVV009 in cynomolgus monkey stud ies of up to 6 -months treatment duration; 
furthermore, no adverse effects fro m exaggerated pharmacology ( ie, autoimmune  diseases, 
bacterial infections) were observed in those studies.  As a result, the no observed adverse effect 
(dose) level (NOAEL ) established for BIVV009 is 180  mg/kg by weekly intravenous ( IV) 
administration for 26  weeks; this translates to a safety marg in that more than adequately covers 
the BIVV009 dose regimen for use in Study BIVV009 -04.  Hence the NOAEL in cynomolgus 
monkeys is more than twice the intended fixed doses of 6.5 gram s or 7.5 grams,  based on adults 
weighing approximately  75 kg.

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  2.2.2  Clinical experience   
The clinical safety foundation for this study includes a n ongoing prospective, double -blind, 
randomized, placebo -controlled, First In Human (FIH) Phase  1a/b study ( BIVV 009-01). 
Phase  1a included Part A, a  single -ascending dose study in normal healthy volunteers (NHV) , 
and Part  B, a multiple -ascending dose study in NHVs .  Phase 1b included Part C, a multi -dose 
study in patients with complement -mediated disorders inclu ding CAgD, WAIHA, BP, and 
antibody -mediated rejection (AMR) i n kidney transplant recipients , and Part E, which was added 
to both allow continued access to study drug in a subset of study patients with CAgD, and to 
further characterize the safety and effica cy to BIVV009.  Part D was not implemented.  
Part A was conducted according to an ascending dose cohort paradigm in which a unique cohort 
of NHVs was treated at each single dose level.  There were 7  cohorts of NHVs. The  first 2 cohorts  
consisted of 4 health y volunteers each, 3 given BIVV009 (0.3  or 1 mg/kg) by IV infusion and 
1 given placebo.  The remaining 5  cohorts consisted of 8  healthy volunteers each, 6  given 
BIVV009 by IV infusion (3, 10, 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg) and 2 given placebo.  
Part B was conducted according to an ascending dose cohort paradigm in which a unique cohort 
of NHVs was treated at each dose level.  There were 2 cohorts of NHVs, each consisting of 
8 healthy volunteers , in this part of the study.  These cohorts were given 4  weekly IV doses o f 
BIVV009 or placebo (6:2 for active:placebo) at a dose level previously administered to NHVs in 
Part A of the study (30 or 60  mg/kg).  
Part C was conducted in a single cohort of patients enrolled in 4 strata, representing four 
complement -mediated disorders  (CAgD, WAIHA, BP, and AMR) .  Patients in Part  C received a 
single IV test dose of 10  mg/kg followed by 4 weekly doses of 60 mg/kg.  
Clinical proof of concept f or BIVV009 was achieved in Phase  1b based upon the demonstration 
of immediate cessation of hemoly sis and rapid correction of anemia during short -term treatment 
of patients with CAgD (a complement -mediated hemolytic anemia).  These results confirm that 
continuous C1s inhibition is sufficient  to observe a treatment effect , while the observation of 
relap se of hemolytic anemia upon washout of BIVV009 and restoration of C1s activity confirms 
that continuous C1s inhibition is necessary for treatment of CA gD. 
The clinical safety profile of single - or multiple -dose administration of BIVV009 to healthy 
volunteers was similar to placebo with respect to type, frequency, or severity of adverse events 
(AEs) and there have been no clinically meaningful AEs seen in healthy volunteers exposed to 
BIVV009 at doses up to 60  mg/kg weekly for 4 doses.  The clinical safety profile of multiple -
dose administration of BIVV009 to patients with a variety of complement -mediated disorders 
has not revealed any new safety concerns in this older -aged, medically complex population.  
With  respect to the hypothetical, mechanism -related  risks from C1s inhibition ( ie, autoimmune 
diseases, bacterial infections), prophylactic vaccination against encapsulated bacterial pathogens 
per regional guidelines and routine surveillance with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
serologic testing ar e available to mitigate these risks.  
A second prospective, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study of multi -dose 
BIVV009 in healthy volunteers was recently completed under Protocol TNT009 -02.  A single 
VV-CLIN-0550477 3.0
 
Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 24 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  cohort of  24 NHVs was randomized to BIVV009  (75 mg/kg) or placebo at a ratio of 3:1. 
Volunteers were dosed on Days 1, 8, 22, and 36.  Intensive PK/PD/exploratory complement 
sampling was performed during the study.  This study added an additional dose level, which was 
combined with data from the BIVV009 -01 study to augment PK modeling and simulations.  
The results of this study, in conjun ction with existing PK data, were  used to propose dose 
regimens for the current protocol.  
2.2.3  Pharmacokinetic experience and dose justification   
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) profile of BIVV009 in healthy volunteers and 
in patients has been established based on  the data collected from the first -in-human clinical trial. 
A human PK model was constructed fr om the complete and final Phase  1a data. This model was 
then augmented with the available PK data emerging from the Phase 1b component of this trial, 
and the combined model was used to simulate a variety of possible dose regimens fo r use in 
patients.  The dose regimen pro posed for use in current and future clinical trials with BIVV009, 
including Study BIVV009 -04, differs from that used in the Phase  1a and 1b program because 
weekly IV administration was deemed to be logistically chall enging for patients when the period 
of treatment is increased from weeks to months.  A regimen based up on a single priming dose on 
Day 0, followed by bi -weekly dosing on Days 7, 21, 35, 49, etc , can provide continuous, 
complete C1s inhibition while better accommodating to the needs of patients.  Human PK 
modeling suggests that a dose level of 6.5 grams or 7.5 gra ms (based on body weight of <75  kg 
or ≥75 kg, respectively) is necessary to protect patients better from potential restoration of CP 
activity at the end of the inter -dose interval.   The weight cut -off of 75 kg was chosen based on 
the expected weight distribution in CAgD patients with a median weight of 74.8 kg.  
The in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic profile of BIVV009 has two especially important f eatures 
that help to define the optimal dose regimen for clinical use.  First, BIVV009 has very high 
affinity and selectivity for C1s, with negligible off -target activity.  Second, it is a potent CP 
inhibitor with  such a steep concentration -effect relation ship that it behaves as a switch -like 
inhibitor of C1s: at concentrations of BIVV009 ≥20 µg/mL, CP activity is virtually undetectable; 
at BIVV009 concentrations below this threshold the CP is fully active.  This property results in 
the requirement to maint ain a blood concentration of BIVV009 that is always at least 
≥20 µg/mL, even at trough, lest CP activity be fully restored.  
2.2.4  Potential risks and benefits   
As previously noted, clinical proof of concept for BIVV009 was achieved in a Phase 1b study, 
which demonstrated immediate cessation of hemolysis and rapid correction of anemia during 
short -term treatment of patients with CAgD.  
The human safety risk from o ff-target effects of mAb  therapeutics is generally considered to be 
low, and in this regard BIVV009 is no exception.  The human safety risk from short -term 
inhibition of the complement system also appears to be low, based upon the experience with 
five approved  products in this therapeutic class.   Long -term, complement inhibition may increase 
the risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria, as reflected in the product label for eculizumab 
(Soliris), an inhibitor of the terminal p ortion of the complement sys tem.  However, to provide 
VV-CLIN-0550477 3.0
 
Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 25 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  optimal protection against infections with encapsulated bacteria, the design of this study includes 
an appropriate program of prophylactic vaccinations.  
The risks associated with long -term inhibition of the proximal portion of the  CP are presently 
unknown.  Theoretically , it could increase the risk of SLE or  circulating immune complexes  
(CIC) disease due to the role of the C1 complex in immune complex clearance, as observed  in 
patients with congenital deficiencies of C1 complex com ponents (C1q,  C1s, and C1r).  However, 
pharmacologic inhibition of C1s differs from  congenital deficienc y of the C1 complex because: 
1) congenital C1 complex component deficiency are commonly not single gene mutations but 
typically are associated with second mutations in other immune system genes; 2)  pharmacologic 
inhibition of C1s enzymatic function in the C1 complex leaves intact the non -enzymatic function 
of C1q, which is important for the opsonization and phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells which 
protects against autoimmunity; and 3) the phenotype associated with life -long, often total 
absence of C1 complex structure and function is unlikely to be reproduced by  pharmacologic 
antagonism of  C1 enzymatic function in fully developed adults.  Neverthele ss, standard clinical  
biomarkers related to SLE ( eg, antibodies to double -stranded DNA  [dsDNA ]) have been 
incorporated into the study design as safety surveillance measures.  
Home infusions with the study drug will be proposed to a number of patients in countries pre -
selected to participate in home infusion.  Home infusions will be assisted by a trained healthcare 
professional , and will concern patients who express such wish, afte r having been qualified by the 
Investigator and no sooner than after Week 39 (Day 273) and without evidence of intolerance of 
the study drug as determined by the Investigator based on the criteria outlined in Appendix K . 
The potential risks associated with home BIVV009 administration s are the same as the risks with 
BIVV009 admi nistration in a clinical setting. Only patients treated with  BIVV009 for a 
minimum of 3 months and who do  not have a history of hypersensitivity  to BIV V009 are eligible 
for the home infusion. Additionally, patients who are participating in or have ever participated in 
undiluted infusions of BIVV009 are not eligible for home infusions . Rescue medications to treat 
hypersensitivity/allergic reactions as per  the PI’s guidance will be available during home 
infusion visits. The home infusion personnel will be trained in basic life support 
(cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]) but will not be required to have equipment to perform 
advanced life support (eg, defib rillators).  
At least 15 patients  in Part B will be proposed to receive infusions of the  study drug undiluted 
with saline solution. An undiluted infusion gives the opportunity to administer study drug without  
diluting with normal saline. Undiluted  infusions may begin  no sooner than after Week 39 
(Day  273) in patients who provide their consent and are without evidence of intolerance to the 
study drug as determined by the Investigator based on the criteria outlined in  Section  4.1, Part B . 
Patients who are participating in or have ever participated in home infusions are not eligible for 
undiluted infusion.  Safety co ncerns associated with undiluted BIVV009 are not anticipated; 
however, an increase in infusion -related reactions may be possible due to the altered 
concentration of the protein/active compound. Therefore , patients treated with BIVV009 for a 
minimum of 3 mo nths and who do  not have a history of hypersensitivity to BIVV009 may be 
eligible for undiluted  infusions with BIVV009. Decreased fluid load associated with BIVV009 
administration may be found clinically advantageous, particularly in this  population of CAg D 
patients who often have numerous co -morbidities which may include cardio -pulmonary 
conditions. Moreover, the preparation of BIVV009 infusion without the need for dilution in

between  undiluted solution and diluted solution.  
The overall risk/benefit balance for participants in Study BIVV009 -04 is favorable  based on 
available data to date .

4.1 STUDY DESIGN   
This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of BIVV009 in symptomatic patients with the complement -mediated disorder primary 
CAgD who do not have a recent history of blood transfusion.  
During the 6 -week Screening/ Observation Period, prospective patients will have a detailed 
medical history documented (including all available transfusion histo ry), physical evaluations, 
and blood samples collected on  3 occasions approximately every 2 weeks.  
Patients may receive a transfusion(s) during the Screening/Observation Period prior to the 
first study drug infusion if medically indicated per the Investig ator’s discretion.  However, the 
baseline visit (and first infusion of study drug) must occur at least 7 days following the 
transfusion.  
Part A  
The study will enroll approximately 40 primary CAgD patients who do not have a recent history 
of blood transfusi on (ie, ≤1 transfusion during the last year and no transfusion during the last 
6 months prior to enrollment).   Eligible patients should have been diagnosed with primary CAgD 
at least 6 months prior to enrollment and should have had no history of transfusio n during this 
period.   
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive an IV infusion of BIVV009 or placebo over 
approximately 60  minutes on Day  0, Day  7, and every 14  days thereafter through Week  25 
(ie, Days 21, 35, 49, 63, 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147 , 161, and 175).   Patients who miss a dose 
(ie, outside the dosing window  or >17 days since last dose ) should return to the site for an 
unscheduled visit 1 week prior to the next scheduled dose in order to receive a n additional  
loading dose .  Patients will  have an End -of-Treatme nt (EOT) visit in Part  A on Day  182 
(Week  26). 
Patients who meet the transfusion criteria in  Table  1 during the 6 -month double -blind treatment 
period will receive a transfusion.   Patients who receive a transfusion during Part A will not be 
withdrawn from the study and will be eligible to part icipate in Part B.  
Table  1 - Transfusion criteria   
A patient will receive a transfusion during Part A  or Part B if his or her Hgb level meets either 
of the  following criteria:  
• Hgb is <9  g/dL and the patient is symptomatic, or 
• Hgb is <7  g/dL and the patient is asymptomatic  
A responder analysis will be conducted following completion of the EOT visit at Week  26. 
The responder definition is provided in  Table  2.

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  Table  2 - Responder  definition   
A patient  will be considered a responder in Part A if:  
• Hgb increases ≥1.5  g/dL from baseline (defined as the last Hgb value before 
administration of the first dose of study drug) at treatment assessment endpoint 
(defined as mean value from Weeks 23, 25, and 26) and  
• The patient did not receive a blood transfusion from Week 5 through Week 26 (EOT), 
and 
• The patient did not receive treatment for CA gD beyond w hat is permitted per protocol 
from Week 5 through Week 26 (EOT)  
A list of excluded concomitant medications, as w ell as allowed concomitant medications with 
restrictions, is provided in Section  6.2.6 . Beyond the permitted concomitant medications, study 
drug, and transfusions, patients may receive no other therapies for the treatment of CAgD while 
enrolled in this study; patients requiring other treatment for their CAgD in Part A will be 
withdrawn from t he study and counted as non -responders.   These patients will not be eligible to 
participate in Part B.  
Part B  
Following completion of dosing in the initial 6 -month treatment period, patients will roll into 
the long-term safety and durability of response extension phase and receive BIVV009 in an 
open -label manner.  Part B will run for 1 year following last patient out ( LPO ) under Part  A.  
Patients requiring treatment with permitted concomitant medications and/or transfusions will not 
be discontinued from the study.  Patients in Part B will be transfused per the transfusion criteria 
in Table  1.  Patients who recei ve a transfusion in Part B will not be withdrawn from the study.   
Blinding will be maintained when rolling patients into the extension period by providing a 
crossover dose at Week 26 to allow placebo patients to receive the BIVV009 loading dose at 
start o f BIVV009 dosing.  Patients who were randomized to BIVV009 during the 6 -month 
treatment period will receive a placebo dose at Week 26 to maintain blinding.  All patients will 
then continue to receive bi -weekly BIVV009 dosing starting at Week 27.  
Patients will be dosed with BIVV009 every 2 weeks, as in Part A.  Should patients deviate from 
their scheduled dosing, a repeat loading dose may be required.  On-site visits will be completed 
~ every 3 months (at a mi nimum) for collection of PK, PD and ADA  samples, and additional 
safety and efficacy measures . 
Home infusion will be performed by a healthcare professional caregiver contingent upon 
completion of training delivered by the Investigator or delegated site staff member only in 
patients willing to be  administered study drug in home, who have been treated with at least  
3 months with BIVV009 in Part B and who satisfy  the criteria mention in the appendix K

2. Treated for at least 3 months in Part B (completed visit Day 273)  
3. No history of hypersensitivity reaction to BIV V009 
4. Not selected to participate in home infusion administration  
5. Considered by Investigator as suitable  for undiluted infusion of BIVV009  
Each qualified  patient is supposed to  receive at least one undiluted  infusion of BIVV009 , 
however , patients are free to continue with undiluted  infusion of BIVV009  until the end of study. 
Undiluted infusions with BIVV009 versus infusions of BIVV009 diluted in  saline will be 
captured through the case report form (CRF) for drug administr ation.  
A safety follow -up visit for collection of AE data, PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody (ADA) 
samples will be performed 9 weeks after administration of the last dose of study drug in patients 
who discontinue early or following the end of dosing in the l ong-term extension period.  Samples 
for PK, PD, and ADA will also be collected from patients who experience a hematological 
breakthrough event.   The study will be complete 12 months following LPO for Part A at which 
time all patients receiving on -going tre atment will proceed to an End -of-Study (EOS) visit.  
4.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN   
The route of administration, dose, and dosing interval for BIVV009 planned for use in this study 
are based on the initial Phase 1a/1b clinical experience ( BIVV009 -01) and corresponding 
non-clinical  data for safety, PK, and PD observations.  BIVV009 has thus far been administered 
to healthy human volunteers and patients wi th complement -mediated disease entities including 
CAgD, BP, WAIHA , and AMR . 
During Part A, randomized  patients will receive fixed doses via IV infusion of either 6.5 grams 
(if <75 kg) or 7.5 gram s (if ≥75 kg) of BIVV009 or placebo based on their baseline body weight.   
During Part B , all patients will receive BIVV009 in an open -label manner based on their body 
weight as described above.  
The repeated dose regimen is predicted to provide continuous C1s inhibition throughout the 
dosing  interval, with an adequa te safety margin based on comparative drug exposures in NHPs

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  (Section  2.2.1 ) and in healthy volunteers given a si ngle dose of 100 mg/kg in Phase  1a 
(Section  2.2.2 ).  
Safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity assessments will be evaluated at the time  points 
indicated in the study schedule of events  (Table  3). In patients having consented to the use of 
their blood samples for future research, ADA may be tested using available predose PD back -up 
samples.

long-term safety and durability of response extension phase of the study.  
• Part B safety and durability of response extension phase: blinding wi ll be maintained 
when rolling patients into the extension period by providing a crossover dose at Week 26 
to allow placebo patients to receive the BIVV009 loading dose at start of BIVV009 
dosing.  Patients who were randomized to BIVV009 during the 6 -month treatment period 
will receive a placebo dose at Week 26 to maintain blinding.  All patients w ill then 
continue to receive bi -weekly BIVV009 dosing starting at Week 27.  For individual  
patients, dosing in Part  B may last from 1 to 2 years, depending on when the patient 
enters Part B.  Part B will to run for 1  year following comp letion of LPO  in Part A.  
• Part A/B ET /Safety Follow -up visit: 9 weeks after administration of the last dose of study 
drug. 
4.5 END OF STUDY   
The study will be considered complete 12 mo nths following LPO from Part  A. When this occurs, 
all ongoing patients in Part B will return to the clinic for EOS assessments (see Section  6.1.5.7  
and Table  3). The EOS will occur when the last patient has had his or her last visit (Last  Patient 
Last Visit).

Bone Marrow Biopsy  
A bone marrow biopsy is required to have been performed within 6 months of Screening to rule 
out overt  evidence of lymphoproliferative disease or other hematological malignancy prior to 
enrollment.  Sites will submit de -identified biopsy reports to an independent central reade r for 
eligibility adjudication.  If biopsy is deemed unsuitable or insufficient t o determine eligibility, 
then either the prior tissue may be submitted for additional hematopathology assessment or a 
new bone marrow biopsy will be performed during the screening period.  Patients will have the 
option to consent to additional testing of b one marrow for MYD88 status. Further instructions 
for bone marrow biopsy assessment will be available in Appendix A  (Bone Marrow Biopsy 
Report Review Process) to the ‘Subject Eligibility Review Process Overview ’. 
Vaccination Against Encapsulated Bacterial Pathogens  
In the event a  patient does not have documented vaccinat ion against encapsulated bacterial 
pathogens (Neisseria meningitis , including serogroup B meningococcus , where available,  
Haemophilus influenzae , and Streptococcus pneumoniae ) within 5 years prior to enrollment , 
vaccination should be initiated during the Screening/Observation Period  prior to enrollment 
(see Table  3).  Vaccina tion series for these pathogens should be completed as per current 
regional guidelines specified for patients with persistent complement deficiency and in 
accordance with their respective labels, as  applicable.  Where no regional guidelines are 
available f or patients with persistent complement deficiency, it is recommended that vaccinations 
include meningococcal conjugate, meningococcal serogroup B, 13 -valent pneumococcal, 23 -valent 
pneumococcal, and Haemophilus influenza  Type b vaccines  where commercially available.  
Vaccinations should be initiated on Day -42 or as early as possible during the 
Screening/Observation period. The primary vaccine series should be completed during Screening 
when possible and otherwise prior to Week 5 of Part A.  Patients must be advised that 
vaccination may not prevent meningococcal infections  and that they should immediately report 
fevers or other symptoms consistent with acute infection to the Investigator . 
Patients who develop symptoms consistent with an in fection due to encapsulated bacterial 
pathogens during the study period will have a blood sample collected to test for confirmation of 
infection  and vaccination status .

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  transcribed o nto the  eCRFs.  The administration location, rate, start time, stop time, any infusion 
interruptions, and total volume of investigationa l product actually administered will be recorded 
in the eCRFs.   If an AE occurs during the administration of study drug, the rest of the infusion 
during which the AE occurred may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the Investigator  or 
the professiona l healthcare caregiver in case of home infusions  (Appendix K ). 
Patients must be monitored for acute allergic  reactions during infusion  and for at least 2  hours 
after the completion of the first administration of study drug or 1 hour after the completion of 
each administration of study drug thereafter.  Additionally, patients undergoing home infusions 
will be monitored by the professional healthcare c aregiver for 2 hours after the completion of the 
first home infusion or 1 hour after the completion of each subsequent home infusion ( Appendix K ). 
Epinephrine, parenteral diphenhydramine  and, for infusions carried at the study site,  cardiac 
resuscitation equipment , must be immediately available in case an allergic reaction or 
anaphylaxis occurs. Site personnel or professional healthcare caregiver in ca se of home infusions 
(Appendix K ), must be qualified to detect allergic reactions and anaphylaxis and treat those 
reactions under the guidance of the  PI. The home infusion personnel will be trained in basic life 
support (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]) but will not be required to have equipment to 
perform advanced life support (eg, defibrillators). See Section  6.3.8  for further details regarding 
additional testing.  
Patients  should be instructed to report the development of rash, hives, pruritus, flushing,  
urticaria, etc, that may represent an allergic or hypersensitivity  reaction to study drug.  If any 
signs or symptoms of an allergic or anaphylactic  reaction are observed during the infusion, 
administration of study drug must be immediately discontinued an d the patient  treated as 
appropriate . In case of home infusion, the investigator has to be notified immediately  to guide 
treatment (Appendix K ). 
6.2.5  Blind ing  
Patients and all study staff will be blinded to treatment assignment.   Study drug or placebo doses 
for infusion will be prepared by the pharmacist or qualified site staff in a blinded manner.  
Investigators will have direct access to unblinding of treatment through the IWRS in the event of 
an emergency in which knowledge of treatment assignment would aid in immediate patient care. 
Should a patient’s treatment be unblinded, every effort will be undertaken to protect the blind 
within the study team. Only a pre -specified group of unblinded team members (safety associate, 
data man ager, biostatistician) will have access to the patient’s unblinded data while the study is 
ongoing . 
6.2.6  Concomitant medications   
Patients  will refrain from participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which 
receipt of any investigational drug occurred within 5 half -lives or 30  days, whichever is longer, 
prior to Day 0 and during the entire study.  
Treatment with rituximab monotherapy or rituximab combination therapies ( eg, with 
bendamustine, fludarabine, ibrutinib, or cytotoxic drugs) is prohibited.

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  During Part A , patients will not take any prescription or over -the-counter medications/products 
until completion of the follow -up assessments, unless prescribed by the Investigator or another 
physi cian for the treatment of an AE.  
As noted in  Section  5.2, concurrent administration of erythropoietin and/or a daily dose of 
corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤10  mg/day of prednisone) is acceptable provided the patient has 
been on a stable dose during  the previous  3 month s; concurrent use of B12, folate and iron 
supplementation  is acceptable provided the patient has been on a stable dose during the previous  
4 weeks.  
Topical therapies without risk of systemic absorption may be allowed, and non -prescription 
medications for treatment of minor intercurrent illnesses (headache, viral upper respirat ory tract 
infections , etc) are permitted at the discretion of the PI.  Hormonal contraception in female 
patients is allowed provided patients are receiving stable treatment ≥3  months prior to Screening.  
Any medication taken by the patient  during the study , along with its strength, frequency of 
dosing, and reason for its use, will be documented in the patient’s  source data and the eCRF.  
6.2.7  Contraception   
Women of non -childbearing pot ential are defined as permanently sterile ( ie, due to hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpin gectomy, bilateral oophorectomy ) or postmenopausal (defined as at least 
12 months post -cessation of menses without an alternative medical cause).  Women who are of 
non-childbearing potential will not be required to use contraception.  
Female patients of childbearing potential must be established on (≥3  months prior to Screening) 
and agree to continue to use the same highly eff ective methods of birth control ( ie, contracep tive 
measure with a failure rate of <1% per year) in conjunction with male barrier contraception 
(ie, male condom with spermicide)  throughout the study and for 9 weeks  after the administration 
of the last dose of study drug .  Highly effective methods of contraception include:  
• Intrauterine device (IUD; Mirena®) 
• Established use of oral (PO) , implanted, transdermal, or hormonal method of 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Permanent birth control via the Essure procedure  
Male patients will be surgically sterile for at least 90 days or when sexually active with female 
partners of childbearing potential will be required to use a male condom with spermicide  
(if locally approved for use)  throughout the study and for 9 weeks after the last dose of study 
drug. 
Patients  who practice true abstinence, because of the patient’s  lifestyle choice ( ie, the patient 
should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation) are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements .  Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  If a patient

contraception as described above.  
For male patients , sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregnant or breastfeeding 
should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time of administration of the first dose until 
9 weeks  after administration o f the last dose of study drug.  Male patients are required to refrain 
from donation of sperm from Day 0  until 9 weeks  after administration of the last dose of study 
drug.

points specifi ed in  Table  3.  Clinical laboratory results will be reviewed by the Investigator and 
results outside of the reference range s will be documented and clinical significance noted.  
Local laboratory values may be utilized for eligibility evaluation and medical management of the 
patient, including assessing the hemoglobin criteria necessitating blood transfusions . Detailed 
informati on on the allocation of samples for central or local laboratory processing will be 
available in the Laboratory Manual.  
6.3.8  Additional testing in case of hypersensitivity/allergic reaction   
If a patient exhibits signs of a hypersensitivity/ allergic reaction during study drug administration, 
the study drug infusion should be stopped immediately , and medical treatment provided, as 
appropriate.  
If a suspected  anaphylactic reaction occurs  (18), the following labs may be obtained  per the 
discretion of the Investigator, after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor : 
• Approximately 30 to 120 minutes after the start of symptoms: blood draw for ADAs 
(including isotyping), tryptase, IL -6, IL -33, plasma histamine, CICs, and complement 
levels (CH50).  A follow -up tryptase level should be obtained 8 days following the 
reactio n.

6.7 ADVERSE EVENTS  AND LABORATORY ABNO RMALITIES   
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to report all AEs in the eCRF.  The AE and SAE 
reporting period will begin from the time the patient signs the ICF  and continue through 9 weeks 
after administration of the last dose of study drug .  Any SAE must be reported within 24  hours of 
the knowledge of the occurrence to the Study Medical Monitor and the designated Clinical 
Research Organizat ion’s (CRO) Clinical Safety Group .  Refer to Section  6.7.4  for further details 
regarding SAE reporting procedures.   
For urgent medical issues in which the study’s Medical Director should be contacted, please 
refer to the study reference manual’s Official Study Contact List for complete contact 
information.  
6.7.1  Definition of adverse events   
An AE is defined in the International Council for  Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical 
investigation  subject  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship  with this treatment” (ICH E6: S ection 1.2).  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory fin ding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related  to the medicinal (investigational) product . 
6.7.1.1  Definition of adverse drug reactions   
Adverse drug reactions are defined as a ll noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose administered.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means 
that a causal rel ationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at leas t a reasonable 
possibility ( ie, the r elationship cannot be ruled out ). 
The following categories for determining the causal relationship to the investigational medicinal 
product are to be used:  
VV-CLIN-0550477 3.0
 
Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 61 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  Probable (must have first three):  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
• It cannot be reasonabl y explained by the know n characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of  therapy administered to the patient . 
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug.  
• It reappears upon re -challenge.  
Possible (must have first two):  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It may readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient . 
• It does not reappear or worsen  when the drug is re -administered.  
Unrelated:  
An AE will be considered “Unrelated” to the use of the investigational drug if there is not a 
reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by the product under investigation and does 
not meet the crite ria for drug relationship listed under possible or probable.  Factors pointing 
toward this assessment include, but are not limited to, the lack of reasonable temporal 
relationship between administration of the drug and the event, the presence of a biologic ally 
implausible relationship between the product and the AE  (eg, the event occurred before 
administration of drug), or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE.  
In case of missing causality assessment in the eCRF or SAE reporting form, the event will be 
regarded as possibly related unless further specified.   Any SAE recorded as probably or possibly 
related will be categorized as “related” for regulatory reporting purposes.  
A serious drug reaction is an adverse drug reaction that me ets the definition of a serious even t 
(provided below).  
6.7.1.2  Definition of serious adverse events   
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (AE) that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening ( patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
• Requires i npatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
• Results in  persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly /birth defect  
• Any other significant medical condition  
VV-CLIN-0550477 3.0
 
Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 62 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  A hospitalization meeting the regulatory definition for “serious” is any inpatient hospital 
admission.  Any AE that does not meet one of the definitions of serious ( ie, important medical 
events that ma y not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the patient or may require interventions to prevent on e of the o ther outcomes listed 
above [eg, emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or requires urgent inve stigation ]) may be 
considered by the Investigator to meet the “other significant medical condition”  criterion for 
classification as an SAE.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood 
dyscrasias.  
If a subject develops a Grade 3 or highe r allergic reaction per Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading or an anaphylactic reaction (see Section  6.3.8 ) in association 
with BIVV009 administration, the event should be reported as an SAE.  
Exceptions from SAE reporting:  
Hospitalization for performing protocol -required procedures or administration of study treatment 
is not classified as an SAE.  
6.7.1.3  Definition of unexpected adverse eve nt/SUSAR   
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event , the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) of BIVV009 .  Also, reports that add 
significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented AE constitute 
unexpected AEs.  An event more specific or more severe than described in the IB would be 
considered “unexpe cted.”  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is a serious adverse reaction, the 
nature or severity of which is not consistent with the IB.  All suspected adverse reactions related 
to BIVV009 that occur in the concerned clinical trial and that are both unexpected and serious 
(SUSARs) are subject to expedited reporting  as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries . 
6.7.2  Clinical adverse events   
The I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs observed by the Investigator or reported 
by the patient are properly captured in the patient’s medical records.  
The following AE attribute s must be assigned by the Investigator:  
• Adverse event term  
• Dates of onset and resolution  
• Seriousness (yes/no)/seriousness criterion  
• Severity  
• Assessment of relatedness to study drug  
VV-CLIN-0550477 3.0
 
Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 63 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  • Outcome  
- Recovered/resolved  
- Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not resolved  
- Fatal  
- Unknown (only applicable if patient is lost to follow -up) 
• Action taken:  
- None  
- Study drug temporarily interrupted  
- Study drug permanently discontinued  
During the study, serious and non -serious AEs will be followed until resolved or clinically 
stable.   At the end of the study, all ongoing SAEs will be foll owed until resolved, stabilized, or 
returned to baseline.  
It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an AE is related and of 
sufficient severity to require the patient’s removal from treatment or from the study.  A patient 
may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable 
AE.  If either of these situations arise s, the patient should be strongly encouraged to undergo an 
ET visit assessment and be under medical supervision u ntil symptoms cease or the condition 
becomes stable.  
All clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of the 
eCRF , regardless of causality .  Severity of AEs will be graded using the CTCAE, version 4.03  
(see Appendix B ). 
If an AE occurs that is not contained in the CTCAE version 4.03, the five -point scale below will 
be used.  
Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
Grade 2 :  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
Grade 3 :  Severe or medically  significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limited 
self-care ADL  
Grade 4 :  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 : Death related to AE

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  6.7.3  Laboratory test a bnormalities   
Laboratory test value abnormalities that have worsened from baseline  should not be reported on 
the AE page of the eCRF as AEs unless they satisfy on e or more of the following conditions for 
clinical significance:  
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms  
• Leading to a change in study medication ( eg, dose modification, interruption, or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a cha nge in concomitant therapy ( eg, add ition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy, or 
treatment  
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for an SAE should be reported as such, in 
addition to being recorded as  an AE in  the eCRF . 
6.7.4  Serious adverse event reporting - procedures for investigators   
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent  throu gh the final study visit, or 9 weeks  
after administration of  the last dose of study drug, whichever occurs later, must be reported to the 
Sponsor’s designated CRO ’s Clinical Safety Group within 24  hours of the knowledge of the 
occurrence.  All SAEs that the I nvestigator considers related to study d rug occurring after the 
follow -up period must be reported directly to the Sponsor.  
To report the SAE, the SAE form for the study  should be completed  and submitted within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event to the designated CRO’s Clinical Safe ty Group 
via email or facsimile (FAX) per the instructions  provided on the SAE report form.  
The Sponsor (or designee) will report SUSARs to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
Investigators according to local law.  
6.7.5  Follow -up of adverse events   
All serious and non -serious AEs, regardless of whether or not they are assessed as related to 
study drug, should be followed up during the study until they have resolved, returned to ba seline 
status , or stabilized.  If a clear explanation is established, it should be recorded on the eCRF. 
If there is a unifying diagnosis, the diagnosis should be reported rather than a collection of signs 
and symptoms.  
Ongoing SAEs at the end of study should continue to be followed until the event has resolved,  
returns to baseline,  the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent 
impairment), or the patient dies.  Within 24 hours of receipt of any follow -up information, the  
Investigator must update the eCRF, complete and submit an SAE follow -up form along with any 
supporting documentation (eg,  patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to the designated 
CRO’s Clinical Safety Group via email or FAX per the instructions  provided on the SAE report 
form .

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  6.7.6  Follow -up of abnormal laboratory results   
In the event of unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated 
immediately and follow -up until they have returned to the normal range and/or an adequate 
explanation of the abnormality is found.  If a clear explanation is established , it should be 
recorded on the eCRF.   Regarding the documentation of abnormal laboratory tests, please refer 
to Section  6.7.3 . 
6.7.7  Pregnancy   
If a patient  becomes pregnant during the study or within 9 weeks of receiving study drug, or if 
the partner of a patient  participating in the study conceives after the patient has received the first 
dose of study drug and up to 9 weeks after receiving the last dose of study drug , the Investigator 
should report the pregnancy to the designated CRO’s Clinical Safety Group by completing and 
forwarding a Pregnancy Report Form  within 24  hours of being notified.  
A patient  becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study, 
study treatment will be stopped , and early study termination  procedures will be performed.  
The patient or patient’s partner should be followed by the Investigator until th e end of the 
pregnancy.  If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator 
should notify the designated CRO ’s Clinical  Safety group  by completing and forwarding an 
updated Pregnancy Report Form.  At the end of the pregnancy , the Investigator should document 
the outcome of the pregnancy and provide a final update via an updated Pregnancy Report Form.  
If outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(ie, postpartum complication, spontaneou s abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
6.7.8  Overdose   
An overdose is any dose of study treatment administered to a subject or taken by a subject that 
exceeds the dose assigned to the sub ject according to the protocol.  Overdoses are not considered 
AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded 
on an Overdose form and faxed or emailed to the designated CRO’s Clinical Safety Group within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose.  An overdose must be reported to the 
designated CRO’s Clinical Safety Group even if the overdose does not result  in an AE.   If an 
overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded.  If an overdose results in an SAE, both the 
SAE and Overdose forms must be completed and faxed or emailed to the designated CRO’s 
Clinical Safety Group .  All study treatment -related dosi ng information must be recorded on the 
dosing CRF.

Data from Part A and Part B of this study will be analyzed and reported separately.  A separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) for each part of the study will be produced providing full details 
of all analy ses to be performed for Part A and Part B.  Should there be any differences between 
the analyses plan and methodology described within the SAP ver sus the clinical protocol, the 
SAP will take precedence.  
For the purpose s of regulatory submission, an interim analysis of  the Part A data will be 
performed after all patients have completed Part A. 
7.1 DESCRIPTION OF OBJEC TIVES AND ENDPOINTS   
The objectives of the study and the endpoints to be analyzed are described in Section  4.3. 
In general, continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics, including: number, 
mean, median, standard deviation  (SD) , minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables and 
response variables will be presented with the number and percentage in each category.  Any 
hypothesis tests will be performed at a two -sided 0.05 significance level.   Unless otherwise 
specified, all data will be presented in patient data listings.  
For analyses purp oses in Part A, baseline is defined as the last value obtained during Screening 
immediately prior to administration of the first dose of study drug.  
For endpoints involving laboratory parameters, except for hematology panel, results from the 
central labora tory will be used.  Local laboratory values were utilized for Direct Antiglobulin 
Test (DAT) for , among others,  eligibility purposes and hematology panel that allow s both 
determination of eligibility and the medical management of the patient, with assessmen t of the 
hemoglobin  criteria necessitating blood transfusions.  
7.2 DEMOGRAPHICS AND BAS ELINE DISEASE CHARAC TERISTICS   
Demographic and other baseline disease characteristics will be s ummarized using descriptive 
statistics for the overall population .  Data to be tabulated will include, but not be limited to, age, 
race, medical history, and other disease -specific measures.  
7.3 EFFICACY  - PART A   
7.3.1  Analysis population s  
Full Analysis Set Population: The Intent -to-Treat (ITT ) Population consists  of all randomized 
subjects who received at least 1 dose (including partial dose) of study drug. All subjects in the 
ITT population will be included in the Full Analysis Set  (FAS ). For analysis, FAS and the ITT 
Population are considered exchangeable, but the term FAS will be used in subsequent sections.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population : The PP Population is defined as a subset of FAS who do not have 
any important protocol deviations impacting their efficacy a ssessments.

Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 67 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  The FAS analyses will be the primary analyses and the PP analyses will be considered as 
supportive.  
The patients in the FAS that are excluded from the PP Population will be listed, together with the 
reason for exclusion from the PP Population.  
7.3.2  Methods of analysis   
Each patient in the FAS will be classified as a responder or non -responder per the response 
criteria, and will be compared between treatment groups using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test  at 
the significance level of 0.05.  The difference in the proportion of responders between groups 
will be calculated with a 95% exact confidence interval  (CI). To assess the hematology 
component of response, the mean of the non -missing Hgb assessments at the Week 23, Week  25, 
and Week  26 analysis visits (treatment assessment endpoint) will be used.  Visit windows will be 
used to assign analysis visits, as detailed in the SAP.  Patients missing all three analysis visits 
will be counted as non -responders.   Sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the impact 
by the missing data, when appropriate.  Details will be specified in the SAP.  
Secondary endpoints , defined as follows, will be tested only when the primary endpoint i s 
statistically significant:  
1. Mean change from baseline in Hgb at the treatment assessment endpoint (mean of values 
at Week 23, 25, and 26)  
2. Mean change from baseline in bilirubin (excluding patients with Gilbert’s Syndrome) at 
the treatment assessment endpoint  
3. Mean change from baseline in QOL, as assessed by the change in FACIT -fatigue scale 
scores at the treatment assessment endpoint  
4. Mean change from baseline in LDH at the treatment assessment endpoint  
5. Incidence of solicited symptomatic anemia at EOT  
The change from baseline variables will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
with baseline as covariate.  A multiple testing procedure will be specified in the SAP to control 
the overall Type I error rate among the secondary endpoints.  
As a sen sitivity analysis, the efficacy analysis will be repeated with patients stratified by 
previous rituximab therapy and/or cytotoxic therapy versus patients who are naïve to rituximab 
therapy and/or cytotoxic therapy using the FAS. 
Other e fficacy assessments will be summarized by overall population using descriptive statistics , 
proportions and graphically where applicable.

7.9 INTERIM ANALYSES   
For the purpose s of regulatory submission, an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data will be 
performed for Part A after all patients have completed Part A.   Parts A and B will have separate 
database locks to enable submission of the BLA/MAA following completion of P art A.   
Additional interim analyses of Part B data may be performed at the Sponsor’s discretion for 
purposes of regulatory filings, publications , or future planning.  
7.10 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDER ATIONS   
Approximately  40 patients with primary CAgD  who do not have a recent history of transfusion 
will be randomized .  
With 40 patients (20 per group), there is 87% power to detect a statistically significant difference 
of 50% between the BIVV009 group and placebo group if the true response rates are 85% and 
35% for the BIVV009 and placebo groups, respectively.  This calculation assumes a 2 -sided 
5%-level test comparing the response rates between the BIVV009 and placebo groups.  A  50% 
improvement over placebo is considered clinically relevant.  
7.11 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING   
Any changes to information in the study  progress notes  and other source documents wil l be 
initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a clinical site  staff member authorized to 
make the change.  Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data and 
clearly entering the correct data ( eg, wrong data right data).  If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written adjacent to the change by the 
clinician.  
Patient  information will be captured and managed by study sites on eCRFs by a  web-based 
electronic data capture  (EDC ) tool developed and supported by CRO and approved by the

Protocol Version 7:  
This is a global amendment to protocol Version 6 and is regarded as substantial amendment 
based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European 
Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
The primary reasons for this amendment to Protocol BIVV009 -04 (Cadenza), Version 7 are:  
• To remove requirements for cardiac resuscitation equipment during home infusion visits 
in countries already identified  for the home infusion sub -study (the US, the Netherlands, 
Norway, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, and Spain) as the risk of occurrence of 
emergency situations during infusions at home has been minimized by authorizing 
enrollment of patients without histo ry of hypersensitivity reactions to study drug, and 
assistance by personnel trained in basic life support will be implemented,  
• To introduce the option of infusion with undiluted solution of BIVV009 in a subset of 
patients in Part B of the study,  
• To clarif y the order of assessments post dose of IMP,  
• To add clarification regarding action taken with the IMP in case of allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions.

Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain), and sites only. 
Qualifying patients who consent for home infusions will 
have study drug infused at their homes at selected 
visits, supported by a healthcare professional 
caregiver.  The primary reasons for this 
amendment to Protocol BIVV009 -
04 (Cade nza) are  
- to provide home infusion facilities 
to the patients (the option of home 
infusions may be beneficial for 
CAgD patients who often are an 
elderly population with other 
comorbidities. This procedure is 
intended to characterize the 
safety and patien t satisfaction 
with the convenience of home 
infusions).  
- to add new exploratory objective 
of immunogenicity,  
- to introduce additional time points 
when samples for ADAs against 
BIVV009 are collected (additional 
ADA samplings will help 
characterize immunogenicity of 
BIVV0009),  
- to specify that predose PD back -
up samples will be used to assess 
immunogenicity in p atients who 
consented to future use of 
samples, - to introduce additional 
time points for SLE panel in Part 
B (As duration of participation in 
Part B is patient -specific, it has 
been specified that surveillance 
with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) serol ogic 
testing will be done every 
6 months),  
- to clarify PK/PD sampling 
schedules for Part -B of the study 
(to fix the inconsistency 
concerning PK and PK sampling 
schedule during Part B between 
Schedule of Study Procedures 
table and body of the protocol)  
- to introduce a correction in

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  Appendix K  COUNTRY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT – HOME INFUSIONS WITH 
BIVV009   
Compared to the global prot ocol, the following country specific  changes are  applicable to the 
US, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, and Spain : 
Synopsis  (Objectives)  
Part B  
Exploratory objective:  
• To describe  the safety and patient satisfaction with the convenience of home infu sions 
with B IVV009 in a subset of patients.  
Synopsis (Test Product(s), Dose, and Mode of Administration)  
Home infusion will be performed at pre -selected countries/sites by a healthcare professional 
caregiver contingent upon completion of training  delivered by the investigator or delegated site 
staff member  only in patients willing to be administered study drug in home, who have been 
treated for at least 3 months (completed visit Day 273) with the stud y drug  BIVV009  in Part B , 
in whom previous on -site infusions were uncomplicated,  and who satisfy the following criteria:  
1. Able to comprehend and give informed consent for participation in the alternate home 
infusion scheme and willing to be infused at home for at least 4 doses, alternating with 
regular office visits.  
2. Treated for at least 3 months in Part B (completed visit Day 273)  
3. No history of hypersensitivity reaction to BIV V009 
4. Considered by the investigator to be a good candidate for home infusions  
5. Not participating in, or have never participated in undiluted  infusion  administration   
Qualifying patients who consent for home infusions will have study drug administered in home 
every other bi -weekly visit alternating with regular office visit with drug infusion. Qualification 
for home infusions and informed consent will be collected no later than at office visit two weeks 
before first planned home infusion.  
For subjects receiving drug injections in home as administered by a healthcar e professional  
durin g the Part B open -label phase, the healthcare profe ssional will collect during home visits 
specific inf ormation  (AEs, concomitant medications, solicited anemia assessment , as well as, 
after the 1st and 4th home infusions, the patient will answer (by fillin g up the form) the Home 
Infusion Patient Satisfaction Survey ) (Appendix L ). The data collected on dedicated paper forms 
will be provided to the Investigator within 24 hours for entry in EDC. The healthcare 
professional will monitor the subject during  infusion lastin g 1-hour or, in certain patients 2-hour 
(eg, patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, with sponsor's approval) and for  2 hours 
after the  first home infusion dose and  1 hour after the completion of each subsequent home  
infusion. Any adverse events  occurring during home visits will be immediately reported by the 
healthcare professional caregiver to the Investigator.

Cadenza Protocol BIVV009 -04 Version 8 Page 104 of 110 
 
Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  First office visit 2 weeks after  first home infusion will include assessments normally planned to 
be performed every 3 months. Neither  blood samples nor urine  or serum  pregnancy tests will be 
performed during home infusion visits; blood tests scheduled to be performed  at 2, or 4 week s 
intervals as well urine  or serum  pregnancy tests in WOCBP (ie , women of child bearing 
potential) will be  performed  during office visits every four weeks while the patient is within the 
home infu sion scheme.  
In case a scheduled home infusion visit happens to coincide  with an  every 3 month  office visit , 
rather than this visit occurring at home,  the patient should attend the office visit  with study drug 
infused at the office site. The  next home infusion visit will then occur 2 weeks later.  
Subse quently, the bi -weekly alternating office visit and home visits with drug infusion s will then  
resume  as previously planned .  
Patients who miss a dose (ie, outside the dosing window or >17 days since last dose, regardless if 
last dose was given at home or at the site) should return to the site for an unscheduled visit to 
receive another loading dose prior to their next scheduled visit which will also take place at the 
office. Such patient may return to the schedule of home visits alternating with regular office 
visits if eligibility criteria for home infusions are still met.  
Patients undergoing home infusions with BIVV0 09 will return to bi -weekly dosing at the study 
site if they experience adverse event that in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize 
patient safety if home infusions are continued. Patients may return to home infusions if this AE 
is considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to BIVV0009 and once resolved or stabilized. 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to study drug will always result in study drug 
discontinuation and withdrawal from the study.  
Infusions given in the home setting versus at  the investigational site will be captured through the 
case report form (CRF) for drug administration .

l   After the 1st and 4th home infusions  
m Post-Day 273 extension phase home visit is alternating with every 4 weeks with site visit and if needed, a loading dose can be inf used at the 
site visit.  
n  HCP records and AEs will be collected on paper forms and will be forwarded to PI within 24h; site will be informed of any AEs  immediately; 
All SAE reporting timelines still apply (ie need to be reported to sponsor safety database within 24 hours of awareness by the home infusion 
healthcare professional).  
Section 2.2 (Background and Study Rationale)  
Patients with CAgD  are often elderly and/or have numerous co -morbidities affecting their 
mobility. Moreover, clinical centers specialized in the management of CAgD  are infrequent and 
may be located far from patients’ home. Consequently , some patients may find the option of 
home infusions with drug against CA gD, beneficial. To this end a group of patients at 
preselected sites/countries will be offered the possibility of home infusions during Part B, 
assisted by trained health care professional.  
Section 2.2.4 (Potential Risks and Benefits)  
Home infusions with the study d rug will be proposed to  a number of patients in countries pre -
selected to participate in home infusion . Home infusions will be assisted by a trained healthcare 
professional , and will concern patients who express  such wish, after having been qualified by the 
Investigator  and no sooner than after Week 39 (Day 2 73) and without evidence of 
hypersensitivity to study drug.  Only patients treated with BIVV009 for the minimum of 
3 months and in whom previous infusions  with BIVV009 were not associated with a 
hypersensitivity reaction are eligible for the home infusion. Additionally, patients who are 
participating in or have ever participated in undiluted infusions are not eligible for home 
infusions. Rescue medications to treat hypersensitivity/allergic reactions as per the PI’s guidance 
will be immediately available during home infusion visits. The home infusion personnel will be 
trained in basic life support (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]) but will not be require d to 
have equipment to perform advanced life support (eg, defibrillators).  
Section 3.5 (Exploratory objective [Part B])  
• To describe  the safety and patient satisfaction with the convenience of home  infusions 
with BIVV009 in a subset of patients  in the US, t he Netherlands, Norway, France, Italy, 
Austria, Germany, and Spain .  
Section 4.1 (Study Design: Part -B) 
A subset of patients from selected sites/countries, who have been treated for a minimum 
3 months (completed visit Day 273) in Part B , and who were deter mined to have tolerated 
BIVV009 well, will be invited to have infusions with BIVV009 performed at their homes , after

Bioverativ USA Inc.  Confidential  having been qualified by the Investigator. Home infusions will be carried out by a trained nurse. 
Patients will follow the alternate home i nfusion scheme, ie , home infusion at the patient’s home 
will be alternating with office visits, so that patients will attend office visit every 4 weeks 
alternating with home infusions every 4 weeks  (+/- 2 days) . 
Section 6.1, Table -3 (Footnote “i”)  
Study drug doses of 6.5 grams (if <75 kg) or 7.5 grams (if ≥75 kg) based on patient’s baseline 
body weight will be administered via IV infusion over ~ 60±5 minutes on Days 0, 7, and every 
14 days thereafter during Part A and every 2 weeks starting at Week 27 during Part B.  Patients 
with underlying cardiopulmonary disease may receive a 2 -hour infusion with Sponsor approval.  
If a patient misses a scheduled dose (outside of the 2 -day window or >17 days since last dose), 
they must return to site (unscheduled visit) to receive another loading dose 1 week prior to the 
next scheduled dose. Qualifying patients at participating sites may have study drug dosed at 
home, alternating with study drug dosed during office visits in Part B.  
Section 6.1.5. 5 (Infusion of the  study drug at  patient’s home)  
Home infusions will be performed at pre -selected countries/sites by a healthcare professional 
caregiver contingent upon completion of training delivered by the Investigator or delegated site

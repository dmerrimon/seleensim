 4.0 BACKGROUN D AND RATIONALE  
Approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed and approximately 610,000 
Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2018 ( American Cancer Society, 2018 ). Despite the 
ongoing improvements in the treatment of solid cancers, disease morbidity remains significantly high 
in the United States (US). Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded only 
by heart disease.  
Treatment guidelines for solid cancers of all stages prominently include surgical removal of the 
primary tumor, as well as at risk or involved lymph nodes, in some cases preceded or followed by 
chemoradiation. Despite the biologic and anatomic differences between these tumor t ypes, t he post -
operative margin status is one of the most important prognostic factors of local tumor control and 
therefore the chance for recurrent disease or tumor metastasis ( Denaro, 2014; Jonkman, 2007 ).  
Surgical excision of solid tumors is a balance between oncologic efficacy and minimization of the 
resection of normal tissue , and thus functional morbidity. This also holds true for lymphadenectomy 
performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, often at the same time as the removal of the 
primary c ancer. The presence or absence of lymph node metastasis is the most important determinant 
of survival for gastrointestinal cancers, breast cancer, and many other solid cancers (Ferlay, 2015; 
Amit, 2014; d'Alessandro, 2015 ). While physical examination or imaging modalities used for staging 
are successful in detecting enlarged or abnormal nodes and help with surgical treatment plans, for  a 
high percentage of patients, lymph node metastasis  is present at a level that is too small to be detected 
by current methods, which leads to under -staging. Because occult nodal metastasis is common, elective 
regional nodal dissection and histological ex amination is standard -of-care (Kim, 2006 ; Milenovic, 
2014; Pedersen, 2015; Thompson, 2013 ) for many solid cancers, especially when locally advanced. 
This leads to overtreatment with significant potential for treatment related morbidities ( Amezaga, 
2007 ).  
While pre -operative imaging modalities such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging, and position emission tomography improve early detection and help with surgical planning, 
intraoperatively surgeons still largely rely on inspection and  palpation to determine surgical margins in 
real-time with limited accuracy  (Alam, 2018 ).  
Optical imaging strategies have rapidly been adapted to image tissues intra -operatively based on 
cellular imaging, native autofluorescence, and Raman scattering ( Dacosta, 2006; Haka, 2006; Mo, 
2009; Schwarz, 2009; Vahrmeijer 2013 ). The potential advantages of optical imaging include real -time 
feedback and the availability of camera systems that provide a wide view of the surgical field ( Gioux, 
2010 ). Despite some succ ess, one of the major limitations of optical imaging strategies is the lack of 
broad tumor applicability in cancer patients.

10.5 Safety Assessments  
10.5.1  Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed from the signing of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) to Day 28 (±48 hours ) in 
Part 1 and to Day 2 8 (±5 days) in Part 2  and Part 3  postdose  through the evaluation of  TEAE s, physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and conventional clinical laboratory data ( CMP and CBC with 
differentials ) according to the schedule of Assessments and Procedures ( Figure 1,

 Table  4/4A, Table   ). Note that the timing provided for postdose  assessments and procedures begins 
after infusion of study drug has been completed (ie, time =0 begins at the end of study drug infusion).  
10.5.2  Adverse Events  
TEAEs will be collected for all patients starting from the start of dosing  and through Day 28 (±48 
hours) in Part 1 and through Day 2 8 (±5 days) in Part 2  and Part 3 . The Investigator will assess all 
TEAEs and SAEs and will record the following information on the appropriate eCRF page:  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution or stabilization  
• Severity  
• Relationshi p to study drug  
• Action taken with study medication  
Medically indicated laboratory tests (emergency or unscheduled tests) should be conducted at the local 
laboratory. The Investigator should employ best medical judgment in determining how to manage  
TEAE s and SAEs. Any questions regarding  TEAE  or SAE management should be directed to the 
Medical Monitor.

10.5.3  Adverse Event Reporting  
The Sponsor has requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to worldwide 
regulatory authorities. Theref ore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately regarding any SAE that 
occurs after informed consent.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Medical Monitor by phone or email within 24 hours of the 
investigational site’s knowledge of the event.  
The study site wil l also transmit a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) to the safety vendor by 
facsimile or email within 24 hours. Contact details will be provided to all sites. An optional initial 
report can be made via telephone, but a completed SAER must still be provid ed within 24 hours of the 
site’s knowledge of the event. The Investigational site will be provided with SAER forms wherein the 
following information is requested.  
• Patient  identification, Investigator name, and site number  
• SAE information: event term, onse t date, severity, and causal relationship  
• The outcomes attributable to the event (eg, death, a life -threatening  TEAE , inpatient 
hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity, or other important medical event[s])  
• A summary of relevant test results, pertinent clinical laboratory data, and any other relevant  
medical history  
• The date of study drug administration  
• Indicate if the study drug was discontinued or the study drug administration schedule modified  
• Supplemental information may include the following hospital records: laboratory results, radiology 
reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, holding and observation notes, 
discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates  
In addition, relevant eCRF  pages should be appended to communicate relevant study drug and patient  
outcome information. The SAER should be faxed or emailed within 24 hours with as much of the 
above information as available at the time. The following minimum in formation is required for 
reporting an SAE: patient  identification, reporting source, and an event or outcome. Supplemental 
information may be transmitted using a follow -up report and should not delay the initial report. The 
Sponsor may contact the investi gational site to solicit additional information or follow up on the event.  
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the ap propriate 
pages of the patient’s eCRF.

10.5.4  Definitions  
10.5.4.1  Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. A  TEAE  (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be a ny 
unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically  meaningful  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about 
causality. A  TEAE  can arise with any use of the drug (eg, o ff-label use, use in combination with 
another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as  TEAE s or SAEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or sympto ms or require medical intervention. However, each laboratory abnormality (eg, 
clinically meaningful changes detected on hematology, CMP ) independent from any underlying 
medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to inte rruption of study 
drug infusion or discontinuation, must be recorded as a  TEAE  or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory 
abnormality is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or 
diagnosis rather than as the individual  laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or 
other abnormal test assessments (eg, ECGs) that are associated with signs or symptoms must be 
recorded as  TEAE s or SAEs if they meet the definition of a  TEAE  (or SAE) as described in Section  
10.5.4.1  (or Section 10.5.4.4 ). 
Conditions resulting from the surgical resection will be considered  TEAE s if they meet the criteria 
described above.  
10.5.4.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any  TEAE  for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the  TEAE . For the purposes of Investigational New Drug  safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable 
possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the  TEAE . 
Suspect ed adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, 
which means any  TEAE  caused by a drug.  
10.5.4.3  Life-Threatening A dverse Event  or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A TEAE  or suspected adverse reaction is con sidered ‘‘life threatening’’ if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or patient  at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include a  TEAE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.

A TEAE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the  Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening  TEAE  (see definition of  TEAE  provided in Section 10.5.4.1 )  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that  may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the d evelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
As the study population consists of oncologic patients, progression of a patient’s pre -existing disease 
will not be considered an SAE. In addition, a n elective hospital admission will not be considered an 
SAE. Conditions resulting from the surgical resecti on will be considered SAEs if the y meet the  criteria 
described above . 
10.5.4.5  Unexpected A dverse Event  or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A TEAE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure o r is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed, or  
• If an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current app lication, as amended  
• If it is not listed in the prescribing information (for marketed products)

Protocol  Amendment 6.0  Confidential  Page 101 of 125 
 For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) 
if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis woul d be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
specificity) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to  TEAE s or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the Investigat or’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.  
10.5.5  Adverse Event Classification  
10.5.5.1  Relationship to I nvestigational Drug  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all  TEAE s (serious and non -serious) 
(Table  11). An Investigator’s c ausality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to a  TEAE .  
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining the 
causal asse ssment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug administration, then an 
alternative explanation should be provided.  
Table 11:  Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug
  
Not related The event is most likely produced by other factors such as the patient ’s 
clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not 
follow a known response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal 
relationship of the event to study drug administration makes a causal relationship unlikely. 
Possibly related The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but is more likely produced by other factors such as the patient's clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs. 
Probably related The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but 
could be explained by other factors such as the patient's clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs. 
Definitely related The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient 's 
clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs.

10.5.5.2  Severity  
All TEAE s will be graded for severity. Adverse events will be graded by the Investigator using a 
numerical score according to the defined National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0 (2017 ). Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI 
CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by the 
NCI CTCAE and as outlined in Table  12. 
The Investigator will use the terms: Mild, Moderate, Severe , Life Threatening, or Death  to describe the 
maximum intensity of the  TEAE . For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as 
follows:  
Table  12:  Guidelines for Severity Assessments  
Grade 1 Mild Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADLa 
Grade 3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADLb 
Grade 4 Life 
threatening Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5 Death Death related to an adverse event 
ADL = activities of daily living  
a. Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
b. Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

 10.5.5.3.1  Serious Adverse Event  Definition Clarifications  
• Death is an outcome of a n AE, and not a n AE in itself  
• All deaths during study drug administration or  occurring within 21 (±1) days after administration 
of study drug, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the patient  is actively receiving study drug at the time 
of the event  
• “Life -threatening” means that the patient  was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, had it occurred with greater 
severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospitalizations are  AEs. If a n AE prolongs hospitalization, it is an 
SAE.  
• “In-patient hospitalization” means the patient  has been formally admitted to a hospital for medical 
reasons, for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation 
and care within an emergency department (although an emergency department visit may define a 
medically important event, which is also considered an SAE).  
• The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and 
other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the  TEAE  or SAE, 
rather than as the individual signs or symptoms.  
10.5.5.4  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Adverse reactions are all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational product related to 
any dose administered. Unexpected adverse reactions are SUSARs if the following 3 conditions are 
met: 
1. The event must be serious ( Section 10.5.5.3 ) 
2. There must be a certain degree of probability that the event is a harmful and an undesirable 
reaction to the medicinal product under investigation, regardless of the administered dose  
3. The adverse reaction m ust be unexpected, that is to say, the nature and severity of the adverse 
reaction are not in agreement with the product information as recorded in  
a. Summary of Product Characteristics for an authorized medicinal product  
b. Investigator’s Brochure  
The sponsor  or sponsor designee will report SUSARs according to details provided in the study’s 
Safety and Medical Management Plan ( or equivalent ). The expedited reporting will occur not later than 
15 days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the adverse reactions.  For fatal or life -threatening 
cases , the term will be maximal 7 days for a preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of 
the report.

Protocol  Amendment 6.0  Confidential  Page 105 of 125 
 10.5.6  Dose -limiting toxicity  
DLT  is defined as any  TEAE  of Grade 2 or greater that is considered by the Investigator to be possibly 
related, probably related, or definitively related to ONM -100 treatment ( Section  10.5.5.1 ) and not to 
surgery, anesthesia, or other study procedures. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  (Sibille 2010 ). TEAEs will be followed closely 
during the study to identify a ny potential DLTs. In Part 1, safety results for each cohort will be 
reviewed by the Internal Safety Review Committee. Escalation to doses higher than those previously 
tested will not occur until the safety of lower doses has been confirmed following revie w by the 
Internal Safety Review Committee.  
10.5.7  Adverse Event Follow -up 
All unresolved  TEAEs (“ongoing” at end of study ) will be followed by the study staff until resolution 
or deemed stable.  
For total bilirubin >1.5×ULN on ≥2 consecutive assessments, assess fr actionated bilirubin. If liver 
function  tests ( ALT, AST, AP, total bilirubin , fractionated bilirubin ) show an abnormal elevation 
(>1.5× ULN ), retest weekly until the values have returned to baseline  or stabilized .  
10.5.8  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There were no  TEAE s of special interest in the Phase 1 study ( Section 4.2.1.3 ).  
10.5.9  Toxicity Management  
The Investigator should employ best medical j udgment in determining how to manage  TEAE s. Any 
questions regarding  TEAE  management should be directed to the Medical Monitor.  
10.5.10  Risks for Women of Child -Bearing Potential or During Pregnancy  
The risks of ONM -100 administration during pregnancy have not been  evaluated. Pregnant and 
lactating females are excluded from this study.  
Male patients and female patients of child -bearing potential (ie , premenopausal women with intact 
reproductive organs and women <2 years after menopause) must agree to and comply with using 
medically acceptable contraception including surgical sterilization (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral tubal lig ation), intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, 
long acting injectable contraceptive, partner’s vasectomy, double -barrier method (condom or 
diaphragm plus spermicide or condom plus diaphragm), or abstinence  during the trial and for 6 months 
thereafter .

Patient s must be instructed to inform the Investigator immediately  if they or their partner become 
pregnant during the study. Female partners of male patients must complete informed consent to allow 
the investigator to follow them for the outcome of the pregnancy.  
In the event of a confirmed pregnancy, the following actions should be taken:  
• Study drug should be discontinued immediately  
• The pregnancy should be reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of notification using the 
applicable Pregnancy Report Form  
• The Investigator should counsel the patient  regarding the possible effects of prior ONM -100 
exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study si te of the outcome of the pregnancy  
• The patient  must be monitored until the immediate postnatal period or until termination of the 
pregnancy. The outcome should be reported to the Medical Monitor using the Pregnancy Outcome 
or Abnormal Pregnancy Outcome for m. 
Pregnancy is not a n AE, in and of itself. However, any pregnancy complication or elective termination 
of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as a n AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is 
always considered an SAE and will be reported as describ ed in the  TEAE  and SAE sections. 
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome poststudy must be reported to the 
Medical Monitor.

 11.5 Safety Analyses  
The safety analyses  will be assessed in the Safety Population.   
Adverse events , vital signs, ECGs, and conventional clinical laboratory data (CMP and CBC with 
differentials)  will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
Version 21.1 . The incidence of TEAEs will be presented by system organ class and preferred term, by 
relationship to study drug, by severity , and by whether or not they resulted in alteration of 
administration of or discontinuation of study drug. A TEAE is defined as a n AE that occurs during or 
after study drug administration and up through 28 days (±48 hours)  in Part 1 or 2 8 days (±5 days) in  
Part 2 after administration of study drug. In addition, the incidence of SAEs and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug will be presented by system organ class, preferred term, and relationship 
to study drug.   
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test results and vital signs, and for changes from Baseline, 
will be presented by time point. Baseline is defined as the measurement closest to, but before , the 
administration of study drug. Incidences of potentially clinically meaningful clinical laboratory results 
and vital signs, determined based on normal ranges and percentage changes from Baseline, will also be 
summarized by time point. The number and percentage of abnormal ECGs will be provided by time 
point.  
11.6 Pharmacokinet ic Analyses  
The PK analyses  will be assessed in the Pharmacokinetic  Population.  
Plasma concentration -time profiles will be constructed for each patient and each dosing cohort. Plasma 
concentration values will be summarized at each time point using mean, s tandard deviation, median, 
and range.  
Summary PK parameters will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, median, and range.

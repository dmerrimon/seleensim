1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Original 28 April 2016
Amendment 1 10 October 2016
Amendment 2 09 March 2018
The purpose of this amendment is to:
● Update Section 5.5.7, Drug Accountability, to remove requirement for onsite 
monitor confirmation of empty boxes, bottles and returned Sharps containers.
Rationale:  Investigative site staff is responsible for drug accountability and 
destruction per their approved process.  Remote monitoring is conducted to 
ensure information documented is consistent with the investigative site's process.
● Update Section 8.0, Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size.
● To update the pre-specified analysis for the continuous endpoints to be 
MMRM.
Rationale:   MMRM was originally planned as a sensitivity analysis for 
continuous endpoints. Given that MMRM is a more robust statistical method 
in terms of missing data handling as compared to ANCOVA using LOCF, it's 
now elevated to be the primary analysis for continuous endpoints. 
● To update the sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint to  be CMH test 
based on Observed Cases (OC).
Rationale:  Originally planned sensitivity analysis was logistic regression. 
This is being changed to a CMH test based on OC because this is a more 
appropriate sensitivity analysis for the response rate difference which is how 
the primary analysis is being reported. 
● To remove pre-specified sensitivity analysis for secondary end points.

4
Rationale:   Pre-specified sensitivity analyses are deemed not to be necessary 
for non-key secondary endpoints. Additional sensitivity analysis for secondary 
endpoints may be performed post-hoc. 
● To remove pre-specified treatment group homogeneity analysis a nd p values 
for demographics and baseline disease characteristics.
Rationale:   Homogeneity analysis and p values for demographics and baseline 
disease characteristics are only meaningful with appropriate sample size 
otherwise a tiny difference which may not be clinically meaningful can have a 
significant p value.  In addition, this is a randomized study, so demographics and baseline characteristics are expected to be similar by the study design.  
Further testing using p values are not needed.  Therefore, descriptive statistics 
is used to demonstrate the similarity for the demographics and baseline characteristics.  Additional analysis on exploring baseline characteristics may 
be performed post hoc.
● To remove formal summary of pre- and post-treatment Adverse Event 
analysis.
Rationale:   Pre- and post-adverse events will be provided in the AE listing. 
● To update the language in the lab change from baseline analysi s.
Rationale: Observed values of vital signs and laboratory variables at each 
visit will be summarized for all treated subjects. In addition, the change from 
baseline for lab variables of interest will be provided. 
● To update the language in Section 8.2Determination of sample size.
Rationale: For added accuracy.
● To make editorial changes throughout for clarity
● The following administrative changes were made:
○ Update Section 1.0, Title Page, to update Sponsor/Emergency contact 
information.
○ Update Section 1.2, Synopsis, to make editorial changes for clarity and to 
align with updates made in Section 8.0, Statistical Methods and 
Determination of Sample Size.
○ Update Section 5.5.2.2, Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs, to clarify 
temperature excursion reporting.

Protocol Title:  A Phase 4 open-label randomized controlled study COmparing the effectiveness of 
adalimumab i NTRO duction and methotrexate dose esca Lation in subjects with Psoriatic Arthritis 
(CONTROL)
Objectives:
Primary ObjectiveThe primary objective is to compare the effectiveness based on the achievement of minimal disease 
activity (MDA) at Week 16 between subjects who had adalimumab i ntroduced and those that had 
methotrexate (MTX) escalated to the highest recommended dose of  20 – 25 mg every week (ew) or 
highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew after inadequate disease control on the initial MTX therapy.
Secondary Objectives
•To compare the effectiveness at Week 16 between subjects who ha d adalimumab introduced 
and those that had MTX escalated to the highest recommended dos e of 20 – 25 mg ew or 
highest tolerable up to 25 mg ew based on the following clinical, functional and quality of life 
measures:
oPsoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS)
oDisease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) score
oPsoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID) score
oAmerican College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR) 
oDisease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)
oPsoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
oHealth Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
oShort Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) scores:  total, physical co mponent summary (PCS) 
and mental component summary (MCS)
oDermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
oLeeds Enthesitis Index (LEI)
oTender dactylitic digit count

Objectives (Continued):  
Exploratory Objectives (Continued)
•To assess the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity of adalimumab with and without 
concomitant MTX.
•To investigate various biomarkers and their associations with treatment responses and outcomes.
Investigators:  Multi-center
Study Sites:  Approximately 60 sites
Study Population:   Approximately 240 adult subjects with active PsA (defined as not in MDA and 
having at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints) despite having b een treated with the first course of MTX at 
the dose of 15 mg ew for ≥ 4 weeks and biologic naive who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in the study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   240 subjects in total, 120 subjects per randomized arm.
Methodology:   This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlle d, parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on adalimumab introduced in 
combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended dose of 20 – 25 mg ew 
or highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled after the initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be op en-label, randomized, controlled, parallel 
group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatment regimens consisting 
of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as ap plicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, 
parallel group.  Subjects will be assigned into the four treatme nt arms based on their MDA status at 
Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option 
based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.
Following a maximum 30-day screening period, subjects meeting th e selection criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and tre ated for 16 weeks in Part 1:
•Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (adalimumab 
40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20 – 25 mg or highest tolerable d ose ew (MTX 20 – 25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew)** MTX will be escalated by increments of 5.0 mg every 2 weeks, s tarting at 20 mg ew as the 
first MTX dose on or after Day 1, depending on the subject's MT X administration schedule 
prior to the study.  In the case of suspected MTX intolerance or toxicity, the MTX dose 
may be de-escalated by 5 mg and the subject may stay on the hig hest tolerable MTX dose 
below 20 – 25 mg ew as described per the protocol.  MTX dose shou ld not exceed 25 mg 
ew in this study.

Methodology (Continued):   
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subj ects will be assigned to one of the 
4 treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial ran domized treatment, and treated for 
additional 16 weeks in Part 2 as follows:
•Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MTX 
15 mg ew, will have MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 and continue receiving adalimumab as monotherapy (adalimumab 40 mg eow),
•Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimu mab 40 mg eow plus MTX 
15 mg ew, will have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combina tion with MTX 15 mg ew 
(adalimumab 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalat ed to 20 – 25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose  (MTX 20 – 25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew),
•Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX esc alated to 20 – 25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew, will receive adalimumab 40 mg eow in  combination with MTX 20 –
25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MT X 20 – 25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-4 of Part 2 of the study will have the optio n of being rescued, starting at Week 24 
and based on the subject not achieving MDA and the Investigator's judgment.  The selection of the rescue treatment regimen will be at the discretion of the Investigator, but should involve adalimumab and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows:
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) have MTX 15 mg ew added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg ew  (Arm 2) have MTX 
escalated to 20 – 25 mg ew,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20 – 25 mg or highest tolerable  dose ew (Arm 3) have 
adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20 – 25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew .

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Ultrasound
•The change in Global OMERACT-EULAR synovitis score (GLOESS) fro m baseline to 
Week 16 in subjects who had adalimumab introduced compared with those who had MTX 
escalated to 20 – 25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew.

the 4 arms of Part 2 of the study.
•The change in OMERACT enthesitis score from Week 16 – 32 in the 4  arms of Part 2 of the 
study.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  For subjects receiving adalimumab, blood samples will be 
collected for determination of adalimumab serum concentrations and the presence of anti-adalimumab 
antibodies (AAA).
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional):  Optional samples may be 
collected to conduct exploratory investigations into known and n ovel biomarkers.  The types of 
biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites.
Safety:  Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs , physical examination, and 
clinical laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination (if required) and laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Effectiveness:   The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed  for the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication.  Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests wil l be conducted at α = 0.05 level (2-sided).  A 
Week 16 database lock is planned when all randomized subjects h ave completed Week 16 (Part 1) of the 
study and statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary  efficacy endpoints will be performed at 
Week 16 between the Part 1 treatment groups.  No multiplicity a djustment will be performed for the 
statistical testing.  
To account for missing data for the binary effectiveness endpoi nts, a non-responder imputation approach 
(NRI) will be used, e.g., subjects who discontinue during Part 1  with missing data will be imputed as a 
non-responder.  For continuous endpoints, the Mixed-effects Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
analysis based on all observed data will be used.

EudraCT 2016-000191-21
13
Statistical Methods (Continued):
Effectiveness (Continued):The response rates for the primary endpoint will be compared be tween the treatment groups using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratifica tion factor, the duration of prior MTX 
use of ≤ 3 months  or > 3 months. The primary analysis will be based on NRI and the sensitivity analysis 
will be based on OC.  
Binary secondary endpoints in Part 1 will be analyzed using a s imilar method as the primary endpoint.  
Change from baseline in continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using MMRM with treatment, 
stratification factor of duration of prior MTX use, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed 
effects, subject as random effect and baseline value as a covar iate.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  Adalimumab serum trough concentrations will be 
summarized by treatment arm at each time point using descriptive statistics including number of subjects, number of non-missing observations (nnmiss), mean, me dian, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation (CV), minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concentrations versus time plots and mean concentration versus time plots by treatment gro up will be provided.  Data listings will 
be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of s ummary statistics and plots, concentration 
values below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero.   In addition, pharmacokinetic model-
based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clea rance (CL/F) and apparent volume of 
distribution (V/F).
AAA will be evaluated for each subject receiving adalimumab and each treatment regimen, and rates of 
AAA positivity will be calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Ultrasound:  For the analysis of ultrasound endpoints in Part 1, similar MMR M model as described for 
the continuous secondary endpoints will be used and baseline weight will be included as an additional covariate in the MMRM model.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be carried out using safety population, which includes all subjects that 
received at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment-emer gent AEs will be summarized and 
reported.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of the study 
medication, and up to within 70 days after the last dose of the  study medication.  All treatment emergent 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulato ry Activities (MedDRA®).  The 
number and percent of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulat ed by system organ class and preferred 
term.  In addition, a summary of AEs by severity and relationsh ip to study drug will be presented.  AEs, 
which are serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to p remature study discontinuation will be 
listed and described in detail.  Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will also be tabulated.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety:Observed values of vital signs and laboratory variables at each visit will be summarized for all treated 
subjects, and change from baseline in selected lab variables will be compared between treatment groups using a one way ANOVA.  The last evaluation prior to the first dose of study drug will be used as 
Baseline for the analyses in Part 1.  For selected parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory 
determination meeting Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) (Version 3 ) of Grade 3 or higher will be 
provided.  Shift tables for changes from Baseline according to the normal range will also be provided for 
laboratory variables.

3.0 Introduction 
3.1 Overview of Disease and its Treatment
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory progressive arthri tis occurring in around 30% 
of patients with psoriasis and an estimated prevalence of 0.1%-0.25% in the general 
population.1-4  PsA entails diverse dermatological, musculoskeletal and extraarticular 
manifestations that often result in impaired physical function,  decreased quality of life and 
work disability.5,6  Almost one third of PsA patients may have evident radiographi c 
damage at their first presentation to the clinic and around 50% may develop erosions within 2 years of the diagnosis.
7  The burden of PsA for the patient and society is 
amplified by frequent comorbidities, in particular cardiovascul ar, resulting in an increased 
and premature mortality.8
Conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( csDMARDs) remain the 
cornerstone of treating PsA in clinical practice, despite their  limited efficacy in reducing 
clinical signs and symptoms and lacking or unproven ability to inhibit radiographic 
progression in this disease9,10  CsDMARDs are also recommended prior to biologic 
DMARDs (bDMARDs) by the international and national PsA manageme nt 
recommendations, unless poor prognostic factors, enthesitis, dactylitis or axial involvement are present.
11-13  In patients that failed csDMARD therapy, bDMARDs have 
demonstrated significant improvements in musculoskeletal and psoriasis outcomes as well as potent inhibition of radiographic progression.
13,14
3.1.1 Methotrexate in Psoriatic Arthritis
The recommended first choice csDMARD in PsA is methotrexate (MT X).11,12  According 
to the clinical practice insights, MTX may be prescribed in up to 90% of PsA patients prior to a biologic agent.
15  However, evidence for the efficacy of MTX in PsA is scant 
and data on the efficacious dose conflicting.
A 6-month double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial (MIP A) with a target MTX 
dose of 15 mg/week did not show a superiority of MTX over place bo in controlling PsA 
Adalimumab

24
arthritis.16  Statistically significant improvements were only observed in patient and 
physician global assessments and mean Psoriasis Area and Severi ty Index (PASI) score, 
but not in the primary outcome of Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), or 
secondary outcomes tender and swollen joint count, composite scores for joint activity 
and improvement, skin improvement, measures of pain and function or laboratory inflammatory markers.
16  The trial has been criticized for several methodological 
drawbacks, including the low MTX dose capped at 15 mg/week.13,14  By contrast, the 
open-label randomized RESPOND study in relatively early, MTX-naive PsA patients that compared infliximab in combination with MTX 15 mg/week with MTX monotherapy at the same dose, showed a better effectiveness of the biologic co mbination, but MTX alone 
provided for high joint and skin responses at Week 16 too.
17  In the recent post-hoc 
analysis within TICOPA, the first Treat-to-Target (T2T) trial i n PsA, 40.8% and 22.4% of 
early PsA subjects achieved a 20% improvement in the American C ollege of 
Rheumatology Criteria (ACR20) and Minimal Disease Activity (MDA ) status, 
respectively, at Week 12 on MTX alone.  Furthermore, 24.7% of s ubjects in the tight 
control arm received only MTX and remained consistently in MDA until the end of the trial at Week 48.  Improvements were also seen in PASI, nail involvement, enthesitis and dactylitis.
18  Still, the majority of PsA patients will likely be insufficiently controlled on 
MTX alone and inhibition of radiographic progression with MTX r emains unproven.9,10
MTX dosing in PsA is mainly based on clinical experience and evidence from trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The recommended target dose is 15-25 mg weekly,
11-13though 
poor tolerance seems to be common at higher MTX doses.19  A vast majority, 91% and 
83% of subjects however reached a MTX dose of at least 20 and 25 mg/week, respectively, by Week 12 in the tight control arm of TICOPA tri al, following an intense 
MTX escalation scheme.  A trend towards better outcomes with the doses higher than 15 mg/week was observed, but the differences were not significant.  The interpretation of this data is however difficult due to confounding present in th e dose escalation.
18
Although the mean MTX dose has increased over the past few decades, it was still16.2 mg/week only in the period between 1994 and 2004 in a Canad ian tertiary clinic.

M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
25
In a more recent large German post-marketing observational stud y, PsA subjects eligible 
for biologic therapy were on a mean of 15.4 mg/week of MTX at e nrolment.15  Likewise, 
the mean MTX dose at baseline in the recent clinical trials wit h new compounds in PsA 
ranged between 15.8-17.5 mg/week.21-23  This implies that in clinical practice PsA patients 
are insufficiently treated for prolonged periods of time with M TX doses lower than the 
recommended target dose.
It is also unclear whether MTX concomitant to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy 
provides an additional benefit in PsA patients that failed MTX.  No difference in the 
efficacy of anti-TNFs with or without MTX was found for peripheral arthritis in randomized controlled trials, though there was some hint that concomitant MTX may decrease the progression of structural damage.  The trials were  however not designed and 
powered to answer this question.  Data from registries suggest that the use of concomitant MTX may prolong drug survival of anti-TNFs, especially monoclon al antibodies, but that 
was not a consistent observation either.
24
3.1.2 Treat-to Target in Psoriatic Arthritis
The T2T recommendations for spondyloarthritis (SpA) suggested r emission, alternatively 
low disease activity, as the ultimate treatment goal.  It has a lso been noted that a 
maximum of 6 months for reaching remission or low disease activ ity seems appropriate, 
but it is advisable to adapt therapy earlier if no significant reduction of disease activity is 
observed within 3 months.25  MDA, which corresponds to the concepts of both remission 
and low disease activity, was suggested as a feasible treatment  target in PsA.25,26
The first T2T trial in SpA TICOPA demonstrated that a T2T approach in comparison with the standard of care improves long-term joint and skin outcomes in subjects with early PsA.
27  Per protocol, the tight control arm mandated treatment escalation every 3 months 
if MDA was not achieved, starting with MTX, increasing it up to 25 mg/week within 3 months, followed by MTX combination with sulphasalazine, befor e an anti-TNF could 
be introduced.  At 48 weeks (end of the trial), 39% of subjects in the tight control arm were on biologics compared with 7% in the standard care arm wit h no pre-defined

26
treatment protocol.27  It may be speculated that the results of T2T could further be  
improved by an earlier anti-TNF introduction.
3.1.3 Adalimumab Overview
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody 
containing only human peptide sequences.  Adalimumab is produce d by recombinant 
DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system.  It consi sts of 1330 amino acids 
and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.  Adalimumab is composed of fully human heavy and light chain variable regions, which co nfer specificity to human 
TNF, and human IgG1 heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences.  Adalimumab binds with high affinity and specificity to soluble TNF-α but not to lymphotoxin-α (TNF-β).
TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses.  Elevated levels of TNF play an important rol e in pathologic 
inflammation.  Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutral izes the biological 
function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF.  After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase  reactants of 
inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sediment ation rate [ESR]) and 
serum cytokines rapidly decrease.
Adalimumab was first approved for the treatment of patients with RA in the United States 
in December 2002 and in the European Union (EU) in September 20 03.  In addition, 
adalimumab is approved for the treatment of patients with early RA, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (2 years of age and older), PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease (adult and pediatric), ulcerative colitis, plaque psori asis (adult), hidradenitis 
suppurativa in the EU, US, and the rest of the world.  Adalimumab is also approved for the treatment of patients with pediatric enthesitis related arthritis (6 years of age and older), pediatric plaque psoriasis (4 years of age and older), and non-radiographic axial 
SpA in the EU and several other countries, as well as for intestinal Behçet's disease in

27
Japan, Argentina, Korea, and Taiwan.  Additional updates regard ing approved indications 
can be found in the current edition of the Humira Investigational Drug Brochure.
The efficacy and safety of adalimumab in PsA was originally dem onstrated in the ADEPT 
trial (Study M02-518), which was a multicountry, 24-week random ized, double-blind, 
placebo controlled trial that compared adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) every other 
week (eow) versus placebo in 313 subjects with moderately to se verely active PsA and 
history of inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammato ry drugs (NSAIDs).  
Significantly better results in subjects treated with adalimumab compared with placebo were seen at Weeks 12 and 24 for joint and skin outcomes, physical function and quality of life.
28,29  Subjects treated with adalimumab also experienced less radiog raphic 
progression, including its components joint space narrowing and joint erosions.28  These 
improvements were sustained through the subsequent 120 weeks of  open-label 
adalimumab therapy.30-32  The results were confirmed in a smaller, 12-week randomized, 
placebo controlled trial conducted in 100 subjects with active, moderate to severe PsA who had failed csDMARD therapy.  Subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg eow had significantly improved joint and skin symptoms, physical functio n and quality of life 
versus placebo at Week 12.  The improvements were sustained dur ing open-label 
adalimumab therapy until Week 24.
33
In a post-hoc analysis of the ADEPT trial, significantly more s ubjects achieved MDA on 
adalimumab than placebo at Week 24:  39% vs. 7%, respectively.34  ADEPT subanalyses 
also indicated that adalimumab monotherapy provides similar results to adalimumab with concurrent MTX.
29,30
No published data are currently available on the efficacy of adalimumab escalated to 40 mg sc every week (ew) in PsA patients that had not achieved s ufficient disease control 
on adalimumab at the standard dose of 40 mg sc eow.

3.2 Rationale for the Study
CsDMARDs are the foundation of PsA treatment, despite their lim ited efficacy in 
reducing clinical signs and symptoms and lacking or unproven ab ility to inhibit 
radiographic progression in this disease.  In subjects that failed csDMARD therapy, 
bDMARDs have demonstrated significant improvement in musculoskeletal and psoriasis outcomes as well as potent inhibition of radiographic progression.
9-14
MTX is the most commonly prescribed csDMARD in PsA, but its rec ommended dosing 
has been extrapolated from clinical trials in RA and the dose-e ffect relationship in PsA is 
unclear.13-15,18  Data suggests that even with intense MTX dose escalation to the target 
dose of 25 mg ew in the context of a clinical trial, the majority of PsA subjects do not achieve adequate disease control on MTX alone.
18,27In clinical practice, PsA patients 
seem to be insufficiently treated for prolonged periods of time with MTX doses lower than the recommended target dose of 20-25 mg ew, and T2T principles are generally not followed.
15,21-23,25,26
Scientific substantiation that an early introduction of bDMARD therapy substantially 
improves long-term outcomes in subjects with PsA is missing.11-13  A recent post-hoc 
analysis of the PRESTA trial provided some evidence by showing that subjects having been treated with etanercept within 2 years of PsA duration exp erienced greater 
improvements in arthritis related scores and patient reported outcomes (PROs) than those with more than 2 years of PsA.
35
Treatment strategy trials are clearly needed to define the best  timing of bDMARD 
introduction, as highlighted in the recent EULAR research agenda for PsA.11
The present Study M14-496 (CONTROL) primarily aims to assess th e effectiveness of 
adalimumab introduction compared with MTX dose escalation to the highest recommended dose of 20-25 mg ew
11,27or the highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew in 
PsA subjects whose disease activity has been insufficiently controlled after an initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  The primary effectiveness outcome w ill be achievement of 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
29
MDA.  A possible impact of the duration of MTX therapy prior to  study enrolment will be 
addressed by stratifying patients at randomization into those h aving been on MTX 15 mg 
ew for 3 months or less and those more than 3 months on MTX 15 mg ew.
Additionally, the maintenance or attainment of MDA on four diff erent potential treatment 
optimization regimens, using adalimumab and/or MTX will be evaluated in the 
second part of the study.  These treatment regimens include adal imumab monotherapy, 
adalimumab escalation to weekly dosing, delayed introduction of adalimumab and continuous treatment with MTX at the highest recommended dose of 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, depending on the treatment regimen and achievement of MDA at the end of the first part of the study.  Such treatment regimens are currently used 
in clinical practice, but lack evidence base.  In subjects not achieving MDA during the 
second part of the study, there will be rescue treatment option  in order to allow for their 
improved outcomes by the end of the study. 
CONTROL is a treatment strategy trial in the T2T context with M DA as the major 
outcome of interest.
3.3 Differences Statement
This is the first study in general aiming to assess the effecti veness of bDMARD 
introduction compared with MTX dose escalation to the highest recommended dose of 20-
25 mg ew
11,27or the highest tolerable dose in PsA subjects who have previous ly been 
treated with MTX.  
3.4 Benefits and Risks
This is a pragmatic study that will address some of the crucial data gaps in the treatment 
of PsA.  Results are expected to inform treatment recommendations and clinical practice.  The main specific benefit will be provision of data on the effectiveness of bDMARD (adalimumab) introduction in combination with MTX compared with  prolonging and 
escalating MTX alone to the highest recommended
11,27or tolerable dose.  The other 
benefits will be insights into the effectiveness of different potential treatment optimization

30
regimens consisting of adalimumab and/or MTX in the maintenance  or attainment of the 
outcomes in the second part of the study.  These treatment regimens are used in clinical 
practice but lack scientific evidence.
Adalimumab has a well-established safety profile in PsA and other approved indications.  
Adalimumab will be administered in this study at the approved dosing regimen for PsA (i.e., 40 mg sc eow).
36,37  The only exception will be subjects not achieving MDA on the 
approved adalimumab dosing in combination with MTX, who will be  required to escalate 
adalimumab to 40 mg sc ew in combination with MTX.  Adalimumab 40 mg ew has been used in ACR20 non-responders in the open-label extension of the ADEPT trial through Week 144 with no increased risk of adverse events (AEs) noted.
30,31  Adalimumab has 
been approved in the EU for weekly dosing in psoriasis patients with inadequate response after 16 weeks of treatment.
36  Adalimumab may be used with or without concomitant 
MTX in PsA according to the label.36,37
MTX is an established immunosuppressive drug and has become the most commonly used csDMARD in inflammatory arthritides over the past decades.   It is labelled for the 
treatment of RA and severe psoriasis across the world, and also  for severe PsA in adults in 
some countries, like the United Kingdom.
38,39  MTX is recommended as the first-choice 
csDMARD by the international PsA management recommendations,11and is also the 
most commonly prescribed csDMARD in PsA.13-15
More than 30,000 subjects participating in hidradenitis suppurativa, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, pediatric enthesitis related arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, psoriasis, pediatric psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-
radiographic axialspondyloarthritis, peripheral spondyloarthrit is, psoriatic arthritis, 
intestinal Behçet's disease, uveitis and ulcerative colitis clinical studies have been treated with adalimumab.
The majority of side effects experienced following administrati on of adalimumab were 
mild to moderate in severity.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (su ch as nasopharyngitis, 
upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, 
haemorrhage, pain or swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pa in.
Serious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira.  TNF-a ntagonists, such as 
Humira affect the immune system and their use may affect the bo dy's defense against 
infection and cancer.  Fatal and life-threatening infections (i ncluding sepsis, opportunistic 
infections and TB), HBV reactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use of Humira.
Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported.  
These include rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, c entral and peripheral 
demyelinating events and reports of lupus, lupus-related condit ions and Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome.
Humira is contraindicated in patients with:
● Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its exci pients;
● Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis,  and opportunistic 
infections;
● Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV).
In its Summary of Product Characteristics, Special warnings and  precautions for use for 
Humira are the following:
● Infections
○ Patients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections.
○ Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections.
● Serious infections
○ Serious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, 
invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or other opportunistic infections such as 
listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in patients 
receiving Humira.

32
● Tuberculosis
○ Tuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has 
been reported in patients receiving Humira.  Reports included cases of 
pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis .
● Other opportunistic infections
○ Opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been 
observed in patients receiving Humira.  These infections have n ot 
consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF antagonists  and this 
resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting  in fatal 
outcomes.
● Hepatitis B reactivation
○ Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving  a TNF-
antagonist including Humira, who are chronic carriers of this virus 
(i.e., surface antigen positive).
● Neurological events
○ TNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances 
with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radi ographic 
evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease includ ing 
multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelina ting disease, 
including Guillain-Barré syndrome.
● Allergic reactions
○ Serious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical 
trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Humira were 
uncommon during clinical trials.  Reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira 
administration.
● Immunosuppression
○ In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with 
Humira, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type 
hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or chang e in 
enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages,  and 
neutrophils.

● Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders
○ In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonis ts, more cases 
of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among pat ients 
receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients.  How ever, the 
occurrence was rare.
● Haematologic reactions
○ Rare reports of pancytopaenia including aplastic anaemia have been 
reported with TNF-antagonists.
○ Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically  
significant cytopoenia (e.g., thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) h ave been 
reported with Humira.
● Vaccinations Patients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except 
for live vaccines.
● Congestive heart failure
○ In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart 
failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure  have been 
observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have als o been 
reported in patients receiving Humira.
● Autoimmune processes
○ Treatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune 
antibodies.  The impact of long term treatment with Humira on the 
development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.
● Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists
○ Concomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic D MARDS 
(e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not 
recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infectio ns, 
including serious infections and other potential pharmacologica l 
interactions.
● Elderly patients
○ The frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subje cts over 
65 years of age (3.6%) was higher than for those under 65 years of age 
(1.4%).
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3

34
○ Some of those had a fatal outcome.  Particular attention regarding the risk 
for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.
● Surgery
○ There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated 
with Humira.
The SmPC states that the long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration 
if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who requires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate act ions should be taken.
The study will be conducted in subjects previously treated with  MTX for PsA at 15 mg 
ew for at least 4 weeks.  Thus, enrolled subjects will have alr eady been exposed to MTX.  
For subjects randomized into the MTX escalation arm, a dose inc rease up to 20-25 mg ew 
will be required, which is the highest recommended dose in PsA
11,27and also approved 
dose for PsA.38  Rapid MTX dose escalation in subjects with PsA up to 25 mg ew  has 
been studied before, though with a different research objective.  The majority, 91% and 83% of patients were able to reach the MTX dose of at least 20 and 25 mg ew, respectively, with no major safety issue.
18,27  Further, in the present study subjects are 
allowed to de-escalate to the highest tolerable MTX dose in the  case of suspected MTX 
toxicity or intolerance.
3.5 Safety Information
Adalimumab therapy has a well-established and well described sa fety profile based on 
extensive postmarketing experience and continued clinical trial patient exposure since the 
first approved indication in 2002 for RA.  Adverse events in th e categories of 
autoimmunity, demyelinating disorders, congestive heart failure , gastrointestinal 
disorders, hematologic events, hepatic events, hypersensitivity, immunosuppression, infections, malignancies, respiratory thoracic disorders, and v ascular disorders have been 
observed with adalimumab therapy.  A detailed discussion of the  pre-clinical toxicology, 
metabolism, pharmacology and safety experience with adalimumab can be found in the 
current Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or prescribin g information.  AbbVie 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
35
is committed to continue to collect safety information includin g those events that may 
occur in this trial in order to confirm this established safety  profile and to identify any 
unknown potential adverse reactions, rare events and those even ts with a long latency.  
AbbVie is participating in an FDA requested, TNF inhibitor class wide exploration of the 
rare appearance of malignancy in subjects who are 30 years of a ge or younger at the time 
of diagnosis.  The risk of malignancy in this age group has not  been established and is 
difficult to study due to its rarity.  AbbVie appreciates your attention to the additional reporting requirements needed in this unlikely event, outlined in Section 6.1.5 under 
Adverse Event Reporting.
The most relevant undesirable effects of MTX therapy are suppre ssion of the 
haematopoietic system and gastrointestinal disorders.  For a de tailed description of the
MTX safety profile, the Investigator should refer to the MTX pr escribing information 
provided.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlled,  parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
37
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on 
adalimumab introduced in combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the 
highest recommended dose of 20-25 mg ew11,27or highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, 
whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled afte r the initial course of MTX 
at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be open-label, randomized, controlled , parallel group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatmen t 
regimens consisting of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as applicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, parallel group.  Subjec ts will be assigned into the 
four treatment arms based on their MDA status at Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.
Eligible male and female subjects with PsA will be selected to participate in the study 
according to the selection criteria.
The study will enroll approximately 240 subjects at approximate ly 60 sites to meet the 
scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in 
alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled. 
Following a screening period of up to 30 days, subjects meeting the selection criteria will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and treated for 16 weeks in Part 1:
● Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15  mg ew 
(ADA 40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
● Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (MTX 
20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew).*
* MTX will be escalated by increments of 5.0 mg every 2 weeks, s tarting at 
20 mg ew as the first MTX dose on or after Day 1, depending on the 
subject's MTX administration schedule prior to the study.  In the case of 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
38
suspected MTX intolerance or toxicity, the MTX dose may be de-e scalated 
by 5 mg and the subject may stay on the highest tolerable MTX d ose below 
20-25 mg ew as described per the protocol (see Section 6.1.7, Toxicity 
Management).  The event of MTX toxicity or intolerance must be clearly 
documented in source documents.  MTX dose should not exceed 25 mg ew 
in this study.
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subjects will be assigned to 
one of the four (4) treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial randomized treatment, and treated for additional 16 weeks in Pa rt 2 as follows:
● Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimumab 40 mg 
eow plus MTX 15 mg ew, will have MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 
and continue receiving adalimumab as monotherapy (ADA 40 mg eow),
● Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimu mab 40 mg 
eow plus MTX 15 mg ew, will have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (ADA 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
● Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalated to 20-
25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose (MTX 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew),
● Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalated to 
20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew, will receive adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (ADA 40 mg eow plus MTX 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-4 of Part 2 of the study will have the optio n of being rescued, starting 
at Week 24 and based on the subject not achieving MDA and the Investigator's judgment.  
The selection of the rescue treatment regimen will be at the di scretion of the Investigator, 
but should involve adalimumab and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows: 
Adalimumab

● Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) hav e MTX 
15 mg ew added,
● Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg ew 
(Arm 2) have MTX escalated to 20-25 mg ew,
● Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20-25 mg or highest tolerabl e dose ew 
(Arm 3) have adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
● Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20-25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew.

MTX will be provided as a study drug for either oral or subcutaneous (sc) administration.  
The route of MTX administration can be selected at the discretion of the Investigator and may be exchanged between oral and sc at any time during the stu dy.
5.1.1 Screening Period
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures, will receive a unique s ubject number via 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system and will undergo t he study procedures 
identified in Section 5.3.1.1 associated with the Screening Visit.  The investigator will 
evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1
and Section 5.2.2 during the period from the Screening Visit through Day 1 prior to 
dosing and record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent process in the subject's medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 30 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.  The screening pe riod may be extended with 
the approval of the AbbVie TA MD for certain circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results, holidays or scheduling/ availability issues).
5.1.1.1 Rescreening
● Subjects that initially screen fail for the study may be permi tted to re-screen 
once. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to  re-screen for 
the study.  All screening procedures with the possible exceptio ns noted below 
will be repeated.
● Re-consent is required if there is a newly approved informed consent since the 
original screening visit or if 60 days have passed.
● If there is one exclusionary laboratory result during screenin g, a re-test of that 
one particular value is allowed without repeating all other laboratory tests 
provided no more than 30 days have passed since the original screening visit.
● If the subject had a complete initial Screening visit including the assessment of 
a PPD test (or equivalent), or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, Chest x-ray (if applicable) and ECG, these tests will not be required to be repeated for the re-screening visit, provided the conditions noted in Section 5.2are met and no 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
41
more than 90 days have passed since the original screening visi t. Note:  If the 
subject initiated TB treatment and the treatment was completed outside the 
30 day screening window, the screening period may be extended wi th the 
approval of the AbbVie TA MD.
The subject must meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of 
enrollment in order to qualify for the study.  As appropriate, sites are encouraged to 
contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) to confirm if subjects should or should not be re-screened.
For subjects who do not meet the study eligibility criteria, th e site personnel must register 
the subject as a screen failure in both IRT and electronic data  capture (EDC) systems.  For 
subjects that re-screen, the Screening number assigned by the I RT at the initial Screening 
visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested.
5.1.2 Treatment Period
5.1.2.1 Part 1 (Randomized Open Label Treatment Period)
At the Baseline visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm 1 or Arm 2 of Part 1  (as described in 
Section 5.1).  During this period of the study, subjects will visit the st udy site at Week 2, 
Week 4 and then monthly through Week 16 (if local requirements ask for additional safety assessments, e.g., due to MTX treatment, respective labo ratory tests should be done 
locally).  A ± 2-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits.  
IRT will be utilized to dispense the appropriate study drug (adalimumab and MTX) to 
subjects for administration during the visit or at the regularly scheduled day for MTX.  Subjects will be given dosing instructions and a dosing diary at  the Baseline visit.
Adalimumab

5.1.2.2 Part 2 (Open-Label Treatment Period)
After completing the randomized-open label treatment period at Week 16, subjects will be 
assigned to Arms 1-4 of Part 2 (as described in Section 5.1), based on the achievement of 
MDA and initial randomized treatment, and treated for additional 16 weeks.  Starting at 
Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option based on not ach ieving MDA and 
investigator's judgment.  During this study period, subjects will visit the study site monthly through Week 32.  A ± 2-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits.  
Subjects will be dispensed study drugs at the Week 16 Visit for  administration during the 
visit or at the regularly scheduled day for MTX.
No study drug will be administered or injected after the final visit (Week 32 Visit).  
Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment at any time durin g study participation.  
Subjects who end study participation early will have a Prematur e Discontinuation (PD) 
Visit and complete the procedures outlined for the PD Visit in Appendix C as soon as 
possible after the last dose of study drug and preferably prior to the administration of any 
new therapies.
Follow-Up Period
Subjects may discontinue their study participation at any time.   Subjects that end study 
participation early will have a PD Visit.  All subjects will hav e a follow-up phone call 
70 days (± a 7 day window) after the last administration of adal imumab to obtain 
information on any new or ongoing AEs.  For subjects taking only MTX, the follow-up 
phone call will occur 70 days (± 7 day window) after the last administration of MTX.

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
5.2.3.1 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication (including over-the-counter or prescription medi cines, vitamins and/or 
herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving within 30 days  prior to screening or 
receives during the study, must be recorded along with the reas on for use, date(s) of 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
50
administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route 
and frequency on the appropriate electronic case report form (e CRF).
All prior drug therapies for PsA since the initial diagnosis must be recorded on the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF along with the dates of first and last dose, dosage/maximum dosage taken, route of administration and reason for use and for discontinuation, if known.  
MTX use for PsA at a stable dose of 15 mg ew (oral or subcutane ous) for ≥ 4 weeks prior 
to Screening is required per the protocol; dates of use, dosage(s), route of 
administration(s) and reason for use should be documented and must be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).
All subjects receiving MTX in this study are recommended to be o n folic or folinic acid 
supplementation with the dose and regimen chosen at the Investigator's discretion.  As per 
general guidance, folic or folinic acid should not be taken on the same day that the MTX is administered, but may be taken all other days in the week, b eginning 24 hours after the 
MTX dose. 
Oral antiemetic agents are permitted to treat transient gastrointestinal tolerability 
problems possibly caused by MTX dose increase.  The selection o f an antiemetic agent 
and duration of antiemetic treatment is at the discretion of the Investigator, but is not advised to exceed 2 weeks.
Concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., sulfasalazine ≤ 2 g/day) must be at  a stable dose for 
≥ 4 weeks before the baseline visit and are to remain stable for the duration of the study.  
If csDMARDs (other than MTX) are discontinued before the study,  this must be done 
≥ 4 weeks before the baseline visit.  Leflunomide must be discont inued at least 4 weeks 
prior to the baseline visit and should not be used during the s tudy.
The use of NSAIDs, including COX 2 inhibitors, paracetamol (up to the maximum 
recommended dose in the local country label), are allowed durin g the study, if subjects are 
receiving stable prescribed doses for ≥ 1 week before the basel ine visit.  In the event of 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
51
tolerability (or other safety) issues, the doses of NSAIDs may be skipped, decreased 
and/or resumed as many times as needed during the study.  If ta king any of the above at 
baseline on an as-needed basis, they should continue to use them  for the same reason and 
same dose each time.  On the days that subjects are scheduled t o be seen in clinic, no 
regularly scheduled NSAIDs should be used within 12 hours of the subject's clinic visit.  
In addition, for subjects participating in the US substudy, no N SAIDs should be used 
within 48 hours of the scheduled US examination.
Narcotics other than tramadol or equivalent opioids and/or non opioid analgesics 
(including codeine), are prohibited except in fixed combination with acetaminophen.  Administration of combined narcotics and acetaminophen and tramadol or equivalent opioids and/or non-opioid analgesics should remain at a stable dose and should not occur 
within 24 hours prior to a study visit with joint assessments.
Concomitant use of oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent) is 
allowed during the study and should be kept at a stable dose fo r ≥ 1 week prior to baseline 
and remain stable throughout the study.  Inhaled corticosteroid s for stable medical 
conditions are allowed.
Doses of all the permitted concomitant medications for PsA must remain stable 
throughout study participation (except as medically required due to an AE (Section 6.1.1.1).
For subjects who require isoniazid (INH) for TB prophylaxis, co nsideration should be 
given to administer pyridoxine (vitamin B
6) to prevent peripheral neuropathy.
During the course of the study, subjects may continue treatment  with medicated shampoos 
that do not contain corticosteroids, bland (without beta or alp ha hydroxy acids) 
emollients, or Class VI or VII low-potency topical corticostero ids on the palms, soles, 
face, inframammary area, and groin only ( Appendix D ).  Application of these topical 
therapies for psoriasis; however, should not occur within 24 hours of a study visit where 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
52
psoriasis assessments are collected so as not to interfere with clinical assessments for 
psoriasis.
In addition for subjects aged ≤ 30 with a reported malignancy adverse event, prior 
exposure to or current use of antineoplastics, or other drugs which have a risk of malignancy as stated in their label and other relevant document s, dosing information to 
estimate total exposure will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages.  At the time of the reported malignancy adverse event, s ites will be ask ed if any of 
the prior and concomitant medications contributed to the event.   Any medications used 
prior to the study will be captured on the appropriate eCRF.  I nformation on the reason for 
use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, highest maintained dose, dosage information including dose, route and frequency, and rea son for stopping the 
medication will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages.
Medications used to treat suspected hypersensitivity reaction o r other post-dose systemic 
reaction will be captured as concomitant therapy.Folic/folinic acid and any other concomitant PsA medications wi ll be received by local 
prescriptions.The AbbVie TA MD identified in Section 6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting should be 
contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or p rior therapies.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing
Contraception Recommendation for Females
If female, subject must be either permanently surgically steril e (bilateral oophorectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal defi ned as:
● Age > 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause.
● Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an  alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 IU/L.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or p ermanently surgically 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required  to practice at least one of the 
following methods of birth control, on Study Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 180 days 
after the last dose of study drug.
● Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contra ception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibitio n of ovulation, 
initiated at least 90 days prior to Study Day 1.
● Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, excluding low-dose oral gestagens 
(mini-pills containing either lynestrenol or norestisteron) initiated at least 
90 days prior to Study Day 1.
● Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
● Bilateral tubal occlusion via hysteroscopy (i.e, Essure), prov ided a 
hysterosalpingogram confirms success of the procedure.
● Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has  received 
medical assessment of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of the 
women of childbearing potential study participant.

56
● True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic  abstinence 
[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation method s] and 
withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence).
Contraception Recommendation for Males
If the male subject has a female partner who is postmenopausal or permanently sterile 
(bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectom y), no contraception is 
required.
If the male subject is sexually active with female partner(s) o f childbearing potential, he 
must agree from Study Day 1 through 180 days after the last dos e of study drug to 
practice contraception with:
● Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the con traceptive 
measures (as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing 
potential).
● True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse-whe n this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  (Note:  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovul ation methods] 
and withdrawal are not acceptable).
Additionally, male subject agrees not to donate sperm from Stud y Day 1 through 180 days 
after the last dose of study drug.
Male subjects are responsible for informing his partner(s) of t he risk of becoming 
pregnant and for reporting any pregnancy to the study doctor.  If a pregnancy occurs, a 
partner authorization form requesting pregnancy outcome information will be requested 
from the pregnant partner.

5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Immunogenicity, Ultrasound and 
Safety Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C .
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
Study procedures are discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of drug 
concentration measurements and antibody measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2 and 
the collection of adverse event (AE) information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study 
data will be recorded in source documents and on the appropriat e eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) approved informe d consent form 
before any study procedures are performed or any medications ar e withheld from the 
subject in order to participate in this study.  Participation i n the pre-specified biomarker 
research analysis is optional, as indicated in the main consent .  A separate consent is 
required from each subject in order to participate in the optional exploratory research/validation studies.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be screened to ensure they meet all inclusion cri teria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at the Screening and Baseline visits.
Medical and Surgical History
A complete non-PsA medical and surgical history, including hist ory of alcohol and 
tobacco use will be obtained from each subject at the Screening visit.  Additionally, a list 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
58
of each subject's specific PsA related medical and surgical history should be recorded at 
Screening.  An updated medical history will be obtained prior t o study drug 
administration at Baseline, to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment, and the medical history will be updated as necessary throughout the stu dy.
A detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure will be documented.  This 
information needs to include Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vac cination, cohabitation 
with individuals who had TB, and/or reside or work in TB endemic locations.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at the design ated study visits as 
specified in Appendix C .  The physical examination at the baseline visit will serve as  the 
baseline physical examination for the entire study.  Physical e xamination abnormalities 
noted by the Investigator at Baseline prior to the first dose o f study drug should be 
recorded in the subject's medical history.  Abnormalities noted  after the Baseline visit and 
first dose of study drug should be evaluated and documented by the Investigator as to 
whether or not these are adverse events.  All findings whether related to an adverse event 
or part of each subject's medical history should be captured on  the appropriate eCRF page.
A symptom-directed physical examination will be performed when necessary.
Confirmation of PsA Diagnosis
The clinical diagnosis of PsA of at least 4-week duration prior to the screening date should be verified at the screening visit against the CASPAR classification criteria (40) outlined below.

CASPAR 
Classification CriteriaTo meet the criteria of the ClASsification of Psoriatic ARthrit is (CASPAR) 
Study Group,* a patient must have inflammatory articular disease (joint, spine, or entheseal) with ≥ 3 points from the following 5 categories:
1. Evidence of current psoriasis, a personal history of psoriasi s, or a family 
history of psoriasis.  Current psoriasis is defined as psoriati c skin or scalp 
disease present today as judged by a rheumatologist or dermatol ogist.
†
A personal history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis that may 
be obtained from a patient, family physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other qualified healthcare provider.  A family history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis in a first- or se cond-degree 
relative according to patient report.
2. Typical psoriatic nail dystrophy including onycholysis, pitti ng, and 
hyperkeratosis observed on current physical examination.
3. A negative test result for the presence of rheumatoid factor by any method 
except latex but preferably by enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay  or 
nephelometry, according to the local laboratory reference range .
4. Either current dactylitis, defined as swelling of an entire d igit, or a history 
of dactylitis recorded by a rheumatologist.  
5. Radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new bone formation, a ppearing as 
ill-defined ossification near joint margins (but excluding osteophyte formation) on plain radiographs of the hand or foot.

Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse 
rate, respiratory rate, body weight, and body temperature will be obtained at each visit, as noted in Appendix C .  Blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate should be performed 
before blood draws are performed.  Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only and weight will be measured at the Screening visit and Week 32 or the premature discontinuation visit (with shoes off).  All measurements will be recorded in metric units 
where applicable.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study  visits as specified in 
Appendix C .  A qualified physician will interpret the clinical significan ce of any abnormal 
finding, sign, and date each ECG.  Any clinically significant f indings will be documented 
in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropr iate eCRF.  Each signed 
original ECG will be monitored by the responsible site monitor and kept with the subject's 
source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at 
Screening will not be required, provided all protocol required documentation is available.  If there are other findings that are clinically significant, the Investigator must contact the AbbVie TA MD before enrolling the subject.
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
Chest X-Ray (CXR)
All subjects will undergo a standard CXR (posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral views) at 
the Screening visit to rule out the presence of TB or other cli nically relevant findings.  
The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous norm al chest x-ray within 
90 days of Screening, provided all protocol required documentati on is available at the site 
(as outlined below) and provided nothing has changed in the sub ject's medical history to 
warrant a repeat test.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the study as warranted based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.A radiologist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Investigator will indicate the 
clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the  report.  In the assessment 
of the chest x-ray, the Investigator or their delegate must ind icate the presence or absence 
of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, a nd (3) signs of active TB.  If 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
61
the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic 
scar, apical or basilar pleural thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Investigator must contact the AbbVie TA MD before enrolling  the subject.
TB Screening
For subjects treated with corticosteroids (equivalent to Prednisone 5 mg or above – with ongoing treatment or treatment within 1 month prior to TB screening), an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test) mu st be performed 
during the Screening Period for all subjects including those with a prior history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) administration.
For subjects NOT treated with corticosteroids (equivalent to Pr ednisone 5 mg or above –
with ongoing treatment or treatment within 1 month prior to TB screening), a PPD skin 
test (alternatively, also known as tuberculin skin test) must b e placed, or an Interferon-
Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or T-SPOT TB test) 
must be performed during the Screening Period for all subjects,  including those with a 
prior history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) administration.If a subject had a negative PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or  IGRA equivalent such 
as T-SPOT TB test) within 90 days prior to Screening, and all pr otocol required 
documentation is available, this test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has 
changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test.  All cases where the Investigator feels a repeat test is not needed must be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD prior to subject enrollment.
For the PPD test:
The subject will be required to have the PPD test read by a lic ensed healthcare 
professional 48 to 72 hours (or according to manufacturer's guide) after 
placement when the induration is maximal.  An induration (not e rythema) of 
5 mm or greater will be considered as PPD positive, irrespective of BCG status or local guidelines.  The induration must be recorded in mm not as positive or 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
62
negative.  The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm," not 
"negative."  (If required by specific countries a two-step test may be performed 
per local guidelines.  The result of the second test should be recorded.  An induration of 5 mm or greater will be considered as PPD positive.)
Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to a PPD skin test in the past should 
not be re-exposed and should not be tested at Screening but will  be considered 
PPD positive.
If there are sites where the accepted testing materials are not available, an 
alternative may be substituted, but the method must be submitte d and approved 
by AbbVie prior to use with study subjects.
If the PPD or the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is positive or the s ubject has a CXR 
indicative of latent TB, the subject will be required to initiate and have taken at least 2 weeks (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer) of an ong oing course of Center for 
Disease Control (CDC) recommended prophylaxis or prophylaxis per local guidelines prior to starting study therapy.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have a documented completion of the CDC 
recommended or local guideline recommended prophylaxis may be p ermitted to enroll.  If 
the subject has a prior history of latent TB, but has not completed or received prophylaxis, prophylaxis must be initiated for at least 2 weeks (or per loca l guidelines, whichever is 
longer) prior to starting study therapy.
If the subject has a prior history of active TB, they must have  documentation of 
completion of CDC recommended or local guideline recommended treatment and 
documentation of resolution of the infection.  In the event both a PPD test and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test are performed, the result of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test will supersede the result of the PPD test.  However, only one test is required.  If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, the site should repe at the test with another

M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
63
blood sample or perform a PPD test.  If the second QuantiFERON- TB Gold test is also 
indeterminate, the subject is considered to be positive and sho uld initiate TB prophylaxis. 
Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured on th e concomitant 
medications page in the eCRF and in the source documents.  Prior therapy should be 
captured in medical history.
Hepatitis B Testing
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) at Screening.  
A positive result for the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) will be exclusionary.  Samples that are negative for HBs Ag will be tested for surface antibodies (HBs Ab) and core antibodies HBc Ab Total).  Subjects with HBs Ag (–), HBs A b (–), and HBc Ab 
Total (+) require PCR qualitative testing for HBV DNA.  Any HBV  DNA PCR result that 
meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary.
Subjects with a negative HBs Ag test and tests showing the results below, do not require 
HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing. 
● HBc Ab Total (–) and HBs Ab (–)
● HBc Ab Total (–) and HBs Ab (+) 
● HBc Ab Total (+) and HBs Ab (+)
Hepatitis C Testing:
Blood samples for Hepatitis C serology will be obtained at the Screening Visit.  A subject 
will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti HCV Ab).
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit  on all female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  At the Baseline Visit, subjects of childbearing potential will have 
a urine pregnancy test performed locally by designated study personnel.  A serum 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
64
pregnancy test will also be taken on Day 1 if the urine pregnan cy test is positive.  If the 
serum result at Day 1 is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.  Investigators 
may conduct more frequent urine pregnancy testing as necessary according to their 
judgment.  If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pre gnancy test will be 
performed by the central laboratory.  A lactating or pregnant f emale will not be eligible 
for participation or continuation in this study.
Starting at baseline, all women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test 
performed locally by designated study personnel at each visit, including at the last dose and PD visit, if applicable (see Appendix C ). 
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be obtained for clinical laborator y tests.  Samples will be 
obtained at the designated study visits as specified in Appendix C .  Samples will be 
obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1.
All Screening laboratory results must be reviewed, signed and d ated by the Investigator 
for review and signature prior to the randomization of a subjec t.  Subjects will not be 
randomized into the study if laboratory or other Screening resu lt abnormalities are 
deemed clinically significant by the Investigator.
When blood draws are performed as part of a clinic visit, the d raws should be performed 
after all clinical assessments and completion of questionnaires and vital sign 
measurements, and before study drug administration.  Urine samp les will be obtained for 
macroscopic urinalysis (dipstick done at the central laboratory  which will include specific 
gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood and nitrites) and  a microscopic urinalysis at 
Screening.  For all other visits that require a urinalysis, the central laboratory will perform a urine dipstick analysis and if the results are abnormal, the central laboratory will perform a microscopic urinalysis.
If required by country regulatory authorities or considered war ranted by the Investigator 
to confirm eligibility, subjects will be tested for antibodies to the Human 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3

Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at Screening and documented that the test has been 
performed.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV inf ection.  AbbVie will not 
receive results from the testing and not be made aware of any p ositive result.
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  The central laboratory chosen for this study  will provide instructions
regarding the collection, processing and shipment of appropriate samples.
The laboratory results will be provided by the central laborato ry to the investigative site 
where they will be reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigat or and filed as source data.  
For any abnormal value outside of the reference range, the Inve stigator will indicate on 
the report if the result is clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  All 
abnormal laboratory test results that are considered clinically  significant by the 
Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.  La boratory abnormalities are 
considered to be adverse events only if they result in disconti nuation from the study, 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Inv estigator considers them to 
be an adverse event.

Tender Joint Count (TJC)
An assessment of 68 joints (TJC68; Appendix E ) will be done for tenderness by pressure 
manipulation on physical examination.  Joint pain/tenderness wi ll be classified as either 
present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
Swollen Joint Count (SJC)
An assessment of 66 joints (SJC66; Appendix E ) will be done by physical examination.  
The joints to be examined for swelling are the same as those examined for tenderness, 
except the hip joints excluded.  Joint swelling will be classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
If possible, the TJC and SJC should be performed by an independent joint assessor who 
should not perform any other study related procedures, as much as possible.  In order to 
minimize variability, the same joint assessor should evaluate a  subject at each visit 
throughout the duration of the trial.  A back-up independent as sessor, who is trained and 
competent in performing such assessments, should be identified.   It is the responsibility of 
the Principal Investigator to ensure all assessors are qualified to perform joint assessments.  If the independent assessor is not available, the  pre-identified back-up 
assessor will perform such assessments.
Dactylitis Assessment
Dactylitis will be assessed as dactylitic digit count and tende r dactylitic digit count. 
Hands and feet bilaterally will be assessed for the presence/ab sence of dactylitis and 
associated tenderness.  The score for each dactylitic count and  tender dactylitic count can 
range 0-20 ( Appendix F ).  The dactylitis assessments will be performed at the visits 
specified in Appendix C .

Enthesitis Assessment
Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI)
The LEI42is an enthesitis measure developed specifically for PsA and assesses the 
presence or absence of tenderness at the following 3 bilateral enthesial sites:  medial 
femoral condyles, lateral epicondyles of the humerus, and Achilles tendon insertions.  
Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 6 sites, for an overall score range of 0-6 ( Appendix G ).  The LEI assessments will be 
performed at the visits specified in Appendix C .
Tenderness at the Plantar Fascia
Tenderness at the plantar fascia as an additional typical PsA enthesitis site
27will be 
assessed as present (1) or absent (0) ( Appendix G ).  The tenderness at the plantar fascia 
assessment will be performed at the visits specified in Appendix C .
Psoriasis Evaluation
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
The PASI provides quantitative assessment of psoriasis lesional  burden based on the 
amount of body surface area involved and degree of severity of erythema, induration, and 
scale, weighted by body part.43,44  A qualified Investigator or designee who has been 
trained by the sponsor/designee, if necessary, will perform the PASI assessment 
(Appendix H ).  The site should make every attempt to have the same qualified 
Investigator or designee perform all PASI assessments on a given subject throughout the study as specified in Appendix C .
Body Surface Area (BSA)
BSA affected by psoriasis will be measured.  The subject's right or left hand will be selected as the measuring device.  For purposes of clinical est imation, the total surface of 
the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% of BSA.

Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID)
PsAID is a validated patient self-reported tool to assess the i mpact of PsA on patient's life.  
Two versions of the questionnaire were developed by an European  League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) initiative:  one for clinical practice (PsAI D-12) and one for 
clinical trials (PsAID-9).  Both contain physical and psycholog ical domains.  The PsAID-
9 version will be used in this study.47
Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
The HAQ-DI is a standardized measure of physical function in arthritis.  The HAQ-DI 
questionnaire contains 20 items divided into 8 domains that measure:  dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and c ommon daily activities.

Musculoskeletal Ultrasound (US) 
Investigators will at study start indicate if they want to participate in the optional US assessments or not.  If they decide to participate, they should , if possible, perform an US 
evaluation for every subject they enroll at visits indicated in  Appendix C .
For the sites participating in the optional US assessment, high -end ultrasound equipment 
is recommended.  The US must be performed by an expert sonographer (rheumatologist or radiologist) with verifiable training and/or certification in ultrasonography, and at least 3 years of regular US experience.  Prior experience in multicent er ultrasound study(ies) is 
recommended, otherwise training will be provided.  The Ultrasonographer must be independent of the clinical Investigator and should be blinded for subject characteristics and treatment arm; he/she should be the same person throughout the study, and a back-up 
with the same qualifications should be appointed.  
The assessments and scoring will be locally performed.  US shou ld be performed the same 
day as the clinical examination, or the day before the visit if  not possible, and prior to 
injecting study medication.  The subjects undergoing US evaluat ion should not take 
NSAIDs for the last 48 hours prior to the US assessment.  (See Section 5.2.3.2 Prohibited 
Therapy).The ultrasound evaluation will comprise a comprehensive assessm ent of joints, entheses 
and tendons. For the joint evaluation, the following 23 pairs of joints will be scanned: 
● Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints 1 to 5, 
● Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints 1 to 5,
● Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints 2 to 5,
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3

72
● Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints 1 to 5,
● Wrist, elbow, knee, ankle (tibiotalar).
The US assessment of synovitis will consist of an evaluation of  hypoechoic synovial 
hyperplasia (SH) using Grayscale (or B mode) and synovial vascu larization using Power 
Doppler (PDUS).  The pre-specified set of 23 paired joints will  be scanned in longitudinal 
and transverse scan from the dorsal aspect with the joint in a neutral position, except for 
the knee, which will also be examined in a flexed position (30° ).
The presence of synovitis (i.e., SH and Power Doppler) will be scored according to the OMERACT-EULAR PDUS composite semi-quantitative scale (0 to 3).
53
For the entheses evaluation, the following 5 pairs of entheses will be scanned:
1. Common extensor tendon insertion at the lateral humeral epico ndyle,
2. Quadriceps tendon insertion at the superior pole of the patel la,
3. Patellar tendon proximal insertion at the inferior pole of the patella,
4. Patellar tendon distal insertion at the tibia tuberosity,5. Achilles tendon insertion at the calcaneus; plantar aponeuroses insertion at the 
calcaneus.
Each evaluated enthesis will be scored in terms of inflammatory (i.e., presence of Doppler 
signal within 2 mm from the cortical bony insertion and hypoechogenicity of the tendon insertion with or without increase of its thickness) and structural lesions (i.e., cortical abnormalities erosions and enthesophytes, and calcifications) according to the OMERACT enthesitis composite semi quantitative scale (0 to 3).
55
Finally, the presence of tenosynovitis will be also recorded.  The following 28 bilateral 
tendons will be assessed for Grayscale and Doppler tenosynoviti s:
● Extensor compartments at the wrist (from 1-6),

tendons.  
Evaluation and scoring will be performed according to the OMERACT definition and 
scoring system.56
Note:  All the specified 46 joints and 10 entheses should be evaluated at every visit indicated in Appendix C .  Only affected tendons will be assessed after Day 1 (Baseline ).  
Standardized evaluation scans and examples of synovitis, enthesitis and tenosynovitis grading for each site examined will be available in an Atlas.
Details of US evaluation are presented in Appendix J .
Dispense Study Drug, Dosing and Compliance
Adalimumab and MTX
Study medication(s), dosing instructions and a dosing diary wil l be dispensed to subjects 
beginning at Baseline (Day 1) and as specified in Appendix C .  Investigators will be 
provided with additional MTX product information from the manufacturer.  The first dose 
of study drug(s) will be administered after all other Baseline (Day 1) procedures are 
completed. 
MTX will be provided for either oral or subcutaneous (sc) admin istration as requested by 
the Investigator.  ADA and sc MTX will be administered to subje cts by study site medical 
staff, by him/herself or by a designee (friend, family member o r health care professional) 
throughout the study.Subjects or a designated family member or friend will be trained to administer study 
medication(s), if needed or considered appropriate, during the first visit or several times.  This training must be documented in the subject's source document.

Subjects or a trained designated family member or friend or a h ealth care professional will 
administer the injections of the study medication(s) in the subject's home or in the clinic 
during the weeks the subjects are not in the office for schedul ed study visits.
For subjects that cannot/will not self-administer study medicat ion(s) or do not have 
adequate support (friend, family member or healthcare professional) at home, administration will occur in the clinic.
On those days that a study visit takes place, study medication is to be administered after 
all clinical assessments including questionnaires, ultrasound evaluation (if applicable) and 
vital sign determination.
Adalimumab should be administered sc at approximately the same time of the day eow or 
ew, as per study protocol (with the exception of office visits) .  At all office visits, subjects 
should be observed after study drug administration until judged clinically stable by the 
study personnel.  Study drug should be administered after all c linical assessments 
including questionnaires and vital sign determination.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of study medication should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  When dosing at home, subjects should be instructed to contact the site immediately w ith any signs or symptoms 
of a reaction.  (See Section 6.1.7 for toxicity management).
MTX should be administered orally or sc at approximately the sa me time of the day ew.  
During the study subjects should continue with their regular MT X administration 
schedule prior to the study enrolment.  If MTX is not routinely taken on the day of the study visit, the MTX will be dispensed to the subject and the s ubject will take the 
medication home and administer it at their regular schedule.  There is no relation between the adalimumab and MTX administration schedule defined per this study protocol, but generally adalimumab and MTX are not recommended to be administ ered on the same 
day.  See Section 5.5.1 Treatments Administered for additional information on MTX 
administration and dose escalation of MTX.

For subjects who deviate from the dosing schedule, every effort should be made to bring 
the subject back to the study Part 1 or 2 dosing schedule as so on as possible.
Subjects will maintain a dosing diary for all study drug admini stered outside of the study 
visit (i.e., at home) to capture dosing dates and times.  The subject must be instructed to return study drug and diaries at each clinic visit for the purpose of compliance assessment and drug accountability as detailed in Section 5.5.7.  At visits specified in Appendix C , 
the site personnel will review and retain a copy of the dosing diary, returned study drug 
kits, and empty study drug packaging to verify compliance.  Add itionally, any discernible 
departure from the protocol rega rding study drug a dministration will be documented 
appropriately.
Randomization and Assignment of Subject Numbers
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study.
Serum Adalimumab Concentrations
Samples will be obtained for serum adalimumab concentrations at the designated study 
visits as indicated in Appendix C and described in more detail under Section 5.3.2 only 
for subjects receiving adalimumab.
Anti-Adalimumab Antibodies (AAA)
Samples will be obtained for AAA at the designated study visits as indicated in 
Appendix C and described in more detail under Section 5.3.2 only for subjects receiving 
adalimumab.Optional Samples for Exploratory Research and Validation Studie s
Subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and validation 
studies.  Subjects may still participate in the main study even if they decide not to participate in this optional exploratory research/validation st udies.  The procedure for 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21

obtaining and documenting informed consent for exploratory rese arch samples is 
discussed in Section 9.3.
Exploratory research can help to improve our understanding of h ow individuals respond 
to drugs and our ability to predict which subjects would benefi t from receiving specific 
therapies.  In addition, exploratory research may help to impro ve our understanding of 
how to diagnose and assess/monitor PsA by assessing association s between disease 
characteristics, outcomes data and biomarkers of interests. Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in-vitro 
diagnostic tests, may be carried out retrospectively in order t o assess associations between 
events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safety events) and ca ndidate biomarkers.
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the exploratory 
research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while re search on adalimumab (or 
drugs of this class) or this disease and related conditions con tinues, but for no longer than 
20 years after study completion.  Instructions for the preparat ion and shipment of the 
samples will be provided in a laboratory manual.  
The following optional samples will be collected at the visits indicated in Appendix C . 
● A single whole blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis will be collected at 
Day 1 or any subsequent visit (if not obtained on Day 1)
● Whole blood for epigenetic analysis
● Whole blood for transcriptomic

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time.  The Investi gator may discontinue 
any subject's participation for any reason, including an advers e event, safety concerns or 
failure to comply with the protocol.
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occur:
● Clinically significant abnormal laboratory result(s) or advers e event(s), as 
determined by the Investigator in consultation with the AbbVie TA MD.
● The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the su bject.
● The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
● Inclusion and exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study drug, when continuation of the study drug would place the  subject at risk 
as determined by the AbbVie TA MD.
● Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the 
study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by the  AbbVie TA 
MD.
● Joint surgery
● The subject becomes pregnant while on study medication.● Subject has known dysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract or m alignancy, except 
for localized non-melanoma skin cancer.  Discontinuation for ca rcinoma 
in-situ of the cervix is at the discretion of the Investigator.
● Subject is diagnosed with lupus like syndrome, multiple sclero sis or 
demyelinating disease.
● Subject is non-compliant with TB prophylaxis.● The subject develops tuberculosis, or any other significant or  opportunistic 
infections.
● Subject is significantly non-compliant with study procedures w hich would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial in consultation with 
the AbbVie TA MD.

If, during the course of study drug administration, the subject prematurely discontinues 
study drug use, the procedures outlined for the PD visit must b e completed within 2 weeks 
of the last dose of study drug, and preferably prior to the ini tiation of another t herapy.  
However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiat ion of any new treatments 
or therapeutic modalities that the Investigator feels are neces sary to treat the subject's 
condition.  Following discontinuation of the study drug, the su bject will be treated in 
accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment.
A final phone call will be made to the subject approximately 70  days (± 7 day window) 
after the last dose of study drug to determine the status of an y ongoing AEs/SAEs or the 
occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs (as described in Section 5.1.2.2 ).  The information will 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last stu dy drug dose and the 
primary reason for premature discontinuation.  The information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.For subjects who are considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a mi nimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation.
Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely will not be repl aced.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its enti rety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, A bbVie will immediately

notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide w ritten instructions for 
study termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered5.5.1.1 Adalimumab
Adalimumab will be administered in this study open-label and at  the standard dosing 
regimen 40 mg sc eow except in one arm of Part 2 as described b elow.
● Subjects randomized to Arm 1/Part 1 or assigned to Arms 1 and 4 of Part 2 at 
Week 16 (as described in Section 5.1and Table 2), will receive adalimumab 
40 mg eow.  Starting at the Baseline (Day 1) visit, subjects wh o are eligible for 
randomization will receive the first dose of study drug:  adali mumab 
40 mg/0.8 mL.
● Subjects assigned to Arm 2/Part 2 (as described in Section 5.1and Table 2), 
will receive adalimumab 40 mg ew beginning at the Week 16 visit .
● Subjects entering the rescue arm at or after Week 24 will have adalimumab 
introduced or escalated at the Investigator's discretion.  For the recommended 
rescue treatment regimens see Section 5.1Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description.
5.5.1.2 Methotrexate
MTX will be administered open-label either orally as tablets or  subcutaneously by pre-
filled pens (sc) as outlined below.
● Subjects randomized to Arm 1/Part 1 will continue at the stable dose of MTX 
15 mg ew (as described in Section 5.1 and Table 3 ). 
● Subjects randomized to Arm 2/Part 1 will increase MTX dose to 20-25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew as described below (see also Section 5.1and 
Table 3).
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
86
● Subjects assigned to Arm 1/Part 2 will discontinue MTX at Week 16 
(Section 5.1and Table 3 ).  MTX should be discontinued immediately and 
completely at the Week 16 Visit (subjects will not taper-off MT X).
● Subjects assigned to Arm 2/Part 2 will continue at the stable dose of MTX 
15 mg ew after the Week 16 visit (see also Section 5.1and Table 3).
● Subjects assigned to Arm 3/Part 2 will continue MTX at 20-25 m g or highest 
tolerable dose ew after the Week 16 Visit (as described in Section 5.1 and 
Table 3).
● Subjects assigned to Arm 4/Part 2 will continue MTX at 20-25 m g or highest 
tolerable dose ew after the Week 16 Visit (as described in Section 5.1 and 
Table 3).
● Subjects entering the rescue arm at or after Week 24 will have  MTX 
introduced or escalated at the Investigator's discretion.  For the recommended 
rescue treatment regimens see Section 5.1Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description.
During the study subjects should remain on their regular MTX ad ministration schedule as 
prior to the study and MTX should be taken on the same day and approximately the same 
time of day ew.
The escalation of MTX dose in Arm 2/Part 1 should be in the increments of 5 mg every 
two weeks until the MTX dose of 20-25 mg ew is reached.27,66,67  The dose escalation 
begins on Day 1, starting with MTX 20 mg ew as the first MTX do se at or after Day 1, as 
applicable according to the MTX administration schedule prior t o study enrolment.  The 
dose of MTX should only be escalated providing there are no clinical and/or laboratory signs of MTX intolerance or toxicity.  
In the case of clinical and/or laboratory signs of MTX intolera nce/toxicity, MTX dose 
may be de-escalated by 5 mg, including during the MTX escalatio n period.
67,68  The 
subject may stay on the highest tolerable MTX dose which is low er than 20-25 mg ew if 
MTX intolerance/toxicity occurred, see Section 6.1.7 for additional information.  MTX 
dose should not exceed 25 mg ew in this study.

87
Change in the route of MTX administration (between oral and sc) is allowed at any time 
as deemed necessary by the Investigator.  Switching from oral t o sc administration may 
improve MTX bioavailability and/or decrease MTX intolerance/tox icity, particularly at 
MTX doses ≥ 20 mg ew.69
The tolerability of oral MTX at doses ≥ 20 mg ew may also be im proved by dividing the 
total dose of MTX into two administrations on the same day, but  not exceeding the total 
daily dose of MTX to be taken in the week.
All subjects receiving MTX in this study are recommended to be on folic or folinic acid 
supplementation with the dose and regimen chosen at the Investigator's discretion (see 
Section 5.2.3.1 Prior and Concomitant Therapy).
There is no required timely relationship between MTX and adalim umab administration 
per this protocol, but in general MTX and adalimumab are not advised to be administered on the same day.

5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
Adalimumab pre-filled syringes are to be stored protected from light at 2° to 8°C/36° to 
46°F.  Study medication drug must not be frozen at any time .  A storage temperature log 
is to be maintained to document proper storage conditions.  The refrigerator temperature 
must be recorded on a temperature log to record proper function .  Malfunctions and
temperature excursions must be reported to the Sponsor immediate ly.  Study medication 
should be quarantined and not dispensed until AbbVie GPRD or AbbVie Temperature Excursion Management System (ATEMS) deems the medication as acc eptable.
MTX tablets must be stored at 15° to 25°C, protected from light .
MTX prefilled pens for injection must be stored at 15° to 25°C,  protected from light and

conditions specified on the label until they are dispensed for subject use or are returned to AbbVie.
Investigational products are for investigational use only and a re to be used only within the 
context of this study.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be centrally randomized using IRT.  Before th e study is initiated, IRT 
directions will be provided to each site.
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by  the IRT at the Screening 
visit.  Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Section 5.2.1 and 
Section 5.2.2 will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adalimumab + MTX  or MTX 
alone on Day 1 (Baseline).  Using IRT, subjects will be first stratified by the duration of 
MTX treatment at 15 mg ew into two strata:  ≤ 3 months and > 3 months.  Then within 
each stratum, the IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
90
treatment group assignment according to the randomization sched ule generated by the 
Statistics Department at AbbVie.
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16, subjects will be assigned to one of the 
four treatment arms of Part 2 (Arms 1-4) as described in Section  5.1for an additional 
16 weeks using IRT.  Additionally, IRT will be used to dispense study medication if a 
subject changes the mode of MTX administration (i.e., oral to sc  or sc to oral) and if 
applicable decreases the dose of MTX (e.g., change from 25 mg sc to 20 mg sc or change from 20 mg sc to 15 mg sc).  The sites will register changes in dose and mode of administration into IRT.
IRT will provide the appropriate medication kit number(s) to dispense to each subject.  
Study drug will be administered at the study visits as summariz ed in Appendix C .  
Returned study medication should not be re-dispensed to any subject.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects should take study medication as outlined in Section 5.5.1 Treatments 
Administered.
If a subject should forget to administer the study medication (adalimumab or MTX) on 
their regularly scheduled dosing date, they should take the for gotten medication as soon as 
they remember the dose was missed up to the day of their next scheduled dose.  The subject should not administer two doses on the same day.
In the event the incorrect dose is taken or a dose is missed, the subject should be 
instructed to contact the site to determine how to proceed with dosing.  The subject must 
record all dosing information for adalimumab and MTX separately  on the Subject-Dosing 
Diary. 
Doses of adalimumab or MTX not administered (e.g., not taken before next dose is 
scheduled), should be recorded as not taken in the source and S ubject-Dosing Diary.  The 
remaining extra study drug should be returned to the study site  full.  For subjects who 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
91
deviate from the dosing schedule, every effort should be made t o bring the subject back to 
their Part 1 or 2 dosing schedule as soon as possible.
5.5.5 Blinding
This study is open-label study.  Blinding is not applicable.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated representatives will dis pense study drugs only for 
use by subjects enrolled in the study
The subject or their qualified designee will administer all dos es of study drug.  
Appropriate site staff will supervise the subject's administration of the study drug at 
required in-office study visits to ensure proper injection tech nique.  In order to document 
compliance with the treatment regimen, the subject will be give n a Subject-Dosing Diary 
for adalimumab and MTX to record all dosing dates and times.  Compliance information will be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Subjects will be c ounseled on missed doses 
of medication and it should be documented in the subjects' source.  If the subject does not return the dosing diary, IP boxes and sharp containers (when applicable), the site should question the subject and obtain as much information as possible  as to the dosing of the 
study drug.
The information should be documented on the source documents as per "best recollection" 
and when possible, re-verified and documented in the source whe n the dosing sheet is 
returned before completing on the applicable eCRF page.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The Investigator or designee will verify that study drug supplies are received intact, at the 
appropriate temperature and in the correct amounts.  For adalimumab, in the US/Puerto Rico adequate temperature is cool to the touch, for non-US sites, temperature recording devices (temptales) are provided in the shipments.  This will be accomplished by documenting the condition of the shipment, verifying the kit numbers in the package 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
92
against the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document included with each drug 
shipment, and documenting this verification by signing and dating the POR or similar document.  The original POR Note or similar document will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an IRT will be used to document investigational product accountability 
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, Kit number(s), date dispensed, subject number and identification of person dispensing the drug .
All empty IP boxes (tablets, pen, prefilled syringes) and the s tatus of each bottle, number 
of tablets remaining in each one returned, will be inventoried by the site.  Each subject 
will be given their own sharps disposal container to store used  adalimumab pre-filled 
syringes and/or methotrexate pre-filled pens, if necessary.  Em pty IP boxes, empty bottles, 
any unused study drug and Sharps containers should be returned by the subject at each 
visit for accountability and compliance purposes and new containers issued as necessary.  Site staff will complete study medication accountability in IRT , using source documents, 
subject dosing diaries, empty IP boxes, bottles and by visually  inspecting the syringes 
and/or pens in the Sharps container whenever possible.  Used Sh arps containers should 
never be opened.  The site monitor will verify drug accountabil ity either at the site or 
during remote monitoring and will complete the reconciliation i n IRT.  The site staff will 
document that the used pre-filled syringes and/or pens have bee n destroyed, using 
appropriate biohazard precautions, when appropriate.  All study  drug unit doses must be 
inventoried, accounted for, and returned to AbbVie or destroyed  per instructions from 
AbbVie and according to local regulations.  For IRT accountabil ity/reconciliation, lost 
status does not apply to empty boxes and bottles not returned.  If a subject returns to a site 
for a visit with proof of taking all doses (verbal and/or dosing diary) the IP is documented as used.  In all cases, comments should be documented in source and IRT (e.g., 'subject lost to follow-up, no medication returned; study drug verified,  subject did not return 
empty boxes').

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multi-country study in 
subjects with PsA consisting of 2 parts:  Part 1 is designed to  compare the achievement of 
MDA between subjects randomized to either adalimumab introduced in combination with 
MTX or MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended or tolerab le dose; Part 2 is to 
compare the maintenance or achievement of MDA between four diff erent treatment 
regimens using adalimumab and/or MTX, with subject allocation based on the initial randomized treatment and achievement of MDA in Part 1.
An open label design was chosen to be able to allow for the subcutaneous and not solely 
oral MTX use.  Although oral MTX is the usual way of using MTX in PsA, some patients may be switched to parenteral MTX in the case of gastrointestin al intolerance or 
insufficient effectiveness in clinical practice.  This is a pra gmatic study, aiming to reflect 
and inform clinical practice.
Subjects eligible for the study are required to have prior MTX therapy at 15 mg ew for at 
least 4 weeks.  The MTX dose of 15 mg ew was selected as the cu rrently recommended 
starting MTX dose.
66,67  Additionally, 15 mg ew or slightly higher is also the average  
MTX dose seen in clinical practice.15,20-23  Four weeks is considered to be the minimum 
period to establish therapeutic effect of MTX.38  The treatment regimens investigated in 
Part 2 of the study are used in clinical practice but lack scie ntific evidence.
MDA was selected as the primary effectiveness variable for the following reasons:  it is a 
composite disease activity measure encompassing all crucial domains of PsA, including 
patient perspective, and has been well validated in PsA; corresponds to the status of remission or low disease activity; has been shown to be associated with long-term patient benefits in terms of less radiographic progression and improvements in PROs, has been recommended as the treatment target in PsA; was shown to be abl e to discriminate 
between active treatment and placebo as well as different treatment regimens (T2T approach and standard of care).

5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
All effectiveness measurements in this study are standard and va lidated.41  All clinical and 
laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
This is a pragmatic study designed to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab introduced 
in combination with MTX compared with MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended
11,27or tolerable dose.
The study will enroll adult male and female subjects with activ e PsA (defined as not in 
MDA and having ≥ 3 tender and ≥ 3 swollen joints) despite treatment with MTX at 15 mg ew for at least 4 weeks who have not been receiving a prior biologic for PsA.  At enrollment, the study subjects will have been treated for a rel atively short period of time 
with 15 mg MTX ew, and will require treatment modification/adjustment due to inadequate disease control.  It is estimated that by not being in MDA and having 
≥ 3 tender and ≥ 3 swollen joints, the subjects will have a sufficient level of PsA disease activity to compare the effectiveness of adalimumab in combinat ion with stable dose of 
MTX and escalated MTX.  The subjects need to be bDMARD naive at enrolment in order to be able to assess the effectiveness of bDMARD introduction.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Adalimumab will be administered in this study at the approved dosing regimen for PsA 
(i.e., 40 mg sc eow).
36,37  The only exception will be subjects not achieving MDA on the 
approved adalimumab dosing in combination with MTX, who will be required to escalate adalimumab to 40 mg sc ew in combination with MTX (Arm 2/Part 2).  Adalimumab 40 mg ew has been used in ACR20 non-responders in the open-label  extension of the 
ADEPT trial up to Week 144 with no increased risk of adverse events.
30,31  Adalimumab 
has been approved in the EU for weekly dosing in psoriasis pati ents with inadequate 
response after 16 weeks of treatment.36  Adalimumab may be used with or without 
concomitant methotrexate in PsA according to the label.36,37

The highest recommended MTX dose of 20-25 mg ew in this study is in line with the 
international recommendations for the management of PsA.11  This dose, along with the 
MTX dose escalation scheme required in this study, has been stu died in subjects with PsA 
before,18,27though with a different research objective.  The dosing of MTX is also in line 
with the MTX prescribing information for PsA.38

Sections 6.1through 6.1.7 .  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2 .
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and lab oratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigat or will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermi ttent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For seri ous adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the 
investigator will provide another cause of the event.  For adver se events to be considered 
intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity .  Adverse events, whether in 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
96
response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported sp ontaneously by the subject 
will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical pr oduct and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An  adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal l aboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a med icinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be rep orted as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are  considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, n ecessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study  will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a  pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the stu dy (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse e vent.

6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively  
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but bas ed 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening , 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
Assessment of adverse event relationship to the study medications(s) will be made with 
respect to adalimumab and MTX.  The investigator will use the f ollowing definitions to 
assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug:
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
99
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal  
relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonab le possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Eve nts assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, another cause of event must be provided by the investigat or for the serious adverse 
event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug adminis tration until 70 days 
following discontinuation of study drug administration have ela psed will be collected, 
whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In addition, serious adverse 
events and protocol-related nonserious adverse events will be c ollected from the time the 
subject signed the study-specific informed consent.  Adverse ev ent information will be 
collected and recorded on the appropriate eCRFs.
Subjects will be contacted 70 days (± 7 day window) following s tudy drug discontinuation 
for an assessment of any new or ongoing AEs.  All SAEs and all ongoing adverse events 
reported during the 70-day follow-up phone call must be capture d in the clinical database.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, and additionally, any n on-serious event of 
malignancy in subjects 30 years of age and younger, whether rel ated to study drug or not, 
the Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being 
made aware of the event by entering the serious adverse event or non-serious event of 
malignancy in subjects 30 years of age and younger data into th e RAVE®electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events and non-serious e vents of malignancy in 
subjects 30 years of age and younger, that occur prior to the s ite having access to the 
RAVE®system or if RAVE®is not operable should be documented on the SAE Non-CRF 
forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of being made aware of the serious adverse event.

The sponsor will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP ) in accordance with 
Directive 2001/20/EC.  The reference document used for SUSAR re porting in the EU 
countries for adalimumab will be the most current version of SmPC (prescribing information).  The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the EU countries for MTX will be the MTX prescribing information provided to the investigator.
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject or a partner of a study subject mu st be reported to AbbVie 
within 1 working day of the site becoming aware of the pregnanc y.  Subjects who become 
pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4).  Pregnancies in study 
subjects and their partners will be collected from the date of the first dose through 
180 days following the last dose of study drug.
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject  or a study subject's 
partner and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.  In the event of pregnancy 
occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any such information.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an AE.  However the medical outcome of 
an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital a nomaly is considered a SAE 
and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
Adalimumab
Subjects who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with adalimumab 
should be monitored closely.  Administration of study injection s should be interrupted if a 
subject develops an infection requiring IV anti-infective treat ment or if an infection meets 
the definition of "serious" (see Section 6.0for definitions).  Study medication may be 
restarted once the physician determines that the infection has been successfully treated.  
Otherwise prohibited concomitant medications may be given if me dically necessary.  
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
103
Prior to use, every attempt should be made to contact the AbbVi e Study Physician for 
direction on re-introduction of adalimumab therapy after prohib ited medication 
administration.
If the subject must undergo elective surgery, the study injecti ons must be interrupted 
2 weeks prior to the surgery.  If the subject must undergo emerg ency surgery, the study 
injections must be interrupted at the time of the surgery.  The injectable study medication 
can recommence at least 2 weeks after surgery once the physician has examined the 
surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection.
Methotrexate
The definition of MTX intolerance and/or toxicity is based on M TX intolerance and 
toxicity as described in the MTX prescribing information provid ed to the investigator.  An 
event of intolerance or toxicity is to be recorded as AE.  The decision for treatment 
adjustment is at the investigator's discretion.
MTX will be escalated by 5.0 mg every 2 weeks.  If MTX intolera nce/toxicity is 
suspected, MTX dose reduction by 5 mg, including during the esc alation period, may be 
performed.  Any subject who cannot tolerate the highest recomme nded dose specified in 
the protocol (20-25 mg ew) due to toxicity or intolerance, is permitted to continue on the 
highest tolerable dose.
Temporary MTX discontinuation followed by re-introduction/re-es calation of MTX is 
allowed if the issue resolves within 4 weeks.  The TA MD must b e consulted if the 
Investigator would like to temporarily discontinue MTX more than one time.If the investigator would like to decrease the MTX dose for any  reasons other than MTX 
intolerance/toxicity, the AbbVie TA MD must be contacted first.

6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical devi ce component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/ broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling 
discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues.
For medical devices, a product complaint also includes all deaths of a subject using the 
device, any illness, injury, or adverse event in the proximity of the device, an adverse event that could be a result of using the device, any event needing medical or surgical intervention including hospitalization while using the device and use errors.
Any information available to help in the determination of causa lity by the device to the 
events outlined directly above should be captured.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported 
to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of  the event via the Product 
Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a 
satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up information is to be re ported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and documented in source as required  by the Sponsor.  Product 
Complaints associated with AEs will be reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition (syringe, pen, etc.).  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be

accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide just ification and an estimated 
date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are require d.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The principal investigator 
is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviat ion occurs (or is identified) 
after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory authorities (as applicable), and the following AbbVie Clinical Contacts:

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1.1 Analysis Population
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed f or the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least 
one dose of study medication.  Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group they were randomized to.  In order to ev aluate the impact of major 
protocol violations on the results of the trial, additional ana lysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint may be conducted on the per protocol population if dee med necessary.  The Per 
Protocol population consists of all ITT subjects who entered th e randomized period of the 
study and did not meet any major protocol violation during the Part 1 of the study.
The safety population consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication.
8.1.2 Statistical and Analytical Plan
Complete and specific details of the final statistical analysis will be described and fully 
documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP wil l be finalized prior to the 
database lock.  The analysis will be performed using SAS (SAS I nstitute Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA).
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be conducte d at α = 0.05 level (2-sided).  
Descriptive statistics will be provided including but not limited to the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and max imum for continuous 
endpoints; and counts and percentages for binary endpoints.  
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
107
A Week 16 database lock is planned when all randomized subjects have completed 
Week 16 (Part 1) of the study.  The Week 16 study results (through Week 16) will be based on this database lock.  Statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed at Week 16 between the Par t 1 treatment groups.  No 
multiplicity adjustment will be performed for the statistical t ests since there is only 
one primary endpoint. 
Data from the subsequent period (Part 2) will be reported at the completion of the study 
by Part 2 treatment groups.  
The last available pre-treatment values recorded on or before D ay 1 (the first dose of 
Part 1) will be considered as the Baseline value for efficacy an alysis.  All subsequent 
study visits will be determined in reference to the baseline. To account for missing data for the binary efficacy endpoints, a non-responder imputation 
approach (NRI) will be used, i.e., subjects who discontinue dur ing Part 1 with missing 
data will be imputed as a non-responder.  For continuous endpoi nts, the Mixed-effects 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis based on all observed data will be used.  The rescued patients' last observation on or before the rescued visit will be included in the 
analysis of Part 2 treatments.  The efficacy and safety after the rescue will be summarized 
separately for the rescued patients.
8.1.3 Analysis of Demographic Data and Baseline Disease 
Characteristics
Demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment groups.  The 
number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum will 
be summarized for continuous variables; Binary endpoints will b e summarized via counts 
and percentages.
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
108
Duration of study treatment will be summarized.  Medical History will be summarized by 
body system and diagnosis.  Prior and concomitant medication wi ll be summarized using 
the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. 
8.1.4 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy
8.1.4.1 Primary Efficacy Variable
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on 
adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MTX 15 mg ew as compared with subjects on MTX alone escalated to 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in response rates between the 
adalimumab + MTX and MTX groups; the alternative hypothesis is that the response rates 
between the treatment groups are different.  The response rates will be tested using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratification factor of the duration of prior (to screening) use of MTX at 15 mg ew.  The stratifica tion factor is defined as the 
duration of prior MTX 15 mg ew use of ≤ 3 months or > 3 months.
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using the same method de scribed above using 
observed cases (OC).
8.1.4.2 Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Variables
A complete list of secondary efficacy endpoints is provided in Section 5.3.3.2.  Binary 
secondary endpoints in Part 1 will be summarized using count an d percentages and will be 
compared between treatment groups using CMH test adjusting for the stratification factor 
of the duration of prior use of MTX.
MDA at Week 32 is a Part 2 endpoint and it will be summarized b y four treatment 
regimens.  No statistical testing will be performed. For the continuous secondary endpoints, the change from baselin e at Week 16 will be 
analyzed using MMRM with treatment, stratification factor of pr ior MTX use, visit, and 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
109
treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as ran dom effect and baseline value 
as a covariate.  The MMRM analysis is based on all observed data.  The LS mean, 95% CI 
and standard error for each randomized treatment group, the LS m ean of the treatment 
difference and its associated 95% CI and p-value from the MMRM model will be 
presented.
8.1.4.3 Other Exploratory Analyses
Analysis for other efficacy endpoints referenced in (Section 5.3.3.3) will be performed 
using similar methods to those described in Section 8.1.4.2.
For ultrasound assessment in Part 1, baseline weight will also be included as additional 
covariate in MMRM.
8.1.5 Statistical Analyses of Safety
Safety analyses will be carried out using safety population, wh ich includes all subjects 
that received at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized and reported.
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of 
the study medication, and up to within 70 days after the last d ose of the study medication.  
All treatment emergent AEs will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary for Drug 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®).  The number and percent of subjects experiencing 
AEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.   In addition, a summary 
of AEs by severity and relationship to study drug will be prese nted.  AEs, which are 
serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to premature s tudy discontinuation will be 
listed and described in detail.  Adverse event of special interest (AESI) will also be 
tabulated. 
Observed values of vital signs and laboratory variables at each visit will be summarized 
for all treated subjects, and change from baseline in selected lab variables will be compared between treatment groups using a one way ANOVA.  The l ast evaluation prior 
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
110
to the first dose of study drug will be used as Baseline for the analyses in Part 1.  For 
selected parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laborat ory determination meeting 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) (Version 3) of Grade 3 or higher  will be provided.  
Shift tables for changes from Baseline according to the normal range will also be provided for laboratory variable.
8.1.6 Subject Disposition and Study Drug Exposure
The number of subjects will be tabulated overall for the following categories:  
randomized, ITT population, completed (e.g., Part 1), and disco ntinued for each treatment 
group and for the total sample as appropriate.  The reasons for  discontinuation will also be 
summarized per CRF categories. 
Treatment compliance will be summarized for adalimumab and MTX respectively for 
Part 1 and Part 2, as appropriate.  Adalimumab compliance will be calculated for each subject as the number of injections actually received divided by the number of injections should have received during the subject's participation in the study (rounded to 0.1%).  MTX compliance will be calculated as the number of tablets/inje ctions actually received 
divided by the number of tablets/injections expected during the  participation in the study.  
Compliance will be summarized for the ITT population. 
8.1.7 Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Analyses
Adalimumab serum trough concentrations will be summarized by treatment arm at each 
time point using descriptive statistics including number of subjects, number of non-missing observations (nnmiss), mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concentrations versus time plots and mean concentration versus time plots by treatmen t group will be provided.  
Data listings will be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of summary statistics and plots, concentration values below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model-based analyses may be  performed with the 
focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F).
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-000191-21
111
AAA will be evaluated for each subject receiving adalimumab and each treatment 
regimen, and rates of AAA positivity will be calculated.  As ap propriate, the effect of 
AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and t reatment emergent 
adverse events may be evaluated.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The study is powered to detect the difference in MDA response r ates at Week 16 between 
adalimumab + MTX 15 mg and MTX escalated dose groups.  Assuming an MDA 
response rate of 40% in the adalimumab + MTX group and 20% in the escalated MTX group, a total sample size of 240 subjects, 120 subjects per arm , will provide at least 90% 
statistical power to detect the difference between the two treatment groups with a significance level of 0.05, allowing approximately 10% dropout.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protoco l, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The I EC/IRB will review the 
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Following local regulation, substantial amendments may also be reviewed and approved 
by the national competent authority.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval pri or to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH  GCP.
Adalimumab
M14-496 Protocol Amendment 3

Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as  dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory 
Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct  of the study, the 
investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH  Expedited Reports, and 
any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IE C/IRB of any changes that 
affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to sub jects.  Written documentation 
of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, In ternational Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guid elines governing clinical 
study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin  in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
9.3 Subject Information and ConsentThe investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the inform ed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who  administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements .  A copy of 
the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior t o any study-related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information r egarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
An informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, must be voluntaril y signed and dated 
before samples are collected for optional exploratory research/ validation studies.  The 
Adalimumab

EudraCT 2016-000191-21
113
nature of the testing should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask 
questions.  The informed consent must be signed before the samples are collected and any testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to provide samples for the optional exploratory research/validation studies, it will not impact their participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from th e study, stored exploratory 
research/validation studies samples will continue to be used fo r research and analysis.  In 
the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for res earch using these samples, 
the subject may request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once AbbVie receives the 
request, remaining exploratory research/validation studies samples will be destroyed.  If 
the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.
10.0 Source Documents and Case Report Form

Appendix H. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
Four anatomic sites – head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities – are assessed 
for erythema, induration and desquamation using a 5-point scale :
● 0 = no symptoms
● 1 = slight
● 2 = moderate
● 3 = marked● 4 = very marked
Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site, the area affected is assigned a 
numerical value:
● 1 = < 10%
● 2 = 10%-29%● 3 = 30%-49%
● 4 = 50%-69%
● 5 = 70%-89%● 6 = 90%-100%
Since the head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities correspond to 
approximately 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of body surface area, respe ctively; the PASI 
score is calculated using the formula:
PASI = 0.1(E
h+ Ih+ D h)Ah+ 0.2(E u+ Iu+ D u)Au+ 0.3(E t+ It + D t)At+ 0.4(E l+ Il+ D l)Al
where E, I, D, and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respective ly, 
and h, u, t, and l denote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, 
respectively.  PASI scores range from 0.0 to 72.0 with the highest score representing 
complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree.  Typically scores of 3 or less

Appendix J. Ultrasound Assessments and Scoring 
For the sites that will be part of the optional ultrasound assessment, Grey Scale (GS) and 
Power-Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) will be performed to all subjec ts included in the study 
at the defined time points of the protocol ( Appendix C ).
PDUS evaluation will be performed at 46 joints, 10 entheses and 28 tendons/tendon synovial compartments (see also Ultrasound evaluation in Section 5.3.1.1 Study 
Procedures).
Joints Evaluation
Twenty-three (23) pairs of joints will be scanned at each time point:
● Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints 1 to 5,
● Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints 1 to 5,
● Distal interphalangeal (DIP) 2 to 5,
● Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints 1 to 5,● Wrist, elbow, knee and ankle (tibiotalar).
The pre specified set of 23 paired joints will be scanned in longitudinal and transverse 
scan from the dorsal aspect with the joint in a neutral position, except for the knee, which will also be examined in a flexed position (30°). 
The US assessment will consist of an evaluation of hypoechoic s ynovial hyperplasia (SH) 
using Grayscale (or B mode) and synovial vascularization using PDUS.  The presence of 
synovitis (i.e., SH and Power Doppler signal) will be scored ac cording to the OMERACT-
EULAR PDUS composite semi-quantitative scale (0 to 3).

Entheses Evaluation
The following 5 entheses will be evaluated bilaterally:
1. Common extensor tendon insertion at the lateral humeral epico ndyle,
2. Quadriceps tendon insertion at the superior pole of the patella,
3. Patellar tendon proximal insertion at the inferior pole of the patella,4. Patellar tendon distal insertion at the tibia tuberosity,5. Achilles tendon insertion and plantar aponeuroses insertion at the calcaneus.
For the enthesis evaluation, US will be initially performed in B mode to detect 
morphologic abnormalities, and subsequently with power Doppler to detect abnormal 
vascularization at bony insertion.  For each enthesis the following elementary lesions will be recorded within 2 mm from the cortical bone, according to the OMERACT definition of enthesitis:
55
● Presence of Doppler signal, 
● Hypoechogenicity of the tendon insertion, 
● Thickening of tendon insertion,● Erosions,
● Enthesophytes,
● Calcifications.
Except for the presence of Doppler signal, each elementary lesi on will be scored binary as 
present or absent.  The presence of Doppler signal will be scored semiquantitative as 0 
(absent) to 3 (severe), according to the following semi-quantit ative grade:
● 0 = absent
● 1 = maximum 3 Doppler spots, 
● 2 = more than 3 and less than 50% of the enthesis area● 3 = more than 50% of the enthesis area

Exploratory Objectives (Continued)
•To assess the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity of adalimumab with and without 
concomitant MTX.
•To investigate various biomarkers and their associations with t reatment responses and 
outcomes.
Investigators:  Multi-center
Study Sites:  Approximately 60 sites
Study Population:   Approximately 240 adult subjects with active PsA (defined as not in MDA and 
having at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints) despite having b een treated with the first course of MTX at 
the dose of 15 mg ew for ≥ 4 weeks and biologic naive who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in the study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   240 subjects in total, 120 subjects per randomized arm.
Methodology:   This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlle d, parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on adalimumab introduced in 
combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended dose of 20-25 mg ew 
or highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled 
after the initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be op en-label, randomized, controlled, parallel 
group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatment regimens consisting 
of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as ap plicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, 
parallel group.  Subjects will be assigned into the four treatm ent arms based on their MDA status at 
Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, t here will be rescue treatment option 
based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.Following a maximum 30-day screening period, subjects meeting t he selection criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and trea ted for 16 weeks in Part 1:
•Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (adalimumab 
40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20-25 mg or highest tolerable d ose ew (MTX 20-25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew)** MTX will be escalated by increments of 5.0 mg every 2 weeks, s tarting at 20 mg ew as the 
first MTX dose on or after Day 1, depending on the subject's MTX administration schedule 
prior to the study.  In the case of suspected MTX intolerance o r toxicity, the MTX dose 
may be de-escalated by 5 mg and the subject may stay on the hig hest tolerable MTX dose 
below 20-25 mg ew as  described per the protocol.  MTX dose should not exceed 25 mg ew 
in this study.

Methodology (Continued):   
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subj ects will be assigned to one of the 
4 treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial randomized treatment, and treated for 
additional 16 weeks in Part 2 as follows:
•Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MTX 
15 mg ew, will have MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 and continue receiving adalimumab as monotherapy (adalimumab 40 mg eow),
•Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimu mab 40 mg eow plus MTX 
15 mg ew, will have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combina tion with MTX 15 mg ew 
(adalimumab 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalat ed to 20-25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose (MTX 20 -25 mg or highest tolerable 
dose ew),
•Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalated to 20-25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew, will receive adalimumab 40 mg eow in  combination with MTX 20-
25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MT X 20-25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-4 of Part 2 of the study will have the optio n of being rescued, starting at Week 24 
and based on the subject not achieving MDA and the Investigator 's judgment.  The selection of the 
rescue treatment regimen will be at the discretion of the Investigator, but should involve adalimumab and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows:
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) have MTX 15 mg ew added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg e w (Arm 2) have MTX 
escalated to 20-25 mg ew,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20-25 mg or highest tolerable  dose ew (Arm 3) have 
adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20-25 mg or highest tolerable 
dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew.

Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  For subjects receiving adalimumab, blood samples will be 
collected for determination of adalimumab serum concentrations and the presence of anti-adalimumab 
antibodies (AAA).
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional):  Optional samples may be 
collected to conduct exploratory investigations into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites.
Safety:  Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, v ital signs, physical examination (if 
required) and laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Effectiveness:   The primary and secondary effectiveness variables will be analyzed for the intent-to-
treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were random ized and received at least one dose of 
study medication.  Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tes ts will be conducted at α = 0.05 level 
(2-sided).  Descriptive statistics will be provided including b ut not limited to the number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for conti nuous variables; and counts and 
percentages for discrete variables.  Statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints will be performed at Week 16 between the Part 1 treat ment groups.  No multiplicity 
adjustment will be performed for the statistical tests.  An interim database lock is planned when all randomized subjects have completed Week 16 (Part 1) of the study.  To account for missing data for the discrete effectiveness endpoints, a non-responder imputation ap proach (NRI) will be used, i.e., subjects 
who discontinue during Part 1 with missing data will be imputed as a non-responder.  The last observation carried forward (LOCF) rule will be used to impute missing continuous effectiveness 
endpoints.  In addition, an analysis using all observed data adjusting for baseline values will be performed as a sensitivity analysis for the effectiveness endpo ints, using mixed-effects model repeated 
measures (MMRM) for continuous variables and logistic random-effect model for binary endpoints.  The rescued patients' last observation on or before the rescued visit will be included in the analysis of Part 2 treatments.  The efficacy and safety after the rescue will be s ummarized separately for the rescued 
patients.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Effectiveness (Continued):The response rates for the primary endpoint will be tested usin g a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test 
adjusting for strata (duration of baseline use of MTX).  Stratu m is defined as the duration of baseline 
MTX use at 15 mg ew ≤ 3 months or > 3 months.  Secondary analys es of the primary endpoint will be 
conducted using all observed cases up to Week 16.  Logistic regression model with stratum, treatment, 
visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as random intercept and baseline as covariate will be employed.
Discrete secondary variables will be summarized using count and percentages and will be compared 
between treatment groups using CMH test.  Continuous secondary variables will be summarized by 
summary statistics (number of subjects, mean, 95% confidence interval, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, minimum, maximum).  Change from Baselin e in the continuous variables will be 
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate for LOCF imputation.  MMRM will be used for observed cases with stratum, treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as  random effect and baseline value as 
covariate.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity:  Adalimumab serum trough concentrations will be 
summarized by treatment arm at each time point using descriptive statistics including number of subjects, number of non-missing observations (nnmiss), mean, me dian, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation (CV), minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concentrations versus time plots and mean concentration versus time plots by treatment gro up will be provided.  Data listings will 
be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of summary statistics and plots, concentration values below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero.   In addition, pharmacokinetic model-
based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F).
AAA will be evaluated for each subject receiving adalimumab and each treatment regimen, and rates of 
AAA positivity will be calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Ultrasound:  Analysis will be performed using similar methods to those described for the primary and 
secondary effectiveness variables.  Baseline weight will also be included as additional covariate in ANCOVA and MMRM.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be carried out using safety population, which includes all subjects that 
received at least one dose of study medication.  Treatment-emer gent, and pre- and post-treatment AEs 
will be summarized and reported.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of the study 
medication, and up to within 70 days after the last dose of the  study medication.  All treatment emergent 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA®).  The 
number and percent of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulat ed by system organ class and preferred 
term.  In addition, a summary of AEs by severity and relationship to study drug will be presented.  AEs, 
which are serious, severe, or life-threatening, which lead to p remature study discontinuation will be 
listed and described in detail.  Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will also be tabulated.

outcomes.
Investigators:  Multi-center
Study Sites:  Approximately 60 sites
Study Population:   Approximately 240 adult subjects with active PsA (defined as n ot in MDA and 
having at least 3 tender and 3 swollen joints) despite having b een treated with the first course of MTX at 
the dose of 15 mg ew for ≥ 4 weeks and biologic naive who meet all the inclusion and none of theexclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in the study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   240 subjects in total, 120 subjects per randomized arm.
Methodology:   This interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlle d, parallel-group, 
multicenter study will be conducted in two (2) parts, each of 1 6-week duration.
Part 1 (Day 1-Week 16) is designed to compare the achievement of MDA on adalimumab int roduced in 
combination with MTX versus MTX alone escalated to the highest recommended dose of 20 – 25 mg ew 
or highest tolerable dose up to 25 mg ew, whatever feasible, in PsA subjects inadequately controlled after the initial course of MTX at 15 mg ew.  Part 1 will be op en-label, randomized, controlled, parallel 
group.
Part 2 (Week 16-32) is to evaluate the effectiveness of four (4) different treatment regimens consisting 
of adalimumab and/or MTX in maintaining or attaining MDA, as ap plicable.  Part 2 will be open-label, 
parallel group.  Subjects will be assigned into the four treatm ent arms based on their MDA status at 
Week 16 and initial randomized treatment.  Starting at Week 24, there will be rescue treatment option 
based on not achieving MDA and investigator's judgment.
Following a maximum 30-day screening period, subjects meeting t he selection criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two (2) arms and tre ated for 16 weeks in Part 1:
•Arm 1/Part 1:  Adalimumab 40 mg eow in combination with MTX 15 mg ew (adalimumab 
40 mg eow + MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 2/Part 1:  MTX escalated to 20 – 25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (MTX 20 – 25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew)** MTX will be escalated by increments of 5.0 mg every 2 weeks, s tarting at 20 mg ew as the 
first MTX dose on or after Day 1, depending on the subject's MTX administration schedule 
prior to the study.  In the case of suspected MTX intolerance or toxicity, the MTX dose may be de-escalated by 5 mg and the subject may stay on the hig hest tolerable MTX dose 
below 20 – 25 mg ew as described per the protocol.  MTX dose should not exceed 25 mg ew in this study.

Methodology (Continued):   
After the assessment of MDA at Week 16 (primary endpoint), subj ects will be assigned to one of the 
4 treatment arms based on the achievement of MDA and initial rand omized treatment, and treated for 
additional 16 weeks in Part 2 as follows:
•Arm 1/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MTX 
15 mg ew, will have MTX completely withdrawn at Week 16 and cont inue receiving 
adalimumab as monotherapy (adalimumab 40 mg eow),
•Arm 2/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on adalimu mab 40 mg eow plus MTX 
15 mg ew, will have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew in combina tion with MTX 15 mg ew 
(adalimumab 40 mg ew plus MTX 15 mg ew),
•Arm 3/Part 2:  Subjects achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalat ed to 20 – 25 mg or 
highest tolerable dose ew, will continue with the same MTX dose  (MTX 20 – 25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew),
•Arm 4/Part 2:  Subjects not achieving MDA at Week 16 on MTX escalated to 20 – 25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew, will receive adalimumab 40 mg eow in  combination with MTX 20 –
25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (adalimumab 40 mg eow plus MT X 20 – 25 mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew).
Subjects in Arms 1-4 of Part 2 of the study will have the optio n of being rescued, starting at Week 24 
and based on the subject not achieving MDA and the Investigator's judgment.  The selection of the rescue treatment regimen will be at the discretion of the Invest igator, but should involve adalimumab 
and/or MTX and should not involve prohibited medications per the protocol.  The recommended rescue treatment regimens are as follows:
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow (Arm 1) have  MTX 15 mg ew added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg ew + MTX 15 mg e w (Arm 2) have MTX 
escalated to 20 – 25 mg ew,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on MTX 20 – 25 mg or highest tolerable dose ew (Arm 3) have adalimumab 40 mg eow added,
•Subjects not achieving MDA on adalimumab 40 mg eow + MTX 20 – 25  mg or highest 
tolerable dose ew (Arm 4) have adalimumab escalated to 40 mg ew .

observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for continuous 
variables; and counts and percentages for discrete variables.  
Statistical comparisons for the primary and secondary effective ness endpoints will be 
performed at Week 16 between the Part 1 treatment groups.  No multiplicity adjustment 
will be performed for the statistical tests. 
An interim database lock is planned when all randomized subject s have completed 
Week 16 (Part 1) of the study.  The 16 week study results (throu gh Week 16) will be 
based on this database lock.  Data from the subsequent period (Part 2) will be reported at the completion of the study 
by Part 2 treatment groups.  
The last available pre-treatment values recorded on or before D ay 1 (the first dose of 
Part 1) will be considered as the Baseline value. All subsequent  study visits will be 
determined in reference to the baseline. To account for missing data for the discrete effectiveness endpoints, a non-responder 
imputation approach (NRI) will be used, i.e., subjects who discontinue during Part 1 with missing data will be imputed as a non-responder.  The last observation carried forward (LOCF) rule will be used to impute missing continuous effective ness endpoints.  That is, 
the subject's last non missing value assessed in the study whil e on study drug will be used 
in the analysis.  In addition, an analysis using all observed d ata adjusting for baseline 
values will be performed as a sensitivity analysis for the effe ctiveness endpoints, using 
mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) for continuous var iables and logistic 
random-effect model for binary endpoints.

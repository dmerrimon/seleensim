15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   1.0 Introduction and Background  
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapy for many 
disorders of lymphohematopoiesis. (Armitage, 1994; Blume, 1993; Bortin & Rimm, 1986; Thomas,  1992; Thomas,  1995) While  allogeneic transplants are often  associated  with lowerrates 
of relapse than autografts or conventional dose treatment, this advantage is partially offset by higher regimen related mortality. (Archimbaud et al., 1994; Attal et al., 1996; Ballester, 1993; Barlogie  et al., 1997; Bensinger  et al., 1996; Björkstrand  et al., 1996; Cassileth  et al., 1992; Cavo, 
Benni, Cirio,  Gozzetti,  & Tura,  1995; Couban, Stewart,  Loach, Panzarella,  & Meharchand, 1997; 
Gahrton, Tura, Ljungman, Blade, Cavo et  al., 1995; Gahrton, Tura,  Ljungman, Blade,  Brandt 
et al., 1995; Mehta et al., 1998; Reece et al., 1995; Samson, 1992; Samson, 1996; Varterasian 
et al., 1997; Vesole et  al., 1996; Zittoun  et al., 1995) Much  of this increase  can be traced  to 
the toxicities  of the conditioning regimen,  GVHD and the immunosuppressive measures required 
for the prevention and/or treatment of GVHD. (Antin & Ferrara, 1992; Brent, 1995; Champlin, 1991; Ferrara & Deeg,  1991; Irschick  et al., 1992; Vogelsang & Hess,  1994) Nowhereis  this more 
apparent  than in published outcomes after HSCT  for multiple  myeloma.  In many  of these trials, 
there is a survival benefit with autologous HSCT over allogeneic  HSCT,  despitea graft versus 
myeloma effect,  on the basis of the toxicity  associated  with the latter procedure.  (Armeson, Hill, 
& Costa, 2013) 
 
For more  than a decade,  it has been  recognized  that long- term disease control after allogeneic 
HSCT  is mediated  through  the anti-tumor  effects of the transplanted  immune  system  and less so 
by the intensity  of the conditioning regimen. This  GVT  effect  can occur  even  inthe absence 
of overt graft versus host disease (GVHD). (Horowitz et al., 1990)  In acute myeloid  leukemia 
(AML)  and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML),  for example, relapse ratesare higher in 
recipients of twin transplants than in GVHD -free recipients of matched sibling grafts. (Gale et 
al., 1994) Moreover, in CML,  many  patients  who relapse after BMT  can be rendered disease free 
through the infusion of additional lymphocytes from the marrow donor without any additional chemoradiotherapy. (Collins  Jr. et al., 1997; Drobyski et al., 1993; Kolb  et al., 1995; Mackinnon 
et al., 1995; Porter, Roth, McGarigle, Ferrara, & Antin, 1994) 
 
1.1
 Development  of Less Intensive  Conditioning  Regimens  
Based on this recognition that long term disease control is mediated through the transplanted immune system, HSCT regimens that are not lethally myeloablative (NM HSCT) have been developed over the last decade. These approaches do not use dose intensity to eradicate malignancy. Rather they use immunosuppressive agents, irrespective of their anti -neoplastic 
properties, to facilitate  donor lymphoid and stem  cell engraftment. The donor lymphoid elements 
then destroy the residual normal and in some cases malignant lymphohematopoietic elements allowing  the transition to donor chimerism. These regimens rely  less heavily  on the conditioning 
regimen  for disease control by exploiting the GVT  effects of the donor immune system.  They  are 
associated with less treatment -related mortality (Hamadani, Awan, & Copelan, 2008) and have 
allowed older and heavily pretreated patients who otherwise would not tolerate the rigors of a fully myeloablative HSCT, to undergo transplant successfully. (Kroger & Mesa, 2008) Nonmyeloablative HSCT has been dramatically effective in CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),  and follicular lymphoma in its original application and may have utility  in other 
diseases as well. (Giralt et al., 1996; Giralt et al., 1997; Khouri et al., 1998; Slavin et al., 1996) 
7 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   1.2 Ablative  versus Non-Myeloablative HSCT  
Despite the demonstration of successful outcomes after NM HSCT, this type of therapy is not 
universally  successful.  This is because  in order to optimize  the graft  versus tumor (GVT)  effects 
of the transplanted donor immune system, malignant cells should be controlled to a degree that they do not outgrow the graft. The “permissible” disease burden at the time of HSCT varies by the kinetics  of the specific malig nancy and to some  extent, the dose intensity  of the conditioning 
regimen which reduces the malignant burden. Many studies contrasting the outcomes between ablative and non-ablative conditioning show that the superior results for NM HSCT in terms of treatme nt related  mortality  are offset  by higher rates of relapse.  (Aoudjhane et al., 2005; Martino 
et al., 2006; Vela- Ojeda et al., 2004) This issue becomes particularly important in diseases not 
known to have a strong GVT effect such as acute lymphocytic leukem ia (ALL) (Fielding & 
Goldstone, 2008; Stein & Forman, 2008) and certain lymphoma subtypes, (Armand et al., 2008; Corradini et al., 2007; Smith, 2006) where dose intensity may be just as important as a GVT effect in terms of overall survival. Many of the non- myeloablative regimens are minimally 
myelosuppressive, while others are more immunosuppressive and are associated with prompter engraftment of donor cells than their less intensive counterparts. The former approach has been associated with less TRM but  with incomplete initial chimerism and increased rates of relapse. 
(Couriel et al., 2004; Martino et al., 2006; Slavin et al., 1998) The latter approach, alternately 
referred to as “reduced intensity” (RIC) HSCT, has been associated with more TRM but less 
relapse. (Anderlini et al., 2005; de Lima et al., 2004) A NM HSCT approach that is not an “either/or” proposition has not been clearly identified.  
 
Based  on the typically  more  aggressive diagnoses of  the population presenting for treatment  to 
the Thomas  Jefferson  University  (TJU)  Blood and  Marrow  Transplant,  RIC as  opposed to  NM 
approaches have been developed in recent years at our institution.  
 
1.3 The TJU 2- Step Approach  
Since 2006, investigators in the TJU Blood and Marrow Transplant Program have opened thre e 
(IRB # 06U.328, 11D.247, and 12D.501) 2- step haploidentical RIC HSCT clinical trials using 
cyclophosphamide (CY) as a tolerization agent. The initial trial completed accrual in 2010; the later trials are  still accruing  patients. The  basic 2 -step approach  for both myeloablative  (MA) and 
RIC HSCT is comprised of a chemoradiotherapy conditioning backbone which is followed by an infusion of donor lymphocytes (DLI) containing 2 x 108/kg T cells. The DLI results in a haploimmunostorm characterized by high fevers and in some cases, rash and diarrhea. During this time period, it is theorized that the activation of the donor lymphocytes results in GVT effects. This is based on literature documenting disease responses in the non -HSCT setting using 
a comparable dose of lymphocytes. (Colvin et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2012) The haploimmunostorm also results in the activation of the most alloreactive donor and host T cells. Two days after the DLI, CY is administered to eradicate these most reactive T cells establishing bidirectional tolerance  and leaving behind a subset  of less alloreactive  T cells to form the basis of 
post HSCT lymphoid immunity. One day after the completion of CY, a CD 34 selected stem cell 
product is infused to restore hematopoiesis. In patients wi th controlled disease at the time of 
HSCT,  overall survival rates (2-8 years of follow-up) have been  75% in the MA setting.  (Grosso, 
Carabasi et al., 2011; Grosso et al., 2014) In terms of the 2 step RIC approaches, OS to date has also been high in fit pat ients with controlled disease at HSCT. However, in subgroups of patients 
who are older, are less physically fit, or who have multiple associated comorbidities, rates of  
8 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   non-relapse mortality  (NRM)  have been greater  than acceptable,  resulting  in decreased  overall 
survival (OS). (Gaballa, Alpdogan, Carabasi, Filicko- O'Hara, Kasner, Martinez et al., 2014a; 
Grosso et al., 2010; Palmisiano et al., 2014) 
 
Thirty -four patients were treated on the completed initial 2 step RIC trial (IRB # 06U.328). 
Diagnoses were  AML  (17), MPD  (1), MDS  (3), B cell ALL  (3), CLL  (3), Myeloma (2), Aplastic 
Anemia (1), DLCL (1), NHL (2), and CMML (1). Median age was 67 years old at the time of 
treatment. The patients are now a median of 76 (range 51 to 89 months) post HSCT with an OS of almost 50% at 12 months and 35% at the median follow- up time. Of the patients that died 
after being treated on the initial RIC trial, 50% died of relapse causes and 50% died of non- relapse causes. This is profoundly different from the MA 2 step trials in which relapsed disease is the primary cause of mortality and death from non- relapse causes is low.  
 
Analysis of this initial trial revealed that multiple comorbidities were associated with decreased OS. While organ function guidelines were part of the eligibility criteria for this trial (as was typical for transplant  protocols at the time of the initiation  almost  10 years ago), the sum of all of 
all of the comorbidities that each patient may have possessed were not accounted for. For example,  patients  could  minimally  meet  organ criteria  across 2-3 systems and still be eligible  for 
HSCT despite having cumulative comorbidities which would have predicted increased risk of toxicity. Conversely, gentler NM approaches to haploidentical HSCT have not been associated with high OS rates either. For example, the Hopkins group, with one of the largest experiences with haploidentical HSCT  in the United  States,  reported  a 1 year  OS in younger patients  (median 
age 46 years) undergoing NM haploidentic al HSCT  using post transplantation  CY of 46% (event 
free survival at 1 year was only  34%) (Luznik et al., 2008) with mortality from recurrent disease 
the primary cause of treatment failure. Therefore, OS after RIC and NM haploidentical HSCT has been low, with causes of mortality  varying with the intensity  of the conditioning regimen. 
 
To help increase the safety  of HSCT at TJUH, a widely  tested comorbidity index developed by 
Mohamed Sorror, the HCT-CI, (Sorror et al., 2005) was used in subsequent trials for risk assessment. Outcomes stratified by comorbidity points using this tool were first published in 2005, with further testing  and widespread  use occurring a few years after the initial publication. 
 
We retrospectively  analyzed  the outcomes of the 34 patients treated  on the initial RIC 2 step trial 
and as seen below, the number of comorbidity points is also correlated with outcomes in this older population treated at our institution.  
9 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022    
 
The other primary predictor of outcomes after HSCT is age at the time of the procedure. 
Accounting for age in association with the HCT- CI strengthens the predictability of OS 
probability of the HCT-CI. This has been demonstrated by Dr. Sorror and colleagues in a 
multivariate  analysis of over 3000 patients undergoing HLA matched  donor HSCT.  (Sorror  et al., 
2014) In this analysis, 1 comorbidity point for age ≥ 40 was added to the HCT -CI scores for the 
patients analyzed. OS at 1 year for patients undergoing intensive regimens with HCT- CI scores 
of 3 and 4 (2 or 3 points plus  age >40 years)  resulted  in an OS of approximately 60% and 50% at 
12 and 24 months respectively, and for scores of 5 (4 points plus age >40 years) of OS of 40% 
and 30% at 12 and 24 months respectively. 
 
Dr. Neil Palmisiano, as part of his gradu ate work in the Jefferson School of Pharmacology, 
performed a survival analysis based  on the combination of age and HSCT  of patients  undergoing 
HSCT on the TJU 2 step  trials to date. All of the trials use intensive conditioning regimens. The 
patients analyzed included those treated on both the first and 2nd generation 2- step RIC trials.  
Consistent  with the Sorror et al. findings, Dr. Palmisiano  found that patients with HCT -CI scores 
of 0-2 did well in terms of OS regardless of age, but comorbidity scor es of >2 were not as well 
tolerated in older patients (> 40 years -Sorror; > 60 years Palmisiano) with increasing detriment 
correlating with increasing comorbidity score.  

10 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   From  Palmisiano:  
 
 
As shown in the table above, patients greater  than a ge 60 years with HCT -CI scores of > 2 have 
a 1 year OS of approximately 45%, decreasing to about 30% at 2 years. While these outcomes 
are similar to Dr. Sorror’s  data based  on HCT -CI score alone, we note that 87% of patients in the 
Sorror et al. analysis were < age 60, while the median age of the population in the initial 2 step RIC trial was 67 years. This highlights the fact that at TJUH, the cut -off age for the same 
outcomes based on the HCT -CI is higher. Other analyses support the age of 60 years or gr eater 
as a point of increasing  vulnerability  in the 2 step population. Dr. Sameh Gaballa et al.(Gaballa, 
Alpdogan, Carabasi, Filicko -O'Hara, Kasner, Martinez et al., 2014b) performed a multivariate 
analysis of factors influencing outcomes after  the TJUH 2 step approach in older patients. 
In addition, an internal analysis of all patients treated to date on the 2 step trials (n=163), show the beginning of a decreasing probability of OS at age 60 years, further supporting that demarcation  as significant in the  2 step trials (Grosso, institutional data).  
 
1.4 Addressing  the Needs of a Growing  Population  
In 2011, a second generation  2-step RIC trial for patients  with good risk disease was opened 
at TJUH. Good risk was defined as having leukemia in remission or an indolent lymphoma  such 
as CLL or follicular lymphoma in which GVT effects were stronger and the incidence of post  
HSCT  relapse was lower  based  on these more  indolent diagnoses. The twenty -three  patients 
treated on this trial to date have a median age of 56  (range 20 - 74 years) with a median follow - 
up of 25.5 (range 2-40 months). In part based  on the more  stringent entry  criteria  that have been 
adopted in the TJUH Blood and Marrow Transplant Program for the second  generation 
2 step trials,  all of the patients were  discharged  from  the HSCT  stay and lived  at least 12 

11 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   months after HSCT. Furthermore, of the 4 patients that died, 3 succumbed to relapsed disease and  
only one patient died of complications of GVHD.  The KM estimate of OS at 2 years is 81%. These  
excellent  outcomes are based  on the types of diseases transplanted  (ie more  indolent with less 
aggressive pretreatment history), the lower ages of the cohort, and the more stringent 
prescreening process based on comorbidity analyses added to the 2 step protocols. The  majority 
of these patients were accrued by 2012 however, and only 1 patient wastreated on this trial in  
2013. The primary  reason  for this precipitous drop in accrual  is the development  of targeted  drugs 
in B cell malignancies which have dramatically changed the landscape of lymphoma treatment, 
with less patients requiring allogeneic HSCT  to achieve disease control.  This change in  the field 
has shifted the cohort of patients requiring HSCT to those with acute leukemia, MDS, or highly resistant lymphoma, all more aggressive diseases requiring aggressive approaches. In addition, the median age of patients with AML and MDS atpresentation is > 60 years, resulting in a growing cohort of patients who  are not only older, but often have  multiple  comorbidities related to their 
age and aggressive pre- HSCT treatment of their disease. Based on our own in -house analyses and 
the Sorror et al. data,  much  of this emerging population of older patient  is unlikely to  withstand  
the rigors  of an RIC approach. This point was demonstrated above in the KM figure of the initial 
2 step RIC trial in which the 34 patients (median age of 67 years), had significant decreases in OS when the analysis was broken down by HCT-CI points. 
 
Of note in the Sorror study, (Sorror et al., 2014) patients  undergoing NM HSCT  as opposed 
to RIC and MA HSCT  tolerated  a HCT -CI/age  score (=HCT -CI score plus 1 if  > than 40 years), 
of 3-4 points better in terms of NRM. Patients undergoing NM HSCT with an adjusted HCT - 
CI/age score of 3 -4 had a NRM rate of 17% at 2 years as opposed to 36% and 37% for RIC and 
MA HSCT respectively. Therefore, it is possible to decrease NRM in vulnerable patients (i.e. advanced age/increased comorbidities),  with the  use of a NM HSCT  regimen. There  is cu rrently 
no 2 step regimen that is NM. Two year OS rates for patients with an HCT -CI/age score of ≥ 5 
were less than 35% at 2 years in all categories of conditioning regimens.  
 
1.5 Purpose  of the Clinical  Trial  
This clinical trial is aimed at reducing NRM in th e expanding population of high- risk patients 
with higher comorbidity scores and/or who are older, undergoing HSCT  with the use of a gentler 
NM 2 step  approach. To  compensate for  the higher  risk of post HSCT  relapse with this type of 
gentler approach, strategies to immunologically increase  GVT effects will be employed. First, 
patients  will undergo HSCT  using the TJU 2 step approach, developed at Jefferson  in 2006,which 
has been an associated with low rates of relapse in patients with controlled disease at HSCT.(Grosso et al., 2011; Grosso et al., 2014) The GVT effects associated with the 2 step approach are thought to be due to the use of a haploidentical donor, the administration of high doses of tolerized  T cells,  the selection  of the most  predicted  alloreactive donor, and the avoidance 
of T cell polarization  to a Th2 type by G- CSF.  A second  strategy  to increase  GVT effects  will be 
the infusion of higher doses of donor stem cells, which can now be reliably obtained with the drug plerixifor. The admini stration of a high dose of CD34 cells has been associated with 
decreased relapsed rates in Jefferson 2 step patients (Gaballa et al., 2014a)and  at other  HSCT 
centers. (Gõmez-Almaguer et al., 2013; Klingebiel et al., 2010; Törlén et al.,2014) 
12 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   2.0 Hypothesis  and Objective  
The hypothesis of this research study is that haploidentical HSCT using a NM 2 step approach 
will decrease NRM as compared to the historical 2 step RIC approaches. Immunological strategies to increase GVT  effects will compensate for the gentler conditioning regimen  such that 
relapse related  mortality  (RRM)  will remain  acceptable.  Therefore,  OS rates (impacted  by NRM  
+ RRM) will be higher at 1 year using  a NM HSCT versus historical TJU 2  step RIC outcomes. 
Examples of vulnerable pa tients who will be treated on this protocol include but are not limited 
to patients with higher comorbidity scores, and/or who are older, or have had previous  histories 
that predispose to higher toxicity. An example of patients  who are predisposedto  higher toxicities 
are patients who have received  autologous HSCT  in the past, who are heavilypretreated,  or those 
who received agents such as bleomycin which can affect the lungs. Patients who do not require intensive conditioning may also be treated on this protocol. 
 
Patients  who are younger and fit, will continue  to be treated  on the 2 step RIC or MAregimens.  
 
2.1 Primary  Objective  
Our primary objective  is to demonstrate  efficacy  of this approach over the historical  2 step 
RIC approaches in the “vulnerable” population as defined above. To prove efficacy, 1 year OS 
of the patient population should be 60%, increased from 45% based on the Palmisiano analysis, and equal to the patients with HSCT -CI scores of >2 in the Sorror et al. analysis (87% of which 
were < 60 years old) undergoing HLA matched HSCT. If an OS of 60% were reached at 1 year, we would conclude that we have been able to improve OS in patients with a higher number of comorbid conditions and/or are older,  undergoing HSCT  at our institution, and that haploidentical 
HSCT  using the 2 step approach  is a safe alternative  to HLA  matched  HSCT  in this patient  subset.  
 
2.2 Secondary  Objective  
1. To compare the NRM and RRM rates at 1 year for patients treated on this study to the that of patients undergoing haploidentical RIC HSCT  as reported  in the literature  and as 
observed in the 2 step RIC trials (06U.327 and 12D.501). 
2. To determine  the incidence and severity  of graft -versus- host disease (GVHD)  in patients 
undergoing treated on the TJU RIC 2 step approach. 
3. To evaluate engraftment rates and lymphoid reconstitution  in patients  treated  in the TJU 
RIC 2 step approach. 
 
3.0 Pa
tient  and Donor Selection  
3.1 Patient  Selection  
The majority  of patients treated on this protocol will have have a history  of heavy pretreatment, 
or an age or comorbidity score which  is higher than allowable  on the current TJUH 2 step trials. 
Because of the NM conditioning regimen, patients must not have rapidly evolving disease as described below: 
 
3.2 Inclusion  Criteria  
1. Patients  treated  on this study will have:  
a. Acute  myeloid  leukemia in morphologic CR not requiring treatment for their 
disease for 4 weeks 
13 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   b. A history of AML with ≤10% residual blasts (use highest count on staging 
studies) after induction therapy and persisting  with <10% blasts for at least 8 
weeks without reinduction and at the time of HSCT. 
c. RA or RARS  or isolated  5q- 
d. RAEB -1, RCMD+/ -RS, or MDS  NOS  with stable disease for at least 3 months.  
e. RAEB- 2 must demonstrate chemo -responsiveness. Chemo- responsiveness is 
defined as a persistent  blast  percentage decrease  by at least 5 percentage points to 
therapy and there must be ≤ 10% blasts (use highest count on staging studies) after treatment and at the time of transplant.  
f. Hodgkin or indolent Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  
g. Myeloma with <5% plasma  cells in the marrow

thought to be beneficial, and the disease is chemoresponsive  
k. Patients without clear manifestations of their disease status in terms of stage and/or responsiveness should be discussed  with the PI and enrollment analysis 
should be documented in the study records. 
2. Patients must have related donor who is HLA mismatched at 2, 3, or 4 antigens at the HLA- A; B; C; DR loci in the GVHD direction. (Patients with related donors who are 
HLA identical or are a 1-antigen mismatch  may be treated  on this therapeutic  approach, 
but their outcomes will not be part of the statistical aims of the study (see St atistical 
Section). The HLA matched related category  includes patients with a syngeneic donor. 
3. Patients  must  have had front  line therapy  for their  disease. 
4. Patients  must  have adequate organ  function:  
a. LVEF (Left  Ventricular End Diastolic  Function) of ≥45%.

5. HCT -CI/Age  Score  ≤5 points (Patients  with greater  than 5 points will be allowed  for trial 
with approval of the PI and the Co-PI or his designee. This is an adjustment to account for healthy patients who meet the  spirit of this protocol but have histories that result in 
higher than HCT -CI 5 points. An example is a patient with a solid tumor malignancy in 
their remote history (adds 3 points to HCT- CI total) where the treatment for the 
malignancy occurred years to decades before and there has been complete recovery of toxicities.  
6. KPS ≥90%  patients  older than 70 years, KPS ≥80%  patients  younger than 70 years  
7. Patients  must  be willing  to use contraception if they have childbearing potential.

1. Performance  status <90%  in patients  70 years or greater,  <80%  in patients  less than age 
70 years 
2. HCT -CI/age  score >5 points (Patients  with greater  than 5 points will be allowed  for trial 
14 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   with approval of the Principal Investigator and the Co -Principal Investigator or his 
designee.  This is an adjustment to account for healthy patients  who meet  the spirit of this 
protocol but have histories that result in higher than HCT-CI 5 points. An example is a 
patient with a solid tumor malignancy in th eir remote history (adds 3 points to HCT- CI 
total) where  the treatment for  the malignancy occurred years to decades before and there 
has been complete recovery of toxicities.  
3. A diagnosis of CMML,  unless in morphologic CR 
4. HIV positive  
5. Active  involvement of the central  nervous system  with malignancy

8. Patients  with life expectancy  of ≤6 months for reasons other  than their underlying 
hematologic/oncologic disorder 
9. Patients who have received  alemtuzumab or antithymocyte globulin within 8 weeks of 
the transplant admission. The absence of these therapies in the medical  record  will serve 
as documentation that they were not given.  
10. Patients  with evidence of another malignancy, exclusive of a skin cancer  that requires 
only local treatment, should not be enrolled on this protocol 
 
3.4 Donor Selection  
All donors are selected and screened for  their ability  to provide adequate infection- free apheresis 
products for the patient in a manner that does not put  the donor at risk for negative consequences. 
Donor selection, evaluation, and treatment will be in compliance with 21 CFR 1271 and all TJU BMT Program SOPs relating to the use of the allogeneic donor for HSCT. 
 
Specifically,  donors will be tested,  using the appropriate FDA- licensed  and designated  screening 
tests, for  
1. HIV,  type 1 
2. HIV,  type 2 
3. HBV  (HBsAg,  anti0HBc  IgC and IgM)  
4. HCV  
5. Treponema pallidum 
6. Human  T-lymphotropic virus, types I and II 
7. Cytomegalovirus  
8. West Nile  Virus  
9. T rypanosoma cruzi  
 
As per the Jefferson  Blood Donor Center  Quality  Plan,  all allogeneic donor testing  samples 
(including HPC donors) will be sent to a laboratory that is FDA and CLIA licensed.  
Agreements/contracts for these services  will be developed according to TJUH  policies  and all 
pertinent regulatory requirements will be retained by the Blood Bank.  
 
 
Infectious disease testing  must  be completed  by the time of the recipient’s  transplant  admission 
date. 
15 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   Per FACT guidelines, pregnancy will be assessed during  the initial donor evaluation and just 
prior to the start of the recipient’s  conditioning regimen  in female  donors of childbearing age. 
 
4.0 Informed  Consent  
Patients  referred  for the trial will have  their eligibility  criteria  verified. On meeting  the eligibility 
for the trial as outlined, informed consent will be obtained using forms approved by the Thomas 
Jefferson  University  Hospital Institutional Review Board and following guidelines related  to the 
use of human subjects in research. The risks and hazards of the procedu re, as well as alternative 
forms of therapy will be presented to the patient in detail. Patients will receive a signed copy if 
the consent form after the consent interview. In addition, donors will be asked to sign consent after they have been fully informed about the procedures and risk of donating. 
 
5.0 Treatment  Plan  
While the days of radiation and drug administration are fixed, the exact timing of these treatments  on the day they are due is not specified because of expected  variations  in clinical 
care.

There should be no administration of agents that suppress lymphocyte reactivity from 
admission  until  Day-1 in this protocol.  This includes steroids,  calcineurin  inhibitors,  MMF,  or 
monoclonal antibodies that affect lymphocyte number or function. If patients have previously 
required steroids as a premedication for transfusion, they may receive a dose of steroids equivalent to 5 mg of prednisone through day -10. After day -10, a significant porti on of the 
conditioning regimen is completed. At this time, the immune system response to alloantigens should be somewhat attenuated. Diphenhydramine and meperidine may be used if necessary. 
Any use of steroids  from day -10 through day 0 should not be admin istered  without approval  
16 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   from  the PI. 
 
Voriconazole is prohibited until  day -1 due to its interaction  with  cyclophosphamide.  
 
The absence of agents that suppress lymphocyte  reactivity  and voriconazole in the medical 
record serves as documentation that they were not given. 
 
All chemotherapy  and HPC  doses in this protocol  are to be based  on adjusted dosing weight 
(40% of the difference between actual and ideal weight).  
 
5.1 Administration  of Fludarabine  
Fludarabine is administered for 3 days on (days -10 through – 8) at a dose of 30 mg/m2 IV. 
Creatinine  should be checked  prior to each dose of fludarabine. If renal  insufficiency  develops, 
the attending physician must be notified in cases where a dose adjustment needs to be made. 
 
 
5.2 TBI 
4 Gy  of TBI  will be administered in two divided doses of 2 Gy each on day -7. At this low dose, 
there  is almost  no clinical scenario  in which  this small  dose of radiation  would be associated  with 
added toxicity from prior radiation. However, because of the heterogeneous past histories of the 
patients to be treated on this protocol, all patients will be evaluated by  the radiation oncologist 
for assessment of radiation toxicity  in the context of previous treatment. In addition there may be 
technical or patient  related factors which will require some minor modification in the TBI 
technique utilized. Selected patients may require local boosting of certain organ sites prior to conditioning therapy. See Appendix A for radiation guidelines. 
 
5.3 Donor Lymphocyte Infusio n 
Hematopoietic cell doses and cyclophosphamide dosing will be based on adjusted dosing weight (40% the difference between  actual  and ideal  body weight + the actual  body weight).  The dose of 
the donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will be based on CD3+ T cells per kilogram of recipient adjusted body weight. Donor lymphocytes will be collected prior to the use of white cell growth factor for progenitor cell collection.  
 
The goal of the first day of donor lymphocyte collection  is to process a blood volume that is both 
safe for the donor as well as to obtain the prescribed dose of CD3+ T cells/recipient kg.  
Approximately 18-27 liters will be processed the first day of donor lymphocyte collection. If a second  day of collection  is needed, the volume processed  will be based  on the amount of T cells 
required to meet the T cell target.  
 
DLI specimen handling and labeling conventions will be performed in accord with the relevant 
AABB (American  Association  of Blood Banks) and/or FACT  (Foundation for Accreditation  for 
Cell Therapy) regulations and guidelines. All DLI specimens must be appropriately labeled in accord with these standards to be accepted by the Processing Laboratory. A valid prescription and request form must be submitted by the requesting physician. 
 
D
etermina tion of the targeted  T cell dose from  the apheresis product is as follows:  
17 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   Total  T-cells required  for the initial infusion = (2x108 T-cells/kg) * (Weight in kg) 
Panel:  
 
    
CD3  count is calculated  directly  with single-platform flow cytometry. Reported CD3  absolute 
count is the mean from 3 -tube counts. 
 
All donors will be apheresed  for lymphocytes on day -7. If the target  number of CD3+  T cell 
lymphocytes, 2 x 108/recipient kg is not obtained, apheresis will be repeated on day -6. 
 
Lymphocyte apheresis will be performed at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital or the 
American  Red Cross,  by trained  apheresis personnel using standard  techniques and equipment. 
 
Patients will receive 2 x 108/kg T cells on day -6. During the infusion, the patient will be 
monitored for any untoward reactions.  Donor lymphocyte infusions will be administered  by 
nursing staff experienced in the administration of blood products. 
 
DLI must N OT  be irradiated. DLI should NEVER be administered through a leukocyte 
depletion (PALL)  filter. If  blood filtration  is necessary,  the filter  should be a standard  blood 
product filter with pore size of at least 170 microns. 
 
5.4
 Cyclophosphamide  
CTX 60 mg/kg IV will be administered on days –3 and –2 of the conditioning regimen. Mesna 
60 mg/kg continuous IV infusion over 24 hours X 2 doses will be infused on days –3 through –2. 
Day –1 is a day of rest.  
 
5.5 Collection  and Infusion of Progenitor Cells  (PBSCs)  
Donors will begin G- CSF,  5μg/kg bid on days - 5 to -1. They  may additionally  receive  Plerixafor 
administered at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/day in the evening on day -3 or -2. The donor will return for a primed progenitor cell collection on days -2 and -1. 18 to 27 liters will be processed per day. Collection days and Plerixafor dosing may be adjusted by one day less or one day more based on initial progenitor cell collection numbers. It is anticipated that with the use of Plerixafor,  only one day of PBSC  collection  may be needed  to achieve the desired  CD-34 cell/kg 
dose. CD34+ cell enrichment will be performed via the closed system method using the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). The CliniMACS system utilizes super -paramagnetic particles composed of iron oxide and dextran conjugated to 
monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies bind to target cells with the corresponding cell surface antigen (in this case, CD34). After magnetic labeling, the cells are separated using a high - 
gradient magnetic separation column. The magnetically  labeled cells are retained in the column   FITC  PE PE-Cy7 APC  APC -

18 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   and separated  from  the unlabeled  cells.  Removing the magnetic field from  the separation  column 
elutes  the retained  cells.  Eluted  cells will be characterized  using fluorescent- activated  cell sorting 
(FACS)  analysis.  All procedures will  be performed in a sterile  environment with  strict adherence 
to all applicable regulations regarding the processing and use of human stem cells. The use of 
this device will conform to TJU BMT Laboratory standard operating procedures. 
 
The target dose of donor PBSCs to be infused into the recipient is 15 x 106 CD34 cells/kg of 
recipient  dosing body weight. The acceptable minimum  infusion target of PBSCs  will be 1 x 106 
CD34 cells/kg. Recipients will receive no more than 2.0 x 107 CD34 cells/kg, the maximum 
dose.  
 
In our experience, the ideal amount of T-cells left in the PBSC product is no greater than 5x10
4/kg, so that every  effort  will be  made to keep  T-cell amounts to below  this threshold.  
 
Progenitor cell apheresis will be performed at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital or the American  Red Cross,  by trained  apheresis personnel using standard  techniques and equipment. 
 
Handling and labeling of the progenitor cell product will be performed in accord with the relevant AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) and/or FACT (Foundation for Accreditation for Cell Therapy) regulations and guidelines. All donor specimens must be appropriate ly labeled  in accord  with these standards to be accepted  by the Processing Laboratory. 
A valid prescription and request form must be submitted by the requesting physician.  
 
The donor PBSC  product is infused UNFILTERED  or through a filter of at least 170 micron  size 
intravenously through a central catheter. PBSCs should only be piggybacked through normal saline and not other intravenous solutions. Contingency plans for an inadequate collection of progenitor cells via apheresis or non-viable donor cells will be made according to institutional policies.  
 
During the infusion, the patient will be monitored for any untoward reactions. PBSC infusions will be administered  by nursing staff experienced  in the administration  of blood products. PBSC 
products must NOT be irradiated. PBSC products should NEVER be administered through a leukocyte depletion (PALL) filter. If blood filtration is necessary, the  filter should be a standard 
blood product filter with pore size of at least 170 microns. 
 
Significant red cell inco mpatibility between donor and recipient will be managed according to 
standard operating procedure, CL: Ppp033, of the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Blood and Marrow  Transplant Processing  Lab. Pre-medications (if any) prior to PBSC infusion will be 
at the discretion of the physician. 
 
Benadryl, epinephrine, and hydrocortisone should be available for emergency  use if necessary. 
Oxygen with nasal cannula should be immediately available. 
 
5.6
 GVHD  Prophylaxis  
Tacrolimus will be started  on day -1. Tacrolimus  dose titration  will occur  to target a goal 
level of 7 ng/ml +/- 2. It is recognized that there may  be values beyond this target range 
19 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   due to interpatient variability.  
 
If grades II-IV GVHD develop at any time after transplant  (inpatient or outpatient), any GVHD 
treatment deemed necessary by the covering attending physician may be utilized. 
 
The tacrolimus taper can be initiated by day + 42 in the absence of concern for GVHD or 
interference with a GVHD plan of care that was developed prior to  day +42. Because of the 
variability  in patient outpatient office  visit times  and the need  for GVHD  assessment,  it is not 
mandatory that the taper begins exactly day on +42. 
 
MMF  will be discontinued beginning at day +28 +/- 3 days in the absence of GVHD.  
 
Tacrolimus and MMF  may be discontinued earlier  if there  is count suppression from  the 
drugs or other unforeseen circumstances in which  the drug is felt to be deleterious  to the 
plan of care, such as infection, count suppression, drug side effects, or a need for alternate GVHD treatment.  
The BMTU attending  physician  may change these  GVHD prophylaxis guidelines if 
clinically indicated.  
 
6.0 Study  Measurements  
The table  below  outlines  the measurements and time  points  specific to this study.  Only  the 
day +28 studies are mandatory. The other elements are recommended. The attending physician may perform assessments/labs more or less frequently based on the patient’s unique course.

The formal  endpoint of this study for efficacy  is 1 year  post HSCT.  Therefore  patients  will not be 
followed for this study after this time. However, outcomes for patients undergoing HSCT at TJUH are followed programmatically beyond this study indefinitely 
 
6.1 Hematopoietic  Engraftment: Defined  as 
Hematopoietic  engraftment  will be defined  as: 
• ANC  ≥ 0.5 x10e9/L for at least 3 days 
• Platelet  engraftment > 20,000 with no transfusion  x7 days 
21 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   6.2 Toxicity  Criteria  
Regimen -related  toxicity  will be graded  according  to the NCI Common  Toxicity Criteria  version 
4.0. 
 
6.3 Disease Response  
Disease response will be measured according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
Guidelines (NCCN).  The guidelines are disease specific and the guidelines for each disease can 
be found at: 
 
http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site  
 
6.4 GVHD  Scoring  
GVHD will be graded according to standard criteria  contained in Appendix B. 
 
6.5 Adverse Event  Reporting  
All patients will be followed for adverse experiences (AEs)  (serious and non- serious),  regardless 
of relationships to study  treatment, from the time of  enrollment until d+100 after  transplant. The 
following events are expected  side effects of high -dose chemotherapy and transplant  and will  be 
recorded but not reported: 
• Alopecia,  headache, dry skin 
• Emesis from chemotherapy or other agents unless refractory  to standard supportive care, 
nausea, anorexia  
• Weight loss, cough, dry mouth  
• Grades 1-3 fever  
• Grades 1-3 infectious sequellae  
• Grades 1-3 electrolyte  imbalances  
• Grades I- III abnormalities  in alkaline phosphatase, AST  and ALT 
• Neutropenia/uncomplicated neutropenic fever  
• Thrombocytopenia, petechiae, ecchymoses, minor vaginal bleeding, epistaxis, hemorrhoidal bleeding, or other similar bleeding events will not be reported. (Bleeding events requiring  intervention  such as endoscopy or radiologic  evaluation w ill be reported) 
• Anemia  
• Grades 1-3 rash 
• Grades 1-3 fatigue  
• Grades 1-3 mucositis  
• Grades 1-3 diarrhea

grade 4-5 
 
Serious adverse events reporting to the TJU Institutional Review  Board  will occur for grade 4 
and grade 5 events and/or for an event that results in hospitalization or permanent disability regardless to the relationship to the study treatment.  
 
After  d+100, only AEs that are considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
associated with the treatment regimen will be reported.  
22 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   6.6 Reporting  to SKCC DSMC 
All AEs and SAEs  except  those listed  in section  6.5, safety  and toxicity  data,  and any corrective 
actions will be submitted  to the DSMC per the frequency described in the SKCC DSMP. The 
report to the SKCC DSMC will also include any unanticipated problems that in the opinion of 
the PI should be reported to the DSMC. 
For expedited reporting requirements, see table  below:  
 
DSMC AE/SAE  Reporting Requirements  
 
 
6.7 Reports to the Federal  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  
All grade  3-5 hematopoietic cell infusion reactions and all unexpected  SAEs  as defined in 21 
CFR 312.32 will be reported to the FDA in an expedited fashion.

23 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   days as defined in 21 CFR  812.150.  
 
An annual report will be sent to the FDA  regarding  the progress to date of patients  on the trial. In 
the report, a separate listing of infusion toxicities and all biological product deviations will be 
included in addition to the other required elements. 
 
6.8 Study  Endpoint  
The endpoint of this study  is OS at 1 year.  
 
7.0 Supportive  Care  
7.1 Avoidance of Infection  
 
It is recommended that IVIG 0.5 g/kg IV is administered every 4 weeks post- transplant to 
support immune function, until the IgG level is ≥ 500 mg/dL on 2 consecutive monthly measurements. The first dose will be administered on day +7 if the patient is clinically  stable 
enough to receive it. If not, IVIG should be administered  as soon as feasibly  possible after d +7. . 
 
The infusion of IVIG  to patients  undergoing matched  sibling  transplant  is at the discretion  of the 
attending physician. 
 
7.2 Infectious Prophylaxis: General  Guidelines  
Patients  post partially -matched  related  donor transplantation  will be maintained  on antifungal 
prophylaxis, usually voriconazole 200 mg BID. It is  at the discretion  of the treating  attending 
physician to change agents as clinically indicated. 
 
Patients post partially -matched related donor transplantation will be maintained on HSV 
prophylaxis, usually valacyclovir 500 mg daily. It is at the discretion  of the treating  attending 
physician to change agents based on culture results and sensitivities.  
 
Patients post partially -matched related donor transplantation will be maintained on PCP 
prophylaxis, usually TMP -SMZ DS 1 tablet  daily  weekly. It is at the discretion  of the treating 
attending physician to change agents based on culture res ults, drug intolerance.  
 
Prophylactic medications may  be discontinued at the discretion  of the attending physician. Their 
absence in the medical record serves as documentation that they were discontinued.  
 
7.3 Growth  Factor and Transfusion  Support  
To prevent inadvertent lymphoid engraftment, all blood cell products must  be irradiated.  
 
All red cell and platelet  products will be leukodepleted to prevent alloimmunization  and decrease 
infectious sequela.  
 
Packed  red blood cell transfusions will be given as necessary  to target a hemoglobin ≥ 7-8g/L.  
 
Platelet transfusions will be used as needed  to keep  the morning count ≥ 10-20x10e9/L, with 
10x10e9/L used for situations without an excessive bleeding risk. 
24 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   It is recognized  that values for hemoglobin and platelet count may go below targets  as these labs 
are not continuously checked and a time delay need to order blood products. 
 
GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor) 250μg/m2 will be administered 
daily beginning on day +1. GM -CSF will be weaned/discontinued at the discretion of the 
attending physician. Every effort should be made to keep the ANC ≥ 1000 for all patients post 
partially -matched  related  donor transplantation.  GCSF  5μg/m2 can be substituted  for GM-CSF in 
the eve nt of a GM -CSF shortage or if a patient has a deleterious reaction to GM- CSF as 
determined by the BMTU attending physician. 
 
Red cell growth factors are permissible after transplantation.  
 
8.0 Drug  Information  and Administration  
8.1 Cyclophosphamide  
Mechanism:  A multistep process activates it by conversion to 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide by 
the liver microsomal oxidase system and to aldophosohamide by tautomerization in the peripheral tissues. Aldophosphamide spontaneously degrades into acrolein and phosporamide mustard, which cause cellular glutathione depletion and DNA alkylation. This results in 
inhibition of DNA replication and transcription. Cells expressing high levels of aldehyde 
dehydrogenase (e.g. stem cells, L1210 leukemia cells) resist cyclophosphamide-m ediated 
cytotoxicity as aldophosphamide is inactivated by this enzyme. The drug also does not affect quiescent  cells and therefore  stem  cells are generally  protected,  an important factor  if autologous 
hematopoietic recovery is relied on in the event of gra ft failure.  
 
Metabolism:  Cyclophosphamide is broken down as described  above and the break  down 
products are excreted by the kidneys. 
 
Incompatibilties: Phenobarbital or rifampin  may increase the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. 
Concurrent allopurinol or thiaz ide diuretics may exaggerate bone marrow depression May 
prolong neuromuscular  blockade from  succinylcholine Cardiotoxicity  may be additive with other 
cardiotoxic agents ( cytarabine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin). May decrease serum digoxin levels. 
Additive bone marrow  depression with other antineoplastics or radiation  therapy. May potentiate 
the effects of warfarin . May decrease antibody response to live- virus vaccines and increase the 
risk of adverse reactions. Prolongs the effects of cocaine.  
 
Toxicity: Na us ea, vomiting, water retention due to inappropriate secretion of anti- diuretic 
hormone (SIADH),  cardiomyopathy with myocardial necrosis  and congestive heart  failure, 
hemorrhagic cystitis, alopecia, skin rash, pulmonary fibrosis, sterility and secondary malignancies.  
 
Administration: P
 atients will receive a dose of cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg IV, on days –3 and - 
2. The dose of cyclophosphamide will be calculated according to the dosing body weight. MESNA  (sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) will be administered  as a 60 mg/kg/continuous IV 
infusion over 24 hours starting 30 minutes prior to cyclophosphamide infusion and ending approximately 24 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide. The dose of MESNA will also 
25 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   be calculated  based on dosing body weight.

Co.: Boston. 
 
8.2
 Donor Leukocyte Infusion  (DLI)  
Administration: All patients will receive a dose of donor CD3+ T cells per kilogram of dosing 
body weight as outlined in the treatment design. Details of the apheresis procedure to obtain 
white blood cells, quantification of CD3+ T cells by flow cytometry, and administration of the 
white  cell product to the recipient  are provided in the treatment  section.  All drugs that may cause 
lymphocyte suppression are starting on the day of admission through day 0 as detailed in the treatment section.  
 
Toxicity: Infusion reactions,  GVHD.  
 
8.3 Fludarabine  
Mechanism:  F ludarabine phosphate is fluorinated nucleotide and analog of antiviral agent 
vidarabine, that is relatively resistant to adenosine deaminase deamination. It is actively dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro- ara-A and phosphorylated further by deoxycytidine kinase to 2- 
fluoro- ara-ATP,  then acts by inhibiting DNA  polymerase alpha,  ribonucleotide reductase and 
DNA primase resulting in DNA synthesis inhibition. 
 
Metabolism:  Renal  Excretion  
In a pharmacokinetic study  of patients treated  with fludarabine for rheumatoid arthritis,  the mean 
total clearance was 14.01 L/hr following  a dose of 20 mg/m2/day, and 13.4 L following a dose of 
30 mg/m2/day (Knebel et al, 1998). The median total body clearance was 9.6 L/hr after 
intravenous or subcutaneous fludarabine 30 mg/m2 for 3 days in 5 patients with lupus nephritis 
(Kuo et al, 2001). 
 
Incompatibilities: Fludarabine has dr ug interactions  with several  vaccines  and its simultaneous 
use with Rotavirus vaccine is contraindicated.  
 
Toxicities: Common: Endocrine/Metabolic: Shivering, Gastrointestinal: Loss of Appetite, 
Nausea, Vomiting, Neurologic: Asthenia, Other: Fatigue, Malaise, Serious: Cardiovascular: Edema  (frequent),  Dermatologic: Aplasia of skin (rare),  Hematologic: Autoimmune Hemolytic 
Anemia, Graft versus host disease, Transfusion-associated, with non- irradiated blood (rare), 
Myelosuppression (frequent), Neurologic: Neurotoxicity, Respiratory: Pneumonia (frequent), Other: Fever (frequent), Infectious disease.  
 
Administration: In th
 is protocol, Fludarabine  is administered  for 3 days on (days -10 through – 8) 
at a dose of 30 mg/m2 IV. Creatinine should  be checked prior to each dose of fludarabine. If 
renal insufficiency develops, the attending physician must be notified in cases where a dose adjustment needs to be made.

15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   8.4 G-CSF 
Mechanism:  G-CSF is a human  granulocyte colony- stimulating  factor  produced by recombinant 
DNA technology. It is a glycoprotein which acts on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific 
cell surface receptors and stimulating  proliferation,  differentiation,  commitment,  and some  end- 
cell functions.  
 
Metabolism:  Absorption and clearance of G -CSF follows first -order pharmacokinetic modeling 
without apparent  concentration  dependence. The eliminat ion half- life in both normal  and cancer 
patients is 3.5 hours. 
 
Incompatibilties: S afety  and efficacy  of G- CSF when used simultaneously with chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy has not been evaluated. Donors receiving either of these 2 modalities will not be permitted on study. 
 
Toxicities: A
 llergic  reactions consisting of rash,  wheezing  and tachycardia. Splenic rupture, 
ARDS, and exacerbation of sickle cell disease have been reported rarely.  
Administration: In th is protocol, G- CSF will be administered  to healthy donors at a dose of 10 
μg/kg (actual weight) subcutaneously on days -5 through day -1. 
 
Reference:  Physician’s Desk  Reference,  Edition 58, 2004.  
 
8.5 GM-CSF 
Mechanism:  GM-CS F is a recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating  factor  produced 
by recombinant DNA technology in a yeast expression system. It supports survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. GM- CSF is also capable of activating 
mature granulocytes and macrophages, and is a multilineage factor with effects on the myelomonocytic, erythroid, and megarkaryocytic lines. 
 
Metabolism:  GM-CSF is detected  in the serum  at 15 minutes after injection.  Peak  levels occur 
about 1 to 3 hours after injection, and it is detectable in the serum for up to 6 hours after inject ion. 
 
Incompatibilities: In
 teractions  between  GM-CSF and other drugs have not been  fully  evaluated. 
Drugs which may potentiate the myeloproliferative effects of GM -CSF, such as lithium and 
corticosteroids, should be used with caution. 
 
Toxicities: A llergic  and anaphylactic reactions  have  been  reported.  A syndrome characterized  by 
respiratory distress, hypoxia, flushing, hypotension, syncope and or tachycardia has been associated with the first administration of GM -CSF in a cycle. These signs have resolved w ith 
treatment.  
 
Administration: In  th
 is protocol,  GM-CSF will be given to the patients beginning on Day +1 in 
the PM.

15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   8.6 Mycophenolate Mofetil  (MMF)  
Mechanism:  Inhibits the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which  is involved in 
purine synthesis. This inhibition results in suppression of T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation. 
 
Metabolism:  Following oral and IV administration, mycophenolate is rapidly hydrolyzed to 
mycophenolic acid (MPA), its active  metabolite.  Distribution  is unknown. MPA  is extensively 
metabolized; <1% excreted unchanged in urine. Some enterohepatic recirculation of MPA 
occurs. Half Life: MPA¾17.9 hr. 
 
Incompatibilities: Combined use with azathioprine is not recommen de d (effects unknown) · 
Acyclovir and ganciclovir compete with MPA for renal excretion and, in patients with renal failure, may increase each other's toxicity. Magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacids decrease the absorption of MPA (avoid simultaneous adm inistration). Cholestyramine and 
colestipol decrease the absorption of MPA  (avoid concurrent use).  Toxicity  may be increased  by 
salicylates.  May interfere  with the action  of oral contraceptives  (additional  contraceptive method 
should be used). May decrease the antibody response to and increase risk of adverse reactions from live -virus vaccines, although influenza vaccine may be useful. When administered with 
food, peak blood levels of MPA are significantly decreased. 
 
Toxicities: GI
 : Bleeding, Diarrhea,  Vom iting,  Hematopoietic:  Leukopenia Miscellaneous: 
Sepsis, Increased Risk of Malignancy  
 
Administration: In this protocol, MMF will be administered at a dose of 1 gram IV BID 
beginning on day -1. MMF  will be discontinued on day +28 in the absence of GVHD.  MMF  may 
be stopped earlier if there is count suppression from the drug or other unforeseen circumstances in which the drug is felt to be deleterious to the plan of care. 
 
8.7
 Plerixafor  
Mechanism:  R eversibly inhibits binding of stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF- 1α), 
expressed  on bone marrow  stromal  cells,  to the CXC  chemokine receptor  4 (CXCR4),  resulting 
in mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow into peripheral blood. Plerixafor used in combination with filgrastim results in synergistic increase in CD34+ cell mobilization.  Mobilized  CD34+  cells are capable of engrafting with extended repopulating 
capacity.  
 
Metabolism:  Plerixafor is absorbed rapidly after subcutaneous administration and is distributed 
primarily  in the extravascular  fluid  space.  The terminal half- life elimination  is 3-6 hours and the 
drug is excreted in the urine, about 70% as parent drug. 
 
Incompatibili t ies: There  are no known significant  incompatibilities.  
 
Toxicities: Adverse reactions  include fatigue, headache,  dizziness,  local  injection  site reaction, 
and arthralgia  
 
Administration: Allogeneic  donors may receive a dose of 0.24 mg/kg daily  x 2 days in the PM of 
days -3 and day -2 as needed. 
28 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   8.8 Tacrolimus  
Mechanism:  T acrolimus, it is a macrolide immunosuppressant. It inhibits lymphocytes by 
forming a complex with FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin leading to the decrease in the 
phosphatase activity  of calcineurin.  This in turn prevents generation  of NF-AT, a nuclear  factor 
for initiating  gene transcription  for lymphokines like interleukin -2 and interferon -γ99. This drug 
is used with corticosteroids for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving allogeneic 
liver transplants. Its use is also currently being investigated in kidney, bone marrow, cardiac, pancreas, pancreatic island cell and small bowel transplantation.  
 
Metabolism: This drug is well absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver by unknown 
mechanisms  and demethylation and hydroxylation has been  proposed based  on in vitro  studies. 
The metabolized products are excreted in the urine.  
 
Incompatibilities: Nephrotoxic drugs, antifungals ( azoles),  calcium -channel blockers, cimetid ine, 
danazol, erythromycin, methylprednisone and metoclopramide increase the bioavailabilty of tacrolimus. On the other hand phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifamycins and carbamazepine decrease tacrolimus levels.  
 
Toxicities: Adverse re
 actions  include: tremor,  headache,  neurotoxicity; diarrhea, nausea; 
hypertension; TTP and renal dysfunction. 
 
Administration: Tacrolimus will be started on day - 1. The drug dose will be titrated to a goal 
level  of 7 ng/ml  +/- 2, although it is recognized  that there  may be variatio ns beyond the target 
range due to interpatient variability.  
9.0 Pa tient  Safety  
To ensure patient  safety, a number of steps will be taken.  
 
The study will be monitored on an ongoing fashion by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the study medical monitor. Monit oring reports will be submitted to the Clinical Research t Office 
(CRO) for review by the DSMC during their quarterly review. Adverse events and a report summarizing their impact on the conduct of the trial are submitted to the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC) quarterly, and the DSMC reports are then submitted to the PRC and IRB annually. The PI will submit serious adverse events (SAE) to the TJU IRB utilizing the electronic Kimmel Cancer Center Clinical Trials Adverse Event Reporting system. Due to the nature of the study treatment as outlined in this protocol, expected grade 3 AE/SAEs that occur while  receiving  standard inpatient protocol treatment  may be included on the patient’s  AE log for 
quarterly  review by the DSMC rather than be reported via the eSAEy  System per the DSM Plan. 
It is the responsibility  of the study Principal Investigator (PI) to report any grade 3 AE/SAE to 
the DSMC per the DSM Plan should the length of standard protocol treatment hospitalization be extended and/or the grade 3 AE/SAE is more acute than expected as outlined in the informed consent form. Unexpected deaths related to this protocol will be reported within 24 hours. 
 
The medical monitor will be a TJU physician who is not a collaborator in this trial. The medical monitor will review  all adverse events (in addition to unexpected adverse events),  safety  data and 
activity  data observed when  this trial is ongoing. The medical  monitor may recommend  reporting  
29 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   adverse events and relevant  safety  data not previously reported, and may recommend  suspension 
or termination  of the trial. The summary  of all discussions of adverse events will be submitted  to 
the DSMC after completion and included in the PI's reports to the PRC and the TJU IRB as part 
of the study progress report. The PRC, DMSC, and/or the TJU IRB may, based on the monitor's recommendation suspend or terminate of the trial. The quarterly safety and monitoring reports will include a statement as to whether this data has invoked any stopping criteria (dose- limiting 
toxicities) in the clinical protocol.  
 
In addition to the Cancer  Center's DMSC,  the TJU BMT  program members meet  weekly  to 
discuss the status of patients on trial and generate discussion regarding the progress of the patients on the trial.  
 
Auditing a
nd  Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, the 
funding sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related  documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory  documents, 
data collection instruments, study data etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities.  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory  authorities  and applicable University  compliance and quality  assurance 
offices.  
 
In addition to review by the DSMC, all studies initiated by SKCC investigators are audited by  an 
independent auditor once they have achieved 10% of target accrual. However, a study can be audited at any time based on recommendations by the IRB, DSMC, PRC and/or the Director of Clinical Investigations, SKCC. Studies are re -audited once they have achieved 50% of target 
accrual.  Special audits  may be recommended  by the IRB,  DSMC  or PRC  based  on prior findings, 
allegations  of scientific misconduct  and where  significant irregularities  are found through quality 
control procedures. Any irregularities  identified as part of this process would result  in a full audit 
of that study. 
 
In addition to the audits at 10 and 50%, the CRO randomly audits at least 10 percent of all patients  entered  into therapeutic SKCC trials  and other trials  as necessary, on  at least a bi-annual 
basis, to verify that there is a signed and dated patient consent form, the patient has met the eligibility criteria, and that SAEs are documented and reported to the TJU IRB.  
 
All audit reports  are submitted  to the DSMC for review  and action  (when appropriate). A copy of 
this report and recommended DSMC action is sent to the PRC and TJU IRB. The committee regards the scientific review process as dynamic and constructive rather than punitive. The review process is designed to assist Principal Investigators in ensuring the safety of study subjects and the adequacy and accuracy of any data generated. The TJU IRB may, based on the DSMC and auditor’s recommendation, suspend or terminate the trial. 
 
9.1 FDA  Reports  
All grade 3-5 hematopoietic cell infusion reactions  and all unexpected  SAEs  as defined in 21

participating in this trial, will be provided to the FDA every  six months. 
 
10.0 Statistical Analysis  
10.1 Study  Design  
This is a one arm interventional study  in which  patients  with hematological malignancies are 
treated with haploidentical HSCT using a NMA conditioning regimen. 
 
10.2 Accrual  and Study  Duration  
The total of 35 patients  will be accrued  in about 6 years and 6 months and then followed for at 
least 1 more year. The total study  duration is approximately 7 years 6 months. 
 
10.3 Analysis of the Primary  Endpoint  
The primary  endpoint for this study is OS at 1 year post HSCT.  
 
The primary  null hypothesis is that 1 year  OS rate is at most  45%. 45% is the figure representing 
the OS at 1 year of patients  treated  on the initial TJU 2 Step RIC HSCT  trial and would  represent 
a failure  to improve OS in patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT at our institution and others 
reported in the literature. Alternative hypothesis is OS at 1 year of 60% . OS will be estimated 
using Kaplan- Meier curves. The 1 -year OS rate and corresponding  95% confidence interval will 
be estimated from the Kaplan -Meier curve for  the OS. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the 
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the 1 -year OS rate is above 0.45. 
 
10.4 Sa mple  Size 
Assuming that 35 patients will be accrued in 6 years and 6 months and then followed for 1 more year there is 74% power to show that 1 -year OS is greater than 45% if the true 1 -year 
survival is 60% or higher (calculations  are based  on the assumptions of uniform accrual  over 
time, no loss to follow-up, exponentially distributed death times, and use of the exponential MLE one -sided testwith alpha=0.05).  
 
10.5 Assessment  of the Secondary  Endpoint  
The secondary endpoints include (1) relapse- related mortality  (RRM) rate at 1 year; (2) NRM at 
1 year; (3) the incidence and severity of graft-versus- host disease (GVHD); (4) engraftment 
rates;  and (5) the evaluation of lymphoid reconstitution monthly to every  other month during the 
first year post HSCT.  These secondary endpoints will be reported  descriptively. RRM  and NRM 
may also be estimated using Kaplan Meier curves and/or cumulative incidence analyses.  
31 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   10.6 Analysis of Safety  
The safety  data analysis will be descriptive.  The estimates of the incidence rates  will be 
presented with corresponding confidence intervals using the exact method. 
 
Patient  outcomes are routinely  monitored in an ongoing fashion  for all patients on investigational 
trials, beyond their formal endpoints. Based on prior experience using a two- step approach 
similar to that described in this trial, we anticipate that the incidence of graft failure should be 
less than 20%, the incidence of severe GVHD should be less than 20%, and the non- relapse 
mortality should be less than 30% at 100 days. If at any point incidences higher than these thresholds are seen, that would trigger a protocol review to assess whether there are any  obvious 
reasons for the inferior outcomes observed. Depending on the r esults of the review, enrollment 
may continue on a limited basis with careful further observation, the protocol may be revised, or 
the protocol may be terminated. 
 
In addition, it is estimated  that up to 5 patients  with matched  sibling  donors will undergo HSCT 
on this approach during the time that the research study is open. The small number of patients undergoing matched  sibling  RIC HSCT  in our transplant  program precludes a separate research 
protocol for that group. To prevent withholding of transplant therapy, these patients will be treated on this protocol. Only the outcomes of the patient group undergoing HSCT from haploidentical donors (2, 3, or 4 antigen mismatches in the GVH direction) will be used in the analysis of outcomes for the statistical ends of the trial. Outcomes for patients with matched sibling donors will be reported descriptively.

12.0 Appendices  
Appendix  A: Guidelines  for Total Body  Irradiation  
Modality:  
Photon irradiation  is to be used for the TBI in all patients.  
 
Energy:  
A linear  accelerator  with energy ≥ 4 MV may be used. Dose  to superficial  tissues near skin 
surface will be increased by  using a beam “spoiler” lucite plate close to the patient.  
Since  neoplastic infiltrates  may be found in the skin, it is necessary  for the superficial  dose to 
satisfy the same total dose requirements as other locations.  
 
Geometry:  
The treatment configuration shall be such that the patient is entirely included within the treatment beam.  It is essential  that the correlation  between  the light field and the radiation  field 
be established and verified for extended TBI distances.  
 
Dose  R
ate:  
A dose rate of 0.05 to 0.25 Gy/minute at the prescription  point shall  be utilized.  The physicist of 
record, involved with TBI treatments, shall be consulted to achieve correct range of treatment 
dose rate.  
 
Calibration  & Beam  Data  Verification: 
The calibration  of the output of the machine,  used for this protocol, shall  be verified  on a daily 
basis prior to start  TBI treatments. All dosimetric parameters, necessary for the calculation of 
dose delivered during TBI treatments,  shall  be measured  at the appropriate treatment  distance. 
They shall be documented and made available for calculation of every patient treatment. 
 
Treatment  V olume:  
The patient shall be entirely included within the treatment beam. Care should be taken to guarantee that all of the patient is within the 90% decrement line at each depth. The 90% decrement  line is defined as the line in each plane perpendicular to the central  axis connecting 
the points which are 90% of the central axis dose, in that plane. 
 
Treatment  D
ose:  
Prescription  Point:  
The prescription  point is defined as the midplane point  along the longitudinal axis at the level  of 
40 
15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   the umbilicus.  
 
Dose  Un it  
All doses shall  be specified  in Gray  (Gy)  to muscle tissue.  
 
Tissue Inhomogeneity C onsiderations:  
No inhomogeneity corrections shall  be made  in the calculation  of the dose to the prescription 
point.  
 
Prescription  Point Dose:  
The total dose shall be 4 Gy delivered  administered  in two divided doses of 2 Gy each on day - 7. 
 
Time -Do se  Considerations:  
Dose  Homogeneity:  
The total absorbed  dose along the patient's  head  to toe axis (in the midplane of the patient)  shall 
not deviate more than 10% from the prescribed dose. 
 
Treatment  Technique:  
Treatment  Fields:  
Equally weighted parallel  opposed portals  shall  be used. AP/PA  fields  shall  be used.  
 
Field  S ize:  
The collimation  and treatment  distance shall  be such that the patient  will be entirely  included 
within the treatment beam and that no part of the patient extends beyond that region. The 
agreement of the light field and the radiation field should be checked periodically for the extended TBI treatment distance.  
 
Treatm e
nt Position:  
The patient  shall  be treated  in any position that is compatible with the homogeneity requirement, 
allowing for the reproducibility of the patient setup and dosimetry. 
 
Field  S haping:  
Patients  will be treated  with open fields.  
 
Calculations: 
Central  Axis  Dose:  
It is recommended  that the dose calculation  method be based  upon measurements that are made 
in a unit density phantom with the following minimum dimensions: 
• Length equal to top of shoulder to the bottom of the pelvis. 
• Width  equal to the patient width at the level  of the umbilicus.  
• Thickness equal to the typical patient  thickness at the umbilicus.  
• All measurements should be made  at the appropriate extended  SSD.  
 
Superficial Dose:  
For the radiation  beam  with the Plexiglas plate  in place,  data should be available  demonstrating 
that the skin dose is within 5% of the prescribed dose.

15D.323  Protocol  version  7.0 dated  11Oct 2022   Quality  Assurance Documentation:  
For purposes of quality  assurance the following must  be performed  on every  patient undergoing 
TBI: 
• A check  of the monitor unit calculation  by a second  physicist and a radiation  oncologist 
prior to first treatment.

carrier as the donor in certain situations  
• Updated section 4.1 that sexually active patients must be on 
contraception  
Additional edits to section 10 including delete day 28 and day 60 
skin biopsies and associated procedures, move  several 
procedures  from the research x chart to standard of care as SOC

BM for MSC production at the time of collection for transplant is 
optional for the donor . Create two treatment arms, based on 
donor’s consent status –  no/refuses additional BM collection = 
Arm A transplant only, yes/agrees to additional BM collection = Arm B transplant + MSC infusions  
Section 7.5 –  MSC Administration - remove language regarding 
collection of BM cells for MSCs and their manufacturing and storage and move to section 8 BM Harvest and MSC Production  
Section 8 –  separate into subsections of bone marrow harvest for 
transplant, risks of BM donation, additional marrow harvest for 
MSC’s in consenting donors and manufacture and storage of 
MSCs  
Section 10.2 – Research Related Procedures –  move procedures 
associated with MSC infusions to new section and label this section as Arms A and B ; delete reference to QOL as determined 
by play score/performance status in section 10.1  
Section 10.3  insert new section titled Research Related 
Procedures (Arm B) to indicate MSC only related procedures and 
assessments

 SYNOPSIS  
Study 
Design:  This is a single -institution, phase II study to determine the event -free survival at 1 year 
post allogeneic transplant with or without  serial mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions 
from a related donor (HLA identical, mismatched or haploidentical) or matched unrelated 
donor for the biochemical correction of severe epidermolysis bullosa (EB).   
 
A single marrow harvest is performe d to collect the stem cells for the transplant 
procedure and, with the donor’s consent , the collection of an additional 40 -50 ml sample  
for MSC production for post -transplant infusion on month (± 14 days) 2, 4,  and 6; and 
additionally offered at  8 and 10 months . If the donor refuses to consent for the extra 
marrow collection, the patient will receive only the transplant . The patient will be enrolled, 
based HLA-matching and on the donor’s consent  to one of the following arms : 
Arm A:  stem cell transplant alone using 300 cG y TBI (closed to enrollment)  
Arm B:  stem cell transplant plus serial MSC infusions  using 300 cG y TBI (closed to 
enrollment)  
Arm D:  stem cell transplant alone using 200 cGy BID  TBI for 8/8 HLA -matched bone 
marrow recipients  
Arm E:  stem cell transplant plus serial MSC infusions using 200 cGy AND TBI for 8/8 
HLA-matched bone marrow recipients  
Arm F: stem cell transplant  along using 200 cGy BID TBI plus addition of  low dose 
Busulfan for HLA -mismatched bone marrow recipients  
Arm G: stem cell transplant plus serial MSC infusions 200 cGy BID TBI plus addition of 
low dose Busulfan for HLA -mismatched bone marrow recipients  
 
In event of graft failure (failure to engraft, autologous recovery or loss of graft), patients 
may be eligible for re -transplant on this study (Arm C) or through the University of 
Minnesota BMT protocol MT2013- 06 (if <1 year from first BMT) or on this study (Arms D -
G) (if >/=1 year from first BMT).  
Primary 
Objective:  To estimate  the event -free survival rate by 1 year post -transplant  with an e vent defined as 
death or a 50% increase in a patient ’s iscoreEB from baseline  
Secondary 
Objectives:  • To document the percentage change of a patient’s iscoreEB at 1 and 2 years as 
compared with baseline 
• To determine the incidence of  transplant -related mortality (TRM) at day 180  
• To describe health quality of life at 1 and 2 years as compared to pretreatment results  
• To determine p roportion of lymphoid and myeloid  chimerism at various time- points 
(days 28, 60, 100, 180, and year 1 and 2) among surviving patients  
Key 
Eligibility:  Diagnosis of severe form of EB with documented  collagen, laminin, integrin, keratin or 
plakin deficiency  
0-25 years of age  
An available healthy HLA matched or partially HLA matched related or unrelated donor 
for HSC graft and MSC  
Adequate renal, hepatic, cardiac and pulmonary function

 Key 
Exclusion:  Evidence of HIV infection or known HIV positive serology; current active serious infection; 
diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma; beta -3 laminin JEB , donor with EB ; pregnancy  
Enrollment 
Plan:  Enroll up to  25 patients per year for a total of 69 patients  
An optimal interim analysis for futility without suspension of accrual  due to the long 
primary endpoint of event -free survival at 1 year post HCT will be performed after 36 
patients are enrolled. Given the change in conditioning (300 cGy TBI to 200 cGy bid TBI, 
then inclusion of low dose busulfan), enrollment will start over for the purpose of 
analyses; the currently enrolled 15 patients plus the planned new cohort of 69 patients for 
a total of 84.

 MSC:  donor mesenchymal stem cell  infusions  offered post-transplant every 2 months (±14 days ) through 10 months 
post BMT ; however these time  points may be altered on an individual patient basis at the discretion of the treating 
investigator.  
 
Re-Transplant Option for  Graft Failure  (not part of the above schema)  
In the event of graft failure,  time from first transplant should be considered when determining the intensity of 
conditioning required.  
If <1 year since the initial BMT, two options are available:  
1) Re-transplant the patient within this protocol (ARM C)  
2) Re-transplant by enrolling patient on the University of Minnesota BMT protocol MT2013-06: Treatment of 
Graft Failure after HSCT  (PI – T. Lund) while continuing follow -up per this protocol  
If >/= 1 year since the initial BMT: Re -transplant on this protocol as a new subject on A RM D-G, which ever is 
appropriate.  
Ideally the same donor would be used for both transplants; however it is recognized this is not always an option.

 2 Background  
2.1 Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB)  
Dystrophic EB (DEB) is a group of heritable mechanobullous skin diseases 
characterized by skin fragility, blister formation, and scarring . The most severe 
forms of DEB are characterized by mutilating scarring, blisters over large proportions of the body surface and later on, mitten deformities, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, corneal erosions, chronic cutaneous infections and 
aggressiv e squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
1-3. Children and adults with recessive 
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) are often faced with a life of pain, often 
dying of SCC. SCC can appear as early as 13 years of age with 50% having SCC 
if they survive to age 40 years. The prognosis of a DEB patient with SCC is very 
poor with nearly all dying of metastatic disease. Patients with the severe DEB have 
profound physical disabilities. Daily activities (e.g., t oileting, feeding, bathing, 
walking) are major challenges. Quality of life also tends to decline with age. Caretakers are consumed by the day to day care of the child with DEB.  
 Type VII collagen (C7) is synthesized by both human keratinocytes and fibroblasts . 
It is secreted within the basement membrane zone (BMZ) lying between the 
epidermis and dermis of skin. C7 is the major component of anchoring fibrils (AF) 
which are necessary for normal epidermal -dermal adherence. Genetic defects in 
the collagen type VII gene, COL7A1 , result in RDEB. Ultrastructurally, abnormal 
morphology and low numbers or absence of AFs result s in cleavage and 
detachment of the sublamina densa from the underlying dermis and extreme skin 
fragility ( Figure 1 ). DEB can be inherited as an autosomal dominant or autosomal 
recessive disease with blisters and scarring often present at birth or shortly 
thereafter. The blisters in the neonate often cover the whole body, including oral and esophageal mucosa, and it continues throughout life.

Several new therapies targeting wounds in RDEB have been developed, including 
local cell therapy with skin fibroblasts
4, 5 and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells,6 
gene therapy with gamma- retroviral7 or lentiviral vectors,8-10 and C7 protein 
replacement therapy.11-13 These innovations emanate d from decades of preclinical 
molecular and cellular studies by highly motivated teams around the globe, 3, 5, 14-
20. Despite the ‘impossible -to-forget’ appearance of a child with RDEB, the 
pathology of generalized severe RDEB is best understood as a global one, with multiple external and internal organ systems affected (cutaneous and gastrointestinal) and wi th whole body responses (such as compromised nutrition, 
anemia, pruritus, chronic inflammation, local and systemic infections) amplifying 
the injury of the underlying C7 deficiency. Therefore, as an alternative to local  
gene, cell and protein therapies, we sought systemic and possibly permanent 
cross- correction of C7 in the extracellular matrix using durable transplantation of 
self-renewing blood and marrow stem cells.  
2.2 Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in EB  
To investigate a possibility of systemic stem cell therapy for generalized severe 
RDEB , we transplanted congenic wild- type bone marrow cells (among a variety of 

MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 17 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 other stem cell types) into neonatal mice with a targeted disruption of the Col7a1  
gene21 that results in widespread blistering and early death due to the absence of 
C7 expression. We hypothesized that there was a stem cell population in bone 
marrow that homed to injured skin near the DE J and produced cellular progeny  
which secreted wild- type C7 protein in the area where it was needed. While various 
non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic cell populations from bone marrow failed to 
successfully correct the disease, it turned out that an infusion of highly purified bone marrow progenitors (CD150+ CD 48- cells),
22  migrated to injured skin and 
secreted C7. AFs were partially restored, and blisters on paws healed23 within the 
14 day window prior to death of untreated affected pups. Thus, donor cells capable 
both of secreting C7 and homing to the injured mucocutaneous membranes led to 
partial correction of the disease phenotype. With this functional correction of C7 in 
a murine model o f human RDEB, data from Chino et al.24 also demonstrating 
similar effects with  prenatal CD90- depleted bone marrow, and absence of any 
other curative approach for  severe RDEB, we sought to examine the safety and 
efficacy of allogeneic blood and marrow  transplantation as a treatment for  children 
with the severest forms of RDEB.  
 
Hematopoietic cell transplantation.  Our first clinical trial25 of systemic cellular 
therapy  (hematopoietic cell transplantation, HCT)  for a genodermatosis 
demonstrated that a) donor cells home to injured skin and do so in unexpectedly 
high numbers, b) expression of C7 is increased and sustained for many years after blood and marrow transplantation, and c) AFs gradually appear and increase in numbers . Clinically, nearly all patient have experienced some improvement in the 
maintenance of overall skin integrity ( Figure 2 ). However, none of the HCT 
recipients has become 
entirely free of wounds, 
and several children 
experienced severe 
complic ations, including 
death as a result of the 
HCT-related toxicities of 
the high -dose 
chemotherapy used as 
myeloablative 
conditioning (MAC) or 
RDEB disease 
progression, or both. 
Therefore, with the 
ultimate aim of 

MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 18 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 improving the efficacy and safety of HCT for the systemic and durable therapy of 
generalized severe RDEB, we sequentially modified the HCT treatment protocol (Figure 3 ) with the addition of supplemental cells and reduced intensity 
conditioning (RIC). The former, addition of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells 
(MSC), has been based on identification of non- hematopoietic donor cells in skin 
of HCT recipients ( Figure 4 ), on the capacity of MSC to secrete C7, and on their 
immune- modulatory potential to mitigate graft -versus -host disease, one of the 
common imm une complications of allogeneic HCT. The latter, RIC, has been 
introduced to assess whether less than complete hematopoietic chimerism can 
mediate adequate clinical response in the setting of conditioning regimen that is expected to result in less morbidit y and mortality after allogeneic HCT.  
 
Patients treated to -date. In total, between 2007 and 2014, 26 individuals (0.4-
20y) with life -threatening, severe generalized form of RDEB have undergone 
allogeneic HCT . Of these, 13 were treated with a MAC (busulfan, fludarabine 
[FLU], and cyclophosphamide [CY]) and 13 were treated with RIC (CY, FLU, anti -
thymocyte globulin, and low dose total body irradiation). RDEB subjects received 
HCT from related (N=15, all bone marr ow grafts), or an unrelated donor (N=11; 6 

MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB

 bone marrow grafts and 5 umbilical cord blood grafts). For the recent 20 individuals 
(the first 6 have been reported in reference 25), the patient characteristics, grafts 
and outcomes are summarized in Table 1  for MAC and Table 2  for RIC. In a cohort 
of patients with another generalized severe form of EB, junctional EB (JEB), two 
children were transplanted using the MAC, and four using  the RIC . Four of six 
patients died between days 42 and 146 after HCT, predominantly from progression 
of their primary genodermatosis. As severe JEB is genetically heterogeneous, it is relevant to note that the two surviving individuals with severe JEB have loss -of-
function mutations in LAMA3  gene, while those who died had genetic inactivation 
of LAMB3  and, in one case ITGB4  gene. As only six JEB patients have been 
treated since the study was opened there are still too few to accurately assess outcome/efficacy for this subgroup.  Thus the review  below  has been confined to 
the 26 RDEB patients.

 Safety outcomes.  The overall probability of  2-year survival in t he MAC  cohort 
(N=13) was 69% (95% CI, 37- 87 %) versus 90% (95% CI, 47- 99%) for the RIC 
(N=13) cohort (p=0.3). Of the 20 recent RDEB patients, three individuals died 
before one year after HCT (MAC: RII -4 of veno -occlusive disease, RII -7 of fungal 
sepsis; RIC: RIII -6 of fungal sepsis); one patient died after one year (MAC: RII -3 
of extensive chronic GvHD; Tables 1 a nd 2). Three individuals did not engraft with 
donor cells (MAC: RII -2, RIC: RIII- 4, RIII- 8; Tables 1 and  2). There were no 
statistically significant survival differences in comparison of related versus 
unrelated grafts, bone marrow versus umbilical cord bl ood grafts, and those who 
received additional MSC versus those who have not. One individual in each cohort (MAC: RII -7, RIC: RIII- 9) developed acute GvH (grade 2, with stage 3 skin 
involvement - erythroderma); one individual developed extensive chronic GvH  
(MAC: RII -3).  
 Efficacy outcomes.  Our primary efficacy measure was the event -free survival rate 
by 1 year after HCT with an event defined as death or failure to have demonstrable increase in C7 or other biochemical, structural or physical measure of improvement.  The overall probability of 2- year event -free survival in the MAC 
cohort (N=13) was 62% (95% CI, 31- 82 %) versus 82% (95% CI, 44- 95%) for the 
RIC (N=13) cohort (p=0.3).  
 Donor -recipient chimerism . Hematopoietic engraftment was near -complete in 
those treated with MAC . As expected with lower doses of conditioning 
chemotherapy, engraftment was significantly lower in those treated with RIC: on 
average 26% in CD15 cells and 55% on CD3 cells 100 days after HCT. The 
maximum skin chimerism in those with successful hematopoietic engraftment  was 
on average 31% in MAC cohort, 10% in RIC with 200cGy TBI, and 15% in RIC with 300cGy ( Tables 1 and 2). Thus skin chimerism correlated proportionally with 
hematopoietic one, and provided structural and functional link s between bone 
marrow and biochemical, structural and physical measures of mucocutaneous changes after HCT.  
 
Biochemical measure -  C7 expression . We observed increase in C7 
immunofluorescence in two RDEB individuals treated with MAC (RII -1 and RII -7; 
in addition to those reported previously ), and in four individuals treated with RIC 
(RIII- 1, RIII- 2, RIII- 5 and RIII -6). In support of a mechanistic model whereby 
engrafted bone marrow serves continuously as a source of cells capable of 
migration to injured sk in and secretion of C7, in individuals available for long term 
assessment, we were able to detect this increase at 1- 3 years after HCT. In several 
others the change in C7 expression after HCT was less obvious as they showed,

February 5, 2019  Page 24 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 despite severe clinical phenoty pe, baseline C7 immunoreactivity before HCT (RIC: 
RIII-3, RIII-9, RIII- 10, RIII- 13).  
 
Structural measure -  Anchoring fibrils  (AFs). AFs are homotrimers of C7 and 
the most direct structural foundation of the C7 function at the DEJ. In some 
individuals (for  example, RII -1) we saw no AFs despite increased C7 expression 
after HCT; in others (for example, RIII -1 and RIII -10) AFs have been seen after 
HCT.  
 Physical measure -  Functional skin stability . Given that our ultimate goal for 
RDEB individuals is functio nal skin, we aimed to assess its integrity before and 
after HCT in a quantitative way. We employed a suction blister device whereby constant negative pressure is applied to skin and time to blistering is proportionate to capacity of skin layers to adhere t o each other. As AFs mediate connectivity of 
epidermis and dermis the longer the time the skin is able to withstand the negative 
pressure applied to it is a measure of C7 expression, polymerization, and its 
functional integration in skin. Typically, indivi duals with RDEB experience blistering 
within 10 minutes, healthy people in approximately 60 minutes, and the obligatory heterozygotes (such as, the parents of RDEB children) in 30- 50 minutes. Critically, 
in several representative examples from both MAC and  RIC trials, serial 
assessments of RDEB subjects after HCT showed gradual increase in skin resilience under pressure ( Figure 5 ).

Clinical assessment . The individual metrics of biochemical, structural and 
physical changes in skin, including the compound measure of functional skin 
stability with suction blister device, while critical to local quantitative assessment 
of treatment intervention, do not capture entirely the complex pathology in its 
impact on health of individuals with RDEB. However, 
clinical 
photographs 
documenting skin 
responses as they 
differ among 
individuals with 
RDEB, unveil the 
impact of HCT in 
the most definitive 
way ( Figure 6 ).

2.3 Rationale for Treatment 
Plan  
The key motivation for changing 
the HCT conditions in the individuals with EB is to improve 
efficacy and safety . The reduced 
intensity chemotherapy ( RIC) 
approach has dramatically 
improved the safety (treatment -
related morbidity and mortality) . 
However, hematopoietic chimerism has been mixed and, 
expectedly, skin chimerism has 
been lower than that seen in the MAC cohort . Assuming that production of C7 (and  
other cutaneous adhesive molecules) is directly proportionate to the number of 
donor cells in skin, the higher skin chimerism is desirable, and— based on our 
comparison between MAC versus RIC groups —achievable with complete 
hematopoietic chimerism . The pos sibility of an acceptable safety profile together 
with near -complete hematopoietic engraftment has recently become possible with

February 5, 2019  Page 27 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 improvements in related HLA -haploidentical HCT using high dose post -transplant 
cyclophosphamide26-28.  
The key benefits of this post -grafting strategy are [1] a dramatic reduction of severe 
GvHD (which has been limiting for early versions of haploidentical HCT), [2] the 
ability to limit post -HCT immunosuppression and thus allow for earlier and 
qualitatively superior immune reconstitution, and [3] the rapid availability of a donor
29-32. For pat ients with EB specifically, this translates to [1] less skin injury (by 
GvH reaction) in an already damaged skin, [2] better and faster establishment of immune response in people with multiple open wounds, typically already colonized or infected with polym icrobial drug -resistant species, and [3] shortening the time 
between the decision to transplant and the HCT itself, which is particularly relevant in generalized severe JEB, which has a mean survival of less than 6 months of 
age.  
Therefore,  we propose to adapt the most robust and tested approach to deplete 
alloreactive cells in vivo  by [1] administering high doses of cyclophosphamide in a 
narrow window after HCT (originally developed by scientists at the John Hopkins 
University School of Medicine but now adopted nationally and internationally for 
many neoplastic as well as non- malignant indications)
28, 33- 35. This plan uses 
combination chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), immunotherapy 
(thymoglobulin), and radiotherapy (total body irradiation) prior to HCT . Post-
transplant i mmunosuppressive therapy consists of high-dose cyclophosphamide 
with MESNA protective therapy, followed by tacrolimus (omit for persons with HLA identical (8/8) related donors) and mycophenolic acid mofetil  (MMF ) as described 
in detail in Section 7 (Treatment Plan).  
Induction o f tolerance with post -HCT cyclophosphamide is bidirectional: 
eradication of both donor and host alloreactive T cells reduces the incidence of both GvH and host versus graft (HvG) reactions
36, 37. This is relevant for EB 
cohorts, as we have observed graft failur e in several individuals (Tables 1 and 2). 
In order to advance from the state- of-art current platform, we will prioritize 
matched- sibling HLA -identical donors over T -cell-replete haploidentical donors 
and HLA -matched unrelated donors —using the same conditi oning before and after 
HCT. Therefore, with or without crossing the HLA barrier, we expect to be able to 
rapidly identify a favorable donor for nearly all patients.  
As RDEB and JEB are inherited genodermatoses, the haploidentical donor pool 
might be reduced but likely only minimally (in relatives with autosomal dominant 
mutations that are present in the compound heterozygosity state in the proband 
with autosomal recessive disease). Moreover, it is relevant that carriers of 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 28 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 autosomal recessive mutations (par ents, the obligatory heterozygotes) are 
typically asymptomatic, and matched- sibling donors that are heterozygotic for 
these mutations have been used with success as HCT donors (with no discernible 
clinical difference in outcomes of such heterozygous -matched sibling HLA -
identical HCT and homozygous wild- type matched sibling HLA -identical or HLA -
matched unrelated donor HCT; Tables 1 and 2).   
Moreover, s ystemic infusions of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have 
been found safe in a large number of disorders, including RDEB6, 38- 44. As they are 
not HLA -matched to the recipient, and sometimes not to the HCT donor, as 
expected these “third party MSCs” are rejected and thus their effects are limited, 
typically to several weeks. Our present approach is based on the advantage of 
most donors being related (matched sibling donors or haploidentical family 
members) to the recipient and the ability to culture MSCs from marrow at the time 
of HCT harvest . Accordingly, we will obtain, screen, and qualify these MSC 
cultures in time for systemic infusions at months 2, 4, and 6; and additionally 
offered at  8, and 10 months . The cell dose will be 1 -2 million MSCs per kilogram 
of recipient weight; a dose that has repeatedly been shown to be safe in a clinical 
setting.  
The sum of experimental and clinical data supports the conclusion that, contrary 
to the prevailing professional opinion of the last several decades, protein 
replacement therapy by allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation is not limited 
to freely diffusible molecules, such as enzymes, but also large structural proteins, 
such as collagens and perhaps laminins . While HCT improve the integrity of the 
skin and mucous membranes, future strategies will be built on the improvements 
of HCT (this protocol) and on concept of c ombination therapy ( Figure  7).

Rationale for Re -Transplant in the Event of Graft Failure  
Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo- HCT) has become a new 
standard of care for selected malignant disorders58,59. This has been enabled by T 
cell depletion, either ex vivo (by T cell depletion of the graft) or in vivo (by post -
transplant cyclophosphamide, PTCy, administration). Remarkably, this strategy 
has been shown to be reasonably safe and highly efficacious in non- malignant, 
typically genetic, disorders treatable by HCT. For example, sickle cell disease, 
thalassemia, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, dyskeratosis congenita, or Fanconi 
anemia have been treated successfully with haplo- HCT60-68. One of th e limitations 
of haplo- HCT, especially with better tolerated reduced intensity conditioning, is 
failure to engraft. Fortunately, second transplants for either aplastic graft failure or 
recovery of autologous hematopoiesis have been almost always successful69-72. 
This is further supported by haplo- HCT data from diseases that present as 
“natural” graft failure- equivalents, that is, bone marrow failures such as seen in 
dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia or idiopathic severe aplastic anemia— all 
of which hav e been shown to respond favorably to allo- HCT. Therefore, our 

MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 30 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 approach of using second transplant after graft failure in patients with generalized 
severe EB, is expected to result in similar favorable safety and efficacy profile. This 
is likely to be furth er enhanced by the use of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells from 
allo-HCT donor after the second allo- HCT transplant. The plan for re- transplant 
includes administration of additional MSC doses after the second transplant, 
following the same schedule as the initial transplant. With depletion of marrow 
during the second transplant, the rationale for this repeated MSC administration is 
not different from the rationale for MSC administration in the initial transplant. MSC 
dosing at month 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 may pro mote engraftment, skin healing and 
diminish the risk of graft versus host disease. In addition to this rationale, 
administration of MSCs following a second transplant will ensure consistency in 
the plan of care and outcome data.   
Rationale for Increased Dose of TBI (300 cGy to 200 cGy BID ) 
As of November 2016, we have had incidences of autologous recovery after 
transplant (i.e. engraftment of the patient's own cells after transplant, rather than 
the donor cells). Although not unexpected, we do strive to reduce these 
occurrences as much as possible. Dr. Tolar, the study Sponsor -Investigator , 
consulted with other experts in BMT at the University of Minnesota, as well as 
international leaders in haploidentical transplant, to identify a plan to better 
promote engraftment of the donor cells. The resounding suggestion has been to 
increase the dose of TBI to 200 cGy BID (rather than 300 cGy). Leading BMT MDs 
in haploidentical transplants at Johns  Hopkins (Drs. Symons, Luznik & Fuchs) 
have implemented this change in a similar patient population (i.e. non- malignant 
disease, marrow not previously prepped with chemotherapy/radiation), with much 
improved full donor engraftment (4 /5 patients had full donor engraftment with 400 
cGy TBI vs 11 /34 patients with 200 cGy TBI ) and no additional ill effects 
experienced by patients.  (unpublished data, personal communication)  
 
Rationale for Exclusion of beta -3 laminin JEB  
Interim analysis of early subjects found no lasting benefit for the patients with beta 
3 laminin 332 mutation.   
 
Rationale for Addition of Low Dose Busulfan for HLA -mismatched stem cell 
recipients  
As of November 2018, five of 14 (36%) enrolled patients exhibited graft failure with 
autologous recovery  (no aplastic graft failure) , including 2 of 8 patients receiving 
the increased dose of TBI (200 cGy BID as opposed to a single fraction of 300 cGy 
following the November 2016 protocol modification. A thorough interim evaluation 
of potential factors mediated autologous recovery was c ompleted, considering 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 31 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 donor type, presence of recipient anti -HLA antibodies [both panel reactive 
antibodies (PRA) and donor specific antibodies (DSA)], pre- conditioning and day 
0 absolute lymphocyte counts, and bone marrow CD34+ stem cell counts. Graft 
failure with autologous recovery predominated in haploidentical parent recipients 
(4 of 4, 100%; 1 of 3 in haploidentical sibling, 0 of 1 in HLA -matched related donor, 
and 0 of 5 in HLA -matched sibling recipients). Eight of 11 tested patients (3 
receiving mat ched sibling bone marrow not tested) had positive PRA, though only 
3 had DSA. Of those patients with DSA, the earliest two had graft failure with 
autologous recovery. The 3rd patient with DSA underwent a debulking protocol 
including immunosuppression to decrease production of antibodies and 
plasmapheresis to remove pre- existing antibodies to limit the risk of immune 
mediated graft rejection. This patient had successful donor engraftment. There 
were no statistically significant associations between engraftment and pre- BMT 
absolute lymphocyte count (p=0.92) or day 0 absolute lymphocyte count (p=0.36), 
or CD34+ stem cell dose (p>0.99).  
 
The importance of DSA and potential role in immune mediated graft failure has 
been recognized and mitigation with debulking st andardized. This is reflected in 
the current Donor Selection criteria. The engraftment barrier with haploidentical 
parent donors is likely the result of inadequate patient myeloablation. We strive to 
reduce the risk of this complication by escalating the i ntensity of conditioning for 
recipients of HLA -mismatched grafts with inclusion of low dose busulfan.  
3 Study Design  
This is a single -institution , phase II study to determine the event -free survival at 1 year 
post allogeneic transplant with or without serial mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
infusions from a related donor ( HLA identical, mismatched or haploidentical ) or 
matched unrelated donor  for the biochemical correction of severe epidermolysis 
bullosa  (EB).  
A single marrow harvest is performed to collect the stem cells for the transplant 
procedure and, with the donor’s consent;  an additional 40- 50 ml sample is collected 
at this time for the production of MSC  for post -transplant infusions. If the donor refuses 
to consent for the extra marrow collection, the patient will receive only the transplant . 
The patient will be enrolled, based on the donor’s consent to either:  
Arm A:   hematopoietic  cell transplant alone using 300 cGY of TBI  (closed to accrual)  
Arm B:   hematopoietic  cell transplant plus serial MSC infusions  using 300 cGY of TBI  
(closed to accrual)

February 5, 2019  Page 32 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 Arm C:  re -transplant using 300 cGy of TBI  (regardless of original transplant arm)  if 
<1 year from first BMT  
Effective with the November 2016 version of the protocol:  
Arm D:  hematopoietic  cell transplant alone using 200 cGY BID of TBI  (400 cGy total)  
for recipients of 8/8 HLA -matched bone marrow  
Arm E:  hematopoietic  cell transplant plus serial MSC infusions  using 200 cGY BID 
of TBI  (400 cGy total)  for recipients of 8/8 HLA -matched bone marrow  
Effective with the November 2018 version of the protocol:  
Arm F:  hematopoietic cell transplant alone using 200 cGy BID of TBI (400 cGy total) 
+ addition of low dose busulfan for recipients of HLA -mismatched bone marrow  
Arm G:  hematopoietic cell transplant plus serial MSC infusions using 200 cGy BID of 
TBI (400 cGy total) + addition of low dose busulfan for recipients of HLA -mismatched 
bone marrow  
A preparative regimen consisting of thymoglobulin, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 
and total body irradiation is  administered prior to a T cell replete donor marrow 
infusion . Post-transplant cyclophosphamide is given on day 3 and 4 to deplete 
alloreactive c ells. 
Graft -versus -host-disease prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid 
mofetil (MMF) is started on post -transplant day 5 and continued through day 35 or 7 
days after engraftment for MMF and day 100  for tacrolimus (start of taper) . Tacro limus 
is eliminated if a fully matched (HLA identical) donor is used.  
Local wound therapy will be offered as clinically indicated  using the FDA approved 
vacuum device (CelluTome®, Regulation number 878.4820). Patients will receive 
local wound therapy using  epidermal skin grafting from the same donor (donor 
consent required) that provided the hematopoietic graft.  
For patients enrolled in Arm E and G,  MSCs will be infused every 2 months ( ± 14 
days)  through 10 months  post-transplant  (months 8 and 10 offered if patient is 
available) ; however these time points may be altered on an individual patient basis at 
the discretion of the treating investigator .  
Disease reassessments will be performed at days 28, 60, 100, and 180,  then at 12 
and 24 months post -transplant.  
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 33 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 In the event of graft failure ( e.g. lack of engraftment, autologous recovery , loss of 
graft), time from the first transplant should be considered when determining the 
intensity of conditioning required.  
If the 2nd transplant will occur <1 year since the first transplant, two options are 
available:  
1) Re-trans plant the patient within this protocol (Arm C)    
2) Re-transplant the patient by enrolling on the University  of Minnesota BMT protocol 
MT2013- 06: Treatment of Graft  Failure after HSCT (PI –  T. Lund) while continuing 
follow -up per this protocol  
If the 2nd transplant will occur >/=1 year following the first transplant: The 2nd BMT 
could be completed on this protocol as a new subject on ARM D -G, whichever is 
appropriate based on HLA -match and donor consent for MSC production.  
Ideally the same donor will be used for the re- transplant; however it is recognized that 
this will not a lways be possible.  
At the discretion of the treating physician and with the donor’s permission, extra 
marrow for MSCs may be collected at the time of the bone marrow harvest . If the 
patient has donor MSCs available (either from the original transplant or the re-
transplant) , they may be infused in the same manner and schedule as detailed after 
the original transplant using day 0 of the second transplant . Targeted toxicities will be 
assessed at time of all MSC infusions.  
All other tests/procedures and follow -up milestone visits would continue to be based 
on the initial transplant day  for statistical analysis purposes . For those that are re-
transplanted on arm C, standard of care and research testing will restart at second transplant day 0 in addition to the remaining follow -up milestones from initial transplant 
day. The window for these assessments may be expanded so these time points 
coincide if in the best interest of the patient.   
4 Patient Selection  
External Advisory  Panel :  Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) for EB has 
spanned dermatology and transplantation biology in a novel fashion, and unquestionable RDEB expertise has been critical for success of the study. Therefore, we will continue to work with our External Advisory Panel (EAP): Professor John A. 
McGrath (St. John’s Institute of Dermatology, King’s College, London, United 
Kingdom), Professor Alain Hovnanian (Institut Federatif de Recherche Necker Enfants 
Malades, Paris, France) and Professor Katsuto Tamai (Department of Dermatology,

5 Donor Select ion 
Unrelated donors will be screened and consented per usual by the Donor Center using 
the Donor Match Selection Criteria found below .  
 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 35 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 Donors assessed at the University of Minnesota must meet the following criteria in 
addition to the Donor Match Selection Criteria .  
5.1 Be medically, socially, and psychologically fit to donate in the opinion of the 
evaluating medical personnel  
5.2 Does not have e pidermolysis bullosa * 
5.3 Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function to undergo the donor 
procedure in the opinion of the evaluating medical personnel  
5.4 Not pregnant  with confirmation of non- pregnancy status within 7 days of 
donation. Lactation is not a contra- indication to donation. Transmission of 
anesthetic medications via breast -milk is variable, dependent upon fat 
solubility of the medication, doses provided to the lactating donor, and infant 
enteral absorption. Transmission of anesthetic medications via breast milk is negligible and general anesthesia not a contraindication to continued breast feeding / pumping .
51-54 
5.5 Voluntary written consent -  adult or parent (with assent for minors, if 
applicable)  
*At the discretion of the primary BMT physician, donors with known positive carrier 
status for EB may be considered if in the opinion of the primary BMT physician, 
the donor is the best available.  
 
Donor Match Selection  Criteria : 
HLA-matched sibling (or 1 allele HLA -mismatched related) :  HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 
genotypic identical donor , or HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 phenotypic identical donor , or 7/8 
HLA-matched donor at HLA -A, B,  C, DRB1  
  
HLA mismatched or haploidentical related donors  (including 1st degree relatives 
and half siblings): The donor and recipient must be identical at least one allele of 
each of the following genetic loci: HLA -A, HLA -B, HLA -Cw, HLA -DRB1, and HLA -
DQB1 . A minimum match of 5/10 is therefore required, and will be considered 
sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.  
 
Matched unrelated donors : Unrelated volunteer donor matched for HLA -A, -B, -C 
and -DRB1 defined by high resolution molecular typing.

 6 Patient and Donor Registration  
Registration will occur after the patient and/or parent/guardian  has signed the 
appropriate consent form and eligibility is confirmed, but before any study related 
procedures are performed . To be eligible for registration to this study, the patient must 
meet each of the criteria listed on the eligibility checklist based on the eligibility 
assessment documented in the patient’s medical record. A copy of the eligibility 
checklist is in appendi ces I and II and under attachments within the study in OnCore  
the Cancer Center’s clinical database.  
Donors will be registered in OnCore per Masonic Cancer Center guidelines.  
6.1 Registration with the Masonic Cancer Center Clinical Trials Office  
Upon completion of the screening evaluation, eligibility confirmation and obtaining written consent, the study coordinator or designee will register the 
patient in OnCore.  
The patient will be assigned to a statistical arm based on transplant only or transplant plus serial MSC infusions  and TBI dose .  
6.2 Patients Who Are Enroll ed and Do Not Receive Study Treatment
 
If a patient is registered to the study and is later found not able to begin study 
treatment, the patient will be removed from study and treated at the physician’s discretion. The study staff will update OnCore of the patient’s non- treatment 
status . Study data will be collected until the time the patient is taken off study . 
The reason for removal from study will be clearly indicated in OnCore. The 
patient will be replaced to complete enrollment .  
If a patient receives any study therapy and then is discontinued, regardless of 
the reason, the patie nt must be followed per section 7.8. 
6.3 Re-Transplant for Graft Failure  
 
Patients being re- transplanted due to graft failure within in this study reassigned 
to Arm C  (if <1 year from 1st transplant) or Arm D -G as appropriate (if >/=1 year 
from 1st transplant)  to release a new calendar and set of case report forms 
(CRFs) . For patients re- transplanted on MT2013- 06, no reassignment on this 
study is necessary .

 7 Treatment Plan  
In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical 
conditions, investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all supportive care drug therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, G -CSF, antimicrobials, etc.).  
Enrol lment is open to both pediatrics and adults; however, the vast majority or all 
patients will qualify for care through the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s 
Hospital and the treatment plan is written as such. If an adult  (>25 years of age)  is 
enrolled, he/she would receive all of their  care at the appropriate facilities within the 
University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview and the adult outpatient clinic(s) .

 7.1 Preparative Therapy  (day – 9 through day -1) 
The preparative therapy will be administered as written with no plans for dose 
modifications  except as described below.  
7.1.1  Rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin®) 
Thymoglobulin (rATG) will be infused through a 0.22 micro filter . The dose  
will be 0.5 mg/kg IV on day - 9 over 6 hours and 2 mg/kg IV on days - 8 and 
-7 over 4 hours.  
Pre-medications:

feeding tube 30 minutes prior to rATG  
• Diphenhydramine 1mg/kg/dose (Max Dose =50 mg by mouth or 
feeding tube 30 minutes prior to rATG   
• Hypersensitivity orders per standard guidelines during rATG 
administration.  
A steroid taper  will be given to prevent reactions to r ATG as follows:  
• On day - 9 to - 7, methylprednisolone 1mg/kg IV 1 hour prior r ATG. 
This dose may be repeated once,  3 hours after the first dose.  
• On day - 6 and - 5, methylprednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/ IV as a single 
dose;  
• On days - 4 and - 3, methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/ IV as a single 
dose;  
• On day -2 methylprednisolone 0.25 mg/kg/ IV as a single dose.  
7.1.2  Fludarabine  
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/dose IV every 24 hours  (adjusted for renal function  
per standard guidelines ). Administe r over a 60 minute IV infusion on Days 
–6 through – 2 (maximum cumulative dose =150 mg/m2).  
For children < 10 kg, fludarabine dosing will be 1 mg/kg IV over 1 hour . If > 
1 year of age, consider converting to mg/kg dosing after discussion between 
the protocol PI and pediatric BMT pharmacist.  
 If the adjusted creatinine clearance < 70 ml/min, a 20% dose- reduction of 
fludarabine may be considered after  discussion between the protocol PI and 
pediatric BMT pharmacist.

February 5, 2019  Page 41 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 Fludarabine dose adjustments for the purpose of poor renal function will  
not be considered a protocol deviation, but  will be noted in OnCore.  
7.1.3  Busulfan (Arms F and G only)  
Busulfan compounding, administration and monitoring should be performed per 
institutional guidelines and infused over 3 hours on days -3 and -2. Busulfan dosing 
will be determined based on the weight of the patients upon admission and per our 
institution busulfan standard of practice dose calculator  and nomogram  (Appendix 
VI). 
Seizure and VOD prophylaxis are prescribed according to institutional guidelines. Concomitant administration of azole anti -fungal agents (except fluconazole) and 
acetaminophen should be avoided within 72 hours before and after busulfan 
administration.  
7.1.4  Pre-Transplant Cyclophosphamide   
Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg/day will be administered as an IV infusion 
over 1 hour. Cyclophosphamide dosing is calculated based on actual weight 
(ABW) un less ABW is >150% above Ideal Body Weight (IBW) per institution 
guidelines.   
 Mesna 2.9 mg/kg IV 5 times daily  will be administered per institutional 
guidelines.  
7.1.5  Total Body Irradiation (TBI)  
 
For patients undergoing transplant on Arm D , E, F, or G : 
TBI will be given in two fractions on day - 1 at least 6 hours apart. Each 
fraction will consist of 200 cGy given with right and left lateral beams prescribed to the midplane at the umbilicus at a dose rate of 10- 19 
cGy/minute. The total TBI dose will be 400 cG y for patients on either of 
these arms.  
For patients undergoing second transplant on 2015 -20 Arm C : 
The dose of TBI will be 300 cGy in a single fraction on day - 1 with right and 
left lateral beams prescribed to the midplane at the umbilicus at a dose rate 
of 10 -19 cGy/minute.  
7.2 Hematopoietic Cell (Bone Marrow)  Infusion (day 0)  
Refer to section 8  for donor collection.  
 
Bone Marrow (T cell replete graft) will be harvested for infusion  on day 0 .

February 5, 2019  Page 42 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 In general there fore: 
• No T cell depletion  
Infus ion of  fresh, unirradiated bone marrow after filtration of bone fragments  
7.3 Post -Transplant Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV over 2 hours on day +3 and day +4 
Mesna and IV fluid  hydration will be administered per institutional guidelines .  
Cyclophosphamide dosing is calculated based on actual weight (ABW) unless 
ABW is  >150% above Ideal Body Weight (IBW) per institution guidelines .  
 
7.4 GVHD Prophylaxis  
On day 5, patients will begin prophylaxis with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic Acid Mofetil (MMF ). Patients will not be eligible for other GVHD prophylaxis studies.  
7.4.1  Tacrolimus  (Omit if 8/8 HLA- matched donor)  
Tacrolimus will be initiated on day +5 as a continuous infusion at a starting dose 
of 0.03 mg/kg/day. The patient will be converted to oral dosing when appropriate. Tacrolimus  will continue until day +100 with goals of 5- 10 ug/L . Starting on day 
101, the dose will be tapered 10% per week to discontinue at approximately day 
+180. Therapy with tacrolimus may continue past day +100 if GVHD is present 
or if patient is still a mixed chimera.  
Tacrolimus may be discontinued earlier than Day 100 (with an appropriate taper 
plan) in the context of graft failure, or prohibitive toxicity . It is suggested that 
patients with suspected graft failure remain o n tacrolimus until at least the ~Day 
60 chimerism assessment.   
7.4.2  Mycophenolic Acid Mofetil  (MMF)  
Mycophenolic acid mofetil will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg IV (based upon actual body weight) every 8 hours  with the maximum total daily dose not to 
exceed 3 grams (1 g IV TID ). BMT patients have unpredictable oral bioavailability 
of MMF . Consider consulting the pediatric BMT pharmacist when changing MMF 
doses or routes of administration. MMF pharmacokinetics are not required on this protocol, but may be obtain ed when clinically indicated. Consult with the 
pediatric BMT pharmacist for AUC interpretations and dose adjustments when necessary.  
 If no acute GVHD, MMF prophylaxis will be discontinued after the last dose on day 35, or 7 days after engraftment, whichev er is later . Definition of engraftment 
is 1
st day of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >0.5 x109/L.

 7.5 Serial MSC Infusions ( months 2, 4, 6; and optionally at 8, and 10 ) – Arms 
E, G and if Applicable, Arm C  
Refer to section 8 regarding MS C production and storage.  
Month 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 post-transplant are the “targeted” infusion time points; 
however, these time points may be adjusted to best fit individual patient situations 
as deemed most appropriate by the treating investigator . Adjustments to the 
MSC schedule may be made without being  considered a protocol deviation.  
Doses at 8 and 10 months are optional and would be based on patient availability to return to UMMC.  
MSC  will be administered at a dose of 1 -2 x 10
6/kg at the months (± 14 days)  2, 
4 and 6: and offered at  8 and 10  months  post-transplant in those patients whose 
donor consented to the additional marrow collection per section 8. The cells will 
be thawed at the “bedside”.  
Premedication (with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine,  anti-emetic) and/or 
additional hydration are not required. The product is infused via IV drip directly 
into the central line as tolerated by the patient without a needle or pump. MSCs 
can also be given via a peripheral IV (PIV) when a central line is not available. 
While adverse events are rare based on substantial past experiences with MSCs, infusional toxicity will be evaluated by continuous monitoring of the subject’s vital 
signs and O
2 saturation by pulse oximetry during the MSC administration.  For 
two hours after MSC administration, O2 saturation will be monitored at regular 
intervals and when clinically indicated. Infusional toxicity will be indicated by a 
decrease in oxygen saturation during the infusion period. After the product bag 
empties, the bag and IV tubing will be flushed with sterile normal saline. Saline 
may be either injected directly into the bag or a 50 cc saline IV bag may be attached to the product bag . Post infusion assessments will be done per section 
11.2.  
7.6 Concurrent Therapy and Supportive Care  
Supportive care will be provided per institutional guidelines . Guidelines may be 
updated based on current data/drugs without requiring a protocol amendment or 
being  considered a protocol deviation.  
Due to the risk of squamous cell carcinom a associated with voriconazole, it is 
preferred that itraconazole be used for antifungal prophylaxis in this patient 
population . Additionally, empiric vancomycin therapy should only be used as 
appropriate according to the circumstances outlined in our inst itutional infection 
prophylaxis and therapy guidelines .

 7.6.1  Epidermal Grafting Using the CelluTome® Epidermal Harvesting 
System  
For patients with persistent wounds, local wound therapy  will be offered using 
epidermal skin grafting from the same donor that provided the hematopoietic 
graft with donor consent/assent . We will use FDA approved vacuum device 
(CelluTome®, Regulation number 878.4820) that enables scar -free harvesting 
of epidermis with negligible bleeding and minimal pain (commonly described as a sensation of warmth and mild pressure) and its transfer on a non- adhering 
silicone mesh dressing (i.e. Adaptic Touch™) to the recipient’s wound.  
EB Wounds  
We will identify regions indicated for grafting.  Such wounds would be open erosions  and apparently free of infection (as documented by physical 
exam —local redness, swelling, and pain—as microbiome is inevitable and 
physiologic on any muco- cutaneous surface).   
Healthy Skin Grafts   
We will identify optimal harvesting sites on the body of the donor . Alth ough 
the epidermal collection is essentially painless (donor will feel warmth and mild pressure at the site) and leaves no scar, we will not choose intensely exposed locations, such as head, neck, palms and soles.  As skin is developmentally, structurally and functionally different at different parts of 
the body we will attempt collection of epidermis from a general area on the 
donor ’s body that corresponds to the site of the wound being treated.  Of 
course, we are prepared to adapt to physical specifics and psychological choices of the donor , and we will not collect twice from exactly  the same 
site. 
Epidermal Transfer  
The grafting will be done in real time.  This FDA approved (Regulation 
number 878.4820) operating procedure will be followed in all details t o 
collect the donor epidermis from a maximum of 3 sites at one sitting  and 
transferred to open wound areas.   Grafts will be secured with bandages 
and ideally protected for at least 2 weeks, and preferably up to 3- 4 weeks 
if possible. Wounds will be observ ed for any signs of infection and 
photographed weekly as able.  
Sessions will be offered to patients at least 100 days post -transplant, with 
up to three total sessions occurring at least 12 weeks apart.  
Donor Eligibility  
• The HCT donor for the EB patient  
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 45 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 • Age > 2 years (based on prior safety testing of the device)  
• Healthy on physical examination in the opinion of the evaluating 
provider  
• Known negativity for Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and HTLV1/2  
• Voluntary written consent (donor or parent/guardian for minors with assent)  
7.7 Duration of Treatment  
All patient s will undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0 with 
standard of care post -transplant follow -up. In addition, if the donor agreed  to the 
collection of additional cells for MSC production, the patient will receive MSC 
infusions post -transplant  unless any of the following occurs:  
• consent is withdrawn or patient is noncompliant  
• patient experiences unacceptable toxicity  
• administering the MSCs would not be in the best interest of the patient   
7.8 Re-Transplant For Graft Failure  
Patients with graft failure (e.g. lack of engraftment, autologous recovery, loss of graft) may be re- transplanted with consideration of time from 1
st BMT informing 
intensity of conditioning.  
If the 2nd transplant will occur <1 year since the 1st transplant, two options are 
available:  
1) Re-transplant on this study (Arm C)   
2) Re-transplant on University  of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
(BMT) p rotocol MT2013- 06C while maintaining post-transplant follow -up 
visits  based on the original transplant  date 
 
If the 2nd transplant will occur >/=1 year following the first transplant: The 2nd BMT 
could be completed on this protocol as a new subject on ARM D -G, whichever is 
appropriate based on HLA -match and donor consent for MSC production.  
Re-transplant is done out of medical need. All aspects of the procedure will be 
within the standard of c are for re -transplant at this institution and charged  to the 
patient and/or 3rd party payer in the usual manner,   
At the discretion of the treating physician and with the donor’s permission, extra 
marrow for MSCs may be collected at the time of the bone m arrow harvest . If the 
patient has donor MSCs available (either from the original transplant or the re-
transplant) , they may be infused in the same manner and schedule as detailed 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 46 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 after the original transplant using day 0 of the second transplant . Targeted 
toxicities will be assessed at time of all MSC infusions.  
All tests/procedures  and follow -up milestone visits in association with the 1st 
transplant would continue.  
A formal statistical analysis  in association with the re- transplant will not be used 
as these patient s are already being analyzed within the context of the initial 
transplant . A descriptive analysis may also be completed for those transplanted 
on Arm C or retransplanted on Arms D -G, in regards to the standard of care and 
research testing that  will restart at second transplant day 0; the window for these 
assessments may be expanded so these time points coincide if in the best 
interest of the patient.  
7.9 Duration of Study Participation  
Evaluable patients will be followed for response, toxicity, and survival for 24  
months from the transplant  unless  consent is withdrawn.  
After 2 years, routine post -trans plant follow -up will continue. Survival status and 
other routine clinical information may be abstracted from the medical record or 
other data sources for up to 5 years from study registration.  
8 Bone Marrow Harvest and MSC Production 
Prior to the bone marrow collection it will be established if the donor has consented to 
the collection of additional BM for the production of MSCs .  
8.1 Bone Marrow Harvest for Tran splant  
Unrelated donor bone marrow will be collected in the usual manner using established parameters determined by the National Marrow Donor Program .  
 
Related donor bone marrow  (BM) will be collected according to current institutional 
guidelines . The bone marrow harvest will be performed on the transplant day (Day 
0). The BM will be infused the same day of collection. The nucleated cell target 
range will be between 2 and 10 x  108/kg of recipient ideal body weight with the 
volume not to exceed 20 mL/kg of donor's weight once the minimal target of 2 x 
108/kg has been reached. Given that there is always uncertainty about the 
feasibility of harvesting certain patients, the harvesting team will have the ability to 
stop the collection  if the minimum target of cells has not been reached and it is 
believed that  it will be unsafe or technically unfeasible to reach the mentioned 
target if harvest  was to continue after a reasonable effort has  been made. In this 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 47 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 case, the study  PI will be notified immediately and efforts should be made to assure 
at least a cell count of 2 x 108/kg of recipient ideal body weight.  For unrelated 
donors, a target nucleated cell dose of 5 x 108/kg will be requested.  
8.2 Risks of Donating Bone Marrow  
The most serious risk associated with donating bone marrow involves the use and 
effects of anesthesia during surgery . Other risks associated with bone marrow 
donation include soreness at the site(s) of collection, pain with walking and generalized weakness after the procedure.  
8.3 Additional Marrow Harvest for MSC Production with Donor’s Consent  
At the time of BM harvest, an additional 40- 50 mL BM will be taken from the donor 
for MSC culture  in donors who have agreed to the extra cell collection (embedded 
in the donor consent as a yes (agree)/no (refuse) checkbox) . If the donor has 
refused to the additional bone marrow collection, the transplant will proceed as 
plan, but the MSC infusions will not be done.  
8.4 MSC Manufacture and Stor age 
BM adherent cells are cultured under standardized conditions . After expansion 
culture, cells are removed for testing while the remainder is cryopreserved in 
aliquots for future use. MSCs will be banked prior to use and will not be released to a patient  until the results of all quality control assays (sterility, epitope analysis, 
and differentiation potential) satisfy lot -release criteria (as defined in the IND) . 
Details on the manufacturing procedure, including lot -release testing and 
specifications, ca n be found in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) 
section of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Only MSCs meeting lot -
release criteria will be available for clinical use.

It is very important that grapefruit or drinks with grapefruit juice are not consumed while 
taking Tacrolimus. Grapefruit has an ingredient called bergamottin, which can affect some of 
the treatment drugs used in this study . Common soft drinks that have bergamottin are Fresca , 
Squirt , and Sunny  Delight .  
9.5 Epidermal Grafting Using the CelluTome®  
9.5.1  Donor  
We do not expect any significant side- effects as this procedure has been 
accepted as safe in the field and used for treatment of number of skin conditions, 
such as vitiligo and diabetic leg ulcers, with an excellent safety profile.  Of note,  
the harvested tissue (epidermis) does not cross the basement membrane,  so the 
procedure is essentially painless  (donor will feel warmth and mild pressure at the 
site) and there is no t typically  residual visible scarring  unless there is a 
malfunction of the device or other unanticipated event.W e will still encourage  
examination  the sites of epidermal harvest via weekly photographs until healed 
and at 12 weeks ( as able)  for any abnormalities detectable by physical 
examination.

 9.5.2  Recipient  
Even though the graft and recipient are uniquely and fully HLA matched, there 
can be local (and much less likely systemic) effects of grafting.  Most prominent among these is non- engraftment (sloughing off the graft) because of subclinical 
infection, ongoing fibrosis and—related to that —inadequate vascular supply at 
the recipient site.  This can be accompanied by local inflammation with systemic 
febrile reaction, though none would be expected to be serious adverse events.

11 Adverse Event Monitoring, Recording and Reporting  
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE) and reported on the schedule 
below. A copy of the CTCAE events can be downloaded from 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40  
11.1 Definitions  
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)).  
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  Any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event:  Any eve nt not present prior to the initiation 
of the treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or 
frequency following exposure to the treatment . A treatment emergent AE refers to 
an event temporally related to the study treatment reg ardless of the causality 
assessment by the investigator.  
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 56 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the investigat or or sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death . Note:   a life -threatening 
event does not necessarily equate to a CTCAE grade 4.  
Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction :  An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction : An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not 
listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is 
not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. Thus, as defined by the FDA 
adverse events th at occur as part of the disease process or underlying medical 
conditions are considered unexpected; however, for the purposes of this study they 
will not be documented or reported.  
11.2 Adverse Event Monitoring, Recording and Reporting 
11.2.1  Event Monitoring  
Monitor ing for adverse events will begin with the start of the preparative 
regimen and continue through 1 year  post-transplant  anniversary visit .  
11.2.2  Event Recording/Documentation 
Due to the intentional clearing of the marrow with chemotherapy as 
preparation for the HCT, it is expected that all patients will experience 
severe depression of their blood counts and other related toxicities as 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 57 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 detailed in section 9 . Therefore, adverse event documentation  in 
OnCore for the purposes of this study will focus on : 
• All s erious  non-hematologic, non -infectious , non -dermatologic  
adverse events through neutrophil engraftment or Day 42, 
whichever is shorter  
• All serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions after Day 42 (or engraftment) through 1 year post -transplant upon knowledge  
• Targeted toxicities (appendix V) and unexpected suspected adverse reactions will be recorded for patients receiving MSCs at 
the following time points:  
o Prior to each MSC infusion  
o 4 hours ( ± 30 minutes) after each MSC infusion  
Transplant related outcomes wi ll continue to be collected as routine by 
the BMT Database.

 11.2.3  Event Reporting to the U of MN IRB, the FDA, and MCC  
Certain events, in addition to recording on the study’s eCRF’s , will require 
prompt report to the University of Minnesota and/or expedited reporting to 
the FDA  according to the table below:  
 At the time of continuing review/IND annual report, relevant events recorded 
in OnCore will be reported in summary format by those persons responsible 
for such reporting.  
11.3 
Monitoring for Stopping Rule Events  
In addition to the event monitoring and reporting described in the previous section, 
the following events will be considered excess toxicity per section 14.4 and be 
reported as a stopping rule event using the Event  Form found in OnCore:

 Stopping rule events only apply to the initial transplant procedure.  
A copy of the completed Event  Form must be sent to the SAE Coordinator ( mcc-
saes@umn.edu ) at the time it is submitted to the study statistician.  
As these events are outcomes of the treatment, not toxicity as found in CTCAE, 
they should only be recorded/reported as an adverse event, if they meet the criteria found in section 11.2.    
12 Data Collection and Monitoring  
12.1 Data Management  
This study will report clinical data using The Online Enterprise Research Management Environment (OnCore
TM), a web based Oracle® database utilizing 
study specific electronic case report forms . Key study personnel will be trained on 
the use of OnCore and will comply with protocol specific instructions embedded 
within the OnCore forms . Patient demographics, patient specific study treatment 
calendars, adverse events, reporting of deaths, and other information required for IND annual reporting will be placed in OnCore and other research databases 
maintained by MCC IT .  
12.2 Case Report Forms  
Participant data will be collected using protocol specific electronic case report forms (e -CRFs) developed within OnCore based on its library of standardized 
forms . The e -CRF will be approved by the study’s Principal Investigator and the 
Biostatistician prior to release for use. The Study Coordinator or designee will be 
responsible for completing e- CRFs based on the patient specific calendar, and 
updating the patient record until patient death or end of required study 
participation.  
12.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be in compliance with the 
University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center's Data & Safety  Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP), which can be accessed at http://z.umn.edu/dmsp
 
 
For the purposes of data and safety monitoring, this study is classified as high risk (investigator initiated protocol under an IND) . Therefore t he following requirements 
will be fulfilled:  
 The Masonic Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC) will 
review the trial’s progress quarterly . 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 60 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
  The PI will comply with at least twice yearly monitoring of the clinical protocol 
by the Masonic Cancer Center monitoring services .  
 The PI will oversee the submission of all reportable adverse events per the 
definition of reportable in section 11 .2.3 to the Masonic Cancer Center’s SAE 
Coordinator, the University of Minnesota IRB, and the FDA .  
 
In addition, at the time of the continuing review with the University of Minnesota 
IRB, a copy of the report with any attachments will be submitted to the Cancer Protocol Review Committee (CPRC).  
 
IND Annual Reports  
In accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312. 33, the IND sponsor (Dr. Tolar ) will 
submit a progress report annually . The report will be submitted within 60 days of 
the anniversary date that the IND went into effect .  
12.4 Record Retention  
The investigator will retain study records including source data, c opies of case 
report form, consent forms, HIPAA authorizations, and all study correspondence in a secured facility for at least 6 years after the study file is closed with the IRB 
and FDA .  
In addition, the University of Minnesota Clinical Trials Office (C TO) will keep a 
master log of all patients participating in the study with sufficient information to allow retrieval of the medical records for that patient.  
Please contact the U of MN CTO before destroying any study related records.  
13 Disease Outcome Measures  
Five s kin samples for tissue analysis will be obtained before the HCT and at day 
100, 180,  and 1 year   then annually after HCT  (additional skin samples may be 
taken as clinically indicated),  from areas approximately 1 mm from a wound border. 
Histo logical changes will be assessed with light microscopy and the expression of 
C7 with a panel of anti -C7 antibodies;25 ultrastructural changes assessed with 
transmission electron microscopy and presence of C7- containing  anchoring fibrils 
with immuno -electron microscopy;45 and donor engraftment in skin assessed by 
competitive polymerase- chain- reaction analysis of polymorphic variable- number 
tandem -repeat regions.  
For functional assessment of skin stability, the time needed to create blisters using 
suction with a vacuum device (NP2 model, Electronic Diversities, Finksburg, USA) 
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 61 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 will be measured. To test for anti -C7 antibodies in blood samples, a quantitative 
enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay will be used with the assessment of serum 
reactivity with the dermal side of the salt -split human skin46.  
For clinical evaluations, we will used instruments validated for scoring treatment 
outcomes in individuals with epidermolysis bullosa: disease severity tool 
(iscorEB)47.  
Photographs . A specialized camera or photograph with standard measuring 
system will be used at these time- points ( day of harvest, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 
1 year after grafting) to allow for quantitative assessment of wound size over time  
in correspondence with CelluTome treatments . Weekly photographs will also be 
requested as able until the week 12 visit to assess heal ing. 
14 Statistical Considerations  
14.1 Statistical Endpoints  
14.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
Event -free survival by 1 year post -transplant . An event will be defined as 
death or a 50% increase in a patient ’s iscoreEB from baseline . 
14.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
• Percentage change in is coreEB at 1 year and 2 years as compared to 
baseline calculated using each is coreEB total score  
• Probability of transplant -related mortality (TRM) at 180 days  
• Change in health quality of life pre-transplant as compared to at  1 and 2 
years post -transplant  as measured by the Lansky or Karnofsky score (10-
100)  
• Propor tion of lymphoid  and myeloid  chimerism at vari ous time- points (days 
28, 60, 100, 180, and year 1 and 2) among surviving patients  
14.1.3  Correlative  Endpoints  
• Levels of biochemical improvement as measured by protein expression  
(collagen, laminin, integrin, keratin or plakin) and related structural and 
physical changes  as derived from biopsy samples at days 100 and180, then 
at 1 and 2 years  using a binary result provided by Dr. Tolar’s lab  
• Chimerism results from skin biopsy samples at days 100 and 180, then at 1 
and 2 years  (and additional time points if collected as clinically indicated)  as 
performed by the Molecular Laboratory   
MT2015- 20:  Stem Cell Transplant and Serial MSC Infusions for EB       
 
    
February 5, 2019  Page 62 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 • Wound healing will be evaluated at milestone clinic visits (day 180, 1 and 2 
years post -transplant and as clinically indicated)  by relative change of 
wound area. It is measured as number of square cm of open wound area at the each time point/open wound area before skin grafting. It is also included 
in the total body surface ar e as noted in the i scorEB.  
• For patients who receive C elluTome, wound healing over time will be 
described by photographs taken prior to graft , at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 
year after treatments.  
14.1.4  Transplant  Related  Endpoints  
The following endpoints are abstracted from the BMT database:  
• Survival by 1 year  
• Grade II -IV and grade III -IV acute graft versus host disease (GvHD)  at 
Day 100  
• Chronic graft versus host disease at 1 year  
• Time to  neutrophil engraftment (defined as the first of three consecutive 
days after HCT that the patient’s absolute neutrophil counts is ≥  0.5x109 
per liter ) 
• The i ncidence of  sustained neutrophil engraftment (neutrophil 
engraftment without autologous recovery ) 
• Time to  platelet engraftment (defined as t he first time after HCT that the  
patient can sustain platelet count  ≥ 20x109 per liter for three consecutive 
days ) 
• Incidence of bacterial, viral and fungal infections at 1 year   
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
Arms A and B will be closed after enrollment of seven patients. Analyses of these 
patients will remain descriptive. Arms D and E will remain open but we expect to enroll approximately 8 additional patients due to the eligibility restriction to HLA 
matched siblings. The total enrollment on these two arms should be approximately 
16 so analyses will also primarily be descriptive. Due to the change/justification in 
conditioning (addition of Busulfan) for future patients receiving an HLA -
mismatched or haploident ical transplant as described in section 2.3, arms F and 
G will now be combined for assessment of the primary endpoint , secondary 
endpoints and the transplant related endpoints  since we do not expect the addition 
of MSCs t o alter these endpoint s based on ou r large past experience of more than 
1,000 patients
42,44,55- 57. Arms F and G may be separated, however, when 
assessing levels of biochemical improvement since MSC s may assume a role in 
collagen and laminin expression.  The planned 69 patients in Arms F and G will be

 survival and survival. Cumulative incidence will be used to estimate the probability 
of TRM, treating time to events as a competing  risk. Ninety -five percent confidence 
intervals will be estimated from respective standard errors. The proportion of donor 
chimerism or donor cells (including MSCs) at various time- points will be estimated 
among patients who have survived to the evaluated time- point along with 
descriptive plot s. Medians, ranges and inter -quartile ranges will be given for actual 
chimerism values and percentage change and absolute values of iscoreEB 
between baseline and 1 year along with descriptive box -plots . iscoreEB 
assessments will be evaluated among patients  surviving to 1 year post transplant. 
The Lansky or Karnofsky score will be measured by the proportion of patients with 
a score < 90 at each time- point. Specific focus will be on survivors at 1 and 2 years 
post-transplant. Simple proportions from binary measures will be used to describe 
the patterns of biochemical improvement over time from 5 different protein expressions. Wound healing will be assessed at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years 
descriptively by use of box -plots and estimating the average or median percent 
change in open wound area in relation to pre -skin grafting. In addition to primary 
and secondary endpoints, the transplant -related endpoints of acute and chronic 
GvHD, primary and sustained neutrophil and platelet engraftment and infections will be e stimated by cumulative incidence treating non- event death as a competing 
risk. Analyses and descriptive plots will be performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC) and/or R 3.0.2.   
14.3 Design and Sample -Size Justification  
This study is designed as a two-stage phase II trial to estimate event -free survival  
(EFS) . Since the goal is to estimate the EFS at a long -term time -point (1 year post -
transplant), our design is a generalization of the Simon design. Rather than 
suspension of the trial for evaluation  after stage 1, this design uses an optimal 
interim analysis for futility without suspension of accrual as proposed by Huang, Talukder and Thomas
48. The goal of this design minimizes the expected sample 
size under the assumed parameters .  
Our trial assumes that 40% 1 year EFS is unacceptably low and 60% 1 year EFS is a rate worthy of further study. Both the null and alternative hypotheses assume that the EFS follow an exponential distribution. Given an overall one- sided type I 
error of 5%, 69 total patients with an interim analysis for futility after accrual of 36 
patients will provide 90% statistical power. These 69 patients do not include the 
currently enrolled 7 patients on Arms A and B nor the expected 16 patients on 
arms D and E as enro llment is starting over for purposes of analyses. Therefore 
total enrollment will be approximately 92 patients.

February 5, 2019  Page 64 of 81 CPRC #2015LS076  
 When 36 patients have been enrolled  at the new TBI dose of 200 cGy bid with the 
inclusion of Busulfan, accrual will stop if the 1- year Kaplan- Meier estimate of EFS 
is less than 41.6%. The probability of stopping under the null hypothesis is 56%. 
The probability of stopping if the alternative hypothesis is true is 5%. If the trial 
reaches the end of stage II, significant clinical activity would req uire at least a 1 
year Kaplan- Meier estimate of EFS of 52% . The R package ‘OptInterim’ with 
functions ‘OptimDes’ and ‘SimDes’ were used to create design parameters49. 
We do not expect the February 2019 amendment to alter the outcome of EFS as 
any differences will be in degree not in kind. Stated differently, differences will not 
be qualitative. Therefore, enrollment  will continue as planned using only patients 
in arms F and G  in the interim decision to continue enrollment as well as in the 
final estimate of EFS at the conclusion of the trial.  
As many as 25 patients may be enrolled per year allowing study enrollment t o be 
completed in approximately 3 years.  
14.4 Toxicity Monitoring and Stopping Rules  
Monitoring guidelines are developed to monitor excess toxicity using a continuous 
monitoring strategy based on an adaptation of Pocock stopping boundaries50. In 
the event that a stopping rule is triggered,  enrollment will be halted. The study will 
be reviewed by the full study committee and if appropriate,  by the IRB , prior to re -
initiating enrollment . Although we do not expect different toxicity rates for the 
diagnoses of JEB and RDEB, m onitoring guidelines will be applied separately 
based on EB diagnosis (JEB versus R DEB).  We expect that 1/3 (n=23) of the 
patients will be transplanted for JEB and 2/3 (n=46) for RDEB.  Continuous 
monitoring will start over with the use of the new  conditioning regimen (adjustment 
from 300 cGy TBI to 200 cGy bid TBI plus the addition of Busulfan. Neither 
monitoring boundary was triggered in the 1st fifteen patients.  Arms D and E will be 
monitored separately but with both diagnoses combined due the s mall expected 
enrollment (n=16).  
14.4.1  Aplastic Graft Failure  
14.4.1.1  JEB 
Stopping rules were developed for excessive graft failure by day 42 post -
transplant. The goal is to construct a boundary based on graft failure such 
that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true graft failure 
rate is equal to 10% and our sample size is 23. Given these parameters, 
the upper stopping boundary for graft failure is 2 failures out of 3  patients, 
3 out of 8, 4 out of 1 4, 5 out of 21 or 6 anytime. Graft failure will be defined

 as failure to reach an ANC ≥ 500 neutrophils/uL for three consecutive days  
prior to day 42. If the actual rate of graft failure is 20% and 30% respectively, 
the probability of early stopping is 49% and 84% respectively.  
14.4.1.2 RDEB  
Stopping rules were developed for excessive graft failure by day 42 post -
transplant. The goal is to construct a boundary based on graft failure such 
that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true graft failure rate is equal to 10% and our sample size is 46. Given these parameters, the upper stopping boundary for graft failure is 2 failures out of 3 patients, 
3 out of 7, 4 out of 1 2, 5 out of 18, 6 out of 24, 7 out of 31, 8 out of 38  or 9 
anytime. Graft failure will be defined as failure to reach an ANC ≥ 500 neutrophils/uL for three consecutive prior to day 42. If the actual rate of graft 
failure is 20% and 30% respectively, the probability of early stopping is 66% 
and 97% respectively.  
14.4.1.2   Arms D & E  
Stopping rules were developed for excessive graft failure by day 42 post -
transplant. The goal is to construct a boundary based on graft failure such that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true graft failure 
rate is equal to 10% and our sample size is 16. Given these parameters, the upper stopping boundary for graft failure is 2 failures out of 4  patients, 
3 out of 9, 4 out of 1 4, or 5 anytime. Graft failure will be defined as failure to 
reach an ANC ≥ 500 neutrophils/uL for three consecutive days prior to day 
42. If the actual rate of graft failure is 20% and 30% respectively, the 
probability of early stopping is 40% and 73 % respectively.  
14.4.2  Transplant Related Mortality by 100 Days 
14.4.2.1  JEB 
Stopping rules were developed for excessiv e TRM by day 100 post -
transplant. The goal is to construct a boundary based on mortality  such that 
the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true TRM  is equal to 
10% and our sample size is 23. Given these parameters, the upper stopping 
boundary for TRM  is 2 events  out of 3 patients, 3 out of 8, 4 out of 14, 5 out 
of 21 or 6  anytime. The probability of early stopping of TRM is same as that 
for graft failure.  
14.4.2.2  RDEB  
Stopping rules were developed for excessive TRM  by day 100 post-
transplant. The goal is to construct a boundary based on TRM  such that the

 probability of early stopping i s at most 10% if the true TRM  rate is equal to 
10% and our sample size is 46. Given these parameters, the upper stopping 
boundary for TRM  is 2 events  out of 3 patients, 3 out of 7, 4 out of 12, 5 out 
of 18, 6 out of 24, 7 out of 31, 8 out of 38 or 9 anytim e. The probability of 
early stopping of TRM is same as that for graft failure.  
14.4.2.3  Arms D & E  
Stopping rules were developed for excessiv e TRM by day 100 post -
transplant. The goal is to construct a boundary based on mortality  such that 
the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true TRM  is equal to 
10% and our sample size is 16. Given these parameters, the upper stopping 
boundary for TRM  is 2 events  out of 4 patients, 3 out of 9 , 4 out of 14, or 5 
anytime. The probability of early stopping of TRM is  same as that for graft 
failure.  
Due to additional stopping rules  and re- initiation of the study , it is 
understood that the overall power may be slightly reduced for this study.

 Appendix VI – Low Dose Busulfan Dose Selection (For Arms F and G Only)  
 
Busulfan Dose Selection, AUC Monitoring and Algorithm for Dose 
Modification Using Once Daily IV Dosing  
Goal AUC 7560  [31 (mg · h)/L ] 
This protocol will use once daily (every 24 hour) intravenous busulfan dosing.  Two (2) total doses of busulfan 
will be given over 2 days in the preparative regimen.  AUC determination after doses #1 and #2 (AUC1 and 
AUC2).  For all patients, each busulfan dose will be administered over 3 hours by central venous line per 
University of Minnesota BMT Program standard guidelines.  
 
THE TOTAL regimen busulfan AUC (AUC cum) targeted will be = 6950- 8170 (µM·Min)/L [28.5 -33.5 (mg · h)/L]  
with ideal target AUC cum of 7560 (µM·Min)/L [31 (mg · h)/L]  in order to best optimize engraftment while 
minimizing toxicity. If at any time upon interim analysis and review of patients transplanted on this protocol with 
the principal investigators and pharmacy team, the subsequen t busulfan levels following dose #2 (AUC2)  are 
deemed reasonable and consistent, the decision may be made to only do kinetics with the dose#1 for all 
remaining patients treated on this protocol. In that event, kinetics for a dose#2  (i.e. AUC monitoring) m ay be 
performed whenever a dose change is required but will not be mandatory. These protocol changes (if enacted) will not require a treatment deviation or protocol amendment.  
 
Steady State Concentration (Css)  equivalent to 6950- 8170 (µM·Min)/L  = 600-700 ng/ml 
 
DETERMINATION OF FIRST BUSULFAN DOSE (DOSE #1)  
The initial empiric busulfan dosing (Dose #1) for ALL patients will be determined as follows:  
a. For patients weighing <12 kg: initial dose will be based on the formula according to the population PK 
model developed by Long -Boyle.  
b. For patients weighing ≥12kg and <66 kg: initial dose will be determined by the nomogram adapted from Bartelink.  
c. For patients weighing ≥66kg: initial busulfan dose = 3 mg/kg IV Once Daily  
 
1. For patients <12 kg: the first busulfan dose will be based on the population PK formula 
developed by Long- Boyle which calculates the first dose as a function of weight and age:  
• Use the Dosing Calculator (Long -Boyle Busulfan 1st Dose) on the BMT website to 
determine the precise dose for the pat ient;  
• Age: enter the age in years (to the hundredths place) by dividing the patient’s age in days by 365 
• Weight : enter the weight in kg (to the tenths place)  
• The Calculator is constructed using the following function:  
o Dose (mg) = AUC (target) x CL i  
o AUC (target) = 15.6 mg ·hr·L-1 (equivalent to 3800 μM·min∙L- 1)  
o CLi is a function of weight and age  
 CLi = 2.3 L/h x (Mat mag + (1- Mat mag) x [1 -e(-age x Kmat)]) x (weight/8 kg)0.75 
 Maturation magnitude (Mat mag) = 0.46; Maturation rate constant (k mat) = 1.4

 • See Table A -1 below for EXAMPLE first Busulfan doses for hypothetical children under 12 kg; this 
table can be used to ensure your patient's calculator output does not carry significant error. 
However, the patient's first dose should be determined directly from the calculator.

2. For patients >/= 12 kg to <66 kg: the first busulfan dose will be according to weight -based dosing 
nomogram developed by Bartelink, which determines the first dose as a function of weight only.  
• Determine the first dose directly from the nomogram chart (no calculator is used)

 • Round the patient's weight to the nearest kg. For weights in kg ending in "x.5", round UP to 
the nearest kg. For instance, for a weight of 43.5 kg, use 44 kg to determine the first 
busulfan dose from the nomogram.

 BUSULFAN THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING (TDM)  
 
Area under the curve (AUC) analyses will be calculated in- house per University of Minnesota BMT standard 
guidelines for all patients. The AUC will be calculated for each dose using serum busulfan concentrations  (in 
ng/ml)  performed by the University of Minnesota Medical Center Drug Analysis Lab and obtained at the 
following time -points:  
• Immediately prior to busulfan infusion ( *ONLY to be drawn if  obtaining levels with doses 2)  
• Immediately after the end of the busulfan infusion  
• 15 minutes after the end of the busulfan in fusion  
• 1 hour after the end of the busulfan infusion  
• 3 hours after the end of the busulfan infusion  
• 5 hours after the end of the busulfan infusion  
• 7 hours after the end of the busulfan infusion  
 
* “trough” or pre -dose serum busulfan level will only be obtained when performing AUC on 2nd or 
higher doses, as serum busulfan level prior to dose #1 is assumed to be zero.  
 
After determination of the patient's clearance and AUC, subsequent doses will be calculated linearly to achieve 
a goal cumulative AUC exposure.  
 
For patients receiving 2 total busulfan doses the goal AUC cum = 6950 -8170 (µM·Min)/L [ 28.5-33.5 (mg · 
h)/L]  with ideal target AUC cum of 7560 (µM·Min)/L [ 31 (mg · h)/L]  
 
 GUIDELINES FOR CHANGING SUBSEQUENT BUSULFAN DOSES BASED ON A PATIENT'S TDM 
RESULTS  
 
Subsequent busulfan dose changes will be made according to the following guidelines:  
 
1. The goal cumulative AUC range (AUC
cum for the entire 2- dose course) will be 6950 -8170 
(µM·Min)/L [ 28.5- 33.5 (mg · h)/L] with ideal target AUC cum of 7560  (µM·Min)/L [ 31 (mg · h)/L] 
2. Cumulative AUC is defined as the sum of each individual dose AUC:  
AUC cum = AUC1  + AUC 2  
3. Changes will be made to subsequent doses only if the projected AUC cum falls outside of the goal 
range .   
a. After the first busulfan dose, projected AUC cum = AUC1 x 2 
b. If dose adjustment is necessary, new doses will be calculated based on an ideal tar get 
AUC cum of exactly 7560 (µM·Min)/L [ 31 (mg · h)/L]  
4. Total busulfan exposure will be recorded from busulfan AUC analyses following both doses:  
AUC cum = AUC1 + AUC2

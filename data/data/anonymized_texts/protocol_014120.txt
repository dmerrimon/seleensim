1. RCT Details  
This section provides a high -level overview of the RCT that the described real- world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely 
as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in  the healthcare database s.  
 1.1 Title  
 Canagliflozin and  Cardiovascular and Renal Events in Type 2 Diabetes  (CANVAS  trial)  
 1.2 Intended aim(s)  
 To compare  canagliflozin to placebo on cardiovascular (CV) events including CV death, heart attack, and stroke in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) , whose diabetes is not well controlled at the beginning of the study and who have a 
history of CV events or have a high risk for CV events.  
 1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  and RCT finding  
 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, Including CV Death, Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction (MI), and Nonfatal Stroke  
 1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable ) 
 With 688 cardiovascular safety events recorded across the trials, there would be at least 90% power, at an alpha level of 
0.05, to exclude an upper margin of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of 1.3.  
 1.5 Primary t rial estimate  targeted for replication  
 HR = 0.86 (95% CI 0.75 –0.97)  comparing canagliflozin to p lacebo  (Neal et al., 2017)  
  
2. Person responsible for implementation of replication in Aetion  
Ajinkya Pawar, Ph.D.  implemented the study design in the Aetion Evidence Platform. S/he is not responsible for the validity of the 
design and analytic choices. All implementation steps are recorded and the implementation history is archived  in the platform.

 3 5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing canagliflozin to the DPP -4 inhibitor  (DPP4i) 
antidiabetic class . DPP4i s serve  as a proxy for placebo, since this class of antidiabetic drugs is not known to have an impact on the 
outcome of interest. The comparison against DPP4 inhibitors  is the primary comparison. Initiators of 2nd generation 
sulfonylurea s are used as a secondary comparator group . The patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment during the 
baseline period of 180 days before initiation of canaglif lozin  or a comparator drug ( cohort entry  date) . Follow -up for the outcome 
(3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the trial, patients are allowed to take other antidiabetic medications during 
the stud y. 
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
 
5.2.1 Eligible c ohort entry dates  
Market availability of canagliflozin  in the U .S. started on March 29, 2013.  
• For Marketscan and Medicare: April 1, 2013- Dec 31, 2017 (end of data availability).  
• For Optum: April 1, 2013- March 31, 2019  (end of data availability).  
 
 
5.2.2 Specify inclusion /exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define  the index date  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are provided 
in Appendix A  and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables :  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 7  
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of canagliflozin. Initiation will be defined by no use of any SGLT- 2 inhibitor or a 
comparator in the prior 6 months before treatme nt initiation (washout period).  
 Comparator agents : 
• Initiators of canagliflozin will be compared to initiators of - 
o DPP4i  (primary ) 
o 2nd generation sulfonylureas  
 Because canagliflozin and comparators are frequently used as second or third line treatments of T2DM, we expect it  to be unlikely 
that cana gliflozin and comparators are initiated in patients with substantially different baseline risk for proposed outcomes.  
 
6.2 Preliminary Covariate s: 
• Age 
• Sex 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default baseline covariate assessment period , defined as  180 days 
prior to and including index date  
 Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. 
We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overl ap between 
treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility 
analysis and the initial power assessment  and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ). These covariates are based on those used by 
Patorno et al. (2019).  
 6.3 Outcome variables  and study follow -up:  
 
6.3.1 Outcome variables  
 
Effectiveness outcomes of interest  (definitions provided in Appendix A ):  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making : Protocol Template  
 8 • Primary outcome : 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), i.e., non- fatal  myocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, 
or CV mortality  
• Secondary outcomes: I ndividual component s: 
o Hospital admission for MI (for purposes of this individual component, fatal MI is included) 
o Hospital admission for stroke (for purposes of this individual component, fatal stroke is included) 
o All-cause mortality/CV mortality:  
§ All-cause inpatient mortality  identified using discharge status codes will be used as a proxy for “CV mortality”  
in commercial databases  
§ Information on CV mortality through data linkage  with the National Death Index (NDI) will only be come  
available  at a later date  for Medicare and will be used in secondary analyses . 
 
Control outcomes of interest  (control outcomes only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further interpreted) :  
1. Diabetes Ketoacidosis (we expect to see a positive association ; Neal et al., 2017 ) 
2. Heart failure (we expect to see a protective effect ; Neal et al., 2017 ) 
Control  outcome definitions  
 
6.3.2 Study follow -up 
Both as -treated (AT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of 
cohort entry. Because adherence in the real world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary  analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
 
For the AT analyses, the follow -up will start the day after  initiation of canagliflozin  and comparator and will continue until the 
earliest date of the following events:  
• The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes ,  Outcome  Definition  Comments  
Control  Outcomes  
Diabetic Ketoacidosis  Inpatient ICD -9 diagnosis: 250.1x  
 Note - The  corresponding ICD -10 codes 
will also be used  
Heart Failure  Inpatient ICD -9 diagnosis ( primary diagnosis):  
428.x, 398.91, 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.11, 404.91, 404.03, 404.13, 404.93  Note - The  corresponding ICD -10 codes 
will also be used  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 9 • The date of end of continuous registration in  the database , 
• End of the study period,  
• Measured death event occurs,  
• Nursing home admission  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to 
no data on a patient, particularly on drug ut ilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason.  
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug (canagliflozin and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 30 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in 
main analyses).  
• The date of augmentation or switching from an exposure to a comparator or any other agent in the comparator class and vice versa (e.g. switching fr om saxagliptin to linagliptin would be a censoring event);  
o A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion  
o An added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion (e.g. if a canaglifloz in user adds insulin, he or she does not get censored at the time of insulin augmentation)  
 
For the ITT analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching  and treatment discontinuation will be replaced with a 
maximum allowed follow -up time of 365 days .

 In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90 -day gap in database enrollment  will be used . This 
outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcom es of interest are available at this stage. 
Complete a 1:1 PS -matched comparative analysis using this outcome.  PS should include only 3 covariates: age, sex, and combined 
comorbidity index . Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).

• Re-calculate power in the appropriate excel table, using the revised number of matched patients from the PS -match in  Section 9 . 
All other parameters in the table should be the same as in Section 8.  If the study is to be implemented in more than one 
database, copy and paste excel sheet to report power for each database separately and for the pooled analysis that uses data 
from all databases together.  Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).

Assay Sens. Finding
Power0.90. With 688 cardiovascular safety events recorded across the 
trials, there would be at least 90% power, at an alpha level of 0.05, to 
exclude an upper margin of the 95% confidence interval for the 
hazard ratio of 1.3. 
Blinding
Statistical MethodCardiovascular safety was to be shown if the upper boundary of the 95% 
confidence interval of the hazard ratio with canagliflozin as compared with 
placebo was less than 1.3, and superiority was to be shown if the upper 
boundary was less than 1.0.

Study Design  
 
 
 
 This study is designed to explore the efficacy of ORMD -0801 
compared to placebo on endogenous glucose production in subjects  
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Subjects  will undergo an initial 
Screening Visit (Visit 0) to establish their eli gibility to participate in 
the study. At Visit 1 ( 2 week s after the Screening Visit), qualifying 
subjects  will be randomized to either ORMD -0801 (8 mg) or  matching  
placebo , study medication will be dispensed and subjects will dos e 
twice a day, once in the morning prior to breakfast a nd once at night 
prior to bedtime. Doses will occur at 45 minutes  (± 15 minutes) before 
breakfast ) and no later than 10 AM each morning, and at 8 PM (± 120 
minutes) each night, and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner . Subjects  
will return to the clinic , 2 weeks later , for Visit 2. At this visit, subject  
compliance will be assessed, medication will be dispensed, a blood 
sample will be collected to measure HbA1c  and subjects  will be 
questioned for any adverse events . Subjects  will be scheduled to return 
to the clinic in 2 weeks for morning admission (8 AM ±  120 minutes) 
to the PK unit (Visit 3). Subjects  will be provided with standardized 
meals  and the morning dose in- clinic . A light standardized dinner meal 
will be provided at 6 PM ±  30 minutes . At approximately 8 PM (± 60 
minutes, and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner ), subjects  will be dosed 
with their study medication  and will be started on a 16- hour infusion 
of [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer . Blood samples will be collected  to measure 
endogenous glucose (tracer attached), plasma glucose , metabolites and 
hormones for the duration of the infusion. Blood samples will be drawn 
at baseline ( pre-infusion), 45, 90, 120 and 150 minutes, and 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hours . Subjects  will be required to 
remain fasting from the evening of Day 28 until the end of the infusion.  
Water intake will be unrestricted.  On Day 29, blood sample will also 
be collected to meas ure HbA1c. Following completion of the infusion, 
the subjects  will receive a standardized lunch and will be observed for 
an additional 6  hours . Prior to discharge, a physical examination will 
be performed , and blood/urine samples will be collected for safety 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis, following which subjects  will 
be discharged from the CRU and will exit the study. 
Primary Endpoint  1. Difference in endogenous glucose production between active and 
placebo as measured by the glucose with tracer attached using 
AUC (0-16) as the primary parameter.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
Endogenous insulin – secreted by the ß -cells of the endocrine pancreas – flows to the liver in the 
portal blood before reaching the systemic circulation through the hepatic veins. Following oral 
administration, the insulin in ORMD -0801 is absorbed through the gastrointestinal mucosa into 
the mesenteric veins (mostly, the superior mesenteric vein that drains blood from the jejunum and ileum) and reaches the liver via  the portal vein, thereby mimicking the route of entry of 
endogenous insulin. The main action of insulin in the liver is to suppress glucose production; for this action, sensitivity is higher, and onset and offset time of this action are faster than for insulin stimulation of glucose uptake by peripheral tissues. First -pass extraction of insulin by the liver is 
50-60%; recirculation raises this percentage to ~80%. As a consequence, portal plasma insulin 
concentrations normally are ~3- fold higher than peripheral insulin levels.  
The hypothesis behind ORMD -0801 is that sufficient oral insulin survives gastrointestinal 
degradation to arrive at the liver where it inhibits glucose production and, through this effect, lowers fasting plasma glucose concentrations. As the majority of thi s exogenous insulin dose is 
degraded in the liver, the resulting systemic insulin levels may be only marginally increased, thereby avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia.  
The use of glucose tracers is the standard non- invasive approach to measure endogenous glucose 
production (EGP) 
[1].  A tracer (in this protocol, [6,6-2H2]-glucose, a stable isotope of glucose) 
infused intravenously at a constant rate will equilibrate with endogenous glucose across its 
distribution space within ~3 hours. From this time onward, the ratio of the tracer infusion rate to 
the plasma tracer/tracee ratio (as assayed by GCMS) measures EGP. As compared to placebo, 
oral insulin is expected to reduce EGP over the ensuing 13 hours of continued fasting. In patients 
with type 2 diabetes, EGP is known to be abnormally elevated and to contribute the 
hyperglycemia [2]. Oral insulin is therefore addressing a key pathophysiological derangement of 
type 2 diabetes.

CONFIDENTIAL  3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is designed to explore the efficacy of ORMD -0801 compared to placebo on 
endogenous glucose production in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Subjects  will undergo 
an initial Screening Visit (Visit 0) to establish their eli gibility to participate in the study. At Visit 1 
(2 week s after the Screening Visit), qualifying subjects  will be randomized to either ORMD -0801 
(8 mg) or matching placebo, study medication will be dispensed and subjects will  dose , twice a 
day, once in the morning prior to breakfast and once at night prior to bedtime. Doses will occur at  
45 minutes (± 15 minutes) before breakfast  and no later than 10 AM each morning, and at  8 PM 
(± 120 minutes) each night, and  no sooner than 1 hour after dinner. Subjects  will return to the 
clinic , 2 weeks later , for Visit 2. At this visit, subject  compliance will be assessed, medication will 
be dispensed, a blood sample will be collected to measure HbA1c  and subjects  will be questioned 
for any adverse events . Subjects  will be scheduled to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for morning 
admission (8 AM ±  120 minutes) to the PK unit (Visit 3). Subjects will be provided with 
standardized meals  and the morning dose in- clinic . A light standardized dinner meal will be 
provided at 6 PM ±  30 minutes . At approximately 8 PM (± 60 min utes, and no sooner than 1 hour 
after dinner ), subjects  will be dosed with their study medication and will be started on a 16- hour 
infusion of [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer. Blood samples will be collected to measure endogenous 
glucose (tracer attached ), plasma glucose, metabolites and hormones for the duration of the 
infusion. Blood samples will be drawn at baseline ( pre-infusion), 45, 90, 120 and 150 minute s, 
and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hours (see Table 2  for blood draw schedule). 
Subjects  will be required to remain fasting from the evening of Day 28 until the end of the 
infusion. Water intake will be unrestricted. On Day 29, blood sample will also be collected to 
measure HbA1c.  Following completion of the infusion, the subjects  will receive a standardized 
lunch and will be observed for an additional 6 hours . Prior to discharge, a physical examination 
will be performed , and blood/urine samples will be collected for safety chemistry, hematology 
and urinalysis, following which subjects  will be discharged from the CRU and will exit the study.  
3.2 Screening/Visit 0 ( Week -3 to -1 , Day -21 to -7 ) 
At the S creening  Visit (Visit 0) , potential subjects will be given a detailed oral presentation 
describing the nature, purpose, risks, and requirements of the study and will receive detailed written information . Subjects will be given ample time to consider participation and ask questions which 
will be adequately addressed by site personnel.  
Once the subject is satisfied that he/she is willing to participate in the study, he/she will be a sked to 
sign the study informed consent form (ICF) (refer to Section 11.2.4 for further detail regarding the 
ICF). The investigational site personnel obtaining written consent from the subject will also sign the form to confirm consent has been obtained.  
Once signed, the Investigator will retain the original ICF for the subject’s study records and provide the subject with a signed copy. The i nvestigator will verify that informed consent has been obtained 
from each subject prior to enrollment  into the study and prior to the subject undergoing any study-
related procedures.

CONFIDENTIAL  4.3 Subject and Trial Discontinuation  
Subjects may choose to withdraw from this study at any time for any reason without penalty of 
jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.   
Within the provisions of informed consent and good clinical judgment with respect to safety, every attempt will be made  to have subjects complete the study. Reasons for subject discontinuation 
include , but are not limited to the following :    
1. Subject  experiences an AE that in the judgement of the Investigator poses a significant risk 
to the subject for continued participation in the study. 
2. Subject uses a prohibited medication ( listed in Section 5.6) that  in the judgment of the 
Investigator poses a significant risk to the subject for continued participation in the study or that will interfere with the interpretation of the results of the study.  
3. Subject becomes pregnant.  
4. Significant protocol violation or noncompliance on the part of the subject or the Investigator.  
5. Intercurrent illness that requires treatment that is not consistent with the protocol requirements, or intercurrent illness or the associated treatment that in the judgment of the Investigator poses a significant risk to the subject for continued participa tion in the study.  
6. Episodes of hypoglycemia not responsive to changes in diet or dose regimen ( Section 7.4.3)  
7. Subject meets one of the exclusion criteria during the study  
8. Subject wishes to withdraw for any reason.  
9. Sponsor elects to end the study, or the Investigational Site elects to end the study at their site.  
10. Any other reason that in the judgment of the Investigator poses unacceptable risk to the subject . 
Subjects  who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of  the investigator and will 
be discussed on a case -by-case basis.  
Except in cases of emergency, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor and the  Medical 
Monitor  before removing the subject from the study. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to 
temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs  that may have an unclear relationship to study 
treatment . The investigator should obtain approval from the Sponsor and Medical Monitor  before 
restarting study treatment s that were temporarily discontinued for an AE . 
In the event that a  subject discontinues the study prior to completion, t he date the subject is 
withdrawn and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the  source documents and e CRF .  
Although a subject  will not be obliged to give his/her reason for withdrawing prematurely, the 
investigator will make  a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the subject’s 
rights.  
All subjects who are randomized and treated (i.e. , received any amount of study treatment ) will be  
included in the safety analyses. Thus, every effort will be  made to contact a ny subject who fail s to 
attend any follow -up appointments/contacts, in order to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory health.  
If a subject  withdraws from the study as a result of meeting discontinuation criteria after the start of 
study treatment administration, reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for the  
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 31 
CONFIDENTIAL  early withdrawal evaluations ( Section 3.6). Any subject withdrawn due to a suspected study 
treatment -related AE should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. 
If a subject becomes pregnant, study treatment will be discontinued immediately. The subject will 
be followed until delivery or other termination of pregnancy for outcome. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study, and the Investigator/Investigational Site has the 
right to close the site, at any time, although this should occur only after consultation between involved parties. The Investigator will notify the IRB in writing of a premature termination of a 
study or closure of Investigational Site, and will send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor.   
Events that may trigger premature termination of a study or closure of an Investigational Site 
include, but are not limited to, a new toxicity finding, a request to discontinue the trial from a regulatory authority, non-compliance with the protocol, GCP violations, slow r ecruitment/low 
enrollment, or change in development plans for the study treatment. 
If either of the criteria listed below is met, enrollment of new subjects and dosing of ongoing 
subject s will be temporarily stopped. The Investigator, Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will 
discuss whether a lower dose or any additional treatment guidelines should be implemented, or if the trial should be permanently stopped. Any proposed changes to the protocol to address such findings will be submitted for review and approval by the IRB and FDA prior to re- starting the trial.  
1. A death within 30 days after study treatment administration where there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event; 
2. Two Grade 4 AEs where there is a reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the events.

this protocol. Administration of  study treatment will be accurately recorded in each subject’s source 
documents and in the eCRF. 
5.6 Concomitant Medications and Supplements  
All medications and supplements  (other than study treatment)  taken by the subject  from Visit 1 
through V isit 3 will be considered “ concomitant ” medications  and supplements . Medications and 
supplements taken prior to Visit 1 that are no longer being taken at the time of Visit 1 will be considered “prior” medications and supplements. 
All medications and supplements taken within 30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and 
concomitant medications  and supplements  taken during the course of the study will be recorded in 
the subject’s source document ation  and in the  eCRF.  
If a subject requires the use of any of the  prohibited medications and supplements listed below , the 
investigator will contact the Sponsor and the  Medical Monitor  to discuss the subject’s continued 
participation in the study. In the event of an emergency, subjects will be treated at the discretion of 
the investigator according to acceptable community standards of medical care.   
The following are prohibited medications:  
1. Any Investigational Drug other than ORMD -0801 (or placebo)  within 30 days prior to Visit  1 
through Visit 3;

CONFIDENTIAL  4. Systemic long -acting corticosteroids or other systemic corticosteroids or inhaled 
corticosteroids (if daily dosage is > 1,000 μg equivalent beclomethasone). Intra -articular 
and/or topical corticosteroids are not considered systemic. 
5. Medications known to modify glucose metabolism or to decrease the ability to recover from 
hypoglycemia such as oral, par enteral, and inhaled steroids, and immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulating agents.  
If the subject  initiates prohibited drug therapy, or if the i nvestigator determines that use of a 
prohibited therapy is in the best interest of the subject’s  health and well -being, the i nvestigator and 
sponsor will jointly decide to continue or discontinue study treatment for the subject . 
Medications and supplements should be recorded according to the generic name when possible.  
The use of c oncomitant medications and supplements should be limited to those that are medically 
necessary.  Any medication or supplement  used should have an indication recorded, and for 
concomitant medications and supplements, this indication must be represented as either  for the 
treatment of an AE , for the management of a pre -existing condition, or for prophylaxis.  
Dosage increases for any concomitant medication  or supplement  should be noted and the reason for 
the dosage increase recorded as an  AE (assumes worsening condition). The side effects of 
concomitant medications will be recorded as AEs .  
Any subject  whose condition becomes disqualifying during the course of the study may be treated 
for that condition. If the condition is suspected during S creening  (Visit 0) , the subject should not be 
enrolled. Treatment of the condition should be instituted according to the Investigator’s/attending 
physician's judgment.  
Medications that have no treatment intent but rather are part of supportive routine care such as local 
anesthetics, intravenous solutions to maintain fluid balance and keep access open, medications used 
for prophylaxis, and narcotics for postsurgical pain must also be recorded in the subject ’s medical 
record and eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL  7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING  
7.1 Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed on an ongoing basis by review of reported AEs, physical 
examinations, 12- lead ECGs, weight, vital signs (SBP/DBP and heart rate) and clinical safety 
labs (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis). 
7.2 Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a)  as follows:  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related. 
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease during the course of the study, and does not imply any judgment about causality . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are defined as any AE that starts  or increases in 
severity after the first  randomized dose of study treatment (active or placebo) .  
7.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) as follows : 
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death; 
• Life-threatening AE;  
• Inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatie nt hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 39 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.4 Eliciting and Reporting of Adverse Events 
AE monitoring will start immediately following the first dose of active treatment o r placebo  (Visit 
1) and will continue through Visit 3. Any subject with a possible study treatment- related AE at the 
end of the study will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. Further, any SAE, 
whether or not related to study treatment that occurs within 30 days following the last dose of study treatment will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the ev ent. This may require additional 
clinica l assessments and laboratory tests. The follow-up results will be recorded in the subject's 
source documentation and in the eCRF. 
Subjects will be instructed to report all AEs experienced during the study, and subjects will be 
assessed  in clinic  for the occurrence of AEs  throughout the study. In order to avoid bias in eliciting 
AEs, subjects will be asked general, non-leading questions such as "How are you feeling?" 
All AEs , including TEAEs, reported by the subject, observed or otherwise identified by the 
Investigator, or other Investigational Site  personnel will be documented.   
Medical conditions existing at Screening should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening 
pre-existing m edical conditions or diseases are considered AEs if they arise or worsen after the 
Screening visit, and should be recorded as AEs. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE if it occurs or is detected following the first dose of Study treatment Visit 1. Conditions leading to planned surgical procedures are not AEs if the condition(s) was (were) known before study treatment . In the latter 
case, the condition should be reported as medical history. 
7.4.1  Routine Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether or not associated with the study treatment, that are observed by the Investigator, 
other Investigational Site personnel, or those reported by the subject will be recorded in the 
subject’s source documentation and on the AE page of the eCRF. Copies of the SAE e CRF pages or 
an SAE listing generated based on the eCRF  pages will be submitted to the Sponsor at regularly 
scheduled intervals to allow the Sponsor to meet expedited regulatory reporting requirements under 
21 CFR 312.32 ( see Section 7.4.2  for further detail ) and regular regulatory reporting requirements 
under 21 CFR 312.33.  
For each AE, the following information will be entered in the eCRF:  
• Medical diagnosis of the event in standard medical terminology (if a medical diagnosis 
cannot be determined, a description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event); 
• Date of onset of any new AE or worsening of a previously observed AE. 
• Date of resolution of the event (or confirmation ongoing).; 
• Whether the event is serious (per definition in Section 7.3), and if so, the reason it is 
considered serious; 
• Severity  of AE (per definition in Section 7.6);  
• Assessment of the attributability of the AE to the study treatment [per definition in 
Section  7.4];   
• Whether the event is expected (per definition in Section  7.7);  
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 40 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Action taken in  treat ing the AE  (including concomitant medications or therapies 
administered) and/or change in the study treatment administration or dose (including 
whether the study treatment was temporarily interrupted or discontinued) ; 
• Outcome of AE (per definition in Section  7.8).   
 
7.4.2  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events , Including Death  
The Sponsor will adhere to all expedited  regulatory reporting requirements as per 21 CFR 
312.32.   If an SAE, including death occurs during this study or within 30 days following the last dose of the study treatment, the Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor within 24 hours  after becoming 
aware of the event.  
Initial notification via the telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE form within the time frames outlined in the protocol. This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously for warded SAE reports . The 
contact information for the Medical Monitor is provided below.  
 Medical Monitor:   
Carmen Margaritescu, MD  
Safety Office, Integrium, LLC  
Office: 714 -210-6665  
Cellular: 714 -328-7083  
Email: carmen.margaritescu@integrium.com  
 
SAE Forms will be provided by the Sponsor or Sponsor designated contract research organization ( CRO ). If all information is not known at the time of initial reporting, an initial 
report should still be made. In the event there is a question as to whether the experience is serious, the information should be forwarded to the Medical Monitor for review. The  
Investigator is responsible for following up on completion of the SAE Form. For all serious adverse events, the Investigator must to pursue and provide information to the Study Medical Monitor in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified abov e. In general, this will 
include a description of the adverse event in enough detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as conc omitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In 
the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Medical Monitor” . 
 In the event of a medical emergency or an SAE that is unexpected (as defined in Section 7.8)  and 
possibly related to the study treatment (s) (i.e., an adverse reaction or suspected adverse reaction as defined in Section 7.6), in  the opinion of either the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, the blind 
will be broken for the subject that experiences the event. If the Investigational Site personnel need to unblind the study treatment they can contact the unblinded programmer and pharmacist . 
The initial SAE Form and any subsequent follow -up SAE Forms submitted to provide more 
accurate, corrected, or new information must be signed by the Investigator. The Investigator and 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 41 
CONFIDENTIAL  Investigational Site Personnel must make every reasonable effort to obtain, from other institutions if 
necessary, all supporting medical case records as needed to comply with expedited Investigational New Drug application (IND) safety reporting requirement s.   
If the SAE involves expedited IND safety reporting (as determined by the Sponsor or designee), all supporting medical records must be submitted to the Sponsor or designee within 4 calendar days for 
death or life -threatening events, and 10 calendar days for  all other events. In cases where medical 
records and supporting documentation are unobtainable, the Investigator must generate a narrative 
of the event utilizing, when necessary, interviews with the subject, their family members and care givers as appropr iate.  
The Investigator must also promptly inform the governing IRB of the SAE  in accordance with  the 
governing IRB’s requirements . Any SAE that is determined by the Sponsor to be reportable to the 
FDA as an IND Safety Report (as defined in 21 CFR 312.32) will be reported to FDA by the Sponsor or designee within the specified time frame. All IND Safety Reports will also be promptly provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her IRB. Similarly, any SAE that is determined by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting to other regulatory authorities will be reported to the appropriate authorities by the Sponsor or designee within the specified time frames, and will be provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her IRB. 
The Investigator , Medical Monitor , and Sponsor  will review each SAE report and evaluate the 
relationship of the adverse experience to study treatment  and to underlying disease. Based on this  
assessment, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action. The primary 
consideration governing further action is whether new findings affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trial. If the discovery of a new adverse exp erience related to the study 
treatment  raises concern over the saf ety of continued administration of study treatment , the Sponsor 
will take immediate steps to notify the regulatory authorities.  
Further action that may be required includes the following:  
1. Alteration of existing research by modification of the protocol;  
2. Discontinuation or suspension of the study;  
3. Alteration of the informed consent process by modification of the existing consent form and informing current study participants of new findings;  
4. Modification of previously identified expected adverse experiences to include adverse expe riences newly identified as s tudy treatment -related.  
 
7.4.2.1  Pregnancy Reporting  
If the subject or partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within 30 days of  discontinuing study medication, the I nvestigator should report the pregnancy to 
Integrium  within 24 hours of being notified. Safety personnel will then forward the Exposure In 
Utero form to the Investigator for completion.  
The subject or partner should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If 
the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the 
Sponsor. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the 
pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 42 
CONFIDENTIAL  SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
7.4.3  Adverse Events of Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia and associated symptoms (e.g., weakness, dizziness, shakiness, increased sweating, 
palpitations, or confusion), have been associated with insulin administration, including ORMD-0801. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with ORMD-0801. It is not known whether ORMD -0801 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is also not 
known whether this product is excreted in human milk. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. 
Long-term animal studies have not been completed to assess whether ORMD- 0801 impairs fertility.  
Due to the specific relevance of hypoglycemia as a limiting factor in insulin therapy, AEs of 
hypoglycemia will be reviewed at every visit. All hypoglycemic events  will be reported on a special 
hypoglycemia AE eCRF page.  This will include the following information: 
• Subject symptoms;  
• Type of symptoms;  
• BG value during the hypoglycemic event and the event severity based on CTCAE 
criteria ; 
• Whether  treatment was required ; 
• Whether  assistance was required for treatment ; 
• What specific treatment , if any, was used . 
 
Instructions will be given to sites to additionally report episodes consistent with hypoglycemia 
requiring third party assistance as Serious Adverse Events (SAE). 
 
Collection of data from the hypoglycemia AE eCRF including episodes consistent with 
hypoglycemia will allow analysis and characterization of hypoglycemia according to accepted ADA definitions (Seaquist et al, 2013) and according to common cut-off values, such as BG < 70 mg/dL and < 53 mg/dL for example.   
7.4.4  Adverse Events of Hyperglycemia  
Hyperglycemia is the result of inadequate treatment and a pre-condition for enrolment into the 
study, therefore in general hyperglycemia is not considered an AE . However, hyperglycemia may 
occur in participants during the study either due to worsening diabetes or lack of efficacy of study medication. For standardization purposes, hyperglycemia is defined as a blood glucose reading > 300 mg/dL regardless of symptoms. Subject s who have a blood glucose reading > 300 mg/dL will 
have the reading repeated 1 -2 hours later. If a subject ’s glucose remains above 300 mg/dL or for 
persistent symptoms of hyperglycemia, the subject will be instructed to contact the investigative site for follow -up.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.5 Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
For all AEs, the Principal Investigator will provide an assessment of causal relationship to the 
study treatment (active or placebo) . The causality assessment must be recorded in the subject’s 
source documents and on the AE eCRF . Causal relationship will be classified acco rding to the 
following criteria:  
1. Unrelated : The event is clearly  due to causes  other  than  the active study drug.  
2. Unlikely : The event is doubtfully related  to active  study drug. The  event  was most likely  
related  to other  factors  such  as the subject’s  clinical  state,  concomitant  drugs  or other 
therapeutic interventions.  
3. Possible : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence  from  the time  of active study 
drug administration  but could have been produced by other  factors  such  as the subject’s  
clinical  state,  therapeutic interventions  or concomitant  drugs. 
4. Probable : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence from  the time  of active 
study drug administration  and follows  a known response pattern  to the  drug.  The toxicity  
cannot  be reasonably  explained  by other  factors  such  as the subject’s  clinical  state,  
therapeutic interventions  or concomitant  drugs.  
5. Definite : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence  from  the time  of active study 
drug administration,  follows  a known response pattern  to the  drug,  cannot  be reasonably  
explained  by other  factors  such as  the subject’s  condition, concomitant  drugs  or 
therapeutic interventions,  AND either occurs  immediately  following active study drug 
administration,  improves on stopping the  study drug, or  reappears  on re -exposure. 
 
7.6 Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The severity of each AE will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03. The severity of AEs that are not specifically listed in the CTCAE will be categorized according to the general guidelines provided in the CTCAE, and as summarized in the table  below.  
Table 3. General Guidelines for Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
Grade 1 :  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 :  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) [preparing meals, 
shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.].  
Grade 3 :  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
Grade 4 :  Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 : Death related to AE.  
 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 44 
CONFIDENTIAL  Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe AE is not 
necessarily a SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject 's 
usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above in Section 7.3. 
7.7 Expectedness of Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a)  as follows : 
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investiga tional plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  
7.8 Assessment of Adverse Event Outcome 
Outcome of AEs will be defined according to International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) 
Topic E2B, ICH Guideline. 
• Recovered/Resolved:  The subject has recovered fully from the AE without any 
remaining effects or impairment.  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae: The subject has recovered, but with an after effect possibly due to disease or treatment.  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved:  The condition is still present.  
• Fatal: Fatal should only be used when death is possibly related to the AE.  
• Unknown: The primary outcome is not known at the time of the final assessment. If an outcome for an AE is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up will proceed 
until an outcome is known or followed up to the Final Study Visit. Any subject with a possible study treatment -related AE at the Final Study Visit will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the event. Further, any SAE, whether or not related to Study treatment (active or placebo), that occurs within 30 days following the last dose of Study treatment will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the  event.  
7.9 Clinical Findings  
Any significant clinical findings at Visit 3 will be followed until the condition returns to pre -
study status, stabilize s, or can be explained as not being study treatment  related. If the clinical 
finding is reported as an AE (per the criteria outlined in Section  7.4), the follow -up procedures 
for AEs defined above will apply.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section describes the statistical methods to be used for the analysis and reporting of data 
collected under Protocol No. ORA -D-018. Additional details will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan . 
8.1 Study Design  
The primary analysis is a comparison of difference in endogenous glucose production for the ORMD- 0801 treated group and placebo. Let pC be the endogenous glucose production for the 
control (placebo) arm and let pT be the endogenous glucose production for the treatment (ORMD -
0801) arm. The primary analysis is:  
H0 : pC=pT  
H1 : pC ≠pT 
Trial success is defined as having the endogenous glucose production for the placebo group being greater than the endogenous glucose production for the ORMD -0801 treated group.  
8.2 Sample Size  
Sample size determination was not based on statistical considerations.  
8.3 Primary Efficacy Evaluation  
The primary endpoint for this study is the difference in endogenous glucose production between active and placebo as measured by the glucose with tracer attached using AUC
(0-16). 
 The primary endpoint will be analyzed using an Analysis of Variance model with treatment as the 
main effect.  
8.4 Secondary Efficacy Evaluation  
8.4.1  16-Hour Tracer Infusion 
A 16 -hour tracer infusion will be performed after 28 days of treatment. The blood draw schedule 
during the tracer infusion is documented in Table 2  in Section 3.7 of the protocol. Based on the 
blood draws the values for the following lab tests will be obtained:  
• Endogenous Glucose Production (glucose that is produced by the liver which has the tracer attached),  
• Key metabolites (β -hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, lactate, pyruvate, FFA, glycerol), and  
• Key hormones (insulin, C -peptide, glucagon).  
 For each of the lab tests, the following parameters will be derived (as appropriate):  
• AUC
(0-16), 
• AUC (0-2), AUC (0-4), AUC (0-8), AUC (0-12), 
• AUC (2-16), AUC (4-16), AUC (8-16), AUC (12-16), 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 46 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Cmax (endogenous glucose production only),  
• Tmax (endogenous glucose production only), and  
• Tlag (endogenous glucose production only). 
 
Each of these parameters for each of the tests will be analyzed using an Analysis of Variance model with treatment as the main effect.  
 
8.4.2  Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) 
Hemoglobin A1c will be collected prior to dosing and after 28 days of dosing. This parameter will 
be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance model with treatment as the main effect and baseline value as the covariate.  
 
8.4.3  Plasma Glucose Levels  
Plasma glucose levels will be collected prior to dosing and after 28 days of dosing. The plasma 
glucose levels collected after the 16 -hour infusion period is complete , is the value that will be 
analyzed for this test. This parameter will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance model with treatment as the main effect and baseline value as the covariate.  
 
8.4.4  Ketones and Free Fatty Acids  
Ketones and free fatty acid levels will be collected prior to dosing and after 28 days of dosing. The 
values collected after the 16 -hour infusion period is complete , are the values that will be analyzed 
for these tests. These parameters will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance model with treatment as the main effect and baseline value as the covariate.  
 
8.4.5  Lipids (Total Cholesterol, LDL Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol and Triglycerides)  
Lipids will be collected prior to dosing and after 28 days of dosing. The values collected after the 
16 hour infusion period is complete , are the values that will be analyzed for these tests.  These 
parameters will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance model with treatment as the main effect and baseline value as the covariate.  
 
8.5 Safety Evaluation  
8.5.1  Safety Population  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment  will be included in the 
safety analysis population.  
8.5.2  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA .   
The incide nce of TEAEs  will be tabulated by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class, 
treatment group, severity, and assigned relationship to study treatment . The incidence for each 
TEAE will be provided as the total number of subjects that experienced the TEAE, as well as the 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 47 
CONFIDENTIAL  percentage of the population that this represents. If a TEAE is reported more than once for a given 
subject, the greatest severity and the worst -case attribution will be presented in the summary tables.  
TEAEs  will be listed for individual subjects, along with information regarding onset  and end dates, 
onset time where available, severity, seriousness, relationship t o study treatment , action taken, and 
outcome. A similar listing will be prepared for the pretreatment AEs.   
TEAEs that lead to withdrawal from the study will be separately listed and summarized.   
Descriptive statistics will be generated as appropriate (i.e., frequency for categorical data). Inferential statistical analysis comparing the AE  data between active and placebo  is not planned.  
 
8.5.3  Laboratory Evaluations  
Individual clinical safety lab (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)  values will be listed by 
visit and summarized using descriptive statistics  as appropriate (i.e., mean, median, range, and 
standard deviation for continuous data and frequency for categorical data) . Individual change from 
baseline ( Screening ) in lab oratory  values will be calculated and summarized descriptively.  A 
clinically significant change from baseline  will be recorded as an AE if deemed appropriate by the 
Investigator . 
 8.5.4  Vital Signs  
Individual vital sign measurements (height, weight, seated SBP/DBP, and heart rate ) will be 
listed by measurement time and summarized using descriptive statistics  as appropriate (i.e., 
mean, median, range, and standard deviation) . Individual change from baseline  in vital sign 
measurements will be calculated and summarized descriptively. A clinically significant change 
from baseline  will be recorded as a  TEAE if deemed appropriate by the Investigator . 
 
8.5.5  12-lead ECG  
Individual 12- lead ECG assessments  are only collected as screening and will be listed . 
 8.5.6  Physical Examination  
Individual physical examination findings  will be listed by visit. A clinically significant change from 
baseline will be recorded as an  AE if deemed appropriate by the Investigator . 
 8.5.7  Prior and Concomitant Medications and Supplements  
Medications and supplements will be coded  using the most current version of  the WHO  Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.   
Concomitant medications and supplements will be listed for individual subjects. A similar listing will be prepared for prior medications and supplements  stopped within 30 days prior to the first 
dose of study treatment . The incidence of these prior and concomitant medications and supplements 
will be summarized.

CONFIDENTIAL  9 DATA MANAGEMENT 
9.1 Data Collection  
All data required by the study protocol  will be collected in a validated database according to the  
CRO’s  SOPs.  
9.1.1  Electronic Data Capture 
Data from the source documents  will be  entered into the EDC system by authorized Investigational 
Site personnel . Data Management staff, using both electronic and manu al checks, will 
systematically check  the data.  Errors or omissions will result in queries  (which can be issued by the 
Study Monitor or Data Management staff) , which will be  presented to the Investigational Site 
within the EDC system. The Investigational Site will resolve the queries within the EDC system.  
The Study Monitor and Data Management staff will review the responses as part of the query resolution process. The EDC system will track the queries with the corresponding responses.  
Medications and supplements entered into the database will be coded in the EDC system using the 
WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. AEs  and Medical History will be coded in the EDC system using MedDRA terminology.  
Laboratory samples will be processed by appropriate laboratories. Results will be reported to Integrium and imported  into the database . 
9.2 Quality Assurance and Database Lock  
A 100% critical variable review of all key safety and secondary endpoint data in the database will be performed.  Following this review, a data quality control audit or a random sample equal to 10% 
of subjects, with a minimum of 5 subjects will be performed . 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked.  Any 
changes to the database after that time can only be made by joint written agreement between the Sponsor, the Investigator, Integrium , and the study biostatistician . 
10 AMENDMENTS/MODIFICATIONS OF THIS PROTOCOL 
The Investigator will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. As the study progresses it may become necessary to change or modify parts of the protocol. The Sponsor or designee is res ponsible for submitting protocol 
amendments to the appropriate government regulatory authorities. The Investigator is responsible for submitting protocol amendments to the appropriate IRB. Approval by the IRB must be obtained before changes are implemented .   
When an emergency occurs that requires a departure from the protocol for an individual, a departure will be only for that subject. The Investigator or other physician in attendance in such an 
emergency will, if circumstances and time permit, contact the Medical Monitor immediately by 
telephone. Such contacts will be made as soon as possible to permit a decision as to whether or not the subject (for whom the departure from protocol was affected) is to continue in the study. The eCRF and source documents will  completely describe the departure from the protocol and state the 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 50 
CONFIDENTIAL  reasons for such departure. In addition, the IRB will be notified in writing of such departure from 
protocol. 
 
11 INVESTIGATOR OBLIGATIONS  
11.1 Regulatory Documentation  
Before the trial starts, Essential Documents as defined in ICH E6 will be generated and placed in 
both the Investigator’s and Sponsor’s files. Additional Essential Documents will be added to both files as new information becomes available and at the completion or termination of the trial as defined in ICH E6.  
11.2 Protection of Human Subjects  
11.2.1  Declaration of Helsinki   
The Investigator will conduct this study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) including all amendments up to and including the October 2013 revision.  
11.2.2  Good Clinical Practice and Regulatory Compliance  
The Investigator will conduct this study in accordance with the principles of GCP (current ICH 
guidelines) and the requirements of all local regulatory authorities regarding the conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human subjects.  
The study will be conducted as described in the approved protocol, with amendments and in accordance with the obligations of clinical Investigators set forth in the Form FDA 1572 and in 21 CFR 50, 54, 56 and 312. 
11.2.3  Institutional Review Board  
The Investigator is responsible for the submission of t he protocol , ICF, and other written materials 
(such as advertisements and diaries), along with relevant supporting data  (e.g., IB), to the 
appropriate IRB for review and approval before the study can be initiated. The Investigator is also 
responsible for submitting a mendments to the protocol  and ICF  to the IRB for review and approval 
prior to implementation of the change. The Investigator is responsible for providing the Sponsor 
with a letter documenting the IRB approval prior to initiation of the study or implementation of the 
changes, respectively .  
The Investigator will not have authority to implement any deviation or change to the protocol 
without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB of an amendment, 
except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  Any significant 
deviation from the approved protocol will be documented in the source documents and eCRF .  
Any deviation or change to the protocol required to eliminate an immediate hazard prior to obtaining IRB approval/favorable opinion, will be submitted as soon as possible to:  
• IRB for review and approval/favorable opinion.  
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 51 
CONFIDENTIAL  • The Sponsor  via appropriate designees.  
• Regulatory Authorities, if required by local regulations.  
 
Documentation of IRB approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB will be provided 
to the Sponsor via appropriate designees.  
If an Amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the subject: 
(1) the ICF will be revised and submitted to the IRB for review and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised ICF will be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the Amendment; and (3) the new ICF will be used to obtain consent from any new subjects prior to enrollment. 
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB of all reportable AEs. IND Safety Reports 
provided by the Sponsor to the Investigator will be promptly forwarded to the IRB by the Investigator. Updates to the IB provided by the Sponsor to the Investigator will be submitted to the IRB by the Investigator.  
The Investigator  is also responsible for informing the IRB of the progress of the study and for 
obtaining annual IRB renewal. The Investigator must inform the IRB when the study is completed 
or terminated. After completion or termination of the study, the Investigator will submit the  final 
clinical study report to the  IRB. The structure and content of the report will meet that described in 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports E3 (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline, dated November 30, 1995).  
11.2.4  Subject Informed Consent  
The Investigator must comply with informed consent regulations (21 CFR Part 50) and relevant state regulations (i.e., California Bill of Rights for California patients).   
The ICF will clearly describe the nature, scope, and potential risks and benefits of the study, in a language that the subject understands. The ICF will  conform to all  the requirements for informed 
consent according to ICH GCP and  US FDA guidelines (21 CFR 50) and will include any 
additional elements required by the Investigator’s institution or local regulatory authorities. The ICF will adhere  to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.   
Prior to the beginning of the study, the Investigator will obtain the IRB’s  written approval/favorable 
opinion of the written ICF. The IRB approved ICF will be given to each prospective participant.  
The subjects will be given adequate time to discuss the study with the Investigator or site staff and to decide whether or not to participate. Each subject who agrees to participate in t he trial and who 
signs the ICF will be given a copy of the signed, dated, and witnessed document. The original signed ICF will be retained by the Investigator in the study files. 
The ICF  and any other information provided to subjects will be  revised whenever important new 
information bec omes available that is  relevant to the subject's consent, and the Investigator will 
obtain the IRB’s  written approval/favorable opinion prior to the use of the revised documents . The 
Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will fully inform the subject of all pertinent 
aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. Subject s will read and sign any and all revised ICFs .

CONFIDENTIAL  11.3 Subject Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subjects’ state of health 
will be regarded as confidential. This is detailed in the ICF  provided to the subject. An agreement 
for the use or disclosure of any such information (PHI)  will be obtained  from the subject  in writing 
(HIPAA authorization) prior to performing any study- related procedures . Disclosure of subject 
medical information obtained as a result of this study to third parties other than those noted below is prohibited.   
Medical information resulting from a subject’s participation in this study may be given to the 
subject’s personal physician or to the appropriate medical personnel responsible for the subject’s welfare. Data generated as a result of this study are to be av ailable for inspection on request by 
FDA or other government regulatory agency auditors, the Sponsor (or designee), and the IRB.   
The information developed in this clinical study will be used by the Sponsor in the clinical 
development of the Study treatment and therefore may be disclosed by the Sponsor as required for disclosure as a public company to other clinical investigators, to other pharmaceutical companies, to the FDA , and to other government agencies. All reports and communications relating to subjects in 
this study will identify each subject only by their initials and subject number. 
11.4 Electronic Data Capture 
All data required by the study protocol will be recorded in the electronic  database. Data from the 
source documents will be entered into the EDC system by authorized Investigational Site 
personnel. The  data will be updated at the time of each subject visit.  Results of tests performed 
outside the Investigational Site will be entered as soon as available to the Investigational 
Site. The Principal Investigator must verify that all data entries  are accurate and correct by 
electronically signing the subject’s Investigator signature screen . 
11.5 Source Documentation 
All data entered in the eCRF must be verifiable against source documentation. Source documents 
may include, but are not limited to, a subject’s medical record, hospital charts, clinic charts, the 
Principal Investigator ’s study files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests.   
11.6 Retention of Records 
The Investigator has the responsibility of maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing 
system containing all study- related documentation. These files must be available for inspection 
by the Sponsor or designee, the IRB, and regulatory authorities (i.e., FDA or international regulatory authorities) at any time and should consist of the Essential Documents as defined in ICH E6, which include, but are not limited to, the following elements: 
• Subject files, containing the completed eCRFs , supporting source documentation from 
the medical record , including laboratory data, and the signed ICF;  
• Regulatory files, containing the protocol with all amendments and Sponsor and Investigator signature pages, copies of all other regulatory documentation, and all correspondence between the site and the IRB and Sponsor; and  
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-018 
Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 53 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Drug accountability files, including a complete account of the receipt and disposition of 
the Study treatment (active and placebo) . 
 
The Investigator will retain all study r ecords for at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., United States, Europe, or Japan) , and until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region. If no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, the Investigator will retain all study records for at least 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been  notified.  
The S ponsor  will provide written notification when it is appropriate for the Investigator to discard 
the study- specific documents referenced above.  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study records. Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the Sponsor will be notified in writing in advance.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the Investigational Site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements will be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor for storage. If source documents are required for continued care of the subject, appropriate copies for storage off site will be made.  
11.7 Clinical Study Report 
After completion or termination of the study, a clinical study report will be prepared.  The structure and content of the report will meet that described in Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports E3 (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline, dated Nove mber  30, 1995). The 
Principal Investigator must verify that all information and data in the clinical study report is accurate and correct by signing the clinical study report. 
 
12 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
12.1 Study Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by the Sponsor or designee to evaluate the progress of the study, to 
verify the accuracy and completeness of the eCRFs, to assure that all protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations, and Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled, and to resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  
 The Investigat or will allow the Study Monitor  to periodically review, at mutually convenient times 
during the study and after the study has been completed, all e CRFs and office, hospital, and 
laboratory records supporting the participation of each subject in the study.   
 
The Study M onitor will compare the eCRF data against source documentation in order to verify its 
accuracy and completeness. T he Investigator and Investigational Site  staff will collaborate with the 
Study Monitor to resolve any identified data  discrepancies in a timely manner.

CONFIDENTIAL  The Study Monitor will record any p rotocol deviations identified, including, but not limited to, 
subjects that were enrolled even though they did not meet all eligibility criteria, subjects who took 
concomitant medications specifically prohibited by the protocol, subjects who received the wrong study treatment or incor rect dose, and subjects who failed to comply with the protocol -defined 
dietary restrictions . The Investigator and Investigational Site  staff will collaborate with the Study 
Monitor to identify the reason for each protocol deviation.   
 
The Study Monitor will compare the Investigational Site study treatment accountability record  
against the study treatment inventory (unused and used) at the site. T he Investigator and 
Investigational Site  staff will collaborate with the Study Monitor to resolve any identified 
discrepancies in a timely manner . 
 Each issue identified during study monitoring visit s will be  documented and  reported  to both the 
Sponsor and the Investigator . 
12.2 On-Site Audits  
The FDA , or other regulatory authorities, may request access to all study records for inspection 
and copying. The Principal Investigator and Investigational Site staff will cooperate with the inspectors and allow  access to all source documents supporting the eCRFs and other study-
related documents. The Investigator will immediately notify the Sponsor when contacted by any 
regulatory authority for the purpose of conducting an inspection.   The Sponsor or designee may also request to visit the Investigator’s site to conduct an audit of 
the study. Prior to initiating this audit, the I nvestigator will be contacted by the Sponsor to 
arrange a convenient time for this visit. The Principal Investigator and Investigational Site staff will cooperate with the auditors and allow access  to all source documents  supporting the eCRFs 
and other study- related documents .  
12.3 Data Quality Assurance  
All e CRFs  mus t be completed  by authorized Investigational Site personnel who have undergone 
eCRF training. Data will be entered into the e CRF as information becomes available on a visit -
by-visit basis. All data recorded on the eCRFs must  be supported by source documentation. The 
Principal Investigator must verify that all data entries in the e CRF are accurate and correct by  
electronically  signing and dating t he eCRF.  
 All e CRF corrections must be made by the Principal Investigator  or authorized Investigational 
Site personnel. The Principal Investigator  must authorize changes to the recorded data, and this 
authorization must be documented in the source documents.    Refer to Section 9 for further details regarding Data Management quality assurance, including query generation and resolution, final data review, and database lock.

CONFIDENTIAL  14 APPENDIX A  
14.1 Guidelines for T RACER Infusion  
 EGP Protocol  
 
Tracer:  [6,6 -2H2]-glucose (from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories 
[https://shop.isotope.com/productdetails.aspx?itemno=DLM -349-PK])  
Constant tracer infusion rate :  0.28 µmol.min-1.kg-1 (= 51 µg.min-1.kg-1) via an indwelling 
catheter in an antecubital vein. Assuming participants have dinner at 18:00pm, the tracer 
infusion can start at 20:00pm and continue until 12 noon the following day, i.e. , for 960 
min.  
Example:  In a T2D subject  weighing 90 kg, the total amount of tracer would be 0.28 x  
960 x  90 = 24,192 µmol (= 4.41 g per study). Rounding this up, on dissolves 4.5 g of [6,6-
2H2]-glucose in 500 mL of saline: this is the mother solution (from which a 5 mL aliquot 
must be saved together with the plasma samples) to be given at a rate of 0.5 mL/min to the 
90-kg person for 960 min. 
Blood sampling :  through a cannula in a contralateral antecubital vein, one sample is taken 
prior to starting the tracer infusion, then blood is drawn every hour till the end.

24-hour Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (24-MQoLQ) 
Methodology This is a multi-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel group study in approximately 1400 subjects with acute 
migraine (ages 18 to 65 years). 
Study participants must have 2 to 8 migraine attacks, and fewer than 15 
headache days during each of the three months before the screening visit. 
At Visits 1 and 2, all study participants will be trained in the use of the 
STS101 device, the use of the electronic diary (e-diary) and undergo 
Placebo Response Reduction training, designed to improve discrimination 
between placebo and drug effects in clinical trials. 
After establishing eligibility, the study participants will be randomized 
(1:1) to receive one of two treatments: 
 5.2 mg STS101 (equivalent to  6.0 mg of DHE mesylate USP) 
 Placebo (matching nasal powder) 
The randomization will be stratified by the use of migraine prevention 
medication. After the randomization, the study participants will treat their 
next qualifying migraine attack of at least moderate pain severity with the 
allocated blinded study medication within 4 hours of the onset of the 
attack. 
The study participants will document the following symptoms of their 
treated migraine before and over 48 hours after study drug administration 
in an electronic diary (e-diary): migraine headache pain severity, presence 
of symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea), presence of allodynia 
and functionality status. Headache pain severity and symptom data will be 
documented immediately before drug administration (time 0), at 15, 30, 45 
minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after study drug 
administration. The subjects must select a most bothersome symptom 
among photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea immediately before study 
drug administration.

use of triptans or other DHE mesylate products as rescue medications 
should be avoided for 24 hours after study drug administration. The study 
participants will return to the study site within approximately one week of 
the treated migraine attack. 
Adverse events, objective nasal evaluation data, safety laboratory data, 
vital sign data and ECGs will be recorded before and after treatment to 
evaluate the tolerability and safety of STS101.

Statistical methods  Sample Size Determination 
A total of approximately 1400 evaluable subjects is planned for the study. 
Given the 1:1 randomization ratio, approximately 700 subjects will be 
randomized to each treatment group. For the co-primary endpoint of pain 
freedom at 2 hours post dosing of investigational drug, a therapeutic gain 
of 10%, assuming a 25% responder rate for STS101 and 15% for the 
placebo is targeted. Based on these assumptions, 700 subjects per 
treatment group can provide 99% power to detect the target treatment 
difference. For the co-primary endpoint of MBS freedom at 2 hours post 
investigational drug , a therapeutic gain of 1 0%, assuming a  45% responder •

Confidential rate for STS101 and 35% for the placebo is targeted. Based on these 
assumptions, 700 subjects per treatment group can provide 95% power to 
detect the target treatment difference. The s ample size calculation is based 
on a chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05 and a 2-sided test. 
The primary efficacy objective will be addressed by simultaneously testing 
the 2 co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and MBS freedom at 2 hours 
after drug administration at a significance level of 0.05. This sample size 
will provide an overall power of at least 94%. 
Efficacy 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) including the final hierarchy of 
testing of primary and secondary endpoints will be created before data base 
lock and study unblinding. 
All study data will be summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics. 
Unless otherwise specified, for numeric data (e.g., age, weight), descriptive 
statistics will include the number of subjects with data to be summarized 
(n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum 
(max). All categorical/qualitative data (e.g., gender, race) will be presented 
using absolute and relative frequency counts and percentage. 
Data from all investigational centers will be pooled for analysis. For the 
primary analysis of the co-primary endpoints, missing data will be imputed 
based on a single-imputation method. Subjects who do not have evaluable 
assessments at the 2-hour time point, or who received rescue medications 
prior to the 2-hour time point will be considered as non-responders. The 
impact of missing data will be further investigated in a number of 
sensitivity analyses with other single and multiple-imputation approaches. 
A study-wise Type I error of 0.05 will be used for this study. A fixed-
sequence testing method with a pre-defined hierarchical order will be 
employed to control for the study-wise Type I error rate. 
For both co-primary endpoints, the Chi-square test will be used to 
compare the active treatment groups and placebo. Chi-square test will also 
be used to test secondary endpoints consisting of proportion of responders. 
For analyses stratified by allodynia status, timing of treatment, the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used. The Kaplan-Meier method 
will be used for time to use of rescue medications. The 24-hour Migraine 
Quality of Life Questionnaire assessments will be analyzed with the 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models. The Chi-Square test will be used 
to analyze the Patient Global Impression ratings. 
Subgroup analyses of the key efficacy endpoints will be conducted to gain 
insight of the nature and consistency of the treatment effect.

Confidential Safety 
Safety analyses will include all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study medication. 
All adverse events reported or observed will be listed, documenting 
severity, start and stop date and time, possible relationship to study 
medication, action taken, and outcome. Treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events recorded after dosing of the 
investigational product. Verbatim terms will be classified to preferred 
terms (PT) and related system organ class (SOC) using the MedDRA 
dictionary. The preferred terms and system organ classes will be tabulated 
by treatment group. All reported adverse events will be summarized by the 
number of subjects reporting adverse events, system or gan class, preferred 
term, severity and relationship to study drug. 
Safety labs including complete blood count (CBC), chemistry and 
urinalysis will be tabulated using descriptive statistics. A tabulation of 
by-subject abnormal/out-of-range findings and changes from pre-dose 
(Visit 1) to post-dose in all laboratory variables will be provided. 
Vital signs, objective and subjective evaluations of nasal symptom and 
standard 12-lead ECGs will be tabulated using descriptive statistics. A 
tabulation of by-subject abnormal/out-of-range findings and changes from 
pre-dose (Visit 1) to post-dose variables will be provided.

Confidential 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1. Introduction 
Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Satsuma) is developing STS101 (dihydroergotamine nasal 
powder), a drug-device combination of a dihydroergotamine (DHE) mesylate dry powder 
formulation prefilled in a single use delivery device for nasal administration. DHE mesylate is 
currently indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the 
acute treatment of cluster headache episodes. DHE mesylate is available as a solution for 
subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV) administration and as a nasal spray 
(IN) (DHE 45® Prescribing Information 2017 ; Migranal® Prescribing Information 2017 ). 
DHE mesylate is a semi-synthetic derivative of ergotamine tartrate that has been used effectively 
to treat migraine since 1945 ( Silberstein 2003 ) and was first approved in U.S. in 1946. The 
antimigraine activity of DHE mesylate is likely related to the agonist activity at 5-HT 1B, 5-HT 1D, 
and 5-HT 1F receptors ( Dahlöf 2012 ). Additionally, DHE mesylate can cause vasoconstriction via 
CGR 2A/2c and 5-HT 2A receptors and may inhibit neurogenic 
inflammation in peripheral meningeal tissues and nociceptive neuronal transmission centrally in 
the trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( Hoskin 1996 ; Burstein 2004 ; Silberstein 2003 ; Dahlöf 2012 ; 
González-Hernández 2018 ). The DHE mesylate-related side effects of nausea and vomiting are 
likely related to activation of central 5-HT lA receptors and dopamine D 2 receptors 
(Silberstein 2003 ). 
DHE mesylate is listed as first-line treatment in migraine treatment guidelines from the American 
Academy of Neurology ( Marmura 2015 ). The effectiveness of DHE mesylate via intravenous, 
intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal and orally inhaled administration routes has been 
demonstrated ( Raskin 1986 ; Winner 1996 ; Gallagher 1996 ; Carleton 1998 ; Edwards 2001 ; 
Aurora 2011 ). In these studies, treatment with DHE mesylate has consistently resulted in 
headache relief in 50 to 70% of the treated patients at 2 hours after administration. 
However, patient acceptance of DHE mesylate has been limited due to these shortcomings: 
 D.H.E.45® (Injectable DHE mesylate solution) 
o Inconvenience and side effects of administration by injection (IV, IM, SC) 
o DHE mesylate-related side effects, especially nausea, which is likely related to rate of 
administration (IV) and C max and has been reported to occur less frequently when 
plasma concentrations remain below 6-10 ng/mL ( Cook 2009 ) 
 Migranal® (DHE mesylate intranasal spray) 
o Inconvenient multi-step procedure of vial opening, spray device-to-vial assembly, and 
priming ( Migranal® Administration Instructions 2017 ) 
o Inconvenient administration procedure requiring four 0.125 mL sprays (two in each 
nostril, repeated after 15 minutes) ( Migranal® Prescribing Information 2017 ) and 
Migranal® Administration Instructions 2017 ) P release by stimulating adrenergic a

Confidential o Low and variable bioavailability ( ; 
Migranal® Prescribing Information 2017 ) 
o Slow onset of action ( ) 
o Drug run off into the pharynx and out of the nose ( Djupesland 2013 ) 
o Side effect of bad or altered sense of taste ( Migranal® Prescribing Information 2017 ; 
van der Kuy 1999 ). 
STS101 (DHE nasal powder) is designed and being developed to address the shortcomings of the 
injectable and intranasal DHE mesylate formulations: 
 STS101 is designed to be easy and convenient for patients to quickly self-administer 
during a migraine attack. 
 STS101 is rapidly and consistently absorbed with T max, Cmax and AUC values falling 
within ranges that have previously been established to be effective for DHE mesylate. 
 Consistent with DHE mesylate effectiveness data reported in multiple studies, STS101 
treatment is expected to be effective in early and late treatment of migraines, in attacks 
with and without allodynia, and to result in high 24-hour pain-free and low 24-hour 
recurrence rates. 
1.2. STS101 Description 
STS101 is a drug-device combination product consisting of a powder formulation of DHE 
mesylate prefilled in a single use delivery device for intranasal (IN) administration. 
1.2.1. STS101 Device 
STS101 will be delivered by a pre-filled single use device, which is a manually operated and air 
driven device specifically designed for IN drug delivery ( Figure 1).

Confidential 1.2.2. STS101 Powder Formulation 
STS101 is a white to off-white powder formulation containing DHE mesylate, microcrystalline 
cellulose (MCC), hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, HPMC), and mannitol. 
1.2.2.1. DHE Mesylate Information 
DHE mesylate is a semi-synthetic derivative of ergotamine tartrate and is known chemically as 
ergotaman-3´,6´,18-trione,9,10-dihydro-12´-hydroxy-2´-methyl-5´-(phenylmethyl)- -
,monomethanesulfonate. Its molecular weight is 679.80 and its empirical formula is 
C34H41N5O8S. The chemical structure is shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2.  Dihydroergotamine mesylate chemical structure 
 
1.2.3. DHE Mechanism of Action in the Treatment of Migraine 
The antimigraine activity of DHE is likely related to the agonist activity at 5-HT 1B, 5-HT 1D, and 
5-HT1F receptors ( Dahlöf 2012 ). Additionally, DHE can cause vasoconstriction via CGRP release 
2A/2c and 5-HT 2A receptors and may inhibit neurogenic inflammation 
in peripheral meningeal tissues and nociceptive neuronal transmission centrally in the trigeminal 
nucleus caudalis ( Hoskin 1996 ; Burstein 2004 ; Silberstein 2003 ; Dahlöf 2012 ; González-
Hernández 2018 ). The DHE mesylate-related side effects of nausea and vomiting are likely 
related to activation of central 5-HT lA receptors and dopamine D 2 receptors ( Silberstein 2003 ). 
Because of slow diffusion from the receptor biophase, the effects of DHE mesylate last far

Confidential 1.2.5. DHE Clinical Experience 
Migranal® (DHE mesylate intranasal liquid) and D.H.E. 45® (DHE mesylate injectable solution), 
approved in the United States in 1998 and 1946, respectively, have been prescribed to a large 
number of patients with migraine headaches. A detailed summary of human experience with 
marketed DHE mesylate formulations and other data regarding Migranal and DHE mesylate 
Injectable solution can be found in the STS101  Brochure. 
1.2.6. DHE Mesylate Pregnancy Category 
DHE mesylate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no 
adequate studies of DHE mesylate in human pregnancy, but developmental toxicity has been 
demonstrated in experimental animals. DHE mesylate possesses oxytocic properties and, 
therefore, should not be administered during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or 
if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. DHE mesylate is designated Pregnancy Category X in the U.S 
(DHE 45® Prescribing Information 2017 ; Migranal® Prescribing Information 2017 ). 
1.3. Summary of Nonclinical Data 
The nonclinical toxicology program for STS101 was designed to supplement the known 
nonclinical studies in support of the general safe use of DHE mesylate. In a GLP 14-day 
intranasal toxicology study with a 14-day recovery period conducted in dog, the presumed 
No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of DHE mesylate dose given to dogs (the most 
sensitive species) was approximately 49-fold more than the planned highest clinical dose of 
STS101 on a dose/weight (mg/kg) basis and 5-fold more based on a normalized nasal cavity 
surface area comparison. The results of the dog 14-day study support the presumption that the 
STS101 DHE mesylate formulation yields no new or unexpected significant toxicity at the 
highest feasible concentrations possible. The large safety multiples based on the NOAEL provide 
reassurance that the proposed human clinical dosing is reasonable and safe. The study is  
1.4. Summary of Clinical Data for STS101 
In the Phase 1 Study STS101-001 (up to 5.2 mg STS101) no serious adverse events occurred and 
no adverse event led to study or treatment discontinuation. All treatment emergent adverse events 
recorded were graded as mild, clinically not significant and resolved by the end of the study. As 
expected, most of the adverse events were local in the nose and described as mild nasal discomfort 
and taste disturbances usually described as sour or bitter taste. In the Phase 3 Study STS101-002, 
up to 5.2 mg STS101 showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile. No drug related serious 
adverse events or deaths occurred during the study. The most common TEAEs were nasal 
discomfort, dysgeusia, and rhinorrhea. For more details see  Investigator's 
summarized in detail in the STSlOl Investigator's Brochure.

Confidential 1.5. Rationale for the study 
In the Phase 3 Study STS101-002, STS101 narrowly missed to achieve statistically significant 
efficacy for the two co-primary endpoints, freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom at 
2 hours after use of study medication (Data on file). The main reasons for this were: 
 A high rate of severe migraine attacks during the treatment period. Severe migraine 
attacks are more difficult to treat and tend to have lower response rates for acute migraine 
treatments ( Aurora 2011 ; Diener 2004 ). Consistent with the literature severe attacks less 
response to the study medication.  
 The mean delivered dose of study medication was approximately 30% below the label 
claim because of a combination of suboptimal administration by the study subjects, 
thicker walls of the pump of the device making it harder to adequately squeeze and some 
powder loss within the device (Satsuma; Data on file).  
 A high placebo response rate in relation to the reported pain and symptom severity of the 
treated attacks ( Aurora 2011 ; Diener 2004 ; Dodick 2019 ; Goadsby 2019 ; Kuca 2018 ; 
Lipton 2019 ; Tepper 2011 ) 
Satsuma has corrected the device and administration related drug delivery issues, and with these 
corrections and an increase in sample size, this study is expected to achieve statistically 
significant efficacy at 2 hours after use of study medication and to demonstrate the clinical 
benefits of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine.  
This study follows the FDA Guidance1 and the Guidelines of the International Headache Society 
for acute migraine studies ( Diener 2019 ) and is being conducted as part of the clinical 
development program for STS101 to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of STS101 
in the treatment of acute migraine attacks with or without aura.

Confidential 3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multi-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
study in approximately 1400 subjects with acute migraine (ages 18 to 65 years). 
After establishing initial eligibility, the study participants will be trained in the use of the 
electronic diary (e-diary) to record their headache attacks for 15 days during the screening 
period. Attack pain severity, presence of symptoms (nausea; photophobia, phonophobia) and 
impact on functional status will be documented. 
The study subjects will also be trained in the administration of study medication and use of the 
STS101 device, and undergo Placebo Response Reduction training, designed to improve 
discrimination between placebo and drug effects in clinical trials. 
After establishing full eligibility, the study participants will be trained in the use of the STS101 
device and randomized (1:1) to receive: 
 5.2 mg STS101 (equivalent to 6.0 mg of DHE mesylate USP), or 
 Placebo (matching nasal powder) 
The randomization will be stratified by the use of migraine prevention medication. After the 
randomization, the study participants will treat a qualifying migraine attack of at least moderate 
pain severity with the allocated blinded study medication within 4 hours of the onset of the 
attack. 
The study participants will document the following symptoms of their treated migraine before 
and over 48 hours after study drug administration in an e-diary: migraine headache pain severity, 
presence of symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea), presence of allodynia and 
functionality status. Headache pain severity and symptom data will be documented immediately 
before drug administration (time 0), at 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 
hours after study drug administration. The subjects must select a most bothersome symptom 
among photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea immediately before study drug administration. 
If subjects require rescue medication, they will be encouraged to wait until the 2-hour post study 
drug administration data collection timepoint. The use of triptans, other ergot-containing products 
(including DHE mesylate and ergotamine), lasmiditan, ubrogepant and rimegepant as rescue 
medications should be avoided for 24 hours after study drug administration. The study participants 
will return to the study site within approximately one week of the treated migraine attack. 
Adverse events, objective nasal evaluation data, safety laboratory data, vital sign data and ECGs 
will be recorded before and after treatment to evaluate the tolerability and safety of STS101. 
Sufficient numbers of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 1400 subjects in the 
study. The dropout rate is estimated to be less than 35%. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn 
from the study after dosing will not be replaced. However, in the event that the number of drop-•

form (ICF) must be signed and dated by each study subject prior to any study procedures being 
performed and a copy must be given to the subject. 
3.2.2. Assignment of Subject Identification Number 
Each subject will be assigned an individual subject identification number. The first three digits 
will identify the study site (ranging from 001 to 999) and last three digits will identify the subject 
as a running number starting with 001. As an example, the first subject entering screening at site 
001 would receive the subject identification number 001-001, the second subject 001-002 etc.  
3.2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Assessment 
All subjects must qualify for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in 
Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, respectively.

include all medications taken for 28 days prior to Screening. The medical history, demographics 
and a list of concomitant and prior medications, concomitant procedures and non-drug therapies 
will be documented at the screening visit (Visit 1). 
In female subjects who menstruate the following additional information will be documented for 
the three months prior to the Screening Visit: 
 Timing and duration of menstruation in each month 
 Occurrence of migraine headaches on day 1 (± 2 days) of menstruation in each month 
Previous or current triptan use will be documented. Subjects who have previously or are 
currently using triptans will be asked to estimate how often they experience(d) pain relief 
(moderate or severe pain becoming mild to no pain) with triptan use: 
 >75% of the time; >50 to 75% of the time; >25 to 50% of the time; 25% of the time 
Medical Records and source documentation to support important diagnoses, e.g., migraine 
history and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be provided or obtained whenever possible. 
3.2.5. Headache Impact Test (HIT-6TM) 
At the Randomization Visit (Visit 2), subjects will complete the 6-question Headache Impact 
Test (Appendix F ), a tool for assessing the impact of headache on daily life in subjects with 
migraine ( Yang 2010 ). 
3.2.6. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Randomization (Visit 2) and at 
the Follow-up/early termination visit. The examination will include all major body systems with 
the exception of genitourinary. Site Personnel performing the physical exams must be qualified 
by training and licensure. 
3.2.7. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be obtained at Screening (Visit 1), Randomization (Visit 2), and at the Follow-
up/early termination visit. Vital signs will include temperature, sitting blood pressure (to be 
taken after 5 minutes of sitting), and pulse rate. 
3.2.8.  Weight, Height and Body Mass Index (BMI) 
Subjects will be weighed in street clothes after removing shoes, coat or jacket. Weight will be 
measured at Screening, Randomization, and at the follow-up/early termination visit. Subject 
height will only be measured at screening, without shoes. Subjects will have their BMI calculated 
at the Screening visit (Visit 1) using the following formula: BMI = weight (kg)/height (m2). •

questionnaire and detailed instructions for completion are shown in Appendix C. 
The Objective Assessment of Nasal Symptoms will be performed during Screening (Visit 1), 
Randomization (Visit 2), and at the Follow-up/early termination Visit (Visit 3). Assessment 
sheets must be retained for all subjects. The person performing the assessments should be the 
same at all visits whenever possible. 
3.2.10. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
A designated central laboratory will perform the hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis and 
diagnostic tests as specified in Table 3.  
Samples for clinical laboratory tests will be taken at Screening (Visit 1) and at the Follow-
up/early termination visit (Visit 3). All samples will be collected in accordance with the Study 
Laboratory Manual and shipped to the designed central laboratory. 
Laboratory reports will be reviewed by the investigator and out of range values will be identified 
and may be repeated at the Investigator's discretion. The Investigator will determine if any out of 
range values are clinically-significant and require recording as adverse events (AEs) in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). All clinically-significant out of range laboratory values 
obtained at the Randomization Visit or Follow-up visit will be followed until they return to 
normal or become medically stable. 
Laboratory tests with exclusionary results at Visit 1, may be repeated with prior approval by the 
Medical Monitor. The repeat test should be done at an unscheduled visit (UV) before the subject 
returns for the randomization visit (Visit 2). . Using categorical scales ranging from "none" to "severe", the physician will

 An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational 
product. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events recorded after 
dosing of the investigational product. 
AEs will be recorded as volunteered by the subject or solicited through indirect questioning. 
AE collection will begin at the 
Screening Visit (Visit 1) and continue until the follow-up/early termination visit.  AEs 
related to the administration of inactive powder during the administration training at Visit 1 and 
Visit 2 will also be recorded. 
AEs will be solicited at the times indicated in the schedule of assessments by asking a question 
 last seen  
AEs may also be reported spontaneously. 
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory values) or symptoms related to a single diagnosis should NOT be recorded 
as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded as an 
AE(s). Changes in laboratory values are only considered to be AEs if they are judged to be 
clinically significant (i.e., if some action or intervention is required or if the Investigator judges 
the change to be beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). If abnormal laboratory 
values are the result of pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis (e.g., increased liver 
enzymes in hepatitis), the diagnosis only should be reported as an AE. 
Any adverse events, signs, and symptoms will be fully recorded on the AE form including date 
of onset, date of resolution, frequency, severity, seriousness, relationship to the drug, treatments 
administered and outcome. AEs may also be reported spontaneously at any time. (CK), CK-myocardial band (CK

based on the criteria listed in Table 4. Assessment of the causal relationship between any Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) and study drug administration will be performed by both the Investigator 
and the Sponsor. If at least one of the parties assesses the event as related, it will be reported 
expeditiously as required to the appropriate authorities.

criteria are not met. 
Not 
Related: There is an un likely temporal relationship between administration of the product and the onset of the 
AE (i.e., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration of the product for it to be 
considered product-related); 
The causal relationship between the product, and the AE is biologically implausible (i.e., injury in an 
automobile accident); 
There is a clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE (i.e., typical adverse reaction to a 
concomitant drug and/or typical disease-related event). 
 
7.2.2. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
Table 5 shows the guidelines for rating severity of AEs may be used: 
Table 5. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; no loss of time from 
normal activities; symptoms would not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs and 
symptoms may be transient, disappearing during continued treatment with study medication.  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with or modification of usual activities.  
Severe: Incapacitating, with inability or notable impairment in work or usual activities; signs and symptoms 
may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation; the study drug may be stopped, and 
treatment for the  event may be required.  
 
7.2.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Recording and Reporting 
The Investigator must decide whether each AE meets the definition of an SAE. An SAE is any 
untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: An AE will be considered 'related" or "not related" to the use of the

For fatal events, the cause of death is reported whenever known. If an autopsy was performed, an 
autopsy report should be provided. Death should be reported as the outcome of a specific SAE. 
Life-threatening, in the definition of serious, refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.

no precipitating signs/symptoms or worsening of the pre-existing condition that necessitated the 
procedure. However, SAEs must be reported for any medical complications that prolonged the 
hospitalization. 
that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above. These will also usually be considered serious. 
Any SAE will be reported within 24 hours of knowledge by the Investigator. Investigator should 
not delay reporting while waiting for clarification or supporting medical information. 
The Investigator must complete the required information fields for SAE documentation and 
reporting in the electronic CRF (AE eCRF and SAE eCRF) and provide any supportive documents 
available (hospital summaries, diagnostic test results, laboratory test results, etc.). Any subject 
identifying information must be redacted prior to uploading. The investigator should not wait for 
these supporting documents in order to notify the medical monitor if doing so would place the 
notification outside the 24-hour window. All SAEs will also be reported on the AE eCRF and 
SAE eCRF and concomitant medications (CM) administered in association with the serious AE 
will be documented on the CM eCRF. 
For any information not available at the time of the first report that becomes available later, 
the Investigator should add this information to both the source documentation and the initial 
SAE section of the eCRFs, and provide any additional written documentation to the Safety 
Group immediately or within 1 working day of receipt. 
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for notifying regulatory agencies of SAEs that require 
reporting as per the governing regulations. Medically significant events are those events considered important in the Investigator's opinion

Confidential 8. STATISTICS 
8.1. Sample Size Determination 
A total of approximately 1400 subjects (approximately 700 in each treatment group) will be 
randomized.  
For the co-primary endpoint of pain freedom at 2 hours post dosing of investigational drug, a 
therapeutic gain of 10%, assuming a 25% responder rate for STS101 and 15% for the placebo is 
targeted. Based on these assumptions, 700 subjects per arm can provide 99% power to detect the 
target treatment difference. For the co-primary endpoint of MBS freedom at 2 hours post 
investigational drug, a therapeutic gain of 10%, assuming a 45% responder rate for STS101 and 
35% for the placebo is targeted. Based on these assumptions, 700 subjects per treatment group 
can provide 95% power to detect the target treatment difference. The sample size calculation is 
based on a chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05 and a 2-sided test.  
The primary efficacy objective will be addressed by simultaneously testing the 2 co-primary 
endpoints of pain freedom and MBS freedom at 2 hours after drug administration at a 
significance level of 0.05. This sample size will provide an overall power of at least 94%.  
8.2. Subject Populations 
The analysis populations to be used in the study are defined below. 
8.2.1 Intent-to-Treat Population 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects who reported a qualifying 
migraine attack, received the study drug, and reported any post-treatment efficacy evaluation. 
Data will be analyzed according to the treatment group each subject is randomized to. 
8.2.2 Modified Intent-to-Treat Population 
For the purposes of efficacy data analysis, the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population will be 
the primary analysis population. This population will include all randomized subjects who 
reported a qualifying migraine attack, received the study drug, and reported a post-treatment 
efficacy evaluation for at least 1 time point at or before the 2-hour time point. Data will be 
analyzed according to the treatment group each subject is randomized to.

The safety population will include all subjects who are randomized and have received the study 
drug. Data will be analyzed according to the treatment each subject actually received. 
8.3. Statistical Analysis 
All study data will be summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics. Unless otherwise 
specified, for numeric data (e.g., age, weight), descriptive statistics will include the number of 
subjects with data to be summarized (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) 
and maximum (max). All categorical/qualitative data (e.g., gender, race) will be presented using 
absolute and relative frequency counts and percentage. 
All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual subject data listings described below will be 
completed using Version 9.3 or later of the SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be provided in a separate document. The SAP

8.3.3. Hypotheses Testing and Significance Level 
A study-wise Type I error of 0.05 will be used for this study. A multiplicity strategy will be 
taken into account when interpreting the nominal 2-sided p-values. 
A fixed-sequence testing method which tests each endpoint individually in a pre-determined 
hierarchal order will be used for both primary and secondary endpoints. If the first endpoint is 
significant (<0.05), then you continue to the next endpoint. If an endpoint is not significant, then 
testing stops and all subsequent endpoints are considered non-significant. 
The order of the secondary endpoints to be tested will be described in detail in the SAP. 
8.3.4. Handling of Missing Data 
For the primary analysis of the co-primary endpoints, missing data will be imputed based on a 
single-imputation method. Subjects who do not have evaluable assessments at the 2-hour time 
point, or who received rescue medications prior to the 2-hour time point will be considered as 
non-responders. The impact of missing data will be further investigated in a number of sensitivity 
analyses with other single and multiple-imputation approaches. The details of the sensitivity 
analyses will be described in the SAP.

For both co-primary endpoints, the Chi-square test will be used to compare the active treatment 
group and placebo. The Chi-square test will also be used to test the secondary endpoints defined 
as a response variable. For analyses stratified by allodynia status, timing of treatment, or any 
other baseline characteristic the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used. The Kaplan-Meier 
method will be used for time to use of rescue medications. The 24-hour Migraine Quality of Life 
Questionnaire assessments will be analyzed with the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models. 
The Chi-Square test will be used to analyze the Patient Global Impression ratings. 
To fully describe the treatment benefit of STS101, the proportion of subjects achieving  
treatment groups and placebo. The results will also be displayed graphically to show the time 
course of effect. To address the onset of efficacy, treatment difference vs. placebo will be 
examined from the 2 hour-timepoint towards the baseline in a sequential manner (i.e., 2 hours, 
1.5 hours, 1 hour, 45 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes). A significance level of 0.05 will be used 
for this analysis. 
8.3.7. Subgroup Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints 
Subgroup analyses of the key efficacy endpoints will be conducted to gain insight of the nature 
and consistency of the treatment effect. Subgroups prospectively identified include: 
1. age group 
2. gender 
3. race 
4. baseline severity of attack (time 0) 
5. allodynia status 
6. menstrual related migraine attacks  
7. in subjects who wake up with migraine headache 
8. baseline (Visit 2) HIT-6 score 
Among these subgroup analyses, # 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are also included in the secondary or 
exploratory endpoints. Analysis by additional subgroups may be considered. They will be 
specified in the SAP before the study is unblinded for analysis. 
Because of the smaller sample sizes for each subgroup, the objective of the analysis is to evaluate 
the consistency of efficacy results across these factors. Statistical tests will be performed. 
However, the interpretation of the p-values will take into account sample size and multiplicity 
issues. Forest plots with estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect across 
different subgroups will be presented.

The number of subjects exposed to each treatment group will be summarized. Because this is a 
single-dose study, each subject is expected to receive one dose only. 
8.3.8.2. Adverse Events 
A TEAE is defined as an AE that begins after the dosing of study drug. 
An overview of adverse events will be presented by treatment group, which will include the number 
and percent of subjects who had at least one AE, TEAE, Serious TEAE, TEAE related to study 
drug, and maximum severity of TEAE. 
Multiple occurrences of an AE are counted only once per subject per SOC and PT for summary 
tables. 
The following TEAEs will be summarized by SOC, PT and treatment group: 
 Incidence of all TEAEs 
 Nasal TEAEs (including taste sensations coded as dysgeusia) 
 Incidence of all TEAEs by maximum severity (severe, moderate and mild) specified by 
investigators 
 Incidence of TEAEs related to the study drug as determined by the investigators 
 Incidence of serious TEAEs 
All data collected in the AE case report form (CRF) will be listed in by-subject listings. 
8.3.8.3. Assessment of Nasal Symptoms 
The data from the Objective Assessment of Nasal Symptoms ( Appendix C ) will be summarized 
by treatment group. Exploratory hypothesis testing may be performed to compare treatment 
group by question. No multiplicity adjustment will be applied to these tests.

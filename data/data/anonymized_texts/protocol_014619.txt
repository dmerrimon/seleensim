Information on demographics, medical conditions, devices,  and mobility will be  obtained  
through chart review .  The primary outcome w ill be  acquisition of  bacteriophage MS2 on a 
composite of all sites, including the percentage of sites contami nated and the average log 10 PFU.  
Based on previous published results, we anticipate that at least one site will be contaminated with 
MS2 in ~60 % of  control group participants.   A power calculation indicated that 17 patients per 
group would provide 80% pow er to detect a 75% reduction in contamination from 60% to 15%.  
Linear and generalized linear mixed -effects models controlling for time of collection and site of 
contamination w ill be  used to compare the percentages and average log 10 PFU levels of 
contamination for the groups .  Bivariate analyses w ill be  conducted to compare  characteristics of 
groups.  Fisher’s exact test w ill be  used for  categorical data and the Student paired t -test for 
normally distributed data.   Analyses w ill be  performed using R version 3.5.1 statistical software 
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)  and functions from the lme4 and 
lmerTest packages will be implemented .

Name of Sponsor/Company: Santen Incorporated
2100 P owell Street, 16thFloor
Emeryville, CA  94608
Name of Investigational Product:   DE-122 injectable solution
Name of Active Ingredient:   DE-122, a chimeric anti -CD105 (Endoglin) IgG1 antibody consisting of 
huma n Cκ and Cγ1 constant regions with murine Vκ and V Hregions
Title of Study:   A Phase I/II, Open -label, Dose -escalating, Sequential -cohort Study Assessing the 
Safety, Tolerability , Immunogenicity ,and Bioactivity of a Single Intravitreal Injection of DE -122 
Injectable Solution for the Treatment of Re fractory Exudative Age -related Macular Degeneration -
PAVE Study
Study Period :  Approximately 21 months
Estimated date first subject enrolled: August, 2015
Estimated date last subject completed: April, 2017Phase of Development: 
Phase I/II
Primary Objec tive: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection of four dose levels of DE -122 
(0.5 mg/eye, 1.0 mg/eye, 2.0 mg/eye and 4.0 mg/eye) in subjects with refractory exudative age -
related macular degeneration.
Secondary Objective: 
 To evaluate the bioactivity of four dose levels of DE -122 in subjects with refractory exudative age -
related macular degeneration.
Methodology:
This is an open -label, dose -escalating, sequential -cohor t study assessing the safety, tolerability , 
immunogenici ty, and bioactivity of a single intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg and 4.0 mg 
DE-122 administered in approximately 12 subjects with refractory exudative age -related macular 
degeneration (AMD).
The subjects will receive a single intravitreal injection of DE -122 in the study eye.  The number of 
subjects will be approximately 12 subjects ( 2 or3 subjects in Cohort 1, 3 subjects each in Cohorts 2, 3 
and 4).  Decisions regarding dose escalation in the next cohort will be based on the recommendatio ns of 
the Safety Review Team consisting of an external Retina Specialist, the Medical Monitor, and the Drug 
Safety Physician.  Dose -Limiting Toxicity response observed in any cohort will result in termination of 
the dose escalation.
To be eligible, subject s with refractory exudative AMD in the study eye must have lesions ≤ 12 disc 
areas, contain ≤ 50% hemorrhage and ≤ 50% fibrosis and ≤ 50% retinal pigment epithelial atrophy . 
Subjects must have received recent Intravitreal Injection of anti -VEGF treatment in the study eye > 30 
days and < 60days prior to Visit 1 (Day 1) an d must satisfy all other inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 65 to 20 ETDRS letters (20/50 to 20/400
Snellen) in the study eye.
The first eligible subject in Cohort 1 will receive a single intravitrea l injection of 0.5 mg DE -122 in the 
study eye and will be evaluated through Visit 3 (Day 8±1).  The Safety Review Team will review the 
safety parameters and determine if the safety and tolerability are acceptable. 
If acceptable, up to two additional eligi ble subjects in Cohort 1 will each receive a single intravitreal 
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 5of 84 Confident ialinjection of 0.5 mg DE -122 in the study eye before starting Cohort 2 .  After the first 2 or 3 subjects in 
Cohort 1 have completed Visit 5 (Day 30±2), the Safety Review Team will review the sa fety 
parameters of the first 2 or 3 subjects in Cohort 1 and determine if the next dose (1.0 mg) will be 
administered to Cohort 2. 
The same enrollment procedures will be followed for Cohort 2 (1.0 mg of DE -122), Cohort 3 (2.0 mg 
of DE -122) and Cohort 4 (4 .0 mg of DE -122), however , 3subjects willbe enrolled in th esecohorts.
Rescue therapy with anti -VEGF medication may be allowed at Visit 3 (Day 8±1) and /orat Visit 7 (Day 
60±3) provided the following rescue criteria are met :  < 5 letters gained from base line BCVA or < 50 
microns reduction from baseline central subfield thickness (CST) as measured by spectral -doma in 
optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT).
Subjects who do not receive rescue therapy with anti -VEGF medication at Visit 3 ( Day 8±1) will 
receive anti-VEGF treatment at Visit 5 (Day 30±2).
Anti-VEGF treatment at Visit 5 (Day 30±2) and rescue therapy (at Visit 3 and/or Visit 7) should be 
performed using the same anti -VEGF medication received just prior to enrollment in the study. 
Safety assessments will be performed on each subject for up to 90 days .
Number of Subjects (planned):
Approximately 12subjects ( 2 or 3 subjects in Cohort 1, 3 subjects each in Cohorts 2, 3 and 4) with 
refractory exudative age related macular degeneration will be enrolled at 5 sites.  The final number of 
subjects enrolled may be adjusted based on the presence of dose limiting toxicities.
Duration of the Study:
The duration of this clinical study includes up to a 7-day screening phase and 90 -day treatment/ follow -
up phase. The subject will receive asingle drug injection of DE -122 at Visit 1 (Day 1) , if rescue
criteria is met, will receive treatment of anti -VEGF medication at Visit 3 (Day 8±1), atVisit 5 (Day 
30±2) if not given at Visit 3, and at Visit 7 (Day 60±3) with follow-up for each subject through Day 90.

AMD i s the leading cause of irreversible visio n loss in developed countries. AMD is
characterized by  extracell ular matrix deposi ts, known a s drusen, accumulat ing between the
retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch’s membrane. In exudative or wet AMD unwanted blood
vessels grow into the macula which leads to hemorrhage and subretinal fluid. In addit ion, retinal
pigment epi thelial detachment, reti nal tears, fibrovascular scarring and vitreous hemorrhage may
occur. The aberrant growth of leaky vessels is the result of local inflammatory  response sleading
to disruption of the balance of cytokines thatcontrol angi ogenesis (Lim et al ., 2008 )
Angiogenesis is a complex and coordinated process of the growth and sprouting of new blood
vessels fro m pre-exist ing vasculature. Although several angiogenic factors have been identified,
VEGF family  proteins, thei r receptors and intracellular signaling mo lecules appear to be the key
mediators of angiogenesis (Kane et al ., 2008 ). 
Excit ing advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of AMD in recent y ears. 
Since 2004, several ant i-VEGF m edicati ons, such as ranibizumab (Lucent is®), pegaptanib 
(Macugen®) and aflibercept (Eylea®) have been approved by  the FDA for pati ents wi th exudat ive 
AMD.  Although Eylea®, which is the m ost recent lyapproved ant i-VEGF medicat ion for 
exudat iveAMD, showed more than 95% of the subjects maintained visio n defined as losing 
< 15 ETDRS letters for 12 months ; however, only  30% of  subjects gained > 15 ETDRS letters.  
Moreover, approximately 30% o f subjects still showed cy stic intraretinal edema and subretinal 
fluid after 12 m onths of treatm ent (Heier et al., 2012 ).  Therefore, anti-VEGF treatm ent m ay not 
represent the only pathway towards anti -angiogenesis.  New or novel approaches to inhibit 
angiogenesis are needed to elicit further improvements in visual acuit y, macular edema, and 
quali ty of life in exudat ive AMD pat ients.
Endoglin (also known as CD105) is a member of the TGF- β receptor family that is expressed by  
proliferat ing endothelial cells and is considered as one of the essential factors for angiogenesis. 
Norm al levels o f endoglin are needed for endothelial cell pro liferat ion (Guo et al., 2004; 
Warrington et al., 2005 ).  Endoglin expressio n is increased by cellular hypoxia through the 
producti on of  hypoxia -inducible factor -1-α (HIF -1-α),and endoglin protects hypoxic cells fro m 
apoptosis (Li et al ., 2003 ).
Endoglin acts to modulate signaling of mult iple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF -β 
superfamily , including TGF- β receptors, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptors, activin 
receptor -like kinases (ALKs) and activin receptors (Barbara et al., 1999 ).  In the abse nce of 
endoglin, act ivation of TGF -β receptors resul ts in phosphorylat ion of SMAD 2/3 proteins that 
inhibit endothelial cell growth.  However, activat ion of endoglin by BMP modulates SMAD 
protein phosphorylat ion, through phosphorylat ion of SMAD 1/5/8 (Nolan-Stevaux et al ., 2012 ).  
The end result is release of the growth inhibitory  effects of TGF -β receptor activat ion on 
endothelial cells (Lebrin et al ., 2004).  Similarly, endoglin is required for proliferat ion of 
endothelium in response to BMP.  BMP -9 and BMP -10 bind to endoglin to induce phosphorylate 
SMAD 1/5/8 to signal endothelial cell proliferat ion (Park et al ., 2008 ). 
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 17of 84 Confident ialA recent study  has dem onstrated that endogli n is highly  expressed in choroi dal 
neovascularizat ion (CNV) membranes surgically excised from exudat iveAMD pat ients 
(Yasukaw a et al ., 2000 ).
TRC105 i s an ant i-angiogenic m ouse/human chimeri c antibody  against human endoglin 
developed by TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  TRC105 binds endoglin on proliferating 
endothelial cells to inhibit ligand binding by BMP, interrupting signal tr ansduct ion, result ing in 
growth inhibit ion and apoptosis.  TRC105 also mediates ant ibody -dependent cell -mediated 
cytotoxi city (ADCC). 
A series o f pharmaco logy studi es in the TRACON oncology  program  have characterized 
TRC105 as a poten t anti -angiogenic age nt.  TRC105 alone inhibits VEGF -and bFGF -induced 
endothelial cell pro liferat ion, suggest ing that TRC105 can achieve similar therapeutic effects as 
anti-VEGF agents but through a different mechanism and specific or shared signaling pathway .
It may be that TRC105 and ant i-VEGF agents work synergist ically to inhibit neovascularizat ion 
and TRC105 suppresses the escape mechanism underlying resistance to the long -term anti-
VEGF treatment, both of which are mediated by  overexpressi on of endoglin. 
Several clinica l trials for vari ous cancer pati ents have being conducted by  TRACON 
Pharmaceut icals, Inc.  As o f 06 December 2014, over 300 patients had been treated with 
TRC105.  The majorit y of the patients have been Caucasian wit h ages ranging fro m 18-87 years.  
TRC105 has been well tolerated and exhibited a remarkably consistent adverse event profile, 
whether dosed as a single agent or dosed in co mbinat ion with VEGF inhibi tors or chem otherapy .  
Activity of TRC105 in combination has been part icularly noteworthy and repr esents the current 
development strategy .
Santen is developing an ophthalmic formulat ion of TRC105 -DE-122 injectable solution -
suitable for intravi treal inject ion for the treatment of exudative AMD.
Santen is opening the IND with this Phase I/II study (P rotocol  36-001), open -label, dose -
escalat ing, sequential cohort study  assessing the safet y, tolerabilit y, immunogenicit y,and 
bioact ivity of a single IVT inject ion of DE -122 injectable solut ion in the study  eye of 
approximately  twelve subjects wi th refract ory exudative AMD.  Four dose levels of DE-122 will 
be assessed in the Phase I/II study; 0.5 mg/eye, 1.0 mg/eye, 2.0 m g/eye and 4.0 mg/eye.  The 
doses selected for use in this study  were based on resul ts from the nonclinical studies.  
Addit ional informatio n regarding the nonclinical studies is provided in the Invest igator’s 
Brochure.
As of June 2016, 2 subjects in Cohort 1 have been enro lled and co mpleted the study  with no 
adverse events, and no safety  and tolerabilit y concerns.

7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan
This is an open -label, dose -escalat ing, sequent ial-cohort study  assessing the s afety, tolerabili ty, 
immunogenicit y,and bioactivit y of a single IVT inject ion of 0.5 m g, 1.0 m g, 2.0 m g and 4.0 m g 
DE-122 inject ion administered in a total of approximately 12 subjects wi th refractory  exudat ive 
AMD.
Approximately  12subjects in four cohor ts (2 or 3 subjects in Cohort 1, 3 subjects each in 
Cohorts 2, 3 and 4) will receive a single IVT injectio n of DE -122 in the study  eye. Decisi ons 
regarding dose escalat ion will be based on the recommendat ions of the Safet y Review Team  
consist ing of an exte rnal Ret ina Specialist, the Medical Monitor, and the Drug Safet y Physician.  
Dose -Limit ing Toxicit y response observed in any  cohort will  resul t in terminat ion of the dose 
escalat ion.
The study  is desi gned to incl ude up to a 7-day screening phase and 90-daytreatm ent/follow-up
phase for each subject. 
The first eligible subject in Cohort 1 will receive a single intravitreal inject ion of 0.5 mg DE -122 
in the study  eye and will be evaluated through Visit 3 (Day  8±1).  The Safet y Review Team will 
review the saf ety parameters and determine if the safet y and tol erabili ty are acceptable. 
If acceptable, up to two addit ional eligible subjects in Cohort 1 will each receive a single 
intravitreal inject ion of 0.5 mg DE -122 in the study  eye beforestarti ng Cohort 2 .  After the first
2or 3subjects in Cohort 1 have co mpleted Vi sit 5 (Day  30±2), the Safet y Review Team will 
review the safety  parameters of the first 2subjects in Cohort 1 and determine if the next dose 
(1.0 m g) will be administered to Cohort 2. 
The same en rollment procedures will be fo llowed for Cohort 2 (1.0 mg of DE -122), Cohort 3 
(2.0mg of DE -122) and Cohort 4 (4.0 mg of DE -122), h owever 3 subjects must be enrolled in 
these cohort s.
Rescue therapy  with anti-VEGF m edicati on may  be all owed at Vi sit 3 (Day 8±1) and/or at 
Visit 7 (Day  60±3) provi ded the following rescue criteria are met :  < 5 l etters gained fro m 
baseline BCVA or < 50 microns reduction fro m baseline CST as measured by SD -OCT.
All subjects will receive IVT ant i-VEGF treatment at Visit 5 (Day  30±2) after DE -122 IVT 
inject ion, in order to avoid a prolonged period without treatment, if no rescue therapy  was given 
atVisit 3(Day  8±1),regardless of the visual acuit y and CST outcom es.
All anti-VEGF treatm ent shoul d be perform ed using the same ant i-VEGF medicat ion received 
just prior to enrollment in the study . 
Safety assessments will be performed on each subject for up to 90 days .
All subjects will be closely mo nitored at Day s 8and/or 30 for dose limit ing toxicit ies by the 
Safety Review team  (Section7.4.1 ).
Randomization is not emplo yed in this study  due to the small sample size and the dose -escalat ing 
design.  Refer to Figure 1for a pi ctorial representati on of  the study  design.

Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 21of 84 Confident ial7.1.1. Selection of Concentrations in the Study
In th isclinical study , fourdose levels of DE-122 ( 0.5 m g, 1.0 mg, 2.0 m g or 4.0 m g)are being 
tested in subjects with refractor y exudat ive AMD.  Systemic exposure of DE -122 in this study  
given by  a single IVT injection at dose levels up to 4.0 mg/eye is ant icipated to be significant ly 
lower than the systemic exposure in over 300 cancer subjects (most of whom received 10 mg/kg 
of TRC105 by weekly intravenous infusio n).  Therefore , no concerns regarding systemic toxicit y 
are anticipated in this study .
In pre -clinical studies, the highest tested DE -122 IVT dose of 5 mg/mo nkey eye would correlate 
to 10 m g/eye in human eyes due to the d ifference in vo lume, hence the difference in vitreous 
volume between human and mo nkey (2:1 ratio) conveys a margin o f safety .
The starting IVT dose of 0.5 mg utilized in this clinical study  is only 1/10 (10%) of the 5 mg 
dose determined as safe in the sing le dose toxicit y study  in cyno molgus m onkeys by IVT 
inject ion (and 1/20, or 5%, of the safe 5 mg dose taking into account differences in monkey and 
human vitreous volumes).  The highest 4.0 mg dose tested in this clinical study  is only 80% of 
the safe dose in monkeys (and 40% of that dose with differences in vitreous vo lume considered).
In the m ouse m odel of laser-induced CNV efficacy study , animals were giv en an IVT injection 
of DE-122 at 0.5, 1.5 and 5.0 μg/ey e.  DE -122 inhibited CNV in a dose -dependent manner.  The 
lowest effect ive dose was 0.5 μg/ey e.  Consi dering the vitreous vol ume difference between 
human and mouse (~1000:1 ratio), 0.5 mg/eye is consid ered a logic alstarting dose level forthis
initial clinical study .  In addit ion, the 0.5 mg DE -122 IVT dose is 10 times lower than the 
tolerated dose of 5.0 mg/eye utilized in the single dose toxicit y study  in cyno molgus monkeys ,
aside from the margin of safet y conferred by  the difference in vi treous vol ume between mo nkey 
and human eyes described above.
7.2. Number of Subjects
Approximately  12subjects ( 2 or 3 subjects in Cohort 1, 3 subjects each in Cohorts 2, 3 and 4) 
with refractory  exudat ive age related mac ular degenerat ion will be enrolled at 5 sites.  The final 
number of subjects enro lled may be adjusted based on the presence o f dose limit ing toxicit ies.
7.3. Treatment Assignment
Four dose levels of DE-122 will be administered by  a single IVT inject ion in the s tudy eye as 
noted i n Table 3.
Table 3: Dose Groups and Associated DE -122 Concentration

Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 22of 84 Confident ial7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria
The Safet y Review Team will review safet y parameters after the first subject in a given cohort 
has completed Visit 3 (Day  8±1).  The rem aining subjects in the cohort will receive the same 
dose if neit her the safety  criteria for adj usting or stopping doses (Secti on7.4.1 )nor the criteria 
for study  terminat ion (Secti on7.5)preclude their treatment.
When the first 2 or 3subjects in Cohort 1and 3 subjects in other Cohort shave completed Visit 5
(Day  30±2), the Safet y Review Team will again evaluate the safet y parameters.  If the safet y 
criteria for adj usting or stopping doses and the criteria for study termination are not met, the first 
subject in the next cohort will receive the next higher DE -122 dose level .
The same safet y evaluat ions will be performed for each cohort .
7.4.1. Safety Criteria for Adjusting or Stopping Doses
If more than one of the following dose limit ing toxicit ies is observed in any one cohort, planned 
doses may  be adjusted or stopped by  the Safet y Review Team.
Visual acui ty loss from baseline defined a s:
oLoss of best corrected visual acuit y (BCVA) of 30or more lettersnot due to 
vitreous hem orrhage orinject ion procedure OR 
oTransit ion to no light perception (NLP) not due to inject ion procedure
Clinically significant inflammat ion defined as:

Severe IOP elevat ion as measured by tonometry , on two separate exams, at least one day  
apart, excluding day  of injecti on (despi te phar maceuti cal interventi on):
o> 35 mmHg OR
oIncrease of > 15 mmHg fro m baseline
If any o f the following adverse events (AEs) occur in any one subject in any cohort, planned 
doses will be adjusted by  treating addi tional subjects at the same or lower dose level (the 
occurrence of a second adverse event in either the same or different subjects in one cohort will
qualif yfor study  terminat ion, Secti on7.5):
Retinal non-perfusion of the study  eye/vascular occlusion
Vasculi tis 
Retinit is 
> 2+ disc edema
> 2 quadrants of retinal hemorrhage
If there is insufficient safet y informat ion in a given cohort at any  time, the Safet y Review Team 
may determine to treat additional subjects within that cohort before moving to the next co hort.

10.8. Study Drug Accountability
The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that an inventory is conducted upon receipt 
of the clinical supplies.  The temperature recorder fro m the shipment will be dea ctivated and 
authori zed study  staff will verify that the temperature was maintained at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46° F)
during transit.  The clinical supplies shipment form should be co mpleted, signed, and returned as 
directed.  A copy  must be m aintained at the sit e for the Principal Invest igator’s records. 
The Principal Invest igator will keep a current record of the inventory , storage condi tions and 
dispensing of all study  drugs.  Thi s record will be made available to Santen (or designee) for the 
purpose of accoun ting for all clinical supplies.  Any  significant di screpancy  and/or deficiency  
must be recorded with an explanat ion. 
All supplies sent to the Principal Invest igator must be accounted for and in no case will study 
drugs be used in any unauthorized situat ion.  It i s the responsibilit y of the Princi pal Invest igator 
to ensure that any  used and unused supplies are available to Santen (or designee) throughout the 
study .
10.9. Study Drug Handling and Disposal
All invest igational products including unused vials of DE -122 supplied by Santen/Representative 
will be fully accounted for by  the m onitor wi th the help of the person responsible for dispensing 
the DE -122 and will be returned to Santen/Representative or desi gnee.  Accountabilit y will be 
docum ented by  use of  drug ac countabilit y forms.
The used vials o f DE-122 will be stored at the investigat ional site upon complet ion of 
accountabilit y procedures and returned to Santen or designee after the trial is co mpleted.

Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 43of 84 Confident ial11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
11.1. Adverse Events
11.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is any  untoward m edical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceut ical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship wit h DE -122.  An AE ,therefore ,can 
be an unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease that has 
clinical significance and is temporally  associated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
In clinical studies, an undesirable medical condit ion occurring at any  time, including baseline or 
pre-treatm entperiod, may  be recorded as an AE even if no DE -122 has been administered.
Any significant adverse change in a subject’s condit ion from baseline, regardless of causalit y, is 
to be considered an A E, unl ess the change is determined to be a continuat ion of a pre- exist ing 
condi tion that i s docum ented in the subject’s medical history .  However, a clinically significant 
worsening in severit y, intensity, or f requency  of a pre -exist ing condit ion may indic ate an AE.  In 
addition, all  condi tions that l ead to hospi talizat ions, defined as an overnight hospital stay , are 
considered as AEs.  This includes planned elect ive surgeries. 
Lack of efficacy o f the IVT DE-122 for the condition being investigated is not considered an AE 
unless a clinically significant change is assessed by the Clinical Invest igator.  An elect ive 
surgi cal procedure scheduled or planned prior to study  entry  is not considered an AE if an 
overnight hospital stay  is not requi red, and the under lying diagnosis for which surgery is to be 
perform ed shoul d be captured in the medical history  as a pre -exist ing condit ion.  The surgical 
procedure should also include the term “elect ive” in all reports. 
11.1.1.1. Assessment of Adverse Events
Clinical Invest igators will seek informat ion on AEs at each subject contact.  Subjects should be 
asked ,using a general, non -direct questi on,if there has been any change in their general health.  
Direct questi oning and examinat ion shoul d then be perform ed as appropri ate.
Sever ity of the AE should be assessed according to the following criteria:
Mild: No interference with the subject’s daily act ivities; no medical intervention/therapy 
requi red
Moderate: Possible interference with the subject’s daily act ivities; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required
Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily act ivities; medical 
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Regardless of severit y, som e AEs may  also meet regul atory  serious cri teria.  Refer to definit ions 
and reporti ng of serious adverse events (SAEs) in Secti on11.1.2 .
A Clinical Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination o f the 
relationship of the invest igational drug, DE-122 to each AE (rel ated or not rel ated).  The Clinical 
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 44of 84 Confident ialInvest igator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibilit y that the DE -122 caused the AE/SAE based on facts, evidence, scient ific rationales, 
and clinical judgment.  When assessing c ausalit y, the Clinical  Investi gator m ay consider the 
following informat ion when determining the relat ionship to the DE -122 for each AE: mechanism 
of action, bi ologic plausibili ty, conf ounding risk factors (i.e., medical history , concomitant 
medicat ions), t emporal relat ionship, dechallenge/rechallenge, and lack of alternat ive explanat ion.  
It should be specified if the AE is related to the injection procedure and not the study  drug. 
The AE may be recorded as Related to DE -122 if there is a plausible tempora l 
relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the DE -122, and the 
AE cannot be readily explained by  the subject’s clinical state, concurrent illness, or 
concomitant therapies; and/or the AE fo llows a known pattern of response to the 
DE-122; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuat ion of the DE -122. 
Reporting the AE as Not Related to DE -122 may be considered if, for example, there 
is good evidence that the AE has an etio logy other than the DE -122 (e.g., pre- exist ing 
medical con dition, underlying disease, concurrent illness, or concomitant 
medicat ion); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relat ionship to administration 
of the DE -122 (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after dose of DE -122).
11.1.1.2. Reporting Adverse Events 
AEs, whether sp ontaneously  reported by  the subject or noted by  authorized study  personnel, will 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF.  Each recorded AE 
will be described by it s durati on (i.e., start and end dates), severit y, regul atory seriousness 
criteria if applicable, suspected relat ionship to the DE-122, acti ons taken and outcome.
AEs that occur after any  subject has provided written informed consent, before treatment, during 
treatm ent, or wi thin 30 days fo llowing the cessat ion oftreatment, whether or not they  are rel ated 
to the study , must be recorded.  To improve the qualit y and preci sion of acquired AE data, 
Clinical Invest igators should observe the following guidelines:
Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when reco rding.  Do not use 
colloquialisms and/or abbreviat ions.
If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than co mponent 
signs and symptoms and /or laboratory  or test findings (e.g., record congest ive heart 
failure rather than dyspnea, rale s, and cyanosis, and enlarged heart on chest x -ray).  
However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or 
disease shoul d be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congest ive heart failure and 
severe headache are observed at the same time and are clinically unrelated, each event 
shoul d be recorded as an individual AE).
If the diagnosis is not known, then record the leading co mponent sign, symptom or 
test finding and describe the other clinically related findings in the narrative 
description of the case.  A suspected diagnosis can be used and described as such 
(e.g., record suspected or probable myocardial infarction); this has to be updated in 
the clinical database once the diagnosis is confirmed. 
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 45of 84 Confident ialAEs occurring secondary  to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be ident ified by the 
primary  cause.  A primary AE, if clearly ident ifiable, generally represents the most 
accurate clinical term.  If a primary  AE is recorded, events occurring secondary  to the 
primary  event shoul d be describ ed in the narrative descript ion of the case .  For 
example:
The subject developed orthostatic hypotension and subsequent ly fainted and fell to 
the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.
The primary  AE in this example is orthostatic hypot ension.  The fall, head trauma and 
neck pain should be described in the narrative description of the case. 
For intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache), the event onset date should be 
recorded as the date the subject first started to experience t he event and resolut ion
date should reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped.  Separate AEs for 
each event should not be recorded.  For example, if a subject experienced headache 
on 14 SEP2015lasting for three hours, then subsequent ly experienc ed intermittent 
episodes of headache every  day for approximately 3 hours until 21 SEP2015, then the 
AE date of onset is 14SEP 2015 and the resolut ion date is 21 SEP2015.
For intermittent events , record the maximum severit y of the individual events.  For 
examp le, if a subject complains o f intermittent headaches for one week and the 
severit y of each headache ranges from mild to moderate, then the severit y woul d be 
moderate .
For intermittent hospitalizat ions occurring for a primary  AE (e.g., in a subject with 
multiple sclerosi s, commo nly known for its relapsing and remitting course, in so me 
cases leading to mult iple hospital confinements), the subsequent hospitalizat ions 
shoul d be described in the narrative descript ion of the case. 
If treatm ent was init iated, inc lude the treatment and duration of the medication(s) in 
the eCRF.
11.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
SAEs are defined as any  findings that suggest a significant hazard, con traindicat ion, side effect, 
or precaution.  Any  adverse event i s consi dered a seri ous adverse ev ent if i t resul ts in any of the 
following outcom es:
Death
Life threatening:
A life-threatening event is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of 
death fro m the event as i t occurred; it does not refer to an event that 
hypotheti cally  might have caused death if it were more severe.
Hospitalization, at the minimum an overnight stay  
A persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y 
A congenital anomaly/birth defect
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 46of 84 Confident ialOther medically significant events: 
Other medically significant events are events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered a serious adverse 
drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardi ze the subject and may require medical or surgical interv ention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above. 
Sight threatening event: 
A sight -threatening event is any  event that pl aces the subject at immediate risk of 
perm anent ly losing visio n in eit her eye as a direct result of the event. 
11.1.2.1. Reporting Serious A dverse Events
A SAE eCRF must be completed with as much information available within 24 hours of 
knowl edge of the event.
To improve the qualit y and precisio n of acquired SAE data, Clinical Invest igators should observe 
the following gui delines:
Death -Deat h is an outcome of an event.  The event that resul ted in the death should 
be recorded and reported as a SAE.
Hospitalizations for Surgical or Diagnostic Procedures -The illness
leading to the surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the 
SAE, not the procedure itself.  The procedure should be captured in the case 
narrative as part of the action taken in response to the illness.
When new significant informat ion (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, the Clinical 
Invest igator should e nter the informat ion directly into the eCRF wi thin 24 hours or as soon as 
possible after knowledge of the informat ion.
Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, Santen may request additional 
docum entati on, for exam ple, copi es of  the ophthalmic and medical record of the subject as well 
as results of laboratory  tests.  If the subject was hospitalized, the site should summarize the 
hospi tal discharge summary  and provi de to Santen upon request.
11.1.2.2. Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Santen (or d esignee) will provide the Principal Investigator with a reporting cover letter and an 
anonymized MedWatch 3500A for expedited reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.  The 
Principal Invest igator is responsible for receiving and reviewing expedited safet y repor ts, 
submitt ing expedited safet y reports to the IRB or IEC, and maintaining copies of expedited 
safet y reports in the study  records.
11.1.3. Events of Special Interest
Events of Special Interest (ESI s) are events that may require special attention for the purposes of 
on-going patient safet y review during this study .  The fo llowing are considered ESIs and should 
be reported on the appropriate eCRF with as much informat ion as available within 24 hours of 
knowl edge of the event:
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 47of 84 Confident ialStudy medication administration error –Study  medicat ion administration errors 
determined to be significant by  the Clinical Invest igator will be reported and 
evaluated as ESIs.  Examples of study  medicat ion administration errors may include, 
but are not limited to:  overdose of study  medicat ion and administration of study  
medicat ion from an incorrect kit.
Pregnancy -There are no con trolled data with the investigat ional product in human 
pregnancy.  It is required that women of childbearing potential use effect ive 
contraception during the study  and recommended for 12 weeks after the complet ion 
of the study .  Any  pregnancy occurring during study  treatm ent shoul d be reported and 
the subject removed from the study .  The subject should be followed unt il the end of 
pregnancy or until the end of the stud y, whichever is lo nger.
Ocular telangiectasia and bleeding –There is no data showing that the 
investigat ional product is related to these events.  However, these are seen in the 
Osler -Weber -Rendu (OWR) syndrome, a genet ic condit ion that causes endoglin 
dysfunct ion. DE -122 binds to and suppresses human endoglin, thus information about 
the ocul ar manifestati ons of  OWR are of value in predict ing possible ocular adverse 
following IVT inject ion of DE -122.  Any ocular telangiectasia or bleeding (both extra 
and i ntraocular) occurring during study  treatm ent shoul d be reported and the subject 
followed unt il the end of the study  or resol ution of  the event. 
11.1.4. Follow -up of Adverse Events
All reported AEs at study  exit will  be followed by the Clinical Investigator (or hi s/her designee) 
until the event is reso lved or determined to be irreversible, chronic, or stable.
In addit ion, on a case-by- case basis, Santen (or designee) may request fo llow up bey ond the end 
of the study .
If the Santen Pharmacovigilance Department reque sts fo llow-up on an individual SAE or 
designated ESI, site response to fo llow-up requests should be faxed to Santen 
Pharmacovigilance:  415-276 -5882 (fax) or drugsafet y@santeninc.co m.
11.1.5. Manual Back -Up Reporting Procedures
This study  is utilizing an electroni c data capture (EDC) sy stem  for data collection.  In the event 
that the EDC sy stem  is unavailable for electronic reporting, the manual back- up reporting 
procedures below should be fo llowed.
Com plete an AE and SAE form.
Attach a fax cover sheet with your co ntact information and address to Santen 
Pharmacovigilance.
Fax the cover sheet and the AE and SAE form to Santen Pharmacovigilance at 
When the EDC system beco mes available, update the EDC system with all previously reported

Preamble
1. The World Medical Associat ion (WMA) has developed the Declarat ion of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research invo lving human subjects, including research 
on identifiable human m aterial and data.
The Declaration is intended to be read as a who le and each of its const ituent paragraphs 
shoul d be applied wi th considerat ion of all other relevant paragraphs.
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declarat ion is addressed primarily  to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are invo lved in medical research invo lving human 
subjects to adopt these principles.
General Principles
3. The Declaration o f Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my  first consi derat ion,” and the Internat ional Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safegua rd the healt h, well -being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge 
and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this dut y.
5. Medi cal progress i s based on research that ult imately must include studies invo lving 
human subjects.
6. The primary purpose of medical research invo lving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve prevent ive, diagnostic and therapeut ic 
intervent ions (me thods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be 
evaluated continually through research for their safety , effect iveness, efficiency, accessibilit y 
and qualit y.
7. Medi cal research is subject to ethical standards that pr omote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 69of 84 Confident ial8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual rese arch subjects.
9. It is the duty of physicians who are invo lved in medical research to protect the life, 
healt h, dignity, integri ty, right to self -determinat ion, privacy , and confident iality of personal 
inform ation of research subjects. The respons ibilit y for the protecti on of  research subjects must 
always rest wi th the physician or other healt h care professio nals and never with the research 
subjects, even though they  have given consent.
10. Physicians m ust consider the ethical, legal and regu latory  norms and standards for 
research invo lving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable internat ional 
norm s and standards. No national or internat ional ethical, l egal or regul atory  requi rement shoul d 
reduce or eliminate any  of the pro tections for research subjects set forth in this Declarat ion.
11. Medi cal research shoul d be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the 
environment.
12. Medi cal research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individu als wi th 
the appropriate ethics and scient ific educat ion, training and qualificat ions. Research on patients 
or healthy vo lunteers requires the supervisio n of a competent and appropriately qualified 
physician or other healt h care professio nal.
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate 
access to participat ion in research.
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should invo lve their patients 
in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potenti al preventive, di agnosti c or 
therapeuti c value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research 
study  will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.
15. Appropriate compensat ion and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of 
participat ing in research must be ensured.
Risks, Burdens and Benefits
16. In medical pract ice and in medical research, most interventions invo lve risks and 
burdens .
Medi cal research invo lving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of 
the object ive outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.
17. All medical research invo lving human subjects must be preceded by careful as sessment 
of predi ctable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in 
comparison wi th foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by  the 
condi tion under invest igation.
Measures to minimi ze the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by  the researcher.
18. Physicians m ay not be involved in a research study  involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 70of 84 Confident ialWhen the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefit s or when there is conclusive 
proof of definit ive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately 
stop the study .
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring addit ional harm.
All vulnerable groups and individual s should receive specifically  considered protecti on.
20. Medi cal research wi th a vulnerable group is only  justified if the research is responsive to 
the healt h needs or priorit ies of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -
vulnerable group. In addit ion, thi s group shoul d stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or 
intervent ions that result fro m the research.
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols
21. Medi cal research involving human subjects must conform to gene rally accepted scient ific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scient ific literature, other relevant sources 
of inform ation, and adequate laboratory  and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The 
welfare of animals used for research must b e respected.
22. The design and performance o f each research study  involving human subjects must be 
clearly  described and j ustified in a research protocol.
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerat ions involved and shoul d 
indicate how the principles in this Declarat ion have been addressed. The protocol should include 
inform ation regarding funding, sponsors, inst itutional affiliat ions, potential conflicts of interest, 
incent ives for subjects and informat ion regarding provi sions for treating and/or compensat ing 
subjects who are harmed as a consequence of part icipat ion in the research study .
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provi sions.
Research Ethics Committees
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, co mment, guidance and 
approval  to the concerned research ethics committee before the study  begins. This committee 
must be transparent in its funct ioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country  or coun tries in which the research is to be performed as well as 
applicable international norms a nd standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or 
eliminate any  of the protecti ons for research subjects set forth in this Declarat ion.
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must 
provi de m onitoring i nformat ion to the committee, especially information about any serious 
adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made wit hout considerat ion and approval 
by the committee. After the end of the study , the researchers m ust submit a final report to th e 
committee containing a summary  of the study’s findings and conclusio ns.
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 71of 84 Confident ialPrivacy and Confidentiality
24. Every precaut ion must be taken to protect the privacy  of research subjects and the 
confident iality of their personal  information.
Informed C onsent
25. Participation by  individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical 
research must be vo luntary. Although i t may be appropri ate to consul t family  members or 
communit y leaders, no individual capable of giving informed con sent may  be enrolled in a 
research study  unless he or she freely  agrees.
26. In medical research invo lving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potenti al subject m ust be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliat ions of the researcher, the ant icipated benefit s 
and potenti al risks of the study  and the di scomfort it may entail , post -study provisio ns and any 
other rel evant aspects of the study . The potenti al subject m ust be informed of the right to refuse 
to parti cipate in the study  or to wi thdraw consent to participate at any  time wi thout reprisal . 
Speci al attenti on shoul d be given to the specific informat ion needs o f individual potential 
subjects as well as to the m ethods used to deliver the informat ion.
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the informat ion, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given 
inform ed co nsent, preferably in writ ing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writ ing, the non -
written consent must be formally  documented and wi tnessed.
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general ou tcom e and results o f the study .
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly caut ious if the potential subject is in a dependent relat ionship wit h the physician 
or may consent under duress . In such situations the informed consent must be sought by  an 
appropriately  qualified individual who is completely  independent of this relat ionship.
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These 
individuals must not be included in a research study  that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it i s intended to promote the health o f the group represented by  the potenti al subject, the 
research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and 
the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable o f giving informed conse nt is 
able to give assent to decisio ns about parti cipat ion in research, the physician must seek that 
assent in addit ion to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s 
dissent shoul d be respected.
30. Research invo lving subjects who are physically or mentally  incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious pat ients, may be done only  if the physical  or m ental  condi tion that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characterist ic of the research group. In s uch 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study  may proceed wi thout informed consent provided that the specific r easons for invo lving 
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 72of 84 Confident ialsubjects wi th a condi tion that renders them  unable to give informed consent have been stated in 
the research protocol and the study  has been approved by  a research ethics committee. Consent 
to rem ain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally  
authori zed representative.
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal o f a pati ent to parti cipate in a study  or the pati ent’s de cision to wi thdraw 
from the study  must never adversely  affect the patient -physician relat ionship.
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
materi al or data contained in bio banks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent for its collect ion, storage and/or reuse. There may be except ional situations where 
consent would be impossible or impract icable to obtain for such research. In such situations the 
research may be done only  after consi derat ion and approval of a research ethics committee.
Use of Placebo
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effect iveness of a new intervent ion must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervent ion(s), except in the fo llowing ci rcumstances:
Where no proven intervent ion exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; 
or
Where for compelling and scient ifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervent ion less effect ive than the best proven one, the u se of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary  to determine the efficacy or safet y of an intervent ion
and the patients who receive any intervention less effect ive than the best proven one, 
placebo, or no intervent ion will not be subject to addi tional risks of seri ous or i rreversible harm 
as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention.
Extrem e care m ust be taken to avoid abuse of this option.
Post-Trial Provisions
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, research ers and host coun try governments shoul d 
make provisio ns for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervent ion ident ified 
as beneficial in the trial.  This informat ion must also be disclosed to participants during the 
inform ed consent pr ocess.
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results
35. Every research study invo lving human subjects must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruit ment of the first subject.
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligat ions wit h 
regard to the publicat ion and disseminat ion of the results of research. Researchers have a duty  to 
make publicly  available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountabl e for 
the com pleteness and accuracy  of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines 
for ethi cal reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as posit ive results must be published or 
otherwi se made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliat ions and conflicts of 
interest m ust be declared in the publicat ion. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declarat ion shoul d not be accepted for publication.
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 73of 84 Confident ialUnproven Interventions in Clinical Practice
37. In the treatment of an individual pat ient, where proven interventions do not exist or other 
known intervent ions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with 
inform ed consent from  the pati ent or a l egally  authori zed represen tative, m ay use an unproven 
intervent ion if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing healt h or 
alleviat ing suffering.  This intervention should subsequent ly be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safet y and efficacy . In all  cases, new inform ation must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

21.4.1. Demographics /Eligibility , Medical /Surgical History and Concomitant 
Medication
Dem ographics /Eligibilit y, medical/surgi cal history and concomitant medicat ion will be obtained 
through subject interviews at Screening (Day  -7 to Day  -1).  Medi cal history  and conco mitant 
medicat ions will be obtained through subject interviews at each visit. CST before the recent a nti-
VEGF m edicat ion received at > 30 days and < 60days from Visit 1 (Day  1) will be collected as 
a Medi cal History .
21.4.2. Physical Examination
A full body  system atic physical exam will be conducted during Screening (Day -7 to Day  -1) and 
Visit 8/Exi t (Day  90±3).  Clinical Invest igator or an external  internist will confirm subject ’s 
overall condit ion noting any abnormalit ies by a review of the fo llowing systems : e.g., head, ey es, 
ears, nose and throat (HEENT), cardiopulmo nary, endocrine, gastrointestinal, 
musculo skeletal /rheumat ic, neuro logic/psychiatric, dermatologic, hepatic/renal systems, and 
other.
The Clinical Invest igator will assess subject’s overall condit ion to determine qualificat ion for 
study  entry  considering possible class effects of DE -122.  Newly no ted abnorm alities or 
worsening of previously noted abnormalit ies found at Study  Exit, or at any  safety assessment 
visit, will be assessed as an AE.  The Clinical Investigator should use his or her clinical judgment 
for appropri ate treatm ent and/or medical referral .
21.4.3. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at each visit using an automated or manual blood 
pressure monitor.  Sy stolic and di astolic blood pressures will be recorded in millimeters of 
mercury (mmHg) and heart rate will be recorde d in beats per minute (bpm). 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Joint National Co mmittee on Prevent ion, 
Detection, Evaluat ion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (U.S.Department of Health and 
Hum an Services et al., 2004 ), the following measurement procedure will be used to measure 
vital signs:
Subject should not smoke or ingest caffeine within the 30 -minute period immediately 
before the measurement.
Subject should be seated quiet ly in a chair with the back supported, feet on the floor, 
arm bared, and arm supported at heart level.
Begin the measurement after at least 5 minutes of rest.
Toensure an accurate measurement, use an appropriately sized cuff.  The cuff 
bladder should encircle at least 80% of the arm.  Many adults need a large cuff.
Take two (2) systolic/diastolic pressure and heart rate measurements separated by at 
least 30 secon ds.  Record each measurement in the subject’s source docum ent.
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 75of 84 Confident ialIf the two pressure measurements differ by 5 mmHg or less , then the average of the 
two beco mes the recorded pressure.  For example, if the two measurements are 
120/90 and 125/95, then 122.5/92. 5 is the recorded sy stolic/diastolic pressure.
If the two pressure measurements differ by more than 5 mmHg , then a thi rd reading 
measurement is made, and the average of the three beco mes the recorded pressure.  
For example, if the three measurements are 11 5/90, 124/96, and 120/92, then 
119.7/92.7 is the recorded sy stolic/diastolic pressure.  The recorded blood pressure 
will be the average of the measurements.
Record the heart rate.  For heart rate, the average of the two (or three, if performed) 
measurement s obtained beco mes the recorded heart rate. 
21.4.4. EKG
EKGs will be recorded at Screening (Day -7 to Day  -1) and reviewed for abnormalit ies by the 
Clinical Invest igator prior to enrollment . EKGs will also be performed at Visit 3 (Day  8 ±1), 
Visit 5 (Day  30±2), a nd Visit 8/Exi t(Day  90±3) .
21.4.5. Best Corrected Visual Acuity
ETDRS chart will be used to examine BCVA at each study  visit. See Study  Procedures manual
forthe detailed procedure for measuring visual acuit y.
21.4.6. Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy
Slit-lamp bi omicroscopy  will be used to examine eye structures at each study  visit.  Slit -lamp 
biomicroscopy  will be perform ed pri or to inject ion and then again within 30 minutes after 
inject ion on the visit of DE- 122 or anti -VEGF injecti on.
The lid, conjunct iva, cornea, and lens will be observed wit h the slit -lamp beam approximately 
0.3 mm in width and 1.0 mm in length and graded on a 4 -point scale (0 -3 scal e) as described 
below:
Lid Redness
None (0) = Norm al
Mild (1) = Redness of most or all the lid(s) margin OR skin

Pupil
The pupil will be evaluated for the presence of any cl inically  significant abnorm alities, and 
graded as either normal (wit hin normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormalit y 
present).  A descript ion of any clinically  significant abnorm alities will  be noted.
21.4.7. Intraocular Pressure
IOP will be meas ured by applanat ion tonometry  at each study  visit.  At the visit of DE -122 or 
anti-VEGF medicat ion inject ion, IOP will be m easured before DE -122 or anti -VEGF m edicat ion
inject ion and 40 (±10) minutes after inject ion.  If post -inject ion IOP is increased ≥ 10 mmHg 
from pre-inject ion IOP, the IOP will be measured again 60 (±10) minutes fo llowing inject ion.  If 
there is an increase of ≥ 10 mmHg at 60 (±10) minutes post -inject ion compared to pre -inject ion 
IOP, the subject will be prescribed a topical IOP -lowerin g medicati on unt il he or she returns for 
follow-up per the Clinical Investigator’s discret ion (an unscheduled visit may apply) , and the 
IOP increase of ≥ 10 mmHg shall be reported as an AE.
IOP should be measured only after the biomicroscopy examination has been completed.
The applanation tonometer must be calibrated for accuracy  before the first subject undergoes 
screening, and periodically  until the last subject has exited the study .  For checking calibrat ion, 
follow the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The following IOP m easurement procedure i s in accordance with the procedure used in the 
Ocul ar Hypertensio n Treatm ent Study  (Gordon et al., 2001) at each visit:
The ri ght eye i s always tested first.  At least two, and so metimes three, consecut ive 
measurements are made to obtain a determinat ion of intraocular pressure.  Each IOP 
measurement should be recorded in the subject’s source document and in the eCRFs.
If the two measurements differ by 2 mmHg or less, then the average of the two 
measurements beco mes the recorded IOP.  For example, if the two measurements are 
22 and 23, then 22.5 is the final recorded IOP.
Protocol  36-001 DE-122 Injectable Solut ion
Versi on 4.0_30JUN2016 78of 84 Confident ialHowever, if the two measurements differ by 3 mmHg or more, then a third 
measurement is made, and the median o f the three measurements beco mes the 
recorded IOP (the median is the middle measurement after arraying the measurements 
from low to hi gh).  For exam ple, if the three measurements are 15, 19, and 16, then 
16 is the final recorded IOP.
The IOP in the left eye is then measured using the same technique.
21.4.8. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy
Indirect ophthalm oscopy  will be perform ed for each eye at each visit with pupil  dilat ion.
Indirect ophthalm oscopy  will be used to examine the retina at each study  visit.  Indi rect 
ophthalmoscopy  will be perform ed pri or to and wi thin 30 minutes after each DE-122 or anti-
VEGF m edicat ioninject ion.  Areas to be assessed include cup to disc ratio, retina, macula and 
choroi d, and vitreous.
Cup/Disc Ratio
The cup/disc ratio will be determined by the exam iner and recorded using two decimal places 
(e.g., 0.80).
Retina, Macula and Choroid
The retina, macula and choroid will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant 
abnorm alities, and graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnorma l (clinically 
significant abnorm ality present).  A descript ion of any abnormalit ies will be noted.
Vitreous
The fo llowing Nati onal Ey e Inst itute Grading Scheme will be used to measure vitreous haze 
and opacificat ion (Nussenblatt et al., 1985).
Vitreous Haze Scale
Step Descript ion 
(0) Clear

A serum pregnancy test will be conducted at Scree ning (Day  -7 to Day  -1)and Visit 8/Exit 
(Day  90±3) for all wo men of childbearing potential.  A female is considered of childbearing 
potenti al unless she i s post -menopausal (at least 24 months since last menses occurred), has had 
her uterus and/or both ov aries removed, or has had a bilateral tubal ligat ion.  To perform the 
pregnancy test, Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG ) will be contained into serum  param eters 
that will be measured . 
21.4.14. Hematology, Chemistry and Urinalysis
Approximately  10mLof fasting blo od and urine sam ples will  be obtained at Screening (Day  -7

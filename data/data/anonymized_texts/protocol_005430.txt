2020Amendment 	2 Summary 	of	Changes
The Amendment 1 protocol, dated 12 Feb 2020, has been amended to reflect the 
following changes:
1. During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote study visits are possible to avoid 
missing efficacy data but are not preferred over clinic visits. 
2. Considering the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit and 
risk to patients participating in this study has been re-evaluated. Based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of the investigational product.
3. Updated Section 9.7.8 (Interim Analysis) to reflect that the interim futility 
analysis has now been performed, after 62% of randomized patients completed or discontinued the study.
Remote Study Visits :
Investigators/appropriately designated study staff will be allowed to perform selected study procedures as remote study assessments (eg, conducted via phone, video conference) if participants are unable to attend in-person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During these remote study visits, the supplemental Schedule of Visits and Procedures for 
Remote Study Visits below should be followed and documented that the visit was 
conducted remotely due to COVID-19 pandemic issues.
Safety Assessments: 
Safety assessments permitted to be completed remotely include assessment of adverse 
events and concomitant medications. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) may be performed remotely, and any positive results will be reviewed with an Investigator-delegated clinician to ensure the participant is not at risk for suicide. Lab draws (PK, pregnancy testing and safety labs), ECG, physical exam and vital signs will need to be collected by an appropriate healthcare professional from the site or captured as 
a deviation if it is not possible to collect these data.
Efficacy Assessments:
Due to the nature of the participant CDRS-R assessment, the interview may be performed 
remotely provided that the participant has access to a videoconferencing platform where the rating clinician can visually see the participant during the discussion. The parent/caregiver CDRS-R interview may be conducted via phone or videoconferencing.
Study Medication Dispensation for Remote Study Visits:
If it is necessary to conduct any part of a visit remotely, resulting in Study Medication not 
being able to be dispensed to the patient at the study site, the option to have study medication delivered by courier direct-to-patient (DTP) may be possible. Approval by the Sponsor for DTP will need to be obtained from the Study Site each time DTP is utilized.

2020Amendment 	1	Summary 	of	Changes
The original protocol, dated 02 Mar 2018, has been amended to reflect the following 
changes:
1. Clarification that pharmacokinetic samples will only be collected in patients aged 
7 to 11 years old.
2. Clarification that participants from Study LVM-MD-11 are excluded from 
participating in this study.
3.Updated exclusion item #2 to replace the term “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” per the category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition.
4. Added interim futility analysis for when approximately 50% of randomized 
patients have either completed or discontinued the study.

20202.0 SYNOPSIS AND SCHEDULE OF EVALUATIONS
CLINICAL STUDY SYNOPSIS: Study LVM-MD-14
Title of StudyA Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-controlled Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Levomilnacipran ER in Pediatric Patients7-17 Years With Major Depressive Disorder 
Study Centers Approximately 60 study centers
Development Phase 3
ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of levomilnacipran compared with placebo in pediatric outpatients (7-17 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD). 
In addition, the study is designed to obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
to define the PK
profile of levomilnacipran in the pediatric population 
(7-17 years of age).
MethodologyMulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-
controlled, flexible-dose, parallel group study
During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remote 
study visits were implemented and will continue to be possible to avoid missing efficacy but are not preferred over clinic visits. The study center needs to alert the Sponsor, ahead of time when possible, that a remote procedure was performed.
Number of Patients 480 planned (160 placebo, 160 levomilnacipran, and 160 fluoxetine) 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for InclusionMale and female outpatients, 7 to 17 years of age (inclusive), who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD; have a score of  ≥ 40 on the 
Children’s Depression Rating Scale–Revised (CDRS-R) at Visits 1 and 2, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 at 
Visits 1 and 2. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders–Present and Lifetime (K-SADS–PL) will be used to confirm the diagnosis of MDD and to document the patient’s psychiatric history.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of AdministrationEncapsulated levomilnacipran extended-release (ER) 10 mg(nontrade), 20 mg, and 40 mg capsules; once-daily oral administration, at the same time each day
Duration of Study!10 weeks in duration: 1-week screening/washout period, followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period and a 1-week double-blind down-taper period
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and 
Mode of AdministrationPlacebo capsules, once-daily oral administration, at the same time 
each day
Encapsulated fluoxetine 10 mg capsules and encapsulated fluoxetine 
20 mg capsules; once-daily oral administration, at the same time each day
Criteria for Evaluation
Primary Outcome Measure CDRS-R change from baseline at Week 8
Secondary Outcome Measure CGI-S change from baseline at Week 8
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 6
2020Safety MeasuresAdverse event (AE) recording, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements including height and weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
Pharmacokinetic AnalysisThe population PK of levomilnacipran will be characterized using plasma concentration-time data. The maximum plasma drug 
concentration, area under the curve, time of maximum plasma 
concentration, half-life, apparent oral clearance and/or apparent volume of distribution for levomilnacipran ER will be estimated and a summary will be reported.
Statistical MethodsThe primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to end of Week 8 of the double-blind treatment period in the CDRS-R total score.
The primary analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, study center, 
visit, and treatment group–by-visit interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline value–by-visit interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within-patient scores. This analysis will be performed based on all postbaseline scores using only the observed 
cases without imputation of missing values.
The secondary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to end 
of Week 8 of the double-blind treatment period in CGI-S. This parameter will be analyzed using an MMRM similarly to the primary efficacy parameter. 
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively. The safety 
analysis will be performed using the Safety Population, defined as all 
randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of the investigational product. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population, defined as all patients in the Safety 
Population who had the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline 
assessment of CDRS-R total score.
Population PK parameters will be estimated using nonlinear 
mixed-effects modeling methods. The study will be prospectively powered to target a 95% confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for levomilnacipran ER, with at least 80% power.

2020In the event of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to 
difficulties in performing protocol-specified procedures, the Sponsor will engage with study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of patients, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the study while trying to best manage patient continuity of care. This may include alternative methods for assessments (eg, phone contacts or virtual site visits), and shipping investigational product and/or supplies direct to patients to ensure continuity of treatment where allowed. In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by local regulations and permitted by IRB/IEC. Investigators should notify the Sponsor if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the patients against any immediate hazard.
5.3 PATIENT INFORMATION AND INFORMED CONSENT
After being given an explanation of the study and before participating in any study 
procedures, each patient, if developmentally appropriate, must provide written assent, and his or her parent(s), legal guardian(s), or legally authorized representative (LAR) (hereafter referred to as parent/guardian/LAR) must provide voluntary and written informed consent in compliance with 21 CFR, Parts 50 and 312 and give HIPAA authorization (or an equivalent of HIPAA authorization in non-US countries). 
The signed documents will be placed in the Investigator’s study files. A unique patient 
identification (PID) number will be assigned.
5.3.1 Patient Assent Form
To participate in the study, the patient will read, assent understanding of, sign the assent 
form, and be made aware they can withdraw from the study at any time. Patients who are unable to read the assent form will have the statements read to them. If the patient cannot sign the form, a witness will be allowed to provide written verification of oral assent. A copy of the signed assent will be given to the patient’s parent/guardian/LAR. 
5.3.2 Parent, Legal Guardian, and Legally Authorized Representative 
Informed Consent
Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient’s parent/guardian/LAR before 
the patient participates in any study-related procedure. To provide consent for the patient’s participation in the study, the patient’s parent/guardian/LAR will read, assent to an understanding of, and sign an instrument of informed consent or other locally applicable regulations and authorization form after having had an opportunity to discuss the forms with the Investigator before signing. The parent/guardian/LAR will be made aware that the patient may withdraw from the study at any time and will receive a copy of the signed ICF. Patients who reach the age of majority (ie, 18 years of age in most jurisdictions) during the course of the study, are required to be re-consented.

20207.0 INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and serious illness in children and 
adolescents. Epidemiological studies and clinical samples estimate the prevalence of MDD as approximately 1%-2% of prepubertal children, and between 3% and 8% of adolescents ( Zalsman 2006 ). By the ages of 10 to 15, girls appear to be more likely to 
experience depression than boys ( Angold 1998).
MDD is commonly associated with feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and thoughts of suicide and its psychosocial burden in the formative years can compromise the developmental process. Patients also experience difficulties with concentration and motivation, impairing functioning in this critical period. Each year as many as 20% of adolescents have suicidal ideation and 9% attempt suicide ( Grunbaum JA 2002). Suicide 
is a leading cause of death in adolescents and is a major public health concern (CDC 2014). A major risk factor for suicide in adolescents is major depression.
MDD in children and adolescents can be chronic and recurrent. The mean length of pediatric depressive episodes is approximately 7 months, and in the course of a first episode, up to 40% of patients appear to recover without specific treatment. However, patients who do not recover appear to be at high risk of chronic depression, and those who do recover have high rates of recurrence and dysthymia (Zalsman 2006).
As a pharmacological treatment, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) for children and adults increased approximately 7-fold during the 1990s. Fluoxetine (Prozac
®), an SSRI, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDD in 
children and adolescents 8 years and older. Escitalopram (Lexapro®), another SSRI, is 
approved for the treatment of MDD in patients aged 12 and over. Currently, no serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been approved for the treatment of MDD in children or adolescents.
Levomilnacipran is an SNRI approved for the treatment of MDD in adults in the United 
States. The pharmacologic mechanism of the antidepressant activity of levomilnacipran and other SNRIs (ie, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine) is thought to be mediated through inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HT) reuptake in the central nervous system. Although all SNRIs (as a class) block 5-HT and NE reuptake, currently marketed SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine) are more potent inhibitors of 5-HT reuptake than of NE reuptake (Deecher 2006; Vaishnavi 2004). Levomilnacipran exhibits a distinct in vitro profile, 
exhibiting more potent inhibition of NE reuptake than 5-HT reuptake ( Auclair 2013 ). 
This greater potency at the NE transporter may confer additional improvements specifically in those domains associated with noradrenergic neurotransmission; for example: alertness, energy, attention, and anhedonia ( Montgomery and Briley, 2011 ).
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 23
2020The efficacy of levomilnacipran as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression 
Rating Scale total score was established in 3 pivotal studies of adult patients with MDD. Levomilnacipran also demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured byimprovement in the Sheehan Disability Scale functional impairment total score. These studies, which were conducted in the United States and Canada, were placebo-controlled; no active comparator was included. Two of the studies were fixed-dose studies (LVM-MD-01: placebo, levomilnacipran 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, and 120 mg/day; and LVM-MD-10: placebo, levomilnacipran 40 and 80 mg/day) and 1 study wasflexible-dose (LVM-MD-03: placebo, levomilnacipran 40 mg/day to 120 mg/day).
In summary, MDD is a condition common in children and adolescents and is a major 
public health concern. Current approved treatment options for this condition are limited to the 2 aforementioned SSRI products. Since the modulation of energy, vigilance, and arousal can be directly linked to the noradrenergic system, it has been suggested that antidepressants with a prominent noradrenergic component, such as levomilnacipran, may be particularly effective in addressing functional impairment, decreased concentration, lassitude, mental and physical slowing, and decreased self-care (Citrome 2013 ). Brain serotonin and norepinephrine systems continue to mature through 
childhood and adolescence, however, and these maturational effects may generate age-related differences in patients’ responses to pharmacotherapy. Thus, it is important that further investigation of SNRI treatment options such as levomilnacipran be evaluated systematically for the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents, so that an SNRI’s efficacy and safety profile can be characterized in this population.
The current study of levomilnacipran extended release (ER) in pediatric patients 
(7-17 years old) with MDD will be conducted as required under the Pediatric Research Equity Act and as agreed upon with the FDA as a part of Postmarketing Requirement studies.

20209.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION
Study LVM-MD-14 will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and 
active-controlled, flexible-dose, parallel group study in pediatric patients, ages 7-17 years. The study will be approximately 10 weeks in duration:
!1-week screening/washout period
!8-week double-blind treatment period 
!1-week double-blind down-taper period 
The screening/washout period will be generally 1 week (± 3 days) prior to Visit 2
(Baseline), but may be extended up to a total of 5 weeks to accommodate prior medication washout or to repeat assessments. Patients will not receive any investigational product during the screening period. 
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria at Visit 2 (Baseline) will be randomized to 1 of 
3 treatment groups: placebo, levomilnacipran, or fluoxetine. See Section 9.4.5 for details 
regarding dose selection and timing. 
All randomized patients who complete the 8-week double-blind treatment period and 
patients who prematurely discontinue from the study before completing 8 weeks of double-blind treatment should enter the 1-week, double-blind down-taper period unless it is considered not clinically appropriate by the Investigator. 
All randomized patients must complete Visit 8/Early Termination (ET) Visit and, at the 
end of the down-taper period, return for Visit 9/Safety Follow-up (SFU) Visit. Patients who do not enter the down-taper period must return for Visit 9/SFU Visit approximately 1 week after Visit 8/ET Visit.
Approximately 480 patients (160 per treatment group) are planned to be randomized in 
the study.
Figure 9-1 provides a schematic of the study design. 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic developed after this study began,
and this protocol has been amended to account for study procedures that may need to be modified in association with adhering to local guidelines or regulations or site flexibility to complete study-required procedures.

2020During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote study visits, in which data are collected via 
phone or videoconference, were and will continue to be possible when needed. To accommodate changes that sites may need to implement during the pandemic, Section 2.0
outlines the conduct of study assessments during on-site clinic visits, which is the preferred method of conducting the study, while study assessments for remote visits are included in Section 2.1. Sites will need to inform the Sponsor of the need for a remote 
visit in advance whenever possible.
In the event that it is required to perform procedures remotely, every effort should be 
made to perform the remote assessment in a manner as similar as possible to the on-site assessment. Patient data collected via phone or video conferencing should remain consistent with either method for each patient.
Detailed descriptions of each study visit are provided in Section 9.5.5.
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 28
2020Visit conduct options will allow remote visits as outlined below:
!Option 1: In-clinic visits 
This is the preferred option. All study visits are performed as in clinic visits with all 
assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 2.0.
!Option 2: Remote visits (except screening) 
This option is only to be used if local guidance, regulations, or the needs of the patientprevent the site or the patient from completing on-site visit procedures. Screening visits must take place as an in-clinic visit with all assessments outlined in the schedule of assessments in Section 2.0. All other visit procedures (V2-V8) can be completed 
remotely with the assessments outlined in Section 2.1. The study center needs to alert the 
Sponsor, ahead of time when possible, that a remote procedure was performed.
For remote visits, there is an option to have study drug delivered by preferred courier. 
Approval from the Sponsor study team must be obtained from the study center each time the preferred courier service is utilized. 
9.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE 
OF CONTROL GROUPS
This placebo- and active-controlled, flexible-dose design with an 8-week double-blind 
treatment period was chosen based on prior studies that established the efficacy and safety of levomilnacipran in adult patients with MDD. In this study, Investigators must use a valid and reliable diagnostic method for recruiting and enrolling children and adolescents meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition 
(DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013 ) criteria for MDD.
A placebo arm is included for comparison since placebo-controlled superiority trials have been shown to be conducive to higher quality studies and to provide more reliable outcomes than non-inferiority comparisons to a previously approved drug ( Feifel 2008; 
Laughren 2001; Gispen-de Wied 2012 ). In addition, placebo in place of the (limited) 
standard therapy should not cause irreversible health problems or extreme suffering (depression is recognized by the FDA as a condition in which there is substantial improvement and variability in placebo groups; see FDA Guidance for Industry:
E10, May 2001 ). 
Fluoxetine was selected as an active comparator for assay sensitivity in the present study because it is an SSRI approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents 8 years and older.
In the current study, safety and efficacy assessments are included in every visit to 
determine adequacy of response, safety, and tolerability for all patients.

20209.3.3 Removal of Patients from Therapy or Assessment
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who gave voluntary assent and/or 
whose parent/guardian/LAR and/or caregiver signed the ICF ceases participation in thestudy, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the study. Patients can be prematurely discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:
!Screen failure (failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria) 
!Withdrawal by subject
!Adverse event (AE)
!Lack of efficacy
!Protocol deviation
!Non-compliance with study drug
!Lost to follow-up
!Study terminated by Sponsor 
!Site terminated by Sponsor
!Other
All randomized patients who prematurely discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, 
should be seen for a final assessment at ET (see Section 9.5.5.6 for details on assessments 
performed at Visit 8/ET). Patients who discontinued from the study and did not return to the site for final assessments must be requested in writing to do so and to return any 
unused investigational product. A copy of the letter, together with the source 
documentation, will be kept by the Investigator. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the Study Disposition Pages of the eCRF.
All randomized patients must complete Visit 8/ET Visit and return for Visit 9/SFU at the 
end of the down-taper period. Patients who do not enter the down-taper period must return for Visit 9/SFU approximately 1 week after Visit 8/ET Visit.

20209.3.5 Demographic Considerations
Efforts will be made to have reasonable representation with respect to gender, race, and 
ethnicity, reflecting the proportions in the disease population. AGN will monitor enrollment and may instruct the sites accordingly.
9.4 TREATMENTS
Patients meeting the eligibility criteria at Visit 2 (Baseline) will be randomized in a 
double-blind fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, levomilnacipran, or fluoxetine.
9.4.1 Treatments Administered
At Visit 1 (Screening) and after consent/assent is obtained, patients will be given a 
placebo capsule to swallow to confirm their ability to swallow investigational product.
Investigational product in the form of over-encapsulated capsules will be packaged in 
blister cards and provided by AGN. Patients will be supplied with blinded investigational product and will be instructed to take 2 capsules orally each morning (see Section 9.4.5
for details). Confirmation that dosing scheme (including titration and down-taper) and dosing instructions were discussed with the patient and caregiver, and that dosing instructions were provided will be recorded in the source documents.
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products
Investigational product will be supplied by AGN as capsules containing placebo or 
nontrade levomilnacipran 10 mg capsules, trade levomilnacipran 20 mg capsules, trade levomilnacipran 40 mg capsules, fluoxetine 10 mg capsules, or fluoxetine 20 mg capsules packaged in blister cards.
The blister cards will contain sufficient numbers of doses for the interval of days between 
scheduled visits plus additional doses to accommodate visit scheduling. 
The blister cards will be labeled with the protocol number, storage information, warning 
language (viz, “Caution: New Drug—Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use”), and instructions to take as directed. The Investigator will write the date, visit number, study week, and PID number on the label.
All investigational product will be provided and shipped to the study centers by AGN and 
must be stored in an appropriate secure area (eg, a locked cabinet in a locked room) at room temperature (25°C or 77°F, with a permitted range of 15°C-30°C or 59°F-86°F), and must be protected from light, heat, and moisture.

Allergan Sales, LLC Page 36
2020The Investigator is responsible for recording the receipt and use of all investigational 
product supplied and for ensuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these supplies. All unused investigational product must be returned; and, whenever investigational product are returned, unit counts must be performed. All investigational product must be accounted for. At the end of the study, all unused investigational product and empty investigational product packages must be returned to the Sponsor at the address provided in the Study Reference Binder.
9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
After the patient, parent/guardian/LAR, and caregiver provide assent and sign the ICF at 
Visit 1 (Screening), study personnel will register the patient in the interactive Web response system (IWRS), and the system will assign the patient a sequential PID number. The first patient entered into the system at each site will be assigned the first number in the sequence by the system. This PID num ber will be used to identify the patient 
throughout the study (ie, at all study phases). 
The study center must contact the IWRS at Baseline (Visit 2) and all subsequent study 
visits in order to obtain the instructions on kit number for the investigational product to be dispensed to the patient at that visit. 
A detailed description of IWRS procedures is contained in the IWRS Site User Guide that 
should be stored in the Study Reference Binder.
9.4.4 Selection of Dosages in the Study
Doses of levomilnacipran in pediatric patients (7-17 years of age) were selected based on 
modeling of available PK data submitted with NDA 204,168 from the adult healthy volunteers and patients with MDD, as well as adolescent patients (12-17 years of age, LVM-MD-11, 2017) with MDD. Based on the results of modeling a common dosing scheme for both age groups of 7-11 and 12-17 years is appropriate. While the adolescent age group, 12-17 years of age, demonstrates similar plasma concentrations as adults administered the same dose of 80 mg/day, for the younger age group, 7-11 years of age, data indicate that equivalent concentrations are achieved with approximately a 33% dose reduction. Thus, 80 mg/day is expected to show exposure similar to exposures seen for the adult population administered 120 mg/day.
Based on the above findings, levomilnacipran 40 mg/day, with an optional increase to 
80 mg/day based on therapeutic response and tolerability, is appropriate for the pediatric 
patient age range (7-17 years of age). The corresponding plasma concentrations of these 
doses in pediatric patients are expected to remain within the plasma concentrations associated with the approved therapeutic dose range for adults.

Allergan Sales, LLC Page 37
20209.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
All investigational products should be taken orally as a single dose, once-daily at the 
same time each day. After consent/assent is obtained, patients undergoing screening will 
be required to swallow a placebo capsule to confirm their ability to swallow the investigational product, as part of their eligibility assessment.
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) and who continue to meet 
all the eligibility criteria for participation in the study will be assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Baseline) and dispensed the corresponding blister card containing capsules of double-blind investigational product for Week 1. Patients will begin dosing with double-blind capsules on the next day. Patients will be instructed to take 2 capsules orally as a single dose, once daily at approximately the same time each day (morning dosing recommended), with or without food. 
Dosing may be switched from the morning to another time of day if a patient prefers or if 
tolerability issues arise. However, any switch must allow at least 20 hours between 2 consecutive doses. 
9.4.5.1 Screening Period
At Visit 1 (Screening) after consent/assent is obtained, a placebo capsule will be administered for the purpose of eligibility determination. Patients will be given a placebo capsule to swallow. If a patient is unable to swallow the placebo capsule, the patient will be ineligible for study participation.
9.4.5.2 Double-blind Treatment Period
The titration schedule is as follows:
!Levomilnacipran: Days 1-3, 10 mg/da y; Days 4-7, 20 mg/day; Week 2 through 
Week 8, 40 mg/day; Based on therapeutic response and tolerability, an additional 
dose increase to 80 mg/day is permitted at Week 3.
!Fluoxetine 20 mg/day (active comparator): Week 1, 10 mg/day; Week 2 throughWeek 8, 20 mg/day
Patients will be assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Baseline) and dispensed the corresponding blister card containing capsules of double-blind investigational product for Week 1. Patients will begin dosing with double-blind capsules on the next morning. Patients will be instructed to take 2 capsules from each column (1 each from Row A andRow B) as a single dose daily each morning with or without food. The double-blind dosing regimen is presented in Table 9-1 .

Patients will be instructed to return the blister card with any remaining investigational 
product, and to return it even if it is empty, preferably at the next study visit. Additional investigational product will be dispensed as per the schedule shown in Section 2.0.
If a patient experiences an AE, the investigational product may be stopped for up to a maximum of 4 consecutive days. The date and reason for missed doses must be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. If appropriate, as deemed by the investigator, patient may resume medication at 40 mg/day or reduce to 40 mg/day (if taking 80 mg/day). Those unable to tolerate 40 mg/day should be discontinued from the study.
9.4.5.3 Double-Blind Down-Taper Period
All randomized patients who complete the 8-week double-blind treatment period andpatients who prematurely discontinue from the study before completing 8 weeks of double-blind treatment should enter the 1-wee k, double-blind down-taper period unless it 
is considered not clinically appropriate by the Investigator. The double-blind down-titration regimen is as follows:
!Levomilnacipran 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day: Days 1-2, 40 mg/day;
Days 3-7, 20 mg/day

20209.4.6 Blinding
A list of patient randomization codes will be generated by Statistical Programming at 
AGN and implemented by the IWRS vendor (an electronic version will be stored on a secure server). This list will identify each patient by randomization number and includethe patient’s corresponding treatment assignment.
9.4.7 Unblinding
The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. The study blind may be 
broken if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the patient’s best interest to know the study treatment assignment. The Sponsor must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the patient’s condition. In this case, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF, as applicable.
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
A list of concomitant medications that are allowed and not allowed for either episodic or 
chronic use is provided in Appendix III . Medication history (psychotropic medication 
history during the previous 5 years and all other medications during the past 12 months) will be recorded at Visit 1 (Screening) in the eCRF. Thereafter, any changes in concomitant medications or new medications added will be recorded in the eCRF.
9.4.9 Monitoring Treatment Compliance
Investigational product compliance during any treatment period will be closely monitored 
by counting the number of capsules dispensed and returned. Before new investigational product is dispensed at each visit, every effort will be made to collect all unused investigational product. Patients who do not take investigational product for 5 or more consecutive days, or consistently demonstrate poor compliance (< 80% or > 120% in 2 consecutive visit intervals, measured by capsule count) should be considered for study discontinuation. Investigators should consult with the Study Physician before discontinuing a patient due to poor compliance.
9.4.10 Treatment After Discontinuation
Patients whose MDD symptoms worsen or are determined by the Investigator to be 
inadequately controlled before completing the double-blind treatment period are allowed to discontinue investigational product and start appropriate treatment at the Investigator’s discretion. This new treatment will not be provided by AGN. Patients who initiate a new treatment for MDD must be discontinued from the study.

20209.5 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES
9.5.1 Efficacy Assessments
The efficacy assessments will include the CDRS-R, CGI-S, and Clinician Global 
Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I). Efficacy assessments are not to be administered if the patient is not accompanied by his/her consented caregiver. The K-SADS-PL and all efficacy assessments will be conducted by experienced clinicians meeting training requirements and qualifications standards established by AGN and rater training vendor.
9.5.1.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
The CDRS-R ( Appendix V ; Poznanski and Mokros 1996) is a semi-structured, 
clinician-rated instrument designed for use with children and adolescents between the ages of 6-17 years and contains 17 ordinally-scaled items that evaluate the presence and severity of symptoms commonly associated  with childhood depression. The CDRS-R 
total score ranges from 17 to 113. 
The CDRS-R will be administered separately to the patient and to the caregiver. For each 
item, the clinician administering the interviews will select the rating that provides the best description of the patient and will then determine the total score.
9.5.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessment
The CGI-S ( Appendix VI ; Guy 1976 ) is a clinician-rated scale used to rate the severity of 
the patient’s current state of mental illness compared with an MDD patient population. The patient will be rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating a “normal, not at all ill” and 7 indicating “among the most extremely ill patients.” 
9.5.1.3 Additional Efficacy Assessment
The CGI-I is a clinician-rated instrument ( Appendix VII ). Based on the Investigator’s 
clinical opinion, the total improvement or worsening of the patient’s mental illness is rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being very much improved and 7 being very much worse, relative to Visit 2 (Baseline), regardless of whether the Investigator considers the worsening to be related to investigational product.
9.5.2 Safety Assessments
Patients must be evaluated by a physician or an appropriately trained health care 
professional at every visit and the evaluation must be documented. The procedures 
discussed below will be completed at the designated visits. Scheduled safety assessments 
are not to be administered if the patient is not accompanied by his/her consented caregiver.

Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 41
20209.5.2.1 Adverse Events
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH-E2A).
For the purpose of data collection for this study, any untoward event that was reported 
from the time the patient signed the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of treatment is to be considered an AE.
Examples of AEs are as follows:
!Changes in the general condition of the patient
!Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the patient
!Objective signs observed by the Investigator or other study center personnel
!All diseases that occur after signing ICF, including any change in severity or 
frequency of preexisting disease
!Laboratory values that are deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator
!Physical exam findings, including vital sign measurements, that are deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator
Please note that medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the study should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a pre-existing condition.
9.5.2.2 Causality Assessment
For each AE, the Investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to the investigational product. The causality assessment must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed by answering the following question:
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 42
2020Is there a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the event?
Yes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and AE, ie:
oThere is a reasonable temporal relationship between the investigational product 
and the event, and/or 
oThe event is unlikely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other investigational products, or other factors, and/or
oPositive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist
No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
investigational product and AE, ie:
oThere is no reasonable temporal relationship between the investigational product and the event, or
oThe patient did not take the investigational product, or
oThe event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other investigational products, or other factors, or
oThe event is commonly occurring in the (study) population independent of investigational product exposure
9.5.2.3 Severity Assessment
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by recording a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Severity,
which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE-required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality (Section 9.5.2.4). Severity will be assessed 
according to the following scale:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 43
2020Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention
9.5.2.4 Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
!Results in death
!Is life threatening
!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospitalization, or the development of investigational product dependency or drug abuse.
Emergency room visits that do not result in hospitalization should be evaluated for one of 
the other serious outcomes to determine whether they qualify as SAEs.
Preplanned hospitalizations (eg, elective procedures for preexisting conditions that did 
not worsen, such as cosmetic surgery and hysterectomy) are excluded from SAE reporting.
9.5.2.5 Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patients are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs that have occurred since the previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question such as, “How do you feel since your last visit?” Study center personnel will record all pertinent information in the patient’s eCRF. 
In addition, any SAEs reported by the patient (or patient representative) or otherwise 
identified by the Investigator after the study period (ie, after 30 days post last dose) should be documented and reported.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 44
2020All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF 
whether or not they are considered causally related to the investigational product.
For every AE, the Investigator must:
!Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (ie, is it an SAE?), as well as 
the severity and causal relationship
!Document all actions taken with regard to the investigational product
!Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE
!Document the outcome of the AE
In addition, patients and caregivers are to be reminded, as described in the ICF and in accordance with Section 9.5.2.1, to notify site personnel of any AEs occurring during the 
30-day poststudy period. Any AEs reported by the patient (or patient representative) during this period are to be recorded in original source documents. AEs are also to be recorded in the eCRF if at least one of the following conditions is met: 1) the event meetsthe criteria for an SAE (see Sections 9.5.2.4 and 9.5.2.6 ), and/or 2) the event is judged by 
the Investigator to be potentially causally related to investigational product.
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol-defined study visit will be 
followed until the condition returns to prestudy status, has resolved or stabilized, or can be explained as being unrelated to the investigational product. If a follow-up visit is deemed necessary for appropriate safety surveillance, it will take place within 30 days of the final protocol-defined study visit.
9.5.2.6 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Events of 
Special Interest
AGN is required to inform worldwide regulatory authorities of SAEs that meet specific criteria. Therefore, AGN must be notified immediately regarding any SAE that occurs after informed consent is obtained.
Within 24 hours of learning of any AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE, the 
study center personnel must report the event to Global Drug Safety on the SAE Form for Clinical Trials. The Study Physician may also be notified by telephone.
If, during follow-up, any nonserious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an 
SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE. 
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 45
2020The study center must transmit the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to the SAE fax number 
shown below. Even if an initial report is made by telephone, the SAE Form for Clinical Trials completed with all available details must still be faxed within 24 hours of knowledge of the event at the study center.
Supplemental information should be submitted as soon as available and may include 
laboratory results, radiology reports, progress notes, hospital admission and emergency room notes, holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates.
The Investigator is expected to take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of 
the SAE. Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the patient’s eCRF. All SAEs are to be followed by the study staff until resolution or until the SAE is deemed stable. AGN may contact the 
study center to solicit additional information or follow up on the event.
Fax the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to AGN:
SAE fax number: 
Primary: 1-714-796-9504
Back-up: 1-714-246-5295
9.5.2.7 Reporting of Pregnancies Occurring During the Study
Study center personnel must report every pregnancy from the time the patient signs the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of investigational product. Within 24 hours of learning of a pregnancy, the study center personnel must report the event to Global Drug Safety on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and fax it to the SAE/Pregnancy fax number stated in Section 9.5.2.6, even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of 
male patients occurring during the time frame described above must also be reported. 
The pregnancy must be followed to term and the outcome reported by completing a 
follow-up Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is hospitalized for hemorrhage), a separate SAE Form for Clinical Trials must be filed as described in Section 9.5.2.6 with the appropriate serious criterion 
(eg, hospitalization) indicated in addition to the Pregnancy Form.

20209.5.2.8 Potential Hy’s Law Cases
Potential Hy’s law criteria are:
!ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN AND 
!Total bilirubin ≥  2 × ULN AND 
!Alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN
Study center personnel must report every patient who meets these potential criteria. 
Typically, all 3 analytes will be obtained from the same sample, but they may come from multiple samples taken within a 24-hour period. This requirement applies from the time he or she signs the ICF for the study until 30 days after the final protocol-defined study visit or the last known dose of investigational product (if the final visit does not occur). 
A laboratory alert for potential Hy’s laws cases will be in place and the laboratory must 
notify Investigators and AGN immediately when the above criteria have been met. A potential Hy’s law case must be faxed to AGN on an AE of Special Interest Form as soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the potential Hy’s law case) to the SAE/Pregnancy fax number stated in Section 9.5.2.6 , even if no AE has occurred. The 
eCRF for potential Hy’s law cases must be completed within 7 calendar days. Every effort to determine the cause of the liver enzyme abnormalities must be made, and close monitoring should be initiated in conjunction with the Study Physician and in accordance with the FDA “Guidance for Industry: Drug Induced Liver Injury- Pre-Marketing Clinical Evaluation” July 2009.
9.5.2.9 Clinical Laboratory Determinations
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected as detailed in the Schedule of Evaluations (Section 2.0). During Screening, the Investigator will assess the 
clinical significance of any values that are outside the reference ranges provided by the central laboratory; patients with abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be excluded from the study.
Patients will be instructed to fast overnight (for at least 8 hours) before coming in for 
their appointments when clinical laboratory blood tests are to be drawn. If non-fasting, an attempt should be made to draw blood at least 4 hours after a meal.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )

2020A UDS will be conducted for all patients at Visit 1 (Screening). A negative UDS for 
prohibited substances (illegal drugs or prohibited concomitant medications [see Appendix III and Exclusion Criterion #18]) is required before Visit 2 (Baseline) for the 
patient to continue in the study. Amphetamines can be allowed if prescribed for treatment of attention deficit disorder at a dose that is stable for at least 60 days before Visit 1 (Screening). If not stable for at least 60 days before Visit 1 (Screening), the patient should be discontinued. However, the patient can be rescreened on a later date.
Patients who have a positive UDS at Visit 1 (Screening) for other prohibited substances 
(barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, phencyclidine, or other prohibited concomitant medications) may be allowed to enroll if (1) there is no suspicion of drug abuse per the Investigator judgment, (2) the use is discontinued and (3) this is documented by a negative UDS before Visit 2 (Baseline). If the repeat test cannot be performed within 21 days, the patient should be discontinued from the study. The patient can be rescreened on a later date and must have a negative UDS to be considered for inclusion in the study.
Alcohol consumption is prohibited during the study. A UDS or blood alcohol test may be 
performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. A patient with a positive blood alcohol test or a positive UDS for any prohibited substances at any postrandomization visit may be allowed to continue in the study if approved by the Investigator and by the Study Physician.
Females of childbearing potential will be required to have a serum β-hCG pregnancy test 
at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 8/ET. Positive pregnancy test results at Visit 1 will 
exclude female patients from participating in the st udy. At every study visit, Investigators 
should inquire about the use of acceptable methods of contraception in females of childbearing potential who are, or become, sexually active, and perform a urine pregnancy test if there is any question of non-compliance with contraception. If the urine pregnancy test is negative, a serum β -hCG pregnancy test must be performed to rule out 
pregnancy. Any positive pregnancy test results during the study will result in patient termination from the study.
The following clinical laboratory levels will be measured:Hematology: Absolute and differential white blood cell count, 
erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and red blood cell indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration)

Serum β -hCG: Female patients of childbearing potential only. Will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and for randomized patients at Visit 8/ET. Urine pregnancy tests may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator at any visit during the double-blind treatment period; if negative, perform a serum β-hCG test to rule out pregnancy.
Other laboratory assessments may be repeated at any visit if there was an abnormal finding at the most recent, previous evaluation or if additional information is clinically necessary to appropriately evaluate the patient’s current condition, follow up and/or manage an AE. Fasting for at least 8 hours is recommended before unscheduled visits to assess serum chemistry.
A central laboratory will be used to evaluate all urine and blood samples, which will be 
collected, processed, and stored according to the instructions provided by the laboratory.

20209.5.2.10 Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements, seated radial pulse rate, seated systolic and diastolic BP, and 
body weight, will be documented at every visit. Pulse and BP readings will be taken twice after the patient has been sitting for at least 5 minutes. The second measurement will be entered in the eCRF. A BP cuff of appropriate size for the patient should be used. The same arm and BP cuff should be used for all BP and radial pulse measurements throughout the study.
BP may be measured manually or by machine, but the same method of measurement 
should be used for a patient throughout the study. Radial pulse rate should be measured manually. All BP and radial pulse measurements will be recorded in the patient’s source documents. 
Patients should be instructed not to wear clothing with tight sleeves when they come to 
have their BP measured. Additionally, they should be kept as calm and undisturbed as possible while BP and pulse measurements are taken (ie, there should be no talking while the BP is being measured).
Height will be measured as accurately as possible using a stadiometer while the patient is 
standing with no shoes on and recorded at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 8/ET. Patients should wear their usual indoor clothing, but take off their jacket and shoes during weight measurements. For each patient, body weight and height should be determined using the same equipment during the study after confirming proper calibration.
9.5.2.11 Electrocardiograms
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 5 (Week 3), and at Visit 8 (Week 8/ET). The paper speed will be standard 25 mm/sec. ECGs will be electronically transmitted for analysis according to the instructions provided by the central ECG laboratory. Measurements (in msec) will be recorded for the following parameters in lead II or lead III: PR interval, QRS duration, and uncorrected QT interval. QTcF (Frederica corrected QT interval) and QTcB (Bazett corrected QT interval) will be calculated.
The overall interpretation and determination of the clinical relevance of ECG findings 
using the central laboratory ECG interpretation report will be the responsibility of the Investigator and will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF.

(Week 8/ET) by a professionally trained physician or health professional listed on Form FDA 1572 and licensed to perform physical examinations.
9.5.2.12.2
Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is an instrument that reports the 
severity of both suicidal ideation and behavior. Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5-item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent). The C-SSRS also captures information about the intensity of ideation, specifically the frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe types of ideation. Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5-item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior), 1 (preparatory acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual attempt). More than 1 classification can be selected provided they represent separate episodes. For actual attempts only, the actual or potential lethality is classified for the initial, most lethal, and most recent attempts. 
The paper version of the C-SSRS will be completed at all study visits. At Visit 1
(Screening), the C-SSRS will be completed for the patient’s lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior ( Appendix VIII ). At all other visits, the C-SSRS will be completed 
for ideation and behavior since the previous visit ( Appendix IX ). The C-SSRS will be 
evaluated and signed at each visit by a qualified staff member (ie, the Investigator or designee that has extensive professional training and experience in assessing mental illness), before the patient leaves the study center.
The patient should not be released from the study center until the results of the C-SSRS 
are reviewed and the patient is not considered to be at risk. If there is doubt about whether a patient is at risk, the Investigator must obtain appropriate psychiatric consultation. The results of the C-SSRS will be recorded in the eCRF.

20209.5.3 Investigational Product Concentration Measurements
PK blood samples will be collected from assented/consented patients aged 7-11 years to 
determine plasma concentrations of levomilnacipran. The blood sample will be 
processed, stored, and shipped as indicated in Appendix IV . The population PK of 
levomilnacipran will be characterized using serial and sparse plasma concentration-time data. The plasma concentration-time data collected will provide estimates of PK parameters, eg, area under the curve (AUC), half-life, maximum plasma drug concentration, and time of maximum plasma concentration.
Sparse PK blood samples will be collected during Visits 5, 6, and 7, as follows:
!Visit 5, at predose and at 1-4 hour postdose
!Visit 6, 4-6 hours postdose
!Visit 7, 6-8 hours postdose
In case of scheduling constraints and with prior notification of AGN, the sampling times 
above may be collected in a different sequence among specified visits.
From a subset of consented patients instead of sparse PK samples, 7 serial PK blood 
samples will be collected at Visit 5 (or at any 24-hour period between Visit 5 and Visit 7, inclusive) at the following time points: predose (20-24 hours after the most recent dose), and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10-12, and 24-hours postdose.
To allow for a predose sampling, patients may be instructed to hold their daily dose on 
the sampling day and take it when instructed at the study center.
PK samples will not be obtained from patients who missed investigational product dosing 
for 2 or more consecutive days before the sampling date.
The actual date and clock times of the reference dose (the last dose taken before the PK 
sample) and all blood draws will be recorded in the eCRF along with the date and time of the 2 doses before the reference dose for each patient who undergoes PK sampling.

9.6 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
9.6.1 Data Monitoring
Before any patient enters the study, a representative of AGN will meet with the 
Investigator and the study center staff to review the procedures to be followed during the study. Electronic data capture (EDC) functionality training is provided via computer-based training to train Investigators and authorized designees on recording the data in the eCRFs using the EDC system. After the first patient is enrolled, the AGNrepresentative, a Regional Site Manager (RSM) or designee, will periodically monitor the progress of the study by conducting on-site visits. This RSM or designee will review query statuses remotely, possibly warranting more frequent communication and/or site visits with the Investigator and the study center staff. The Investigator will make available to the RSM or designee source documents (written notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, and all other study-related documents. The Investigator and the study center staff will be responsible for data entry of patient data into the eCRFs via the EDC system, resolving data queries generated via the EDC system, and providing missing or corrected data. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for approving all changes performed on the data, and endorsing the patient data within the EDC system. This approval method will include applying an electronic signature linked to a uniquely assigned username and password that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature used in the past.

Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 59
20209.6.2 Data Recording and Documentation
Data collection will involve the use of the AGN EDC system, to which only authorized 
personnel will have access. Patient’s data are to be entered into the EDC system by the Investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account. After data entry into the EDC system by the Investigator or designee, a combination of manual and programmatic edit checks will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol. As a result of these edits checks, data monitoring, and reviews, queries may be electronically issued to the site and should be answered electronically via the EDC system.
Each query will carry identifying information (assigned username, date, and time) to 
assist AGN and the Investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and the response provided by the Investigator. All data changes made to the patient’s data via a data query will be approved by the Investigator before the final database lock.
After all data have been reviewed and all issues have been resolved, the database will be 
locked.
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Also, data will be stored and evaluated in such a way as to guarantee patient confidentiality in accordance with the legal stipulations applying to confidentiality of data. Study records (eg, copies of eCRFs, laboratory reports, patient diaries, regulatory documents) will be retained at the site, along with adequate source documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All study records must be available for inspection by AGN, its authorized representatives, and the FDA or other health authorities.
9.7 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
9.7.1 Patient Populations

9.7.1.1 Screened Population
The Screened Population will consist of all patients who underwent a Screening Visit and received a screening number, and for whom informed consent was obtained.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 60
20209.7.1.2 Randomized Population
The Randomized Population will consist of all patients in the Screened Population who 
were randomized to a treatment group in the study.
9.7.1.3 Safety Population
The Safety Population will consist of all patients in the Randomized Population who took at least 1 dose of double-blind investigational product.
9.7.1.4 Intent-to-Treat Population
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all patients in the Safety Population who had the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline assessment of the CDRS-R total score.
9.7.2 Patient Disposition
The number of patients in the Screened Population will be summarized overall by study 
center. The number of patients in the Randomized, Safety, and ITT Populations will be summarized by treatment group and study center. Patients who were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, had protocol deviations, missing safety assessments, AEs 
[as determined by investigator], or withdrew from the study due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, or whose anxiety appeared to be affected by the pandemic) will also be summarized.
Screen failures (ie, patients who were screened but not included in the Randomized 
Population) and the associated reasons for failure will be tabulated overall. Patients completing 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (Visits 2-8) will be considered completers. The number and percentage of patients who complete the double-blind treatment period and of patients who prematurely discontinue during the same period will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across treatment groups. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the double-blind treatment period as recorded on the dispositionpages of the eCRF will be summarized (number and percentage) by treatment group for the safety population. 
The number and percentage of patients with important protocol deviations will be 
summarized overall and by treatment group for the Safety Population. Deviations related to the following categories will be included:
!Inclusion or exclusion criteria
!Withdrawal criteria
!Treatment or dose
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 61
2020!Concomitant medications
These and any additional important protocol deviations will be reviewed and documented 
before database lock and unblinding of treatment codes.
Protocol deviations that occur due to COVID-19 will be summarized and listed 
separately.
9.7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic parameters (eg, age, race, ethnicity, sex, weight, height, body mass index) 
and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for the Safety and ITT populations. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables, and frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be presented for categorical variables.
Prior medication is defined as any recorded medication taken before the date of the 
first dose of double-blind investigational product. Concomitant medication is defined as any recorded medication taken on or after the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product. 
Both prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by the number and 
proportion of patients in each treatment group receiving each medication within each therapeutic class for the Safety Population. Multiple medication use by a patient will only be counted once. Any recorded medications started after last dose of double-blind investigational product will not be summarized but will be included in listings.
9.7.4 Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance
9.7.4.1 Extent of Exposure 
9.7.4.1.1 Investigational Product
Exposure to double-blind investigational product for the Safety Population during the 
double-blind treatment period will be summarized for treatment duration, calculated as the number of days from the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product taken to the date of the last dose taken, inclusive. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented by treatment group.
In addition, weekly and overall mean daily dose of investigational product will be 
summarized by treatment group for the Safety Population.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 62
20209.7.4.2 Measurement of Treatment Compliance 
Dosing compliance for a specified period will be defined as the total number of capsules 
actually taken by a patient during that period divided by the number of capsules prescribed to be taken for the same period multiplied by 100. This information will be obtained from the investigational product record of the patient’s eCRF. 
The total number of capsules actually taken during a specific time period is calculated 
based on the study medication record. The number of capsules prescribed to be taken for a specific treatment period will be calculated by multiplying the number of days in that period by the number of capsules to be taken per day.
Descriptive statistics for investigational product compliance will be presented by 
treatment group for each period between 2 consecutive visits, as well as for the entire double-blind treatment period.
9.7.5 Efficacy Analyses 
The efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT Population. Baseline for efficacy is 
defined as the last nonmissing efficacy assessment recorded at or prior to Visit 2. All statistical tests will be 2-sided hypothesis tests performed at the 5% level of significance. All confidence intervals will be 2-sided 95% confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise.
For efficacy analyses in which study center is a factor, a small center will be defined as a 
center with less than 2 patients in at least 1 treatment group in the ITT population. Small centers will be pooled to form pseudo centers so that each treatment group includes at least 2 ITT patients within the center. Pooling will be done using the following algorithm: 
Based on the number of ITT patients, small centers will be ordered from the largest to the 
smallest, and centers of the same size will be ordered from the largest center code to the smallest center code. The pooling process starts with the largest small center from the top, which will be pooled with the smallest from the bottom until a non-small center is formed. The process will be repeated using the small centers left out after the first pass. If any centers are left out at the end of the process, they will be pooled with the smallest pseudo center. If there is more than 1 smallest pseudo center, the pseudo center with the smallest center code will be selected. In case the pseudo center formed by pooling all small centers is still a small center, it will be pooled with the smallest non-small center. If there is more than 1 smallest non-small center, the one with the smallest center code will be selected.
By-visit analysis based on the mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
using the observed case approach will be performed for all continuous efficacyparameters.
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 63
2020In addition, by-visit analyses using the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) 
approach will be presented for all continuous efficacy parameters. For the LOCF approach, only the postbaseline total score of a parameter will be imputed using the LOCF approach; individual item scores will not be carried forward. Baseline total score will be carried forward only for the intermittent missing scores immediately after baseline. If all the postbaseline values are missing, the baseline value will not be carried forward.
9.7.5.1 Primary Efficacy Parameter
The primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to end of Week 8 in the CDRS-R total score. The primary analysis will be performed using an MMRM with treatment group, study center, visit, and treatment group–by-visit interaction as the fixedeffects and the baseline value and baseline value-by-visit interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within-patient scores. The Kenward-Roger approximation ( Kenward and Roger, 1997 ) will be used to 
estimate denominator degrees of freedom. This analysis will be performed based on all postbaseline scores using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values. In the MMRM analysis, if the model fails to converge based on the unstructured covariance matrix, then structures of Heterogenous Toeplitz, Toeplitz, and Compound symmetry will be applied, only if necessary, in the specified order until the model converges.
In addition, 2 sensitivity analyses, LOCF and pattern-mixture model, will be performed 
on the primary efficacy parameter. For the LOCF approach, the between-treatment group comparison will be performed by means of an analysis-of-covariance model with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and the baseline CDRS-R total score as the covariate. The LOCF approach will be used to impute missing postbaseline values, provided that at least 1 postbaseline assessment is available. Missing values between the baseline and the first nonmissing postbaseline will be imputed with the baseline value. Ifall the postbaseline values are missing, baseline value will not be carried forward. Only the total score of a parameter will be imputed using the LOCF approach; individual item scores will not be carried forward.
In the other sensitivity analysis, a pattern-mixture model based on non-future dependent 
missing value restrictions ( Kenward 2003) will be performed to assess the robustness of 
the primary MMRM results to the possible violation of the missing-at–random missingness assumption. The non-future dependent missing value restriction states that the probability of drop-out at a specific visit can only depend on the observed value and the possibly missing value up to that visit, but not future values beyond that visit. The details of this sensitivity analyses are as follows:
Approval Date: 05-Au g-2020 10:42:17 (GMT )
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 64
2020The pattern for the pattern-mixture model will be defined by the patient’s last visit with 
observed value. The observed CDRS-R total score at a visit is assumed to have a linear relationship with the patient’s prior measurements. The dataset with missing values will be imputed under the assumption that the distribution of a missing observation differs from the observed only by a shift parameter value Δ. The dataset with missing values will 
be analyzed using the same model as the primary analysis for between-treatment group comparisons at Week 8. The imputation of missing values and the analysis will be performed multiple times and the inference of this sensitivity analysis will be based on the combined estimates using the standard multiple imputation technique. The values for Δ will be selected as 0 to 6 based on experience with historical data. 
9.7.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Parameter
The secondary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline to the end of Week 8 in CGI-S score. This parameter will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy parameter.
A sensitivity analysis will also be performed using the LOCF approach as described in 
Section 9.7.5.1.
9.7.5.3 Additional Efficacy Parameters
The additional efficacy parameters will include the following at each postbaseline visit:
!CGI-I score
!Change from baseline in CGI-S score
!CDRS-R response ( ≥ 40% reduction in CDRS-R from baseline) rate
!CDRS-R remission (CDRS-R ≤ 28) rate
CGI-I score and the change in CGI-S will be analyzed using the MMRM and LOCF 
approaches similar to those used for the primary efficacy parameter. For CGI-I score, the baseline CGI-S score will be used as the baseline variable.
The CDRS-R response rate and CDRS-R remission rate will be analyzed using a 
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), based on logit link function, with random intercept and flexible terms of treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline score. If the GLMM does not converge, a logistic regression model with treatment group and the baseline score as explanatory variables will be used. For the logistic regression analysis, the postbaseline missing data will be imputed using the LOCF approach.

20209.7.6 Safety Analyses
The safety analysis will be performed for the double-blind treatment period and 
double-blind down-taper period separately using the Safety Population. The safety parameters will include AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, ECG parameters, C-SSRS, and growth evaluations. For each safety parameter, the last assessment made before the first dose of double-blind investigational product will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter. 
9.7.6.1 Adverse Events
An AE (classified by preferred term) that occurs during the double-blind treatment period or during the double-blind down-taper treatment period will be considered a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it was not present before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product or was present before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product and increased in severity during the double-blind treatment period or during the double-blind down-taper period, respectively. If more than 1 AE is reported before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product and coded to the same preferred term, the AE with the greatest severity will be used as the benchmark for comparison with the AEs occurring during the double-blind treatment period or during the double-blind down-taper period that were also coded to that preferred term. An AE that occurs more than 30 days after the date of the last dose of double-blind investigational product will not be counted as a TEAE.
An AE occurring during the double-blind down-taper period will be considered a newly 
emergent AE if it was not present before the start of the double-blind down-taper period or was present before the start of the double-blind down-taper period but increased in severity during the double-blind down-taper period. The newly emergent AEs during the double-blind down-taper period will be summarized by body system, preferred term, and treatment group.
The number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be 
tabulated by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, preferred term, and severity; and by system organ class, preferred term, and causal relationship to the investigational product. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same patient, the patient will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related occurrence for the summarization by severity and by causalrelationship to the investigational product.
The distribution of TEAEs by severity and causal relationship to the investigational

9.7.6.5.1 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
For the C-SSRS, the number and percentage of patients with suicidal ideation or suicidal 
behavior as recorded on the C-SSRS scale will be presented by treatment group. The distribution of responses for most severe suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior during the lifetime history, the double-blind treatment period and the down-taper period will also be presented by treatment group for the Safety Population. Supportive listings will be provided and will include the PID number, treatment group, visit number, lifetime history, and postbaseline values for each patient. Intensity of ideation, suicidal behavior type, and lethality of suicidal behavior will also be included in these listings.
9.7.6.5.2
Growth Evaluation
Weight and height will be presented as standardized z-scores adjusted for gender and age, 
using the lambda-mu-sigma method ( Cole TJ 1990). To assess the impact of treatment on 
growth, the change from baseline in the age and gender adjusted height will be analyzed using an analysis of variance model with treatment as factor. A non-parametric (Wilcoxon) test will also be performed.
9.7.6.6 Investigational Product Plasma Concentration Parameters
Plasma samples will be analyzed for the concentrations of levomilnacipran using validated bioanalytical methods. Population PK parameters will be estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methods. The study will be prospectively powered to target a 95% confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for levomilnacipran ER, with at least 80% power.
9.7.7 Health Economics and Outcomes Research Analyses
Not applicable.
9.7.8 Interim Analysis
The interim analysis was conducted to iden tify early signs of futility after 62% of 
randomized patients had either completed or discontinued the study. The futility 
assessment of the primary efficacy parameter (CDRS-R total score) on ITT population was based on the conditional power as described in Lan et al. 1999 . In calculating the 
conditional power, it was assumed that the future patients to be enrolled into the Studywill have similar efficacy as those of the existing patients of the same treatment group. The non-binding futility criteria was set when the conditional power for detecting a statistically significant treatment difference between the levomilnacipran treatment group 
Protocol LVM-MD-14
Allergan Sales, LLC Page 69
2020(40-80 mg/day) and placebo at the final analysis was 0.2 (20%) or lower given the 
interim analysis results. After the futility analysis results were reviewed by a data monitoring committee member, it was determined that this study will continue until the planned study end.
9.7.9 Determination of Sample Size
The effect size (treatment group difference relative to pooled SD) of 0.36 for both 
levomilnacipran and fluoxetine is based on a treatment difference of 4 units with a common pooled SD of 11.1 for the primary efficacy parameter, change from baseline to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score. A sample size of 480 patients (160 per treatment group) will be needed to provide 85% power for primary analysis (levomilnacipran vs placebo) based on an MMRM model using simulation method ( Lu 2012 ). The simulation assumed 
a correlation of 0.7 between the repeated measures and a dropout rate of 17% based on historical data in pediatric patients.
9.7.10 Computer Methods
Statistical analyses will be performed using version 9. 3 (or newer) of SAS on a 
LINUX operating system.

mg administered three times daily), 30 mg cyclobenz aprine (i.e., 10 mg administered three 
times daily), and placebo. Subjects will receive 3 days of each treatment.   
Subject participation will be approximately 3 weeks  as outpatients with 3 days each week as 
overnight clinic participants.   
Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to T reatment Period 1 (Visit 2) for eligibility for 
participation in the study. The Familiarization and  Practice drives on the driving simulator 
must be completed no more than 21 days prior to Tre atment Period 1.  
Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria w ill then be admitted to the clinic on Day -1 
to be evaluated for continued eligibility. Subjects  will perform a practice trial with the driving 
simulator and the cognitive function test.  
Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1. App roximately one hour after the second 
dose on Day 1, subjects will be administered the co gnitive test, followed by the driving 
simulator examination.  
On the morning of Day 2, prior to dosing, subjects will be readministered the cognitive test 
and driving examination to assess residual next day  effects.  
Subjects will repeat cognitive testing and the driv ing examination on the morning of Day 3, 
after administration of the AM study medication, to  evaluate the cumulative effects of 3 days 
of dosing.  
Subjects will be discharged on Day 3 with instructi ons to return to the clinic on Day 7 and Day 
14 to repeat the above procedure with the second an d third treatments.  
A follow-up phone call will be conducted 1 week (±3  days) following discharge from the 
clinic on Day 17 to assess for continued safety.

Vital Signs: 
Vital signs, including supine and standing blood pr essure and heart rate, temperature and 
respiration rate will be collected at the following  visits/time points: 
• Screening,  
• Day -1, 7, and 14 upon clinic check-in, 
• Day 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17 prior to and 4 hours post AM dosing. 
• Weight and height will be measured at Screening onl y. 
Electrocardiogram 
Twelve-lead ECG recording will be collected at Scre ening and EOS (Day 17). 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Blood Sampling: 
Blood samples for the determination of plasma tolpe risone concentrations will be drawn prior 
to each AM dosing on Days 1-3 and post-driving test  (15-30 minutes after the drive) on Days 
1 and 3.  
Statistical Plan and Methods:  
Doses of tolperisone will be considered non-inferio r (NI) to placebo if the upper 95% 
confidence limit on the difference in SDLP between that dose and placebo is less than 4.4 cm 
(the NI margin). Cyclobenzaprine comparisons to pla cebo are to assess assay sensitivity and 
no adjustment to alpha levels will be made for eith er the comparison of cyclobenzaprine to 
placebo or tolperisone, or for secondary endpoints or analyses. Formal statistical tests (where 
performed) will be two-sided and testing at the alp ha=0.05 level of significance.   
The sequence of testing to control for multiplicity  associated with comparisons of tolperisone 
to placebo (to assess NI) on multiple days is  Day 1 (single-dose), followed by Day 3 (steady-
state), followed by Day 2 (residual effect). Tolper isone will be considered NI to placebo if 
prior comparisons (at time points in the sequence p rovided, above) also indicate non-
inferiorty.    
In general, categorical variables will be summarize d by the count (N) and percentage of 
subjects (%). Continuous variables will be summariz ed by the number of non-missing 
observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), me dian, minimum, and maximum values. 
All study data will be displayed in the data listin gs. 
Safety: 
Safety measures will be summarized using descriptiv e statistics and listed for each subject.

Safety analysis will be based on all subjects enrol led who receive at least 1 dose of the study 
medication. The safety analysis will evaluate adver se events and additional safety parameters.  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE will be summarized by 
body system, preferred term, and treatment. If appr opriate, AEs will also be summarized by 
intensity and relationship to study drug. SAEs, if any, will be tabulated. 
Additional safety parameters will be assessed from summaries of physical examinations, 
12-lead ECGs and vital signs. The 12-lead ECG resul ts will be categorized as normal, 
clinically significant abnormal, and not clinically  significant abnormal. Hematology, chemistry 
and urinalysis laboratory test results will be cate gorized relative to the normal ranges. The 
changes from baseline for each of these parameters from Screening to EOS will be presented.  
Complete listings and summary tables for all safety  information including AEs, laboratory 
safety data, ECG, vital signs and physical examinat ion will be included in the study report. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The correlations between plasma drug concentrations  and key secondary end points will be 
evaluated. 
The decision as to which plasma samples collected w ill be assayed for evaluation of 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics will be determine d by Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
The relationship between plasma drug levels and dri ving performance will be evaluated, data 
permitting. If indicated, these samples may also be  assayed and/or pooled for assay in an 
exploratory manner for metabolites and/or additiona l pharmacodynamic markers.  
Pharmacodynamics: 
The primary endpoint, SDLP, will be analyzed using a normal theory mixed effects model 
with fixed effects for sequence, period, and treatm ent, and a random effect for subject within 
sequence. An unstructured covariance structure and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom will 
be used.   
Pair-wise comparisons (hypothesis tests) of differe nces in least squares means, and 95% 
confidence intervals on differences will be provide d for: 
     Initial dose effect

In addition, pair-wise within-subject differences i n SDLP greater than 4.4 cm in absolute value 
(equal to the previously found difference between p lacebo and 0.05% Blood Alcohol Content 
(BAC) for the CRCDS) will be compared using McNemar ’s test. These pair-wise, within 
subject differences in SDLP will also be tested for  symmetry about zero [ 6] using the 
maximally selected McNemar test. 
Summary statistics will be provided (mean, SD, medi an, minimum, maximum) for SDLP for 
each time point and treatment group. 
Additional details of analysis for secondary endpoi nts of VAS, SDC, KSS, and driving 
performance endpoints will be specificed in the Sta tistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The relationship between tolperisone plasma drug le vels and driving performance (i.e., the 
primary endpoint of SDLP) will be assessed by corre lational analyses.   
All pharmacodynamic results will be summarized in t abular format, with summary statistics 
(number [n], mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum ) and change from baseline, as

Page 21 of 69 6 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 
6.1  Introduction 
Tolperisone hydrochloride (HCl), a centrally acting  muscle relaxant, is widely used in Europe, 
Asia, and South America for the treatment of abnorm ally increased muscle tone. NR100, an oral 
formulation of tolperisone HCl as film-coated table ts, is being developed by Neurana 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as a novel muscle relaxant fo r the treatment of acute and painful symptoms 
associated with muscle spasms resulting from occupa tional and sports-related injury or 
myofascial pain. Future development of NR100 will b e for the separate indication of treatment of 
spasticity associated with neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord 
injury.  
 
While the mode of action of tolperisone HCl is not fully characterized, the most prominent effect 
of tolperisone HCl is its inhibitory action on path ways of spinal reflexes. It suppresses the mono 
and polysynaptic reflex transmission by both pre-sy naptic and post-synaptic mechanisms. 
Tolperisone HCl has sodium (Na +) and, to a lesser extent, calcium (Ca2 +) channel blocking 
activity. It inhibits, in a relatively selective ma nner, voltage-gated Na + channels. However, even 
with high tolperisone HCl concentrations, channel b lockade remains incomplete and reversible. 
Tolperisone has been shown to have unique analgesic  effects and a lack of sedation effects. 
 
The centrally acting muscle relaxants reduce the in creased muscle tonus and are typically 
sedative when used. The avoidance of drug-induced c entral depression, e.g., dizziness, 
drowsiness and excessive loss of muscle strength, i s important in the medical care of patients. 
 
The Study 115 will explore the sedative effects of tolperisone HCl after single and multiple 
doses of NR100 compared to placebo, and to a widely  prescribed agent for muscle relaxation 
used as  a positive control, cyclobenzaprine.

Full details of cyclobenzaprine pre-clinical and cl inical safety and tolerability data are contained 
in the Package Insert.    
6.3  Rationale  
6.3.1  Study Design 
This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, mult iple-dose 3-way cross-over study of the 
safety and cognitive effects of multiple doses of t olperisone administered TID in 30 male and 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 22 of 69 female healthy volunteers. Treatment groups include  450 mg tolperisone (i.e., 150 mg 
administered three times daily), 30 mg cyclobenzapr ine (i.e., 10 mg administered three times 
daily), and placebo.  
Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria a t Screening will be admitted to the clinic on 
Day -1 to be evaluated for continued eligibility. S ubjects will perform a practice trial with the 
driving simulator and the cognitive function test.  
Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1. App roximately one hour after the second dose 
on Day 1, subjects will be administered the cogniti ve test, followed by the driving simulator 
examination.  
On the morning of Day 2, prior to dosing, subjects will be readministered the cognitive test and 
driving examination to assess residual next day eff ects.  
Subjects will repeat cognitive testing and the driv ing examination on the morning of Day 3, after 
administration of the AM study medication, to evalu ate the cumulative effects of 3 days of 
dosing.  
Subjects will be discharged on Day 3 with instructi ons to return to the clinic on Day 7 and 
Day 14 to repeat the above procedures with the seco nd and third treatments.  
A follow-up phone call will be conducted 1 week (±3  days) following discharge from the clinic 
on Day 17 to assess for continued safety. 
6.3.2  Tolperisone Dose Level 
For the tolperisone treatment arm, tolperisone will  be administered three times per day, with 
1 tablet administered at 8:00 AM (AM dose), 2:00 PM  (PM dose), and 10:00 PM (HS dose) daily 
for 2 days and 1 tablet at 8:00 AM on Day 3. Depend ing upon randomization sequence 
tolperisone dosing will take place at Visit 1, 2, o r 3. Each dose will be a 150 mg tablet of 
tolperisone, for a total daily dose of 450 mg on Da ys 1 and 2, and a total dose of 150 mg on 
Day 3.  
6.3.3  Positive Control Dose Level 
Cyclobenzaprine will serve as the positive control to demonstrate assay sensitivity. For the 
cyclobenzaprine treatment arm, cyclobenzaprine will  be administered three times per day, with 
1 tablet administered at 8:00 AM (AM dose), 2:00 PM  (PM dose), and 10:00 PM (HS dose) daily 
for 2 days and 1 tablet at 8:00 AM on Day 3. Depend ing upon randomization sequence, 
cyclobenzaprine dosing will take place at Visit 1, 2, or 3. Each dose will be a 10 mg tablet of 
cyclobenzaprine, for a total daily dose of 30 mg on  Days 1 and 2, and a total dose of 10 mg on 
Day 3.

Screening 
Screening (Visit 1) will include procedures as described in the Schedule of Activities and further 
in the protocol. Prior to randomization, subjects will be screened for simulator sickness and will 
receive standardized training on the driving simulator and CogScreen Symbol Digit Coding 
subtest. Screening procedures and screening assessments may be performed on different days but 
must be completed within 28 days before Period 1 (Visit 2). The Familiarization and Practice 
drives on the driving simulator must be completed no more than 21 days prior to Period 1. 
In addition, each potential study participant will have the following assessments done by the 
Investigator or designee within 28 days prior to study start: medical and social history and 
demographic data, including sex, age, race, ethnicity, body weight (kg), height (cm), 
BMI (kg/m
2
), and smoking habits. Each potential participant will receive a physical examination, 
vital signs (including supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate, respiration rate, and 
body temperature), ECG, ESS, and laboratory tests including hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis. Urine drug and alcohol breathalyzer tests will be conducted on all potential subjects. 
Serum pregnancy tests will be conducted on all females of childbearing potential. AEs will be 
assessed, and prior and concomitant medication use will be recorded. 
Only medically healthy subjects with clinically acceptable laboratory profiles and ECGs will be 
enrolled in the study. The informed consent documents will be discussed with each potential 
participant, and each individual will sign an informed consent document for the study prior to 
any study-specific procedures being performed. 
A positive test result for pregnancy, urine drug or alcohol breathalyzer will end the screening 
process.

STUDY PROCEDURES 
11.1
 
CVDA Driving Scenario on the CRCDS-MiniSim 
The
 p
resent study employs the CVDA driving scenario, a 62.1 mile (100 km), monotonous, 
two-lane highway driving task that includes a secondary visual vigilance task (DA). The 
monotonous Country Vigilance scenario has been demonstrated to be sensitive to detect the 
effects of fatigue or sleepiness on driving performance 
[1]
. This scenario has been useful in 
measu
ring the effects of sleep deprivation, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, chronic primary insomnia, 
and is sensitive to central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., alcohol and sedating 
antihistamines). Results obtained using this methodology are comparable to those obtained using 
over-the-road driving tests 
[2]
. 
Subje
cts will perform the driving simulator test at the times specified in 
Section 10
.  Data will be 
capt
u
red in electronic format. Details are provided in the Cognitive Research Corporation 
CRCDS Testing Operations Manual. 
11.2
 
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale 
The KSS 
[3]
 will be used to assess subjective level of sleepiness. Th
is is a subject self-report 
measure of situational sleepiness and provides an assessment of alertness/sleepiness at a 
particular point in time. The KSS has been found to correlate with electroencephalogram and 
behavioral variables 
[4]
.  Subjects indicate their level of alertness versus sle
epiness according to 
the following scale: 
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale 
 
1=extremely alert 
2 
3=alert 
4 
5=neither alert nor sleepy 
6 
7=sleepy - but no difficulty remaining awake

9=extremely sleepy – fighting sleep 
   
Su
bjects will self-report their KSS assessments at the times specified in 
Section 10.
  The 
sub
ject’s self-reported scores will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). 
11.3
 
Self-perceived Safety to Drive Question 
Prior to driving, the subject will be asked a simple question as to whether they feel safe to drive 
(“Right now do you feel safe to drive?”). The subject will answer “yes” or “no”. The answer will 
be recorded in the CRF. 
11.4
 
Digit Symbol Substitution Test (CogScreen Symbol Digit Coding; SDC) 
The CogScreen SDC subtest will be used in this study to measure attention, visual scanning, 
working memory, and speed of information processing. SDC is a computer analogue of the 
conventional symbol-substitution task found in the WAIS-R Digit Symbol subtest and the 
Symbol Digit Modalities Test 
[5]
.  
SD
C
 will be administered by trained study site personnel. Subjects will perform the test prior to 
the driving simulation test at the times specified in 
Section 10
. The subject will perform the test 
by i
nteracting with a touchscreen monitor. Data will be captured in electronic format. Details are 
provided in the CogScreen

Visual Analog Scales (VAS) to Assess Subject’s Motivation and Self-Appraisal 
After completing the driving simulation, subjects will assess their own performance and their 
level of motivation to perform at their best during the driving simulation. 
Subjects will respond to 2 questions: 
1.
 
How well you think you drove for the last 60 minutes? 
2.
 
How motivated did you feel to drive at your best during the last 60 minutes of driving? 
Subjects will record their response to each question by drawing a vertical line on a 100 mm 
horizontal, linear visual analog scale.  For the self-assessment of driving performance, one end of 
the line is marked “Not Satisfactory”  and the other end of the line is marked “Satisfactory”.  For 
the motivation item, one end of the line is marked “Not Motivated” and the other end is marked 
“Motivated”. Scores on the 100 mm linear scale will be measured to the nearest millimeter from 
the left. The subject’s scores will be recorded in the CRF.   
11.6
 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include the measurement of supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate, 
respiration rate, and body temperature. Weight and height will be measured at Screening only.

11.8  Blood Collection for Tolperisone Plasma Concentrati ons  
Blood samples for the determination of plasma tolpe risone concentrations will be drawn prior to 
each AM dosing on Days 1-3 and post-driving test (1 5-30 minutes after the drive) on Days 1 and 
3.  
Blood samples will be collected into heparinized po lypropylene tubes (~5.0 mL). The tubes 
should be mixed immediately after filling by gently  inverting the tubes at least 8 to 10 times.  
Thereafter, the tubes will be centrifuged as soon a s possible (within 30 minutes of collection) at a 
minimum of 1500 g for 15 minutes until cells and pl asma are well separated. The resulting 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 37 of 69 plasma samples will be transferred into two (duplic ate) 2 ml cryovial tubes and labeled 
appropriately. 
Plasma samples will be analyzed for tolperisone at Pharm-analyt Labor GmB, Ferdinand-Pichler-
Gasse 2, 2500 Baden, Austria, using a validated liq uid chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometric detection (LC/MS/MS) method (limit of  quantification (LOQ): 1 ng/mL). A 
detailed method description, including validation, calibration and quality assurance procedures 
will be included in the bioanalytical report which will be part of the Final Study Report. 
11.8.1  Sample Storage and Shipment 
The samples will be frozen as soon as possible (wit hin 4 hours) of collection and stored frozen at 
–20°C until time of shipment to Pharm-Analyt Labor,  GmB, Ferdinand-Pichler-Gasse 2, 2500 
Baden, Austria for analysis. All samples will be sh ipped frozen with sufficient dry ice to 
maintain frozen conditions for at least 72 hours at  times arranged between the study site and the 
analytical laboratory. Detailed shipping instructio ns will be provided separately. 
11.9  Blood Collection Volume for the Study 
For Periods 1-3, a total of approximately 25 mL (5 x 5 mL samples) will be collected from each 
subject for PK analysis. In addition, up to 48 mL o f blood will be collected for screening and 
EOS clinical laboratory evaluations.  
11.10  Medical and Social History 
A medical and social history will be performed at S creening. Each subject’s history of alcohol 
and drug use will be evaluated. Subject’s caffeine consumption and tobacco use will be 
evaluated to ensure that the protocol will be follo wed during the course of the study. Continued 
eligibility will be evaluated on Day -1 and adheren ce to protocol restrictions will be confirmed 
throughout the study.  
11.11  Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at Screeni ng and EOS.  
 
11.12  Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
The ESS will be used to exclude subjects who demons trate excessive sleepiness prior to 
randomization.   
The ESS is an 8-item self-administered questionnair e which measures general level of daytime 
sleepiness. Individual items on the scale refer to daytime events likely to lead to sleepiness. For 
each item, the subject rates how likely they are to  fall asleep. Subjects are asked to rate how 
likely they would be to doze off or fall asleep in each situation in contrast to feeling just tired 
based on their usual way of life in recent times. E ach item (or situation such as sitting and 
reading) is rated on a 4-point scale that ranges fr om “0 = Would never doze” to “3 = High chance 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 38 of 69 of dozing.” The total score on the ESS is the sum o f the responses to each of the 8 items. The 
range of possible scores for each responder is 0 to  24. A total score of <10 indicates that the 
individual is not likely suffering from excessive d aytime sleepiness. Individual items are not 
analyzed and have no independent, valid interpretat ions. 
Subjects will complete the ESS at Screening. 
11.13  Pregnancy Test 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screeni ng for all females of childbearing potential.  
A urine pregnancy test will also be collected at ea ch CRU check-in visit (Days -1, 7, and 14) for 
females of childbearing potential. A positive pregn ancy test at any time during the study will 
immediately terminate the subject from further part icipation in the study.  
11.14  Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing 
The Sponsor will supply Tolperisone 150 mg tablets and matching placebo in an unblinded 
fashion. The sites or CRO on behalf of the sites wi ll procure the cyclobenzaprine 10 mg tablets. 
To maintain the double-blind status of the study, t he following dispensing and dosing procedures 
will be followed. The site will identify a qualifie d unblinded dispenser and alternate(s) who will 
be responsible for dispensing and administering the  study treatment. Aside from dispensing and 
administering the study treatment, the qualified un blinded dispenser will not be otherwise 
involved in the study. Cognitive Research Corporati on will provide randomization codes directly 
to the individual identified by the study site. The  randomization codes will be kept in a secured 
area with access limited to only the assigned unbli nded dispenser.  
The qualified unblinded dispenser will prepare stud y treatment for each subject in a designated 
dispensing room. Prior to administering the first d ose, the qualified unblinded dispenser will 
assign the next available randomization number. For  each dose administered, the unblinded 
dispenser will dispense the appropriate tablet into  a dispensing cup and complete the study 
treatment dispensing record. The study treatment di spensing record will remain in a secure 
locked area with access limited to the qualified un blinded dispenser and the alternate(s). No 
other study personnel will be present in the design ated dispensing room at the time of study 
treatment dispensing.  
11.15  Study Drug Administration 
To maintain the study blind for tolperisone 150 mg,  cyclobenzaprine 10 mg, and placebo, 
subjects will be blindfolded during dosing in each Period. Subjects will be given one tablet at 
approximately 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 10:00 PM daily on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and at 
8:00 AM on Days 3, 10, and 17. Dosing will be obser ved by a study staff member (qualified 
unblinded dispenser); no other study personnel will  be present at the time of dosing. 
The qualified unblinded dispenser will place the ta blet into a dispensing cup. The blindfolded 
subject will transfer the study treatment directly from the cup into their mouth. All study 
medications will be administered orally with 4-6 ou nces of room temperature water. The subjects 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Page 41 of 69 12  EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1  Adverse Event (AE) Definitions 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence  in a subject administered a medicinal 
product and which does not necessarily have to have  a causal relationship with this treatment. 
AEs occurring after the initiation of the treatment  are referred to as treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs). An AE can therefore be any unfavora ble and unintended sign (for example, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered relate d to this medicinal product. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which th ere is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there  is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse re action implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
An AE may be: 
• A new illness, 
• Worsening of a concomitant illness, 
• An effect of the study medication including compara tor; it could be an abnormal 
laboratory value as well as a significant shift fro m baseline within normal range which 
the Principal Investigator or medical qualified des ignate considers to be clinically 
important. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs. They ar e therapeutic measures for conditions that 
required surgery. The condition for which the surge ry is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study 
protocol and the conditions(s) leading to these mea sures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment. I n the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any un toward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, 
• Is life-threatening, 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions), 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, 
• Is an important medical event (including developmen t of drug dependence or drug abuse) 
that may jeopardize the subject or may require inte rvention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above (according to medical judgmen t of the Principal Investigator). 
12.1.1  Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe  according to the following definitions: 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 42 of 69 Mild: Causing no limitation of usual activities; th e subject may experience slight 
discomfort. 
Moderate: Causing some limitation of usual activiti es; the subject may experience annoying 
discomfort. 
Severe: Causing inability to carry out usual activi ties; the subject may experience 
intolerable discomfort or pain. 
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate eva luation of the severity. 
12.1.2  Causality Assessment  
Investigators are required to assess the causal rel ationship (i.e., whether there is reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the event) u sing the following definitions: 
• Unrelated: another cause of the adverse event is mo re plausible; a temporal sequence 
cannot be established with the onset of the adverse  event and administration of the study 
agent; or a causal relationship is considered biolo gically implausible. 
 
• Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible t ime sequence between onset of the 
adverse event and administration of the study agent , but the adverse event could also be 
attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures. 
Possible related should be used when the study agen t is one or several biologically 
plausible adverse event causes. 
 
• Definitely Related: The adverse event is clearly re lated to use of the study agent. 
12.2  Routine Reporting  
For the purposes of this study, the period of obser vation of AEs extends from the signing of the 
consent at the screening visit until the follow-up call. During this period, all AEs spontaneously 
reported by the subject, observed by the clinical s taff, or elicited by general questioning will be 
recorded and reported in the CRF. 
Any AE which remains unresolved as of the last visi t will require an evaluation and follow-up 
until the AE has been resolved or a reasonable expl anation for its persistence found, or is deemed 
mild and safely resolving. 
In the case of AEs deemed related to the Investigat ional Product, every effort will be made to 
determine the final outcome. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure s ubjects experiencing AEs receive appropriate 
follow-up, treatment where required, and that every  action is well documented. 
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of the study period and before 
the departure from the clinical site. Open-ended qu estions will be asked. 
Classification will be performed by System Organ Cl ass (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (M edDRA), version 19.0 or higher. 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 43 of 69 In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events  (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of 
events) should be identified by their primary cause . For example, if severe vomiting is known to 
result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record o nly vomiting as SAE or AE in the CRF. However, 
medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an  initiating event that are separated in time 
should be recorded as independent events on the CRF . 
Pregnancy in a female subject on the study shall be  reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the 
knowledge of its occurrence by the Principal Invest igator or designee (for pregnancies occurring 
during the course of the study or immediately follo wing the end of the study). Because of the 
possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been e xposed to the study drug through the parent 
and for the subject’s safety, the pregnancy will be  followed up to determine its outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, det ails of birth, presence or absence of any birth 
defects, congenital anomalies, or maternal and/or n ewborn complications. 
The pregnancy will be recorded and reported by the Principal Investigator or designee to the 
sponsor. Pregnancy follow-up will also be properly recorded to ensure quality and completeness 
of the data belonging to the study drug and will in clude an assessment of the possible causal 
relation between the study drug and any pregnancy o utcome. Any SAE experienced during 
pregnancy will be reported on a SAE Report Form. 
12.3  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The sites will notify the sponsor of any SAE, witho ut regard to causality, within 24 hours after 
becoming aware of its occurrence.  
If, during follow-up, any non-serious AE worsens an d eventually meets the criteria for an SAE, 
that AE should be recorded as a new SAE. 
The initial SAE report must be as complete as possi ble, including details of the current illness 
and SAE, and an assessment of the causal relationsh ip between the event and the investigational 
product(s). Information not available at the time o f the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE,  
laboratory values received after the report, or hos pital discharge summary) must be documented. 
All follow-up information must be reported as soon as the relevant info is available. 
The notification should be directed to the followin g sponsor representatives: 
Gerald M. Penn, M.D. 
Medical Director, Mary Rutan Hospital Department of  Pathology 
205 Palmer Rd. 
Bellefontaine, OH 43311 
gerald.penn@maryrutan.org  
Office:  (937) 651-6632 
Mobile:  (614) 563-7543  
An SAE will be considered “unexpected” if the AE is  not listed in the investigator brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is 
not required or available, is not consistent with t he risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current ap plication. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned i n the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmac ological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the partic ular drug under investigation. 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 44 of 69 The sites will determine whether any serious unexpe cted related AE must be reported to the IRB. 
If so, the event will be reported via fax or email within 15 calendar days of the investigator or 
staff becoming aware of the event. 
The sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported in an expedited manner to the 
appropriate regulatory agencies. If so, the sponsor  will report the event to the appropriate 
regulatory agencies, and all participating investig ators. 
If reports of any new and unexpected AEs become ava ilable to the sponsor during the clinical 
portion of this study (related or not to the presen t study), the sponsor must advise the sites of 
those events.  
13  STATISTICAL METHODS 
13.1  Determination of Sample Size 
This study is designed to test non-inferiority of t olperisone doses relative to placebo, with a 
cyclobenzaprine test versus placebo to confirm the sensitivity of the simulator to detect treatment 
effects. The following assumptions were made in the  sample size computation: (a) within-subject 
standard deviation for SDLP is approximately 6 cm; (b) the true difference between tolperisone 
doses and placebo is 0; and, (c) the non-inferiorit y (NI) margin is proposed to be 4.4 cm, which 
is the effect seen with 0.05% of BAC with this driv ing simulator scenario. Under these 
assumptions, a sample of 30 subjects would provide in excess of 90% power to establish non-
inferiority of tolperisone compared to placebo on a ny given dosing day in terms of the primary 
end point, SDLP. This sample size is considered mor e than adequate to detect cyclobenzaprine 
differences from placebo, which are anticipated to exceed the NI margin. 
13.2  Analysis Populations 
• PK Population – All subjects with evaluable plasma concentration data will be included 
in the pharmacokinetic population.  
• Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population – The ITT Populati on includes all randomized subjects 
who receive at least 1 dose of study drug in a give n treatment period. This is the analysis 
population for efficacy analysis. Subjects will (in  general) be included in all analyses for 
which data are non-missing. 
• Safety Population – The Safety Population includes all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug. 
13.3  Statistical Analysis – General Considerations 
This section describes the general approaches plann ed to analyze the data from this study.  
Additional details of the planned analyses outlined  here, will be further described in the SAP.   
Doses of tolperisone will be considered non-inferio r to placebo if the upper 95% confidence limit 
on the difference in SDLP between that dose and pla cebo is less than 4.4 cm (the NI margin).  
Cyclobenzaprine comparisons to placebo are to asses s assay sensitivity and no adjustment to 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 45 of 69 alpha levels will be made for either the comparison  of cyclobenzaprine to placebo or tolperisone, 
or for secondary endpoints or analyses.  Formal sta tistical tests (where performed) will be two-
sided and testing at the alpha=0.05 level of signif icance.   
The sequence of testing to control for multiplicity  associated with comparisons of tolperisone to 
placebo (to assess NI) on multiple days is  Day 1 ( single-dose) , followed by Day 3 (steady-
state), followed by Day 2 (residual effect).  Tolpe risone will be considered NI to placebo if prior 
comparisons ( at time points in the sequence provid ed, above) also indicate non-inferiorty.    
In general, categorical variables will be summarize d by the count (N) and percentage of subjects 
(%). Continuous variables will be summarized by the  number of non-missing observations (N), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and  maximum values. 
All study data are to be displayed in the data list ings. 
13.4  Safety Analysis 
Safety measures will be summarized using descriptiv e statistics and listed for each subject. 
Safety analysis will be based on all subjects enrol led who receive at least 1 dose of the study 
medication. The safety analysis will evaluate adver se events and additional safety parameters.  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE will be summarized by 
body system, preferred term, and treatment. If appr opriate, AEs will also be summarized by 
intensity and relationship to study drug. SAEs, if any, will be tabulated. 
Additional safety parameters will be assessed from summaries of physical examinations, 12-lead 
ECGs and vital signs. The 12-lead ECG results will be categorized as normal, clinically 
significant abnormal, and not clinically significan t abnormal. Hematology, chemistry and 
urinalysis laboratory test results will be categori zed relative to the normal ranges. The changes 
from baseline for each of these parameters from Scr eening to EOS will be presented.  Complete 
listings and summary tables for all safety informat ion including AEs, laboratory safety data, 
ECG, vital signs and physical examination will be i ncluded in the study report. 
13.4.1  Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment, Med DRA terminology (latest version), 
severity and relation to study drug. The descriptiv e statistics presented for each system-organ 
class and preferred term will be the number of subj ects with event (N), the percent of subjects 
exposed with event (%), and the number of events (E ). All AEs will be listed by subject, 
including demographic information, dose, MedDRA lat est version, system organ class, and 
preferred term. 
13.4.2  Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical laboratory values will be summarized by de scriptive statistics by dose. Changes from 
baseline in clinical laboratory values will be summ arized by descriptive statistics. All clinical 
laboratory values outside normal range (including S creening/Visit 1 and EOS/Day 17 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 46 of 69 examination) will be listed by treatment and subjec t number, including demographic information 
and flagging of values. 
13.4.3  Vital Signs 
Vital signs (BP, HR and body temperature) will be s ummarized by dose using descriptive 
statistics. Changes from baseline in vital signs wi ll be summarized by descriptive statistics for 
each dose. 
13.4.4  Twelve-lead ECG 
All ECG endpoints will be listed by dose, subject a nd time of assessment and summarized by 
descriptive statistics. Changes from baseline in EC G parameters will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics by dose. 
13.4.5  Physical Examination 
Subjects with any changes in the physical examinati on evaluation from Screening/Visit 1 to 
EOS/Day 17 will be listed. A description of the stu dy population in terms of baseline measures 
and demographics will be presented. 
13.5  Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The correlations between plasma drug concentrations  and key secondary end points will be 
evaluated. Details of the PK and associated statist ical analyses will be included in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
13.6  Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
The primary endpoint, SDLP, will be analyzed using a normal theory mixed effects model with 
fixed effects for sequence, period, and treatment, and a random effect for subject within 
sequence. An unstructured covariance structure and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom will be 
used.   
Pair-wise comparisons (hypothesis tests) of differe nces in least squares means, and 95% 
confidence intervals on differences will be provide d for: 
     Initial dose effect 
1. cyclobenzaprine versus placebo following Day 1 P M dose 
2. tolperisone versus placebo following Day 1 PM do se 
3. tolperisone versus cyclobenzaprine following Day  1 PM dose

9. tolperisone versus cyclobenzaprine following Day 3 AM dose 
 
In addition, pair-wise within-subject differences in SDLP greater than 4.4 cm in absolute value 
(equal to the previously found difference between placebo and 0.05% Blood Alcohol Content 
(BAC) for the CRCDS) will be compared using McNemar’s test. These pair-wise, within subject 
differences in SDLP will also be tested for symmetry about zero 
[

 using the maximally 
s
elected McNemar test. 
Summary statistics will be provided (mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum) for SDLP for 
each time point and treatment group. 
Additional details of analysis for secondary endpoints of VAS, SDC, KSS, and driving 
performance endpoints will be specified in the SAP.  
The relationship between tolperisone plasma drug levels and driving performance (i.e., the 
primary endpoint of SDLP) will be assessed by correlational analyses.   
All pharmacodynamic results will be summarized in tabular format, with summary statistics 
(number [n], mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) and change from baseline, as 
appropriate by time point.

Y
ou have been asked to take part in a research study.  First, we want you to know that 
taking part in a research study is entirely voluntary. 
 
Second, you need to know that 
there
 
are important differences between being cared for in a research study and being 
cared for by your doctor outside of a research study.  Participating in a research study is 
not the same as getting regular medical care.  The purpose of regular medical care is to 
improve your health.  The purpose of a research study is to gather information.  Being in 
this study does not replace your regular medical care
.  
Therefore, 
it is 
important that you 
understand the difference between the regular care you get from your
 
doctor and what
 
is
 
involved in this research study.
 
 
This consent document gives you important information about the research study.    
Please read this information carefully before deciding to take part.  No one can make 
you take part and you can stop at
 
any time.  If you choose to take part in this research 
study, you will need to sign
 
and date
 
this consent document and you will receive a copy 
of this signed and dated document for your records.
 
 
This research study is being conducted for 
Neurana 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc
.  
Neurana 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
is sponsoring the study and
 
will be paying

The following sections describe the research study.
  
Before you decide to take 
part, please take as much time as you need to ask questions with 
the 
study team, 
with family and friends, or with your personal physician or other healthcare 
professional
s.
  
The study team will 
fully 
answer any questions you have before 
you make a decision.
   
 
1.
 
WHAT IS THE 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?
 
The purpose of this research study is to compare how certain drugs affect 
how 
you feel, 
how you perform on a simulated driving task, and your cognitive functioning after taking 
the drug. This research study will compare the effects of the following study drugs:  
tolperisone, cyclobenzaprine,
 
and placebo.
 
 
During the study, subjects will receive oral doses of 450 mg tolperisone (150 mg 
administered three times daily),
 
30 mg cyclobenzaprine (10 mg administered three times 
daily), and placebo. Subjects will receive each 
study treatment
 
for the 3 days, with only 1 
dose being administered on the 3
rd
 
day.
 
 
Tolperisone
 
is
 
marketed in multiple countries in Europe, 
and 
Asia, 
for
 
muscle spasticity 
(tightness or stiffness) and muscle spasms
.
 
It 
will be
 
studied in the United States to 
determine its safety and efficacy (how well it works).
 
 
Cyclobenzaprine
 
has been 
approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA 
as 
Flexiri
l
®
. 
 
It
 
is available by prescription 
to 
relax muscles
.
  
The 10
 
mg dose
 
three times 
per day
 
represents the highest dose typically administered
 
for 
adults with muscle 
spasms
. 
 
Researchers use a placebo 
(sugar pill) 
to see if the study drug works better or is safer 
than not taking any drug
. 
 
Because this is a research study, the study drugs will be given to you only during this 
study and not after the study is over.  
 
 
2.
 
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE STUDY?
 
There will be 
about 30
 
male and female participants between the ages of 21
-55 
years
 
enrolled in this study. 
 
The study is being 
conducted at 
1 or 
2 
different research 
sites in 
the USA
. 
 
About
 
15
-
30 people
 
will be enrolled at this site.
 
 
3.
 
HOW LONG WILL PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY LAST?
 
If you decide to participate, you will be in this study for
 
at lea
st 3
 
weeks but no longer 
than
 
7 weeks
. 
You 
will 
need to visit the 
research 
site 
5 times
 
during the study, including 
3 visits with 3 overnight stays
.

requirements to take part in 
this research
 
study.
  
 
 
During the screeni
ng visit, y
ou will be asked to 
have 
t
he following tests and activities or 
assessments
: 
 
 
 
♦
 
Provide a social and medical history;
 
♦
 
An electrocardiogram
 (
ECG
, a recording of the heart’s rhythm
) 
will be performed;
 
♦
 
You will 
also be
 
asked about any medications and treatments you are currently 
taking.  It is important to tell the 
study 
site staff if you are taking any “over the 
counter” medication
s
, herbal or natural remedies
 
or dietary supplements
; 
♦
 
Physical examination
 
and vital signs
 
(includes an examination of major body 
systems, height, weight, blood pressure
 
while lying down and standing,
 
pulse
 
[heartrate]
, 
oral temperature, 
and respiratory
 
[breathing]
 
rate
); 
♦
 Y
ou will provide a urine sample
 
and be 
given a breathalyzer test. The urine 
sample will be used for safety laboratory assessments (urinalysis)
 
and to detect 
drugs and alcohol that are not allowed in this study, including illegal drugs (such 
as: amphetamines, methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, 
cannabinoids, and opiates).  Your urine sample must test negative for all of these 
drugs
, 
and your breathalyzer must test negative 
for 
alcohol to participate
 
in the 
study;
 
♦
 
You will be required to complete 
a 
questionnaire regarding your sleep 
habits;
  
♦
 
Collection
 
of about 
2 
teaspoons of blood. This blood sample will be used to 
determine if you have HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus
) 
or hepatitis
 (
liver 
problem
)
, 
and will also measure blood counts (hematology)
 
and
 
organ function 
(blood chemistry)
.
  
For females
 
who 
could become pregnant
, 
the sample will also 
be used to 
help 
confirm 
if
 
you are pregnant
. 
If the HIV or hepatitis result is 
positive, the physician in charge of the study or designee will personally inform 
you and at that moment he or she will indicate the procedure to follow. Note that 
a positive result for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C must be reported to the public 
health department as required by law.  If you have any questions about what 
information is required to be reported, please ask the Study Doctor or study staff.
 
All blood collections for this study will be taken by individual needle sticks into 
one of the veins in your arm.

Taking a placebo may be similar to not taking any medication.  
 
 
Risks and possible discomforts 
you might experience
 
from the study procedures
 
include:
 
 
Other Risks
 
 
Since the use of the study drug is investigational when taken alone or in combination 
with other medications, there may be other risks that are unknown.  All drugs have a 
potential risk of an allergic reaction, which if not treated promptly, could become life 
threat
ening.  You should get medical help and contact the Study Doctor right away if 
you think you have any of the following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:  trouble 
breathing, or swelling of the face, mouth, lips, gums, tongue or neck.  Other allergic 
reactions may include rash, hives, or blisters.
 
 
If you experience the symptoms of an allergic reaction while outside the clinic, please 
go to the nearest hospital emergency department.  If you experience these symptoms 
while inside the clinic, please tell
 
the study staff.
 
 
It is important that you report all symptoms and side effects that you experience as soon 
as they occur, whether or not you think they are caused by the study drug.  The phone 
numbers for the study team are on the first page of this docu
ment
. 
 
Blood draws
: A blood draw may cause faintness, 
swelling
 
of the vein, pain, 
redness, 
bruising, or bleeding at the site of puncture.  There is also a slight chance of infection.
 
 
Simulator Sickness
: You may feel sick
 
after driving the simulator. This is a feeling similar 
to motion sickness.
 
 
HIV/Hepatitis Testing:  
Some of your blood will be tested for HIV, hepatitis B, and 
hepatitis C.  The study doctor may be required by law to report the result of these tests 
to the local health authority.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM INJURED AS A RESULT OF TAKING PART IN 
THIS 
RESEARCH STUDY?
 
If you become ill or are hurt while you are in the study, get the medical care that you 
need right away. You must notify the study doctor immediately of any injury. If you have
 
any questions concerning the availability of medical care or if you think you have 
experienced a research
-
related illness, injury or emergency, contact the study doctor 
using the contact information on the first page of this form. 
 
 
If you experience a research injury, the study doctor or study site will provide or arrange 
for medical treatment at no cost to you. Neurana

costs of this treatment.  A research injury is any physical injury or illness caused by your 
taking part in this study. If you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure that you 
would have received even if you were not in this study, that is not a research injury. To 
help avoid injury, it is very important to follow all study directions. The sponsor has no 
plans for other financial compensation.  
 
 
To pay these medical expenses, the sponsor will need to know some information about 
you like your name, date of birth, and social security number or Medicare Health 
Insurance Claim Number. This is because the sponsor has to check to see if you 
receive Medicare and if you do, report the payment it makes to Medicare.
 
 
You still have the right to make a claim through the legal system even if you sign this 
form, accept medical care, or accept payment for medical expenses.

part 
or continuing in this research study.  If you want to drop out, you should tell us.  We 
will make sure
 
you can end the study in the safe

IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY, HOW WILL MY PRIVACY BE 
PROTECTED?
 
A federal regulation
, 
known as the Privacy Rule
, 
gives you certain rights concerning the 
privacy of your health information.  The Privacy Rule was issued under a law called the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Researchers 
covered by this regulation are required to get your authorization (permission) to use and 
disclose
 
(share with others) any health information that could identify you. 
 
 
If you sign this informed consent form, you are giving permission for the use and 
disclosure of your health information for purposes of this research study.  You do not 
have to give this permission.  However, if you do not, you will not be able to take part in 
the study.
 
 
Who Will Use and Disclose My Health Information?
 
 
The study team may use your health information to conduct, review, and determine the 
results of the study.  The study team may also use your information to prepare reports 
or publications about the study.  However, your name will not appear in any report o
r 
publication. 
 
  
What Health Information will be Used and Disclosed?
 
 
During the study, the study team will use, collect, and record health information about 
you (your “records”).  Your records will include any information about you that the study 
team needs to do the study, including information from the procedures described above. 
Your records may include other health information about you and will include identifying 
information such as your name and address. The study team will record some of this 
info
rmation on “study forms” provided by the study sponsor.  Your name or address will 
not appear on the study forms.  Instead, you will be assigned a participant identification 
number.  
 
 
The study team will send the completed study forms to the study sponsor and may 
share this information with others, as described below.

Representatives from the groups identified below may also need to look at your records 
(which identify you) to make sure that the information on the study forms is correct or 
that the study was conducted properly.  Reviews like that will take place at the research 
site or where the records are stored and can take place after the study is over.
  
 
 
Who Will Receive My Health Information?
 
 
Your study information may be shared with the following people or groups:
 
 
•
 
The study sponsor (Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or its representatives, 
including companies it hires to provide study
-
related services 
 
•
 
Researchers who are conducting this study at other research sites 
 
•
 
The 
I
nstitutional 
R
eview 
B
oard (ethics committee) that approved this study and 
any other committees responsible for overseeing the research
 
•
 
Government health agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration) in the 
US or other countries
 
•
 
Your study doctor may inform your primary physician about your participation in 
the study if you have a primary physician and you agree to the primary physician 
being informed.  
 
  
Will My Information 
Be
 Pr
otected by the Privacy Rule After it is Disclosed to 
Others?
 
 
The study site
 
is required by the Privacy Rule to protect your health information.  After 
your information is shared with others, such as the study sponsor, it may no longer be 
protected by the Privacy Rule.  The people who receive this information could use it in 
ways 
not discussed in this form and could disclose it to others.  However, the study 
sponsor will use and disclose your information only for research or regulatory purposes 
or to prepare research publications.  In addition to using it for this study, the study 
sponsor may reanalyze the study data at a later date or combine your information with 
information from other studies for research purposes not directly related to this study.  
The goal of any such research would be to learn more about drugs or diseases or 
to 
help design better studies in the future.  When using your information in these ways, the 
study sponsor may share it with regulatory authorities, other researchers, its business 
partners, or companies it hires to provide research
-
related services.  This
 
could result in 
transfer of your information outside the 
United
 
States.  
However, your name will never 
appear in any study sponsor reports or publications, or in any future disclosures 
by the 
study
 
sponsor.
 
 
What Happens if I Leave the Study Early?
 
 
If you stop participating in the study early for any reason, the study team will tell the 
study sponsor why.  If the study team asks you to come to any more study visits and 
if 
you agree, the study team will send the study sponsor information from those vi
sits as 
well.  All information collected about you may continue to be used and disclosed.

This Authorization does not have an expiration date.  The study team may need to 
correct or provide missing information about you even after your study participation is 
over.  The review of your medical records (described above) may also take place after 
the study is over.
 
 
May I Take Back My Authorization?
 
 
You have the right to take back (revoke) your Authorization at any time by writing to 
the 
study doctor at the address listed on the first page of this form.
 
 
If you revoke your Authorization, the study team will not collect any new health 
information about you.  However, they can continue to use and disclose any already 
collect

study.  The study sponsor can also still keep and use any information that it has already 
received.  If you revoke your Authorization, you can no longer continue to participate in 
the study.
 
 
May I Look At My Study Information?
 
 
You have a right to see and make copies of your medical records.  However, to ensure 
the reliability of the study, you will need to wait to see your study records until the study 
is completed.

You have been asked to take part in a research study.  First, we want you to know that 
taking part in a research study is entirely voluntary.  Second, you need to know that 
there are important differences between being cared for in a research study and being 
cared for by your doctor outside of a research study.  Participating in a research study is 
not the same as getting regular medical care.  The purpose of regular medical care is to 
improve your health.  The purpose of a research study is to gather information.  Being in 
this study does not replace your regular medical care.  Therefore, it is important that you 
understand the difference between the regular care you get from your doctor and wha
t 
is involved in this research study.
 
 
This consent document gives you important information about the research study.    
Please read this information carefully before deciding to take part.  No one can make 
you take part and you can stop at any time.  If you choose to take part in this research 
study, you will need to sign
 
and date
 
this consent document and you will receive a copy 
of this signed and dated document for your records.
 
 
This research study is being conducted for Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Neurana 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is sponsoring the study and will be paying the study doctor and 
the study site to conduct the study.

The following sections describe the research study.  Before you decide to take 
part, please take as much time as you need t
o ask questions with the study team, 
with family and friends, or with your personal physician or other healthcare 
professionals.
  
The study team will fully answer any questions you have before 
you make a decision.
   
 
1.
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?
 
The purpose of this research study is to compare how certain drugs affect how you feel, 
how you perform on a simulated driving task, and your cognitive functioning after taking 
the drug. This research study will compare the effects of the following 
study d
rugs:  
tolperisone, cyclobenzaprine, and placebo.
 
 
During the study, subjects will receive oral doses of 450 mg tolperisone (150 mg 
administered three times daily), 30 mg cyclobenzaprine (10 mg administered three times 
daily), and placebo. Subjects will receive each 
study treatment
 
for the 3 days, with only 1 
dose being administered on the 3
rd
 
day.
 
 
Tolperisone
 
is
 
marketed in multiple countries in Europe, 
and 
Asia, 
for
 
muscle spasticity 
(tightness or stiffness) and muscle spasms.
 
It will be studied in the United States to 
determine its safety and efficacy (how well it works).
 
 
Cyclobenzaprine 
has been 
approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA 
as Flexiril
®
. 
 
It
 
is available by prescription to relax muscles.  The 10 mg dose three times 
per day represents the highest dose typically administered for adults with muscle 
spasms.
 
 
Researchers use a placebo (sugar pill) to see if the study drug works better or is safer 
than not taking any drug
. 
 
Because this is a research study, the study drugs will be given to you only during this 
study and not after the study is over.  
 
 
2.
 
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE STUDY?
 
There will be about 30 male and female participants between the ages of 21
-
55 year
s 
enrolled in this study.  The study is being conducted at 1 or 
2 
different research sites in 
the USA.  About 15
-
30 people will be enrolled at this site.
 
 
3.
 
HOW LONG WILL PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY LAST?
 
If you decide to participate, y
ou will be in this 
study for at least 3 weeks but no longer 
than 7 weeks
. 
You will need to visit the research site 5 times during the study, including 
3 visits with 3 overnight stays.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE RESEARCH STUDY?
 
Screening Visit
 
(Visit 1)
 
After signing and dating this consent document, you will begin in the study with a 
screening visit.  The purpose of the screening visit is to find out if you meet all of the 
requirements to take part in this research study.  
 
 
During the screening visit, you will be asked to have the following tests and activities or 
assessments: 
 
 
 
♦
 
Provide a social and medical history;
 
♦
 
An electrocardiogram
 (
ECG
, a recording of the heart’s rhythm
) 
will be performed;
 
♦
 
You will 
also be
 
asked about any medications and treatments you are currently 
taking.  It is important to tell the study site staff if you are taking any “over the 
counter” medications, herbal or natural remedies or dietary supplements;
 
♦
 
Physical examination
 
and vital signs
 
(includes an examination of major body 
systems, height, weight, blood pressure
 
while lying down and sta
nding,
 
pulse 
[heartrate], oral 
temperature, and respiratory [breathing] rate);
 
♦
 Y
ou will provide a urine sample
 
and be given a breathalyzer test. The urine 
sample will be used for safety laboratory assessments (urinalysis)
 
and to detect 
drugs and alcohol that are not allowed in this study, including illegal drugs (such 
as: amphetamines, methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, 
cannabinoids, and opiates).  Your urine sample must test negative for all of these 
drugs
, 
and your breathalyzer must
 
test negative for alcohol to participate
 
in the 
study;
 
♦
 
You will be required to complete a questionnaire regarding your sleep habits; 
 
♦
 
Collection
 
of about 2 teaspoons of blood. This blood sample will be used to 
determine if you have HIV (
Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus) or hepatitis (liver 
problem), and will also measure blood counts (hematology) and organ function 
(blood chemistry)
.
  
For females who could become pregnant, the sample will also 
be used to help confirm 
if
 
you are pregnant.
 
If the HIV
 
or hepatitis result is 
positive, the physician in charge of the study or designee will personally inform 
you and at that moment he or she will indicate the procedure to follow. Note that 
a positive result for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C must be reported to the public 
health department as required by law.  If you have any questions about what 
information is required to be reported, please ask the Study Doctor or study staff.
 
All blood collections for this study will be taken by individual needle sticks
 
into 
one of the veins in your arm.

Placebo Risk:
  
 
Taking a placebo may be similar to not taking any medication.  
 
 
Risks and possible discomforts you might experience from the study procedures 
include:
 
 
Other Risks
 
 
Since the use of the study drug is investigational when taken alone or in combination 
with other medications, there may be other risks that are unknown.  All drugs have a 
potential risk of an allergic reaction, which if not treated promptly, could become life 
threatening.  You should get medical help and contact the Study Doctor right away if 
you think you have any of the following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:  
trouble 
breathing, or swelling of the face, mouth, lips, gums, tongue or neck.  Other allergic 
reactions may include rash, hives, or blisters.
 
 
If you experience the symptoms of an allergic reaction while outside the clinic, please 
go to the nearest hospital emergency department.  If you experience these symptoms 
while inside the clinic, please tell the study staff.
 
 
It is important that you report all symptoms and side effects that you experience as soon 
as they occur, whether or not you think they are caused by the study drug.  The phone 
numbers for the study team are on the first page of this document
. 
 
Blood draws
: A blood draw may cause faintness, swelling of the vein, pain, redness, 
bruising, or bleeding at the site of puncture.  There is also a slight chance of infection.
 
 
Simulator Sickness
: You may feel sick after driving the simulator. This is a feeling similar 
to motion sickness.
 
 
HIV/Hepatitis Testing:  
Some of your blood will be tested for HIV, hepatitis B, and 
hepatitis C.  The study doctor may be required by law to report the result of these tests 
to the local health authority.
  
 
Pregnancy Related Risks / Use of Birth Control
 
 
Women who are pregnant or nursing a child may not participate in this study.  
To 
participate in the study, y
ou 
must confirm that, to the best of your knowledge, you are 
not now pregnant, and that you do not intend to become pregnant during the study or 
for at least one month after you complete the
 
study.  If there is any possibility that you 
may become pregnant during the study, you will not be able to participate in the study. If 
you suspect that you have become pregnant during the study, you must notify the study 
doctor immediately.  You will not be able to participate in the study if you become 
pregnant.

WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE OTHER THAN BEING IN THIS STUDY?
 
This research study is for research purposes only.  The only alternative is to not take 
part in this study.
 
 
11.
 
WHAT ARE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY?
 
This study is for research purposes only.  There is no direct benefit to you from your 
participation in the study.  Information learned from the study may help other people in 
the future.
 
 
12.
 
WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM INJURED AS A RESULT OF TAKING PART IN THIS 
RESEARCH STUDY?
 
If you become ill or are hurt while you are in the study, get the medical care that you 
need right away. You must notify the study doctor immediately of any injury. If you have
 
any questions concerning the availability of medical care or if you think you h
ave 
experienced a research
-
related illness, injury or emergency, contact the study doctor 
using the contact information on the first page of this form. 
 
 
If you experience a research injury, the study doctor or study site will provide or arrange 
for medical treatment at no cost to you. Neurana
 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will cover the 
costs of this treatment.  A research injury is any physical injury or illness caused by your 
taking part in this study. If you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure that 
you 
would have received even if you were not in this study, that is not a research injury. To 
help avoid injury, it is very important to follow all study directions. The sponsor has no 
plans for other financial compensation.  
 
 
To pay these medical expenses, the sponsor will need to know some information about 
you like your name, date of birth, and social security number or Medicare Health 
Insurance Claim Number. This is because the sponsor has to check to see if you 
receive Medicare and if you do, report the payment it makes to Medicare.
 
 
You still have the right to make a claim through the legal system even if you sign this 
form, accept medical care, or accept payment for medical expenses.
 
 
13.
 
IS BEING IN THE STUDY VOLUNTARY?
 
Yes.  Taking part in this research study is up to you.  You may choose not to take part, 
or you can change your mind and withdraw (drop out) later.  There will be no penalty, 
and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or have a right to receive.   
 
 
We will tell you if we learn new information that could change your mind about taking 
part or continuing in this research study.  If you want to drop out, you should tell us.

What Health Information will be Used and Disclosed?
 
 
During the study, the study team will use, collect, and record health 
information about you (your “records”).  Your records will include any 
information about you that the study team needs to do the study, including 
information from the procedures described above. Your records may 
include other health information about you and will include identifying 
information such as your name and address. The study team will record 
some of this information on “study forms” provided by the study sponsor.  
Your name or address will not appear on the study forms.  Instead, you will 
be assigned a participant identification number.  
 
 
The study team will send the completed study forms to the study sponsor 
and may share this information with others, as described below.   
 
 
Re
presentatives from the groups identified below may also need to look at 
your records (which identify you) to make sure that the information on the 
study forms is correct or that the study was conducted properly.  Reviews 
like that will take place at the research site or where the records are stored 
and can take place after the study is over.
  
 
 
Who Will Receive My Health Information?
 
 
Your study information may be shared with the following people or groups:
 
 
•
 
The study sponsor (Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
 
or its 
representatives, including companies it hires to provide study

services  
•
 
Researchers who are conducting this study at other research sites 
 
•
 
The Institutional Review Board (ethics committee) that approved this 
study and any other committees responsible for overseeing the 
research
 
•
 
Government health agencies (such as the Food and Drug 
Administration) in the US or other countries
 
•
 
Your study doctor may inform your primary physician about your 
participation in the study if you have a primary physician and you

Will My Information Be Protected by the Privacy Rule After it is 
Disclosed to Others?
 
 
The study site is required by the Privacy Rule to protect your health 
information.  After your information is shared with others, such as the study 
sponsor, it may no longer be protected by the Privacy Rule.  The people 
who receive this information could use it in ways not discussed in this form 
and could disclose it to others.  However, the study sponsor will use and 
disclose your information only for research or regulatory purposes or to 
prepare research publications.  In addition to using it for this stu
dy, the 
study sponsor may reanalyze the study data at a later date or combine your 
information with information from other studies for research purposes not 
directly related to this study.  The goal of any such research would be to 
learn more about drugs or diseases or to help design better studies in the 
future.  When using your information in these ways, the study sponsor may 
share it with regulatory authorities, other researchers, its business partners, 
or companies it hires to provide research
-
related services.  This could 
result in transfer of your information outside the United States.  
However, 
your name will never appear in any study sponsor reports or 
publications, or in any future disclosures by the study sponsor.
 
 
 
What Happens if I Leave the Stud
y Early?
 
 
If you stop participating in the study early for any reason, the study team 
will tell the study sponsor why.  If the study team asks you to come to any 
more study visits and if you agree, the study team will send the study 
sponsor information from those visits as well.  All information collected 
about you may continue to be used and disclosed.  
 
 
Will My Authorization Ever Expire?
 
 
This Authorization does not have an expiration date.  The study team may 
need to correct or provide missing information about you even after your 
study participation is over.  The review of your medical records (described 
above) may also take place after the study is over.

May I Take Back My Authorization?
 
 
You have the right to take back (revoke) your Authorization at 
any time by 
writing to the study doctor at the address listed on the first page of this 
form.
 
 
If you revoke your Authorization, the study team will not collect any new 
health information about you.  However, they can continue to use and 
disclose any already collected information if that is necessary for the 
reliability (the scientific value) of the study.  The study sponsor can also still 
keep and use any information that it has already received.  If you revoke 
your Authorization, you can no longer continue to participate in the study.
 
 
In California and any other state that requires an expiration date, the 
Authorization will expire 50 years after you sign this authorization document.

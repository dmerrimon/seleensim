CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 23 of 119Overall Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group, multicenter study 
including a maximum of approximately 90 randomized adult participants with biopsy-proven 
non-cirrhotic non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis (NAS ≥ 4, fibrosis stages F1, 
F2, F3). The study will be conducted at approximately 48 sites across approximately 9 countries. 
During screening, the participants will be checked for eligib ility and e nrolled in the study. 
Following an 8-week screening period, approximately 90 participants will be randomized at Visit 4 in a 1:1 ratio to once daily dos ing of 5 mg AZD4831 ( mitiperstat) or placebo. 
Participants, including participants who are re screened, can be randomized anytime within the 
screening period outlined in the SoA (Table 2)  once all inclusion/exclusio n criteria have been 
fulfilled. For participants who have a histor ical biopsy and elevated alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), the screening period can be shortened.
All participants will be treated once daily with 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) or placebo for 12 
weeks. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics will be evaluated at 12 weeks.
This is the first clinical study to test AZD4831 (mitiperstat) in participants with non-ci rrhotic 
NASH with fibrosis.
Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant 
and investigator blinded. 
Number of Participants:
Approximately 300 participants will be screened/enrolled to achieve approximately 
90 participants randomly assigned to study intervention or placebo. 
Note : “Enrolled” means a participant's, or their leg ally acceptable representative’s, agreement 
to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process. 
Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, 
but are not randomly assigned/assigned in the study, are considered “screen failures”, unless otherwise specified by the protocol. 
Intervention Groups and Duration:
Participants will be randomized to once da ily dosing of 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) or 
placebo. Dosing should be supervised and documented by study staff when study intervention 
is administered in the clinic. 
The study will comprise 3 periods totaling approximately 24 weeks:

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24 of 119!A total treatment period of 12 weeks

Data Review Committee: An unblinded safety data review committee consisting of 
AstraZeneca personnel and an external dermatologist will be set up for ongoing, periodic safety monitoring, with a focus on skin reactions and study stopping criteria.
Statistical Methods
The primary pharmacodynamic endpoint of this study is change from baseline to Week 12 in 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and it will be assessed through a treatment policy estimand.This approach will assess the effect of the treatment policy of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) and placebo regardless of discontinuation of study medication. The main analysis will be using a mixed effects linear model with participant as random effect, treatment, visit, and treatment-
by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate, including all participants in the full analysis set (FAS). Data will be log-transformed before analyses, and results will be back-
transformed to describe relative change ve rsus placebo in value at end of treatment relative to 
baseline.
The null hypothesis of no decrease in ALT comparing AZD4831 (mitiperstat) to placebo will 
be tested versus the alternative hypothesis of a decrease in ALT in favor of AZD4831 
(mitiperstat) to placebo using a one-sided test at 5% significance level. 
The secondary endpoint Pro-C3 will be analyzed in the same way as ALT.The study has been powered to have at least 80% power to detect a 25% decrease in ALT level 
at end of treatment relative to baseline for AZD4831 (mitiperstat) treated versus placebo 
treated in a one-sided test at 5% significance level, based on the FAS population. ALT 
measurements will be log-transformed before analysis. Under the assumption of a standard deviation of 0.50 for change from baseline in log-transformed ALT, and allowing for 10% missing data, 45 participants per arm would render the desired power.
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set, which includes all participants 
who receive at least 1 dose of ra ndomized AZD4831 (mitiperstat)  or placebo. Safety data will 
be presented using descriptive statistics unless otherwise specified and will not be formally tested.
No multiplicity adjustment for alpha is planned.
All personnel involved with the conduct of the study will remain blinded until database lock at 
12 weeks and protocol violations have been identified and documented. Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 30 of 1192 INTRODUCTION
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) is a highly potent MPOi that is being developed for the management 
of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. AZD4831 (mitiperstat) is hypothesized to delay disease progression and potentially reverse disease in NASH with fibrosis through direct disease-modifying effects.
2.1 Study Rationale
This Phase IIa study will evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics of 5 mg AZD 4831 
(mitiperstat) in adults with biopsy-proven non-ci rrhotic NASH with fibrosis stage F1, F2, or 
F3. 
MPOi AZD4831 (mitiperstat) is a low molecular weight, selective, and irreversible inhibitor 
of MPO that has been associated with improvement in liver inflammation and fibrosis in an animal model of NASH. 
2.2 Background
2.2.1 Disease Background
NASH is part of the spectrum of liver diseases known as NAFLD, ranging from simple steatosis or non-alcoho lic fatty liver to NASH. NAFLD is the most common cause of c hronic 
liver disease in Western industrialized countries, and it has an estimated prevalence of approximately 6% to 35% worldwide (Bellentani 2017, Younossi et al 2016) . NASH i s the 
progressive form of the disease with a prevalence of approximately 2% to 3% of the general population. NASH can lead to cirrhosis and its complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, and 
end stage liver disease ( Bellentani et al 2010) . NASH is expected to become the leading 
reason for liver transplantation over the next decade and is an important etiology driving the 
burden of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Cholankeril et al 2017, Wong et al 2014, Pais et al 2016) .
NASH is closely associated with metabolic risk factors including obesity, T2DM, and 
dyslipidemia. Epidemiological studies have de monstrated the prevalence of comorbid obesity 
and T2DM in approximately 80% and 45% of patients with NASH, respectively ( Younossi et 
al 2016) . Pathophysio logically, NASH is frequently associated with a hyperinsulinemic or 
insulin resistant state, leading to adipose tissue dysfunction and increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Therefore, it is believed that both increased adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de 
novo lipogenesis contribute to increased liver fat and formation of lipid metabolites causing 
lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are believed to contribute to the hallmarks of NASH including signs of cell death or hepatocyte ballooning, lobular or portal inflammation, and ultimately in some patients, liver fibrosis ( Marra et al 
2013, Neuschwander-Tetri 2017) .
NASH is defined histologically as a multicompone nt condition composed of hepatic steatosis, 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 31 of 119inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning in va rying proportions. NASH differs from steatosis 
alone by the presence of hepatic cell inflammation and injury in response to lipotoxic intermediates that are accumulated and metabolized in the steatotic liver. Approximately 25% to 35% of patients with NASH develop liver fibrosis ( Mishra and Younossi 2012) . Fibrosis 
stage (F1 to F4) has been shown to have significant prognostic value in NASH correlating 
with liver-related outcomes and mortality ( Angulo et al 2015, Dulai et al 2017) . Several  
factors have been shown to increase the risk of liver fibrosis progression to cirrhosis including presence of comorbid T2DM, increasing age, hypertension, and high BMI (Angulo 2007,  
Angulo et al 2015) .
There are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for NASH, with lifestyle 
modifications being the mainstay of treatment. Many patients do not achieve or maintain dietary go als and weight loss. Consequently, the development of new therapies for NASH 
would address a high unmet medical need, particularly given the expected increasing burden 
of this disease in parallel with the rising global prevalence of obesity and especially T2DM 
(Estes et al 2018) .
2.2.2 MPO and AZD4831 (mitiperstat) Background
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, and safety of 
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) is provided in the IB.
MPO is a highly abundant protein mainly pre sent in azurophilic granules of neutrophils, 
constituting 5% of the dry weight of the cells. In addition to neutrophils, there are also data 
suggesting the presence of MPO in monocytes and macrophages. MPO can be secreted and is 
unique in its ability to generate reactive chlorinating species such as hypochlorous acid, the active component of bleach, which possesses potent bactericidal and viricidal activities. In addition, hypochlorous acid reacts with electron-rich  moieties of a large range of biomolecules 
(Nicholls and Hazen 2005) .
MPO is deposited and active in the livers of patients with NASH ( Rensen et al 2009, Pulli et 
al 2015, Pulli et al 2017) . Neutrophils, the principal cell t ype expressing MPO, are elevated in 
patients with NASH and a high neutrophil to lym phocyte ratio is associated with advanced 
fibrosis (Alkhouri et al 2012) . MPO has been identified as part of a proapoptotic and 
profibrotic pathway of progression in NASH via activation of inflammatory myeloid cells, hepatocytes, and hepatic stellate cells, with nonclinical studies indicating that MPO knockout reduces NASH-induced fibrosis (Pulli et al 2015, Rensen et al 2012) . As such, MPO has been 
identified as a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate this disease.
In a diet-induced mouse model of NASH, the MPOi AZD4831 (mitiperstat) at a dose 
providing a p lasma exposure predicted to achieve approximately  
 (estimated based on PK-pharmacodynamics modeling using data 
CCI
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32 of 119from study ), demonstrated significant improvement in histological scoring of 
liver inflammation and fibrosis while not affecting steatosis (study  data on file: Study report to be finalized by pre-IND sub mission). It is hypothesized that AZD4831 
(mitiperstat) will similarly reduce inflammation and fibrosis in patients with NASH, thereby limiting progression of the disease and leading to NASH resolution and fibrosis reversal.
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) is a potent inhibito r of extracellular MPO in the micro- and macro-
vasculature but has minimal effect on intracellular MPO activity, thus is expected to have a low risk of decreasing host-defense against infections. 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and potential risks of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) may be found in the IB.

HFpEF, one participant (of 27) had generalized 
maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 3 at 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) occurring 5 days after up-titration from 2.5 to 5 mg. In a single-blind multiple-ascending dose study in healthy Japanese and Chinese participants, maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 1 was reported in one Japanese participant (of 6) on 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat), and maculopapular rash Grade 2 was reported in one Chinese participant (of 6) on 5 mg AZD4831 
(mitiperstat) and in in 3 Japanese participants (of 6) 
on 10 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat). See IB Section 6.3

The study design aims to minimize potential risks to participants based on the protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, safety monitoring, and other measures ( Table 3) . Taking into 
account the measures to minimize risk to participants  in this study, the potential and identified 
risks associated with AZD 4831 (mitiperstat) are ju stified by the anticipated benefits that may 
be afforded to participants with non-ci rrhotic NASH with stage F1-F3 fi brosis.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 39 of 1194 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group, multicenter study 
including a maximum of approximately 90 randomized adult participants with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic  NASH with fibrosis ( NAS ≥ 4, fibrosis stages F1, F2, F3). The study will be 
conducted at approximately 48 sites across approximately 9 countries. 
During screening, the participants will be checked for eligibility and enrolled in the study. 
Following an 8-week screening period, approximately 90 participants will be randomized at Visit 4 in a 1:1 ratio to once daily dos ing of 5 mg AZD4831 ( mitiperstat) or placebo. 
Participants, including participants who are re screened, can be rando mized any time within the 
screening period outlined in the SoA (Table 2)  once all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been 
fulfilled. For participants who have a historical biopsy and elevated ALT, the screening period

All participants will be treated once daily with 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) or placebo for 12 
weeks. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics will be evaluated at 12 weeks.
An unblinded safety DRC consisting of AstraZeneca personnel and an external dermatologist 
will be set up for ongoing, periodic safety monitoring, with a focus on skin reactions and study stopping criteria. Additional details will be contained in the safety DRC charter.
Participants will be in the study for up to 24 weeks, including a screening period of up to 
8 weeks, a 12-week treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up peri od. 
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This is the first study to test AZD4831 ( mitiperstat) in participants with non-ci rrhotic NASH 
with fibrosis.
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-c ontrolled, parallel -group, multicenter study. In 
order to focus on the patient population with the greatest need and potential effect on health 
(currently identified as the target populat ion within NASH with fibrosis who warrant 
pharmacologic intervention), this study will be conducted in participants with non-cirrhotic 
NASH with liver fibrosis. Participants with biopsy-proven non-ci rrhotic NASH with fibrosis 
(NAS ≥ 4 with a component score of ≥ 1 for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning, 
as well as liver fibrosis stage F1, F2, F3) will be enrolled. Participants with stage F4 fibrosis (cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) will not be included. 
The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamic effects of 1 dose level 
of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) versus placebo, administered once daily for a total of 12 weeks. The control group will receive matching placebo; there are no approved pharmacological

according to local guidelines on standard of care treatment, focusing on treatment of NASH symptoms and comorbidities.
The primary endpoint is change from baseline to Week 12 in log-transformed ALT, an 
indicator of hepatocellular injury. The secondary endpoints are Pro-C3 (measured to assess 
extracellular matrix formation) and PK. The study will  also assess the safety and tolerability 
of AZD4831 (mitiperstat), including hepatic safe ty, at 12 weeks compared with placebo, with 
special focus on the incidence of AESIs related to skin reactions (including maculopapular rash) and infection, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and ECG.

These indices leverage routinely measured parameters and will be assessed in the current trial.
4.3 Justification for Dose
To date, 4 Phase I clinical studies have been completed in which a total of 36 healthy 
volunteers have been exposed to AZD4831 (mitiperstat) at doses of 5 to 405 mg as single 
doses and 53 healthy volunteer s at doses 2.5 to 45 mg as multiple doses. In healthy volun teers, 
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) was generally well tolerated with the exception of generalized maculopapular rash seen around 7 to 10 days after the first dose: in the single ascending dose study (D6580C00001), 1 out of 6 receiving 45 mg, 1 out of 6 receiving 135 mg, and 2 out of 6 receiving 405 mg; in the MAD study (D6580C00004), 2 out of 8 receiving 15 mg and 2 out of 5 receiving 45 mg.
In a single-blind MAD study in Japanese and Chinese healthy volunteers 
(Study D6580C00008), maculopapular rash was report ed in 5 of 24 Japanese and Chinese 
healthy volunt eers who received AZD4831 (mitipers tat). Maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 1 
was reported in one of 6 Japanese healthy volunteers on 5 mg AZD 4831 (mitiper stat), and 
maculopapular rash Grade 2 was reported in 1 of 6 Chinese healthy volunteers on 5 mg AZD9831 and in 3 of 6 Japanese healthy vo lunteers on 10 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41 of 119(mitiperstat) in participants with HFpEF  was prematurely terminated during the COVID-19 
pandemic after meeting predefined target engagement, safety, and tolerability criteria (Study D6580C00003). One participant out of 27 receiving 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) was discontinued from study treatment due to CTCAE Grade 3 generalized maculopapular rash.
The dose selection for this study is based on data from the Phase I MAD study (healthy 
volunteers), the Phase II study (HFpEF), and data from the MAD study in Japanese and 
Chinese healthy volunteers. One dose level is being investigated (5 mg) based on expected pharmacodynamics and safety. The 5 mg dose is predicted to result in approximately 60% MPO inhibition and is the upper safety dose since no rash was observed at doses below 15 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) in the Phase I MAD study (healthy volunteers), in 1 of 27 participants at 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiper stat) in the Phase IIa study (HFpEF), and in 2 of 12 healthy 
volunteers on 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) in the Japanese and Chinese MAD study. Doses of 2.5 and 5 mg are currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase IIb/III study 
(D6580C00010) in heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction > 40%. 
4.4 End of Study Definition
For the purpose of Clinical Trial Transparency (C TT) the definition of the end of the study 
differs under FDA and EU regulatory requirements:
European Union requirements define study completi on as the last visit of the last subject for 
any protocol related activity.
Food and Drug Administration requirements defines two completion dates:Primary Completion Date – the date that the final participant is examined or receives an 
intervention for the purposes  of final co llection of d ata for the primary outcome measure, 
whether the clinical study concluded according to the pre-specified protocol or was 
terminated. In the case of clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all of the primary outcomes.
Study Completion Date – the date the final participant is examined or receives an intervention 
for purposes of final collection of data for th e primary and secondary outcome measures and 
AEs (for example, last participant’s last visit), whether the clinical study concludes according to the pre-specified protocol or is terminated.
A participant is considered to have completed the study if they have completed all phases of 
the study including the last visit.

5.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomi zed into the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any SAE.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened once at the investigator’s discretion. Participants that previously withdrew from the 
study are not permitted to be rescreened. Resc reened participants should be assigned the same 
participant number as for the initial screeni ng, and all enrollment assessments and procedures 
(including signing ICF) should be performed again, except the biopsy. Participants who are rescreened do not need to complete the full 8-week screening period, if all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been fulfilled. However, they must complete Visit 1 and Visit 3, following Table 2.  Individuals who do not meet a specific criteria may have this parameter retested if the 
investigator determines there is a reason to believe that this was caused by a 
temporary/transient reason. 
Rescreening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be assessed. 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION
Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s) (including marketed 
product(s) and placebo) intended to be administered to or medical device(s) utilized by a study participant according to the study protocol. Study intervention in this st udy refers to AZD4831

6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
1 The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.
2 Only participants enrolled in the study  may receive study intervention and only 
authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to 
the investigator and authorized site staff.
3 The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
4 Study medication will be dispensed to part icipants in a bottle with a white label. 
Participants will be instructed to take one tablet per day. Each bottle contains 35 tablets, 
and the participant will receive enough bottles to last until the next resupply visit. 
5 The AstraZeneca representative or delegate is responsible for confirming the investigator 
or delegate has recorded the quantities of r eturned and unused tablets at a participant level 
before the study intervention is destroyed.

are provided in the pharmacy manual.
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
All participants will be blinded with respect to active or placebo treatment. 
All participants will be centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an 
IRT/RTSM. This computerized randomization procedure will ascertain allocation concealment and will assign the participants 1:1 to AZD4831 (mitiperstat) (5 mg) or placebo. The 
randomization codes w ill be computer generated and loaded into the IRT/RTSM database. 
Before the study is initiated, th e log-in information and directions for the IRT/RTSM will be 
provided to each site. 
The study will be blinded to both participants  and investigators/site staff as well as to the 
sponsor (designated sponsor personnel will be unblinded as part of the DRC as described in Section  9.6). The IR T/RTSM will provide to the investig ator(s) the kit identification number 
to be allocated to the participant at the dispensation visit. Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in  Table 2.  Routines for this will be described in the IR T/RTSM 
user manual that will be provided to each center.
The randomization code s hould not be broken except in medical emergencies when the 
appropriate management of the participant requires knowledge of the treatment 
randomization. The investigator documents and re ports the action to AstraZeneca, without 
revealing the treatment given to the participant to the AstraZeneca staff. 
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Rando mization codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of 
data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have 
been made and documented.
The IRT/RTSM will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an 
emergency, in which the knowledge of the specif ic blinded study intervention will affect the 
immediate management of the participant’s condition (eg, antidote available), the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants’ intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The investigator documents and reports 
the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing th e treatment given to participant to the 
AstraZeneca staff.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50 of 119The randomization list s hould be sent to the personnel analyzing the PK samples. PK samples 
will be analyzed by the bioanalytical laboratory performing the bioanalyses only for participants on active treatment, as referenced in Section  8.5.2.1.  To allow for the appropriate 
selection of samples, the bioanalytical laboratory  will, therefore, have access to the treatment 
codes but will not share the codes with the sponsor or others involved in the study until the 
blinding is broken for the study.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Study intervention will be administered in clin ic on the day of randomization (Day 1, Visit 4), 
Day 29 (Visit 6), and Day 85 (Visit 8). Participan ts will self-administer study intervention at 
home on other days.
At Visit 8, a new bottle will not be dispensed at the site, and the participant will receive study 
intervention from the bottle they have brought from home. When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention di rectly from the investigator or designee, under 
medical supervision, after checking treatment was not taken at home before coming to the 
study site. The date, and time if applicable, of dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF. The dose of study intervention and study 
participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site 
staff other than the person administering the study intervention.
When participants self-administer study intervention at home, compliance with study 
intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance w ill be assessed by direct questioning 
and counting returned tablets during the site visits and documented in the source documents and eCRF. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosag e regimen should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Participants will be provided with a dosing car d to record the dose intake information (date 
and time) for each dose.
A record of the number of AZD4831 (mitiperstat)/p lacebo tablets dispensed to and taken by 
each participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and compliance records. Intervention start and stop dates, including dates for intervention delays will also be recorded in the eCRF.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over the counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or 
receives during the study must be evaluated by the investigator/sponsor and recorded along 
with:

7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
It may be necessary for a participant to perm anently discontinue (definitive discontinuation) 
study intervention. Participants who permanently discontinue study intervention prior to 
Week 12 will have an EDV as described in  Table 2.  If study intervention is permanently 
discontinued, the participant should remain in the study, ie, continue to participate in scheduled study visits and evaluations. 
Note that discontinuation from study intervention is NOT the same thing as a withdrawal from 
the study. 
At each visit, participants will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if rash or 
skin reaction has developed. If maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 1, 2, or 3 has developed, 
the participant must be permanently discontinued from study intervention and AstraZeneca 
medical staff must be informed.
!CTCAE Grade 1: Macules/papules coveri ng < 10% body surface area with or without 
symptoms (eg, pruritus, burning, tightness)
!CTCAE Grade 2: Macules/papules covering 10% to 30% body surface area, with or 
without symptoms (eg, pruritus, burning, tight ness); limiting instrumental activities of 
daily living (refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc); rash covering > 30% body surface area with or without mild symptoms
!CTCAE Grade 3: Macules/papules coveri ng > 30% body surface area, with moderate or 
severe symptoms; limiting self-care activities of daily living (refer to bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden)
If the participant develops a rash or skin reaction that is not considered a maculopapular rash 
but is a generalized rash/skin reaction or is considered to be an SAE, the participant must be permanently discontinued from the study in tervention and AstraZeneca medical staff should

Further information and rash/skin reaction evaluation guidance is provided in Appendix  E5 .  
Participants may also be discontinued from the study intervention in the following situations: 
!Participant decision - The participant is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment
!Lost to follow-up
!Pregnancy in a female participant
!AE or other safety reasons as judged by the investigator and/or sponsor, where continued 
treatment may put the participant at undue risk
!Development of uncontrolled and clinically significant  as judged by 
the investigator
!Severe non-compliance with the CSP 
!Elevations in liver tests corresponding to possible DILI (Appendix F8for details)
Data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow-up and any further 
evaluations that need to be completed are noted in  Table 2.  
7.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation
Every attempt should be made to maintain participants on the study intervention during the 
course of the study. If the study intervention ha s been interrupted, it should be re-introduced as 
soon as, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant is able to re-start study treatment. 
Note related to AESI skin reactions (including maculopapular rash): In the event of 
maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 1, 2, or 3, or any other generalized rash/skin reaction or serious rash/skin reaction, study intervention should be permanently discontinued. At each 
visit, participants will be instructed to stop the study intervention and contact the investigator immediately if rash or skin reaction has developed. After the participant has been seen by the 
study doctor or designee and the skin reaction is  not considered a maculopapular rash CTCAE 
Grade 1, 2, or 3, or any other generalized rash/skin reaction or serious rash/skin reaction, the study treatment can be restarted.
7.1.2 Rechallenge
Participants who have temporarily discontinued study intervention can resume treatment as soon as, in the opinion of the investigator, the pa rticipant is able to re-start study treatment and 
the participant wishes to resume. No minimum time period is necessary before treatment can resume.CCI
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54 of 119If a participant develops maculopapular rash CTCAE Grades 1, 2, or 3 or any other 
generalized rash/skin reaction or serious rash /skin reaction, study intervention should be 
permanently discontinued.
7.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study
!A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
!A participant who considers withdrawing f rom the study must be informed by the 
investigator about modified follow-up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records).
!At the time of withdrawal from the study, if possible, an EDV should be conducted, as 
shown in  Table 2 for data to be collected at the time of study withdrawal and follow-up 
and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
oThe participant will discontinue the study  intervention and be withdrawn from the 
study at that time.
!If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
!If a participant withdraws from the study, it should be confirmed if he/she still agrees for 
existing samples to be used in line with the original consent. If he/she requests withdrawal of consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and not tested should be carried out in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulation. The investigator must document the decision on use of existing samples in the site study records and inform th e Global St udy Team.
!The reason for participant withdrawal should be recorded in the eCRF.
7.3 Lost to Follow Up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:
!The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 55 of 119!Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.
!Should the participant c ontinue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
!Site personnel, or delegated third party, will attempt to collect the vital status of the 
participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomized, including 
those who did not get IP. Public sources may be searched for vital status information. If vital status is determin ed as deceased, this will be documented and the participant will not 
be considered lost to follow-up. Sponsor pers onnel will not be involve d in any attempts to 
collect vital status information. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the st udy as a whole are handled as part of  Appendix D.
7.4 Study Stopping Criteria
In the event of any of the following criteria being met, the clinical trial would be stopped if 
confirmed with the DRC.
!Any one death considered related to AZD4831 (mitiperstat) by the DRC.
!A difference of 2 patients experiencing SAEs considered related to AZD4831 
(mitiperstat) by the DRC as compared to placebo.
!One Hy’s Law case on AZD4831 (mitiperstat) (That is: AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN together 
with Total Bilirubin ≥ 2× ULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found 
to explain the combination of increases).
!Five patients who experience the following cate gories of rash/skin reaction leading to 
permanent discontinuation: CTCAE Grade 2 maculopapular rash, CTCAE Grade 3 
maculopapular rash, other generalized rash/skin reaction not considered maculopapular, 
or other rash/skin reaction not considered maculopapular that is considered as an SAE; these would also need to be considered related to AZD4831 (mitiperstat) by the DRC.
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
!Study procedures and their timing are summarized in  Table 2.  Protocol  waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56 of 119!Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
!Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in  Table 2,  is 
essential and required for study conduct.
!All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The i nvestigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
!Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time fr ame defined in  Table 2.
!The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the 
study, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 300 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.
8.1 Efficacy Assessments
ALT will be used as a surrogate non-invasive biomarker of hepatocellular injury ( Table 8) . 
The primary endpoint is change in ALT from bas eline and over placebo to Week 12. 
8.2 Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in  Table 2.  AEs based on 
examinations and tests are described in Section  8.3.5.
8.2.1 Medical History
Complete medical history will include history a nd current medical conditions past or present 
cardiovascular disorders; respiratory, gastroint estinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, 
lymphatic, hematologic, immunologic, dermatological, psychiatric, genitourinary, or any other diseases or disorders; drug and surgical history; and history of alcohol and tobacco use.
The AUDIT questionnaire to assess alcohol use habits will be completed at screening only 
(Table 2) . The AUDIT questionnaire should be administered by the investigator using the 
latest version, downloaded from  https://auditscreen.org. A  sample is provided in  Appendix B.  
The results will be used for determining participant eligibility (Section  4.4).

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 57 of 1198.2.2 Physical Examinations
!A complete physical examination will include assessments of the following: general 
appearance; respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose, and throat), lymph nodes, thy roid, musculoskeletal (i ncluding spine and 
extremities) and neurological systems.
!A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of general 
appearance and skin, abdomen, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.
Physical examination will be performed at timepoints as specified in  Table 2.  
8.2.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs (supine BP [average of 2 measurements], pulse rate, height, weight, and body 
temperature) will be performed in-clinic at timepoints as specified in  Table 2. Vital sign 
assessments are to be collected using equipment supplied by the investigator.
At Visits 4 and Visit 8, the vital signs BP measurements can be used for the predose supine 
measurements for the orthostatic test, if taken after being supine for at least 10 minutes and as 
long as the standing BP measurements are taken after these supine measurements at the time intervals described below for the orthostatic BP measurement.
The measurements should be done before any blood sampling. The measurements should be 
preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions.
8.2.3.1 Orthostatic Blood Pressure Measurements and Follow-up of Confirmed 
Orthostatic Hypotension 
Orthostatic BP measurements will be obtained using a standard sphygmomanometer after 
scheduled supine measurements (1 and 3 minutes after the participant stands) and prior to any required blood draw:
!At baseline (Visit 4, Day 1), orthostatic BP should be measured predose and 1 to 2 hours 
post‑dose.
!At Week 12 (Visit 8) orthostatic BP should be measured predose.
To minimize chances of orthostatic hypotension related to volume depletion, participants 
should be well hydrated when they come to th e clinic for study visits. Supine BP measures 
will be collected after participants have been lying down for at least 10 minutes. To ensure that a stable supine BP is obtained, at least 2 systolic and 2 diastolic BP measurements will be 
obtained. If the replicate measurements differ by no more than 10 mmHg and 5 mmHg, 
respectively, the supine BP will be considered stable. The mean value of each replicate (mean systolic and mean diastolic value) will represent the baseline BP for that visit. After stable BP 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 58 of 119is achieved, the participant will stand, and BP measurements will be taken at 1 and 3 minutes 
after the participant stands. If the BP measurements do not meet th e criteria for orthostatic 
hypotension, no additional measurement is needed. If the BP measurement meets the criteria shown in  Table 6,  invest igators will repeat the supine and standing measurements up to 
2 additional times. The exception is for participants with orthostatic hypotension symptoms: 
In this situation, the orthostatic hypotension  AE should be reported based on a single 
orthostatic test sequence.
When evaluating orthostatic vitals, record any symptoms of dizziness or light headedness. 
Record on the AE page in the eCRF. At Visit 4, if orthostatic hypotension is confirmed predose and postdose, the orthostatic hypotension AE should be reported twice (predose and postdose). The same applies to symptoms related to the measurement of orthostatic vitals: if present predose and postdose, it should also be reported as an AE twice (predose and postdose).
Table 6 Orthostatic Blood Pressure Criteria and Management
Decrease in BP Indicative of 
Orthostatic HypotensionActions
≥ 20 mmHg systolic or 
≥ 10 mmHg diastolicRepeat the BP measurements (supine and standing) up to 2 additional times, 
unless orthostatic hypotension is present in association with symptoms 
related to the measurement of orthostatic vitals: in such a case the test doesn't need to be repeated and the orthostatic hypotension AE and symptoms related to the measurement of orthostatic vitals AE should be 
reported based on a single sequence.
If either the 1-minute or 3-minute standing BP meets the orthostatic 
(postural) hypotension criteria, then the sequence is considered indicative of 
orthostatic hypotension. 
If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences are positive, then orthostatic hypotension is 
confirmed, and an AE of orthostatic hypotension will be reported.
AE, adverse event; BP, blood pressure
For participants with orthostatic hypotension, individualized treatment should be prescribed at 
the investigator’s discretion following local  guidelines, including pharmacological (eg, down 
titration of nitrates) or non-pharmacological (eg, hydration) treatments.
8.2.4 Electrocardiograms
Single 12-lead ECG w ill be ob tained after the participant has been resting in a supine position 
for at least 10 minutes, at the visits outlined in  Table 2.  A digital ECG machine that 
automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be used. Interpretation of the clinical safety digital ECG findings will be reviewed and confirmed by the investigator and recorded in the eCRF.

8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The principal investigator is responsible for ens uring that all staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section.
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in  Appendix E.
Adverse events will be reported by the part icipant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious 
Adverse Event Information
Adverse events will be collected from time of first dose throughout the treatment period and 
including the follow-up period. The only exception is related to the predose orthostatic test at CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 of 119Visit 4: If orthostatic hypotension is confirmed, it should be reported as an AE, and symptoms 
related to the measurement of orthostatic vitals if present should also be reported as an AE.
Serious adverse events will be recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent 
form.
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the 
investigational medicinal product that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant 
treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the 
sponsor.
8.3.2 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
AE Variables
The following variables will be collected for each AE:
!AE (verbatim)
!The date and time when the AE started and stopped
!Maximum intensity
!Maximum CTCAE grade for maculopapular rash
!Whether the AE is serious or not
!Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)
!Action taken with regard to IP
!AE caused participant’s w ithdrawal from study (yes or no)
!Outcome
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:
!Date AE met criteria for SAE
!Date investigator became aware of SAE
!AE is serious due to
!Date of hospitalization
!Date of discharge
!In case of fatality:

oDate of death
oAutopsy performed
!Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) 
!Causality assessment to other medication
8.3.3 Causality Collection
The investigator should assess causal relationship between study intervention and each AE, 
and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IP?” 
For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication. Note that for 
SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in  Appendix E to the CSP .
8.3.4 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question 
from the study site staff: “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?”, or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from the CSP mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the CSR. 
Deterioration as compared to baseline in p rotocol-mandated measurements should therefore 
only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with  the IP or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged 
by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study 
intervention, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). 
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clin ical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 63 of 119the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal med ical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment w ill be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease under study.
8.3.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the IP and may require close monitoring and collection of additional information by the investigator. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of 
these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this IP. 
Adverse events of special interest for this study include:
!Skin reactions, including maculopapular rash
!Infections
These AESIs are to be reported as described in Section  8.3.1 and Section  8.3.2.  
8.3.6.1 Skin Reactions, Including Maculopapular Rash
If the rash is considered maculopapular, it will be evaluated using CTCAE Grades 1-3 for rash 
maculopapular; if not considered maculopapular, severity will be captured as mild/moderate/severe, along with data element components generally used for CTCAE grading of other skin reactions, given that CTCAE grading is specific to the particular type of skin lesion. For all rashes, various aspects of the rash will be documented, including start/end date, morphology of lesions (maculopapular vs other morphologies), body  surface area 
impacted, anatomical site(s), symptoms, effect on participant (including ADL impacted), concomitant medications, medication administered, and specific rash diagnosis, if available. 
Photos (overview and detailed) should be taken.
Refer Appendix  E5 for further guidance in rash assessment and reporting. 
At all visits, participants will be instructed  to contact the investigator immediately if rash or 
skin reaction has developed at any time point during the study. 
Participants who develop skin reactions, including rash, will be asked to return to the clinic for 
an additional visit that will include a full physical exam and co llection of bl ood samples for 
safety, hs-CRP, and PK. If a participant is discontinued from IP and proceeds to the EDV , an exploratory biomarker sample and blood and urine samples for metabolite analysis will also be collected. The genetic sample should also be collected at the EDV if not previously 
collected from the participant. 
It is suggested to start with treatment for maculopapular rash, 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 64 of 119per local standard treatment guidelines (which  may include, but not be limited to, a topical 
steroid and/or oral antihistamine). The treatment should be individualized per participant and 
based on investigator discretion. The participant can be provided with a treatment for the skin rash, according to clinical management standard. 
Patients should be referred to a dermatologist if  they experience a skin reaction or rash that is 
considered severe, serious, persists ≥ 7 days, continues worsening after discontinuing the 
investigational agent, or if the investigator deems it otherwise necessary. It would be recommended that the dermatologist determine whether the individual subject will benefit with additional treatment and recommended that a biopsy is performed if deemed necessary 
by the dermatologist in these scenarios.
Blood samples should be drawn prior to treatment,  if possible, and without delaying treatment.
8.3.6.2 Infection
Infections will be considered AESI in this study. Local laboratory testing for microorganisms 
per local guidelines is requested for serious infections (those that meet SAE criteria) and 
results documented.
8.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further 
evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN may 
need to be reported as SAEs. Refer to  Appendix F for further instruction on cases of increases 
in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
8.3.8 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs w ill be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, investigators or other site personnel will inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the investigator to ensure that all 
the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar 
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel will inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 65 of 119aware of it.
Once the investigators or other site personnel ind icate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an 
automated email alert is sent to the design ated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system 
is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the 
investigator/study site staff how to proceed.
Further guidance on the definition of a SAE is provided in  Appendix E.
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug.
8.3.9 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except for:
!If the pregnancy is discovered before the study participant has received any study 
intervention.
8.3.9.1 Maternal Exposure
Should a pregnancy occur, the IP should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy 
reported to AstraZeneca.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unle ss there is a suspicion that the study intervention 
under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without comp lications should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth or congenital anomaly/birth defect) should be followed up and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study.
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 
5 calendar days for SAEs (Section  8.3.8)  and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
The PREGREP module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the paper-based 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66 of 119PREGOUT module is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
8.3.10 Medication Error, Drug Abuse, and Drug Misuse
8.3.10.1 Timelines
If an event of medication error, drug abuse, or drug misuse occurs during the study, then the 
investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 
one calendar day , ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when they become aware of 
it.  
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is completed within one(initial fatal/life-threatening or follow up 
fatal/life-threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an 
SAE associated with the event of medication error, drug abuse or misuse (Section  8.3.8)  and 
within 30 days for all other events.
8.3.10.2 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an IMP or AstraZeneca NIMP that either causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant.
The full definition and examples of medication error can be found in Appendix  E4 .
8.3.10.3 Drug Abuse
Drug abuse is the persistent or sporadic intentional , non-therapeutic excessive use of IMP or 
AstraZeneca NIMP for a perceived reward or desired non-therapeutic effect. 
The full definition and examples of drug abuse can be found in Appendix  E4 .
8.3.10.4 Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intentional and inappropriate use (by a study  participant) of IMP or 
AstraZeneca NIMP for medicinal purposes outside of the authorized product information, or 
for unauthorized IMPs or AstraZeneca NIMPs, outside the intended use as specified in the 
protocol and includes deliberate administration of the product by the wrong route. 
The full definition and examples of drug misuse can be found in Appendix  E4 .
8.4 Overdose
For this study, any dose of study intervention greater than those specified in this protocol 
within the same day will be considered an overdose.
!An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module

!Blood samples will be co llected for measurement of concentrations of AZD4831 
(mitiperstat) in plasma as specified in  Table 2.  
!Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected predose; thus, participants should be reminded 
not to take their study medication at home on the day of their clinic visit as they will 
receive study medication in clinic on th ese days. Therefore , study medication 
administration at Visit 4, Visit 6, and Visit 8 will be in clinic.
!Samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if warranted and 
agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor, eg, for safety reasons. 
!Plasma samples will be used to analyze the PK of AZD4831 (mitiperstat). Samples 
collected for analyses of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) plasma concentration may also be used 
to evaluate safety or pharmacodynamics aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study.
!Samples will be collected, labeled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory 
Manual.
!Dosing cards will be given to the participants at the randomization visit and the 
participants will be asked to f ill in the dose intake in formation (date and time) at home. 
Drug concentration information that would unblind the study will not be reported to 
investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. 
Any changes in the timing or addition of time points for any planned study assessments must 
be documented and approved by the relevant st udy team member and then archived in the 
sponsor and site study files but will not constitute a protocol amendment. The IRB/IEC will be informed of any safety issues that require alteration of the safety monitoring scheme or amendment of the ICF.
8.5.2.1 Determination of Drug Concentration
Samples for determination of drug concentration in plasma will be analyzed by or on behalf of 
AstraZeneca, using an appropriately validated bioanalytical method and only for participants on active treatment. Only samples from participants on active treatment will be analyzed (Section  6.3), unless there is a need to confirm that correct treatment has been given to study  
participants. Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate 
Bioanalytical Report. 
Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be re ported to 
investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The primary hypothesis of the study is that on ce daily dosing of 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) 
will result in a significant decrease versus once daily dosing of placebo in ALT at end of 
treatment relative to ALT at baseline in a NASH patient population. The safety hypothesis is 
that once daily dosing of 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) will be safe and tolerable in a NASH 
patient population.
Statistical hypotheses for secondary endpoints are described in Section  9.4, and further details 
will be provided in the SAP. 
No multiplicity adjustment for alpha is planned.
9.2 Sample Size Determination
The study has been powered to have at least 80% power to detect a 25% decrease in ALT level 
at end of treatment relative to baseline for AZ D4831 (mitiperstat) treated versus placebo 
treated in a one-sided test at 5% significan ce level, based on the FAS population. Alanine 
aminotransferase measurements will be log-transformed before analysis. Under the 
assumption of a standard deviation of 0.50 for change from baseline in log-transformed ALT, 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72 of 119and allowing for 10% missing data, 45 participants per arm would render the desired power.
9.3 Populations for Analyses
9.3.1 Full Analysis Set
All participants who have been randomized to the study intervention will be included in the 
FAS irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. 
Participants will be analyzed according to their randomized study intervention irrespective of whether or not they have prematurely disc ontinued and irrespective of the treatment they 
actually received. Participants who withdraw consent to participate in the study are included up to the date of their study termination. The FAS will be considered the primary analysis set 
for all pharmacodynamics variables.
9.3.2 Safety Analysis Set
All participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized AZD4831 (mitiperstat) or placebo 
will be included in the safety analysis set.  Throughout the safety resu lts sections, erroneously 
treated participants (eg, those randomized to AZD4831 (mitiperstat) but actually given placebo) will be accounted for in the actual treatment group. A participant who had received any dose of the experimental study intervention will be classified as in the experimental IP group.
9.3.3 PK Analysis Set
The PK analysis set will consist of all participants in the FAS who have received at least one dose of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) and who have at least one PK sample post dose. 
9.4 Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock, and it will include a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section is a summary of the planned statist ical analyses of the most important e ndpoints including primary 
and secondary endpoints.
9.4.1 General Considerations
All personnel involved with the analysis of th e study will remain blinded until database lock 
and protocol violations have been identified and documented. Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives.
Nominal significance will be 5% and all tests will be one-sided. All confidence intervals will 
be 2-sided and 95%. 
No multiplicity adjustment for alpha is planned.

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73 of 119For analyses both on the FAS and on the SAS, baseline is defined as the last non-missing 
value prior to first dose including unscheduled assessments that occurs prior to first dose.
All summary statistics will be presented in total, divided by fibrosis stage, and divided by 
T2DM status. 
9.4.2 Pharmacodynamics
9.4.2.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary pharmacodynamic endpoint for this study is change from baseline to Week 12 in 
log-transformed ALT. 
The null hypothesis of no decrease in ALT co mparing AZD4831 (mitiperstat) to placebo will 
be tested versus the alternative hypothesis of a decrease in ALT in favor of AZD4831 
(mitiperstat) to placebo using a one-sided test at 5% significance level, assessed through a treatment policy estimand. The endpoint will be analyzed in a mixed effects linear model with 
participant as random effect, treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, 
and baseline as covariate. Data will be log-transformed before analyses, and results will be 
back-transformed to describe relative change versus placebo in value at end of treatment relative to baseline. Furthermore, data will also be analyzed as individual percental change, that is (value at time t – value at baseline)/(value at baseline)100%, in a similar mixed effects model but without log transformation of data.
!Treatment: Treatment with 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) compared to placebo, 
administered in addition to optimal background therapy for co-morbidities
!Population: FAS
!Endpoint: Change from baseline in log-transformed ALT
!Intercurrent events: Intercurrent events will be ignored (treatment policy strategy) 
and potential missing data imputed
!Population-level summary: Relative change versus placebo in value at end of 
treatment relative to baseline
Any missing baseline ALT values will be imputed based on existing baseline values of FAS 
participants using PROC MI MCMC, disregarding the treatment group. For postbaseline missing ALT values, a distinction in the imputation will be made between non-monotone and monotone missing data. Monotone missing data are defined as missing data that constitute the 
end participant follow-up, while non-monotone mi ssing data means that there are observations 
made after the missing time point. Any non-monotone missing data will be replaced using PROC MI MCMC while monotone missing data will use PROC MI regression. The imputation model will include timepoint, baseline value, and treatment group. More details will be described in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74 of 1199.4.2.2 Secondary Endpoint
For Pro-C3 the null hypothesis of no decrease comparing AZD4831 (mitiperstat) to placebo 
will be tested versus the alternative hypothesis of a decrease in favor of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) to placebo in the same way as for ALT. Missing observations will be imputed using the same method as for missing ALT observations.
Estimand for Pro-C3:
!Treatment: Treatment with 5 mg AZD4831 (mitiperstat) compared to placebo, 
administered in addition to optimal background therapy for co-morbidities
!Population: FAS
!Endpoint: Change from baseline in log-transformed Pro-C3
!Intercurrent events: Intercurrent events will be ignored (treatment policy strategy) and 
potential missing data imputed
!Population-level summary: Relative change versus placebo in value at end of treatment 
relative to baseline
Furthermore, all pharmacodynamics data collected will be listed for each participant and 
summarized descriptively (including, but not limited to, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
maximum, geometric mean, geometric co efficient of variation) by treatment and time 
point/visit. Figures of the mean response (absolute change from baseline, and value relative to baseline where appropriate) will be used to visualize the average response over time.
It is important to distinguish between non-adherence with, or withdrawal from, randomized 
treatment and discontinuation from the trial. A randomized participant can withdraw from the 
study but not from the analysis. The potential impact of intercurrent events (events that occur after treatment initiation and either preclude observation of the variable or affect its interpretation [eg, discontinuation of treatment,  switching treatment, severe adverse and 
clinical events, lost to follow-up, or withdrawn consent]) apart from rash leading stop of study 
treatment, potential intercurrent events are anti cipated to have even distribution between the 
treatment arms.
9.4.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints
Analysis of exploratory endpoints will be described in the SAP. 
9.4.3 Safety
The safety endpoint for this study is safety and tolerability, including hepatic safety, during 
treatment with AZD4831 (mitiperstat) (5 mg) comp ared with placebo. Safety analyses will be 
performed using the safety analysis set. Safety data will be presented using descriptive 
statistics unless otherwise specified.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 of 119Appendix A Optional Genomics Initiative Sample
A1 Use/Analysis of DNA
!AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic 
variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications. This genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments, or medications.  Therefore, where local regulations and 
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants.
!This optional genetic research may consist of the analysis of the structure of the 
participant´s DNA, ie, the entire genome. 
!The results of genetic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary.
!The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality.
A2 Genetic Research Plan and Procedures
Selection of Genetic Research Population
!All participants will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participation is 
voluntary and if a participant declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of 
benefit. The participant will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study.
Inclusion Criterion
!For inclusion in this genetic research, particip ants must fulfill all of the inclusion criteria 
described in the main body of the Clinical St udy Protocol and: Provide informed consent 
for the Genomics Initiative sampling and analyses.
Exclusion Criteria
!Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in 
the main study or any of the following:
oPrevious allogeneic bone marrow transplant
oNon-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample 
collection

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 78 of 119Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research: 
!Participants may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any 
decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study. Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Section  7.2of the main Clinical Study Protocol.
Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
!The blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained from the participants at 
Visit 4 randomization. Alth ough DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to 
avoid introducing bias through excluding participants who may withdraw due to an AE. If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Visit 4, it may be taken at any visit until the last 
study visit. Only one sample should be coll ected per participant for genetics during the 
study. 
Coding and Storage of DNA Samples
!The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are 
important to maintain participant confidentia lity. Samples will be stored for a maximum 
of 15 years, from the date of last participant las t visit, after which they will be destroyed. 
DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
!An additional second code will be assigne d to the sample either before or at the time of 
DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will 
be identifiable only by the second, unique number. This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZen eca genetics laboratories, or at the 
designated organization. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to 
any person (AstraZeneca employee or design ated organizations working with the DNA).
!The link between the participant enrollment/randomization code and the second number 
will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organizations. The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of 
withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
!The principles for ethical and regulatory re quirements for the study, including this 
genetics research component, are outlined in  Appendix D.

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 79 of 119Informed Consent
!The genetic component of this study is optional, and the participant may participate in 
other components of the main study without participating in this genetic component. To participate in the genetic component of the study the participant must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the addendum for the Genomics Initiative 
component of the study. Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to 
the participant and the original filed at the study center. The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the participant understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genetic aspect of the study at any time.
Participant Data Protection
!AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to participants, any insurance 
company, any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law.
!Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being 
linked to the identity of the participant. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a participant. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca physician or an 
investigator might know a participant’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic 
data. Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the participant’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
Data Management
!Any genetic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca 
and/or designated organizations to analyze the samples.
!AstraZeneca and its designated organizations may share summary results (such as genetic 
differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organizations or health insurance companies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease. The researchers can only use th is information for health-related research 
purposes. Researchers may see summary results,  but they will not be able to see 
individual participant data or any personal identifiers. 
!Some or all of the clinical datasets from th e main study may be merged with the genetic 
data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 82 of 119Appendix C COVID-19
C1 Background to COVID-19
There is currently an outbreak of resp iratory disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel 
SARS-CoV-2 that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in 2019. This new virus has rapidly spread across the globe causing the WHO to declare a pandemic situation on 12 March 2020. The countermeasures initiated by national and local governments worldwide and the recommendations issued by the heal th authorities have impacted current and new 
clinical studies. As the threat of pandemic burden including new outbreaks, locally or globally, 
will impact the further conduct of clinical studies, appropriate risk assessments and mitigation 
measures will need to be taken into consideration in all clinical studies to protect participants, site staff, and society as a whole.
Both EMA and FDA as well as national health  authorities in Europe have issued new 
guidelines that aim to provide recommendations for actions for conduct of clinical studies of medical products during COVID-19 pandemic. Since the pandemic situation is evolving, guidelines, recommendations, national laws, and local restrictions may change at high pace. Given the circumstances of po tentially relapsing pa ndemic or epidemic situation with regard 
to the spread of COVID-19 in future, special attention will be paid to protect participants 
participating in the study and site staff involved in the investigations against infection with 
SARS-CoV-2 as requested by the newly issued EMA guideline.
C2 Risk Assessment for COVID-19 Pandemic
While there is a theoretical risk that treatment with a myeloperoxidase inhibitor could impair host-defense mechanisms, an increased incidence of infection has not been seen in limited 
clinical data with AZD4831 (mitiperstat). There fore, the risk to participants exposed to SARS-
CoV-2 or to those who suffer from COVID-19 is expected to be similar to the background population with the same co-morbidities as thos e in the study, in particular non-cirrhotic non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis. The risk of exposure to infected people cannot be completely excluded as the participants may need to expose themselves to public areas (eg, commute to the site) and have additional human contact (eg, with site staff and other participants of the clinical study).
AstraZeneca has no data on the co-administration of AZD4831 (mitiperstat) and COVID-19 
vaccines being approved. Potential AZD4831 (mitiperstat) vaccine interactions affecting 
patient safety or IMP and vaccine efficacy are therefore unclear.
Measures to mitigate the additional risks caused by COVID-19 are:
!This study is going to start enrolling only when the sponsor deems it is safe to start the 
study. In addition, the study will not star t until the local confinement measures or other

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 83 of 119safety restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic imposed by the local authorities are 
compatible with safe conduct of the study.
!Current national laws and local recommendations for prevention of pandemic will be 
strictly adhered to.
!Participants will be closely monitored for any signs and symptoms of COVID-19, 
including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue throughout the study during the pandemic. Once clinical signs of infection are reported by participants, the investigator needs to determine whether samples can be collected, and safety data can be recorded on site. If not, adverse events and concomitant medications will be obtained via phone calls. The decision to continue with dosing the participant with the study drugs in the event of him/her showing symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be per investigator’s discretion.
!The probability of virus transmission will be controlled as much as possible by:
oAdvice for participant to adhere to local requirements for reduction of the public 
exposure while ambulatory.
oConfirmation of COVID-19 infection by optional laboratory assessment will be conducted based on availability (test capacity and turnaround time) of approved tests and on investigator’s discretion.
oPhysical distancing and person-to-person contact restrictions will be applied during site visits. 
oWhere physical distancing is not possible, personal protective equipment will be used by study participants (surgical face mas k, gloves) and staff (for example but not 
limited to masks, gloves, protectors, medical suits) if deemed appropriate by the investigators and site staff and guided by local requirements.
oLogistical im provements of the site and structural measures of the study site building 
will be implemented to further improve physical distancing.
!If site visits are not possible due to local restrictions, home nursing visits may be 
considered after discussion with and approval by the sponsor. Study intervention may be delivered direct to participant if appropriate and via sponsor approved courier service.
C3 Restrictions Related to COVID-19
During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants are advised to adhere to local requirements for reduction of the public SARS-CoV-2 exposure while ambulatory. If applicable, prior to 
screening (Visit 1), potential participants shoul d be called to confirm they are not experiencing 
any COVID-19 symptoms and signs and are asked not to attend the site in case of suspected infection. If appropriate, participants will be referred to the local health care system. Physical distancing and person-to-person contact restrictions will be applied and explained to participants while staying at the study site. Where physical distancing is not possible, study

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 91 of 119Appendix E Adverse Events Definitions and Additional Safety 
Information
E1 Definition of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical study participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally a ssociated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurre nce. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study intervention has been administered.
E2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, 
treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening
!Requires in-participant hospitalization or prolongation of existing hosp italization 
!Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
!Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
!Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical 
treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
AEs for malignant tumors reported during a study should generally be assessed as SAEs . If 
no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion should be used. In 
certain situations, however, medical judgment on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumor even t should be assessed and reported as a non-SAE . For 
example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumor, the AE may not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that does not require
hospitalization, may be assessed as non-serious; exam ples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell 
carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 92 of 119Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalization
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself an SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not consider ed AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, disability, or incapacity but may jeopardize the participant or may 
require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. 
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
!Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
!Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
!Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
!Blood dyscrasias (eg, neut ropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization
!Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Intensity Rating Scale:
!Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
!Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
!Severe (incapacitating, with inab ility to perform normal activities)
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix  E2 .  An AE of severe 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 93 of 119intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix  E2 .  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix  E2 .
E3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by the drug.
!Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?
!Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology a nd toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?
!De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?
!No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, ot her host or environmental factors.
!Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge.
!Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory inve stigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
!Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
!Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘r elated’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal r elationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal r elations hip is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94 of 119causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
E4 Medication Error, Drug Abuse, and Drug Misuse
Medication Error 
For the purposes of this clinical study a medicatio n error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or AstraZeneca non-
investigational medicinal product (NIMP) that either causes harm to the participant or has the 
potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant. 
Medication error includes situ ations where an error:  
!Occurred 
!Was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug 
!Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error 
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: 
!Drug name confusion 
!Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the participant 
!Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration 
!Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
!Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the refrigerator when it should be at room 
temperature 
!Wrong participant received the medication (excluding interactive response technology 
[IRT]/ randomization and trial supply management [RTSM] errors) 
!Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IRT/RTSM errors) 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95 of 119Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: 
!Errors related to or resulting from IRT/RTSM - including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error  
!Participant accidentally missed drug dos e(s) eg, forgot to take medication 
!Accidental overdose (w ill be captured as an ove rdose) 
!Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging 
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.
Drug Abuse
For the purpose of this study, drug abuse is defined as the persistent or sporadic intentional, 
non-therapeutic excessive use of IMP or AstraZeneca NIMP for a perceived reward or desired 
non-therapeutic effect. 
Any events of drug abuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the Data Entry Site (DES) using the Drug Abuse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug abuse happened in a study participant or if the drug abuse regards a person not enrolled in the study (such as a relative of the study participant). 
Examples of drug abuse include but are not limited to: 
!The drug is used with the intent of getting a perceived reward (by the study participant or 
a person not enrolled in the study)
!The drug in the form of a tablet is crushe d and injected or snorted with the intent of 
getting high
Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intentional and inappropriate use (by a study participant) of IMP or 
AstraZeneca NIMP for medicinal purposes outside of the authorized product information, or 
for unauthorized IMPs or AstraZeneca NIMPs, outside the intended use as specified in the protocol and includes deliberate administration of the product by the wrong route. 
Events of drug misuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the DES using the Drug Misuse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug misuse happened in a study participant or if the drug misuse regards a person not enrolled in the study (such as a relati ve of the study participant).

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 96 of 119Examples of drug misuse include but are not limited to: 
!The drug is used with the intention to cause an effect in another person 
!The drug is sold to other people for recreational purposes  
!The drug is used to facilitate assault in another person 
!The drug is deliberately administered by the wrong route 
!The drug is split in half because it is easier to swallow, when it is stated in the protocol 
that it must be swallowed whole 
!Only half the dose is taken because the study participant feels that he/she is feeling better 
when not taking the whole dose 
!Someone who is not enrolled in the study intentionally takes the drug 
E5 Guide to Skin Reaction Assessment
This Appendix describes the process to be followed to appropriately identify, assess, and 
report cases of skin reactions. Skin reactions, including maculopapular rash, will be considered AEs of special interest in this study. To ensure that data are collected systematically, any skin reaction will be rec orded on a special eCRF page. All skin reactions 
should be recorded and reported as AEs or SAEs.
If the rash is considered maculopapular, it will be evaluated using Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grades 1 to 3 for rash maculopapular; if not considered 
maculopapular, severity will be captured as mild/moderate/severe, along with data element 
components generally used for CTCAE grading of other skin reactions, given that CTCAE grading is specific to the particular type of skin lesion. For all rashes, various aspects of the rash will be documented, including start/end date, morphology of lesions (maculopapular vs other m orphologies), body  surface area impacted, anatomical site(s), symptoms, effect on 
participant (including activities of daily living [ADL] impacted), concomitant medications, medication administered, and specific rash diagnosis, if available. 
If maculopapular rash Grade 1, 2, or 3 has developed, participant must be permanently 
discontinued from IP, and AstraZeneca medical staff should be informed. 
If the participant develops a rash or skin reaction that is not considered a maculopapular rash, 
the participant must permanently discontinue if the rash/skin reaction is considered an SAE or is a generalized rash/skin reaction. AstraZeneca medical staff should be informed.
At all visits, participants will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if rash has 
developed at any time point during the study. Par ticipants will be recommended to make an 
acceptable quality self-photo of skin affected with rash.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 97 of 119Participants who develop skin reactions, including rash, will be asked to return to the clinic for 
an additional visit that will include a full physical examination and blood samples for safety, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a nd pharmacokinetics (PK). If a participant is 
discontinued from investigational product and proceeds to the early discontinuation visit (EDV), exploratory biomarker sample and blood and urine samples for exploratory metabolite 
analysis will also be collected. The mandatory genetic sample per Section  8.6.1 should also be 
collected at the EDV if not previously collected from the participant. Initiation of treatment for maculopapular rash is s uggested, in line with local standard treatment guidelines which 
could include, but not limited to, a topical ster oid and/or oral antihistamine. The treatment 
should be individualized per participant and based on investigator discretion. The participant can be provided with a treatment for the skin rash, according to clinical management standard. 
Patients should be referred to a dermatologist if  they experience a skin reaction or rash that is 
considered severe, serious, persists ≥ 7 days, continues worsening after discontinuing the 
investigational agent, or if the investigator deems it otherwise necessary. It would be 
recommended that the dermatologist determine whether the individual subject will benefit with additional treatment and recommended that a biopsy is performed if deemed necessary 
by the dermatologist in these scenarios.
Blood samples should be drawn prior to treatment,  if possible, and without delaying treatment.
The investigator should make quality photo(s) of par ticipant’s skin affected with rash, that 
will allow the evaluation of rash according to the guidance given in this section. Photos taken by the investigator and participant should avoid identifying features like the face, use adequate 
lighting, and capture both a close-up photo(s) of the affected skin and photo(s) from farther 
away to give context to the size of the affected  area and the location of the skin reaction/rash. 
Face, tattoos, piercings, and other identifiers must not be seen in the photo(s) to avoid identification of the pa rticipant (participant can cover them when making photo, or these can 
be masked/edited afterwards by investigator).
Participant must not send any photo(s) to invest igator via SMS, e-mail, or in any other way in 
order to keep the data privacy and anonymity.  Investigator may take a photo of participant’s 
photo(s) showed on digital device (phone, tablet, etc). Alternatively, participant can print out photo(s) at the site visit and give them to the site staff for scanning. 
The Common Terminology Criteria for AEs is a descriptive terminology that can be used for 
AE reporting.
In general, CTCAE Guidelines describe the Grades of AE severity from 1 to 5:
Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001

Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization ind icated; disabling; limiting self-care 
ADL**
Grade 4 : Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 : Death related to AE
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.
Note: for Maculopapular rash, only 3 CTC Grades exist:
Maculo-Papular Rash
Definition: A disorder characterized by the presence of macules (flat) and papules (elevated). Also known as 
morbilliform rash, it is one of the most common cutaneous AEs, frequently affecting the upper trunk, 
spreading centripetally, and associated with pruritis.
Grade 1 Macules/papules covering < 10% Body Surface Area with or without symptoms (eg, pruritus, 
burning, tightness)
Grade 2 Macules/papules covering 10 - 30% Body Surface Area, with or without symptoms (eg, pruritus, 
burning, tightness); limiting Instrumental Activities of Daily Living*; rash covering > 30% Body 
Surface Area with or without mild symptoms

and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
F1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the manag ement of elevated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on stopping criteria and dose adaptations in possible hepatocellular drug-
induced liver injury (DILI) and in possible cholestatic DILI can be found in Appendix  F8of 
the CSP .
During the course of the study the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential PHL criteria at any point during the study.
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study vi sits and other visits including central and all 
local laboratory evaluations even if collected out side of the study visits; for example, PHL 
criteria could be met by an elevated alanine ami notransferase (ALT) from a central laboratory 
and/or elevated total bilirubin (TBL) from a local laboratory. 
The investigator will also review adverse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevations in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events.
The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria  to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternative exp lanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry 
other than DILI caused by the IMP. 
The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs according to the outcome of the review and 
assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.

AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 102 of 119IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. 
For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
F3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to identify cases of PHL it is importan t to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any participant who meets a ny of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
!ALT ≥3×U L N
!AST ≥3×U L N
!TBL ≥2 × ULN 
Central Laboratories Being Used:
When a participant meets any of the PHL identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, 
the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent to 
AstraZeneca representative). 
The investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the PHL 
identification criteria are met, where this is the case the investigator will:
!Notify the AstraZeneca representative.
!Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory without delay.
!Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory e CRF module(s) with the original local 
laboratory test result.
When the identification criteria are met from central or local la boratory results the investigator 
will wit hout delay:
!Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (definition in Section  F2 )  by 
reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits (including both central and local 
laboratory results).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 103 of 119F4 Follow-up
F 4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the participant does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
!Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the participant has not met PHL criteria. 
!Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory re sults according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP.
F 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the participant does meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
!Notify the AstraZeneca representative who w ill then inform the central St udy Team.
!Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as a SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causality assessment ‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
!For participants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the investigator is not 
required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change
#in the participant’s 
condition.
!The Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study participants’ follow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data.
!Subsequent to this contact the investigator will:
oMonitor the participant until liver bi ochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Complete follow-up SAE Form as required.
oInvestigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician. This  includes deciding which of the tests 
available in the HL lab kit should be used.
oComplete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules as  information becomes available. 
#A ‘significant’ change in the participant’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry param eters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this 
may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 104 of 119F5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be foll owed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the 
IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was met. The AstraZeneca Glob al Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global 
Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the 
instructions below.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
!If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF.
!If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE eCRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality and seriousness criteria) following the AstraZeneca standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is noexplanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
!Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes. 
oThe ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion s hould be used if no other serious criteria 
apply.
oAs there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
!Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL, (report term now 
‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causality assessment is related to IMP and seriousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2.0 AstraZeneca
AZD4831 (mitiperstat) - D6581C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 105 of 119!Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined.
F6 Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met 
Before and After Starting Study Intervention 
This section is applicable to participants who meet PHL criteria on study intervention, having 
previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study intervention.
At the first on-study intervention occurrence of PHL criteria being met the investigator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the participants’ condition#compared with 
the last visit where PHL criteria were met#.
!If there is no significant change no action is required.
!If there is a significant change, notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will inform the 
central Study Team, then follow the s ubsequent process described in Section  F 4.2.  
# A ‘significant’ change in the participant’s condition refers  to a clinically relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry param eters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in

G1 Chain of Custody
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The investigator at each center keep s full traceability of collected biologi cal samples from the 
participants while in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples while at site.
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal.
AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through 
internal procedures, monitoring of study sites , auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requirements of extern al laboratory providers.
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other 
sample archive facilities and will be tracked  by the appropriate Astr aZeneca Biobank Team 
during the entire sample life cycle.
G2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. If samples are already analyzed, AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.
Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, further study participation should be 
considered in relation to the withdrawal processes outlined in the informed consent.
The investigator:
!Ensures participant’s withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to AstraZeneca or delegate.
!Ensures that relevant human biological samples  from that participant, if stored at the 
study site, are immediately identified, dis posed of as appropriate, and the action 
documented.
!Ensures that the participant and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.
AstraZeneca ensures that the organization(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of or repatriated as appropriate, and that the action documented, and the study site is notified.

LABELING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES
International Airline Transportation Association (IA TA) 
(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/download.aspx ) classifies infectious 
substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B, or Exempt.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disa bility, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.
Category A Pathogens are, eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus. Infectious substances meeting these 
criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814. Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to UN 2900.
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are, eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses. They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name:
!UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B
!are to be packed in accordance with UN 3373 and IATA 650
Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are 
unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they 
meet the criteria for inclusion in another class.
!Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations
!Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in 
IATA 650 compliant packaging (https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/DGR-60-EN-PI650.pdf).

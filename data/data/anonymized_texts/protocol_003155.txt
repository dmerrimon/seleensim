 Page 2 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 5) Background Introduction Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a progressive autoimmune disease of biliary epithelial cells resulting in biliary cirrhosis. The prevalence of PBC in the US and Europe is estimated to be 5-40 per 100,000 persons and accounts for 3-4 % of liver transplants performed in the US. The only approved medical therapy of PBC is the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Multiple studies suggest that UDCA delays progression of the disease, particularly those that have a biochemical response which has defined by multiple criteria, the simplest being a decrease of the alkaline phosphatase to 1.67 times the upper limit of normal. However, 20-40% of PBC patients have an incomplete response to UDCA and remain at significant risk of disease progression leading to death or liver transplantation. PBC is characterized by a 90% female predominance, high titers of serum anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA) directed against the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 subunit and elevated plasma levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, evidence from both human and murine models suggests that T-cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, are key to the destruction of bile ducts. Genetic evidence of a T-cell defect is also supported by our findings and those of others demonstrating significant associations between CTLA-4 polymorphisms and PBC. Most notable, are the results we recently published in our murine model of PBC in which both AMA and biliary inflammation are induced by immunization with the xenobiotic 2-octynoic acid (2-OA). CTLA-4 Ig treatment one day before 2-OA immunization, completely inhibited AMA production, intra-hepatic T cell infiltrates, and bile duct damage. More critically, treatment with CTLA-4 Ig initiated after the 2-OA immunization and development of disease, also resulted in reduced intra-hepatic T cell infiltrates and biliary cell damage, although AMA levels were not altered.  a) Pathology of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Three important observations must be taken into account for us to understand the pathogenic basis of PBC. First, appearance of AMAs before liver disease suggests that loss of tolerance to the mitochondrial autoantigen is an early event and could be independent of the development of liver disease. Second, although the autoantigen is present ubiquitously in all nucleated cells, the immune response is restricted to epithelial cells of intrahepatic bile ducts and, to a lesser degree, to cells of salivary and lacrimal glands. Finally, recurrence of PBC after liver transplantation supports the idea that the bile duct epithelial cell is a generic target and is not unique to the patient with PBC. Similar to other complex diseases, the combination of a susceptible genetic background and exposure to environmental triggers are needed to initiate and promote the disorder. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: ABATACEPT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH AN INCOMPLETE BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID  
 Page 3 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 Observations that 1–6% of individuals with PBC have at least one family member manifesting disease and a 63% concordance rate in monozygotic twins (vs null concordance in dizygotic sets), show the substantial genetic effect on disease susceptibility, one of the strongest for any autoimmune disorder. Many candidate genes have been investigated for a role in susceptibility to PBC, disease progression, or both in case-control cross-sectional studies. Findings of a genome-wide association study undertaken in a northern American set of patients and controls indicated a significant association between PBC and polymorphisms of HLA-DQB1, IL12A, IL12RB2, and to a minor extent, STAT4, and these associations have been confirmed in an independent cohort of Italian patients and controls with a combined analysis.  Several environmental factors—mainly infectious and chemical—are also thought to contribute to the onset of PBC, largely through molecular mimicry or modification of autoantigens. Geographic clustering of cases near toxic waste sites in New York City and space-time clustering in northeast England provide epidemiological evidence for a role of chemicals, infectious agents, or both. Additional data that lend support to a role for infections in disease development include the significantly higher prevalence than usual of recurrent urinary-tract infections in patients with PBC and experimental findings of sequence similarity between the E2 enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex recognized by autoantibodies and bacterial proteins. Several bacterial strains—including the non-pathogenic gram-negative bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans—have the highest known homology to the immunodominant autoepitope of the E2 enzyme. Several other infectious agents have been proposed, including Escherichia coli, Helicobacter spp, organisms of the genus Mycoplasma, and a human β retrovirus, although support for the retrovirus has not been substantiated.  Other environmental factors proposed to trigger disease onset are foreign chemicals (ie, xenobiotics) that can either alter or form a complex with a defined self or non-self protein, causing a change in the protein's molecular structure that induces an immune response. Lipoic acid is attached to only a few proteins, yet it is a vital component of the E2 epitope. The structure of the E2 enzyme exposes lipoic acid at the exterior of the protein complex, making this compound accessible to chemical modification. The role of xenobiotics in PBC is supported by serum reactivity against specific organic compounds with structures similar to lipoic acid; furthermore, two of these compounds (6-bromohexanoate and 2-octynoic acid) can induce AMAs and liver lesions similar to those of PBC in guinea pigs and mouse models.  AMAs in serum are highly sensitive and specific for PBC: they are detected in nearly 95% of patients, with specificity close to 100% when tested with recombinant antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence remains the test used for screening, but it can be associated with a substantial number of false-positive results. Follow-up data from AMA-positive individuals without signs of liver disease suggest that autoantibodies arise several years before onset of PBC and have a high predictive value. Epitopes recognized by AMAs 
PROTOCOL TITLE: ABATACEPT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH AN INCOMPLETE BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID  
 Page 4 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 include lipoylated domains (via the Asx-Lys-Ala motif) within subunits of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase family of enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in particular, E2 subunit and E3 binding-protein components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and E2 components of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes.   b) Role of T cells in Primary Biliary Cirrhosis In addition to AMAs, autoreactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex have been identified both in peripheral blood and within the liver of patients with PBC, and the immunodominant epitope of these T cells maps in close proximity to the epitope recognized by AMAs in serum. Autoreactive CD4+ cell clones specific for the E2 enzyme have been isolated in intrahepatic and peripheral lymphocytes, not only in AMA-positive individuals but also in patients without antibodies, thus corroborating the notion that PBC either positive or negative for AMAs is one nosological entity.  CD4+ CD25high regulatory T cells act to prevent autoreactivity, as shown in several autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with PBC are characterized by substantially lower frequencies of CD4+ CD25high regulatory T cells as proportions of total T-cell receptor-αβ+/CD4+ cells, and this factor could be important in the breakdown of tolerance.   c) Summary of Results of Investigational Program Pharmacology of Abatacept Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA4 and a fragment (hinge- CH2-CH3 domains) of the Fc domain of human IgG1 that has been modified to prevent complement fixation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Abatacept is the first drug in a new class of agents termed “selective costimulation modulators.” Abatacept binds specifically to the CD80 and CD86 molecules, proteins prominently displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Activation of naive T cells during an immune response requires two stimuli from APCs. The first signal is antigen-specific; antigens are presented by APCs, with the signal transmitted to the T cell through the T cell’s antigen receptor. The second, or costimulatory, signal is not antigen-specific and is delivered following the engagement of a costimulatory ligand on the APC with a cognate receptor on the T cell. A key costimulatory receptor on T cells is CD28. CD28 is constitutively expressed on resting T cells and binds to both CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on the APC. A 
PROTOCOL TITLE: ABATACEPT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH AN INCOMPLETE BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID  
 Page 5 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 costimulatory signal is required not only for the full activation of naive T cells, but also may be required for the survival of memory and autoimmune effector cells. At 24 to 48 hours following T cell activation, the T cell expresses CTLA4 on its surface, which engages the CD80 and CD86 molecules on the APC surface interfering with CD28’s ability to bind to its ligands on the APC; CD80 and CD86 preferentially bind to CTLA4 with a much higher avidity than with CD28. Although the precise mechanisms are as yet unclear, CTLA4 expression is associated with a decrease in T cell activation. After the T cell activity has been dampened, the CTLA4 recycles into the T cell’s cytoplasm. The CTLA4 section of abatacept binds specifically to CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and B7-2, respectively) and down-modulates the CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells. Thus, abatacept uses a segment of a molecule that is part of the normal immune homeostatic mechanism to suppress T cell activity involved in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The FC region of abatacept was engineered with several point mutations designed to inactivate it. Because of these changes, abatacept does not mediate pathways such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  Study Rationale This is an open label, single center, active treatment study of the effects of abatacept on PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA. These patients have been demonstrated to have increased morbidity and mortality with standard-of-care treatment. An abundance of human and pre-clinical data suggests that T cell activation is central to the immune-mediated destruction of biliary epithelial cells and that abatacept may be effective in halting this process.   6) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria 1.

 Page 13 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015  From the ICF: The clinical study will be done only at UC Davis. The name and address of this study center and the investigator for this study center are listed on page 1 of this document. Authorized members of the study staff will do all study procedures. An initial examination called “Screening” will help decide if you can take part in the clinical study. This will include a full physical examination including body weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature. You will also have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity of your heart. This involves placing several sticky pads on your arms, legs and chest, on your bare skin. These pads are attached to a machine that will measure your heart’s electrical activity. Also, your medical history and details of your illness will be recorded.  If you take part in the clinical study, your treatment will begin within 28 days of the first examination. The study is expected to last up to 36 weeks, during which time you will make 7 planned visits to the study center. Visits will be scheduled approximately once every 2 to 4 weeks.  You will be given enough of the study medication to last between visits. Each week, you will be asked to administer a subcutaneous injection (a shot just under the skin) of 125mg of Abatacept. The study team will teach you how to administer this shot yourself. Blood will be collected. Some blood samples must be taken when you are in a fasting state (overnight fast, only water is allowed). Over the course of the study, a total of approximately 244 mL (about 8.25 ounces) of blood will be collected. As a comparison, 450 to 500 mL of blood is taken at a typical blood donation. During 2 of the 7 scheduled visits, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) will be performed. This test involves placing a small vibrating pad on your abdomen, over the area of your liver. The vibrations into your abdomen will help the study doctor to determine the stiffness of your liver.  Before entering the study, you must tell the investigator about any medications that you are taking or have taken during the last 12 months. You will also need to tell the investigator about all medications (other than study drug) that you take during the study. You may not take any new medications to treat PBC during the study or change the dose of any medications you are allowed to take. You should inform your general practitioner (family doctor) if you take part in this clinical study. Your general practitioner should not change your dosage of study medication, except in cases of emergency. The study investigator must be told about any medication prescribed by your general practitioner or other physicians during this study. Participation in other clinical studies within the last 30 days and during the course of this study is not allowed. You will be expected to fast (only water is allowed) overnight before some of the blood samples are collected.

 Page 14 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 It is very important that women of childbearing age avoid pregnancy during the study. All sexually active women who take part in the study must use a reliable form of birth control. A pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and at the visits during Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 12 and 24 of the study. If you become pregnant during the study, inform the study center immediately. 13) Data and Specimen Banking n/a. 14) Data Management and Confidentiality STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether abatacept is effective in inducing a biochemical response in PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA. The secondary objectives of this study are: • To assess the safety of abatacept in patients with PBC • To assess effect of abatacept on liver stiffness as a measure of liver fibrosis in patients with PBC • To determine the effects of abatacept on immunologic markers of PBC • To assess the impact of abatacept on the quality of life in patients with PBC • To characterize pharmacokineticsPKof abatacept 125mg administrated SC weekly in patients with PBC  • To assess immunogenicity of abatacept 125mg administered SC weekly in patients with PBC  Sample Size Determination Among patients with PBC who do not have a complete biochemical response to UDCA, the probability of achieving serum liver biochemical normalization spontaneously is <5%. If abatacept is found to be ineffective among 20 enrolled subjects, the probability of observing 3 or fewer treatment responses is >98%. If abatacept is associated with a treatment success response rate of 30% or more, then the probability of 4 or more individuals responding is 89%. If these endpoints were met, pursuit of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial would then be justified. Populations for Analyses The primary analysis set for efficacy and safety analyses will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.

 Page 16 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 (or Fisher’s exact test) for categorical variables. For variables measured at multiple time points, Repeated Measures ANOVA will be employed. All analyses will be two-tailed and P values less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. The primary endpoint assessment will be the biochemical response rate defined by normalization of alkaline phosphatase or decrease of alkaline phosphatase by > 40% of the Day 0 level at 24 weeks of treatment. We will report the observed biochemical response rate and a 95% confidence interval for the expected biochemical response rate. We will assess each of the secondary endpoints:  absolute and percent change in alkaline phosphatase, absolute and percent change in alanine transferase (ALT), change in liver stiffness as measured by magnetic resonance elastography, change in quality of life measured by change in PBC-40, change in AMA titer, change in IgM level, and change in CD4+CD44+CD62L- and CD8+CD44+CD62L- frequencies in PBMC from Day 0 to week 24 by paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test when appropriate.  Because these endpoints will be generated with these studies, to solve the problem of the above multiple significance testing, we will use the false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. In addition, PK and immunogenicity of abatacept in patients with PBC will be estimated. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize safety data to allow a comparison between pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment. Safety data, including AEs, clinical and laboratory observations and physical examination findings, and other safety related outcomes will be summarized. Summary tables of treatment-emergent AEs will be provided. A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study medication.  AEs will be included in the treatment-emergent analysis if the onset date is on or after the first day of dosing and up to 56 days post the last dosing day. The incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group, and by severity and relationship to treatment. Tables of TEAEs leading to study medication discontinuation and SAEs will be provided. Descriptive statistics summarizing laboratory data (hematology and chemistry) will be presented for all trial visits. Changes from pretreatment to each trial visit will also be summarized. Additional safety assessments include vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs. For safety assessments pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment including adverse events, laboratory observations, and physical exam findings, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be employed to analyze a continuous outcome variable measured at these multiple time points, and a generalized estimating equation will be used to analyze a count or binary outcome variable measured at these multiple time points in order to take into account a possible unknown correlation among outcomes obtained on the same patient.

 Page 17 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 Clinical outcomes will be assessed including death from hepatic and non-hepatic causes, liver transplantation or placement on a liver transplant list, MELD score ≥ 15, new complications of liver disease including DILI as defined above, esophageal variceal bleeding, interventions to manage variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Summary statistics for abatacept concentrations from Week 0 to Week 24 will be tabulated. Lack of immunogenicity is defined as the absence of a positive antibody response generated against abatacept administered subcutaneously. The incidence of a positive response will be summarized. The data will be analyzed to assess immunogenicity and its potential effect on pharmacokinetics and safety. Procedures for maintenance of confidentiality: • All data and specimens will be stored on password protected computers in locked offices and in monitored freezers/refrigerators • The data will only be stored for the duration of the study and then destroyed. • Only authorized research personnel will have access to the data and/or specimens. • Ultimately the PI is responsible for the transmission of data and specimens, but this duty will likely be delegated to a qualified study coordinator. 15) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects Data Monitoring Committee An independent multidisciplinary Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the progress of the study and perform interim data reviews in order to protect subject welfare and preserve study integrity. The first DMC review will be conducted after the first 5 subjects enrolled complete through week 24. The DMC will subsequently meet after every 5 subjects complete 24 weeks of treatment and finally after the last subject enrolled completes through week 32. In addition, the DMC will receive every Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the trial in real time and monthly listings of all Adverse Events (AEs) reported. The DMC members can request an ad hoc meeting based on their review of these safety events. Finally, if a minimum of 2 subjects in the trial either experience the same treatment-emergent Grade 3 AE or if any one subject experiences a Grade 4 or 5 AE by the MedDRA grading system, this will trigger an ad hoc meeting of the DMC to review the safety of continuing the trial. The DMC will provide recommendations as needed regarding study design and conduct. The DMC has the authority to terminate the trial early if they determine that continuing the trial puts the subjects in the trial at undue risk.

 Page 18 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 16) Withdrawal of Subjects Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and noninvestigational product at the discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons: • Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason). • Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject. • Pregnancy - Instruct WOCBP to contact the investigator or study staff immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation. Institutional policy and local regulations should determine the frequency of on-study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in the study. - The investigator must immediately notify BMS if a study subject becomes pregnant. • Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. All subjects who discontinue should comply with protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). If a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal must be documented appropriately.  17) Risks to Subjects From the ICF: You may have unwanted effects and symptoms as a result of taking Abatacept.

 Page 22 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 It is not known if the study medication could cause harm to a breast-feeding infant if passed through the breast milk. For this reason, breast-feeding women are not allowed to take part in this study. It is also not known if the medication can be passed through sperm and cause injury or harm to a/during pregnancy. Therefore, it is advised that female partners of male study participants do not become pregnant during the treatment phase of this study and use effective forms of birth control. Subcutaneous Injections: Subcutaneous injections may be slightly painful, cause bruising or, rarely, and infection.  Blood Drawing:  Blood drawing is mildly painful and can cause bruising and, very rarely, fainting, blood clots or an infection at the site.  Electrocardiogram (ECG): There is no pain or discomfort during an ECG; however, removing the pads may cause some irritation to your skin.  Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE): Magnetic resonance imaging uses a strong magnetic field, which is not harmful in itself, but implanted medical devices that contain metal may malfunction or cause problems during an MR exam.  If you have any implanted devices please inform the doctors before the procedure.   HIV Testing: Being tested for HIV may cause anxiety regardless of the test results. A positive test indicates that you have been infected with the HIV virus, but no one knows for certain when, if ever, you will become sick with AIDS or a related condition. Receiving positive results may make you very upset. If other people learn about your positive test results, you may have trouble obtaining insurance or employment. If your test is negative, there is still the possibility that you could be infected with the HIV virus and test positive at some time in the future. Also, it is always possible that the test results could be wrong.  Privacy Risks: There may also be risks to your privacy.  The Researchers will store study records and other information about you in a secure location and will grant access only to those with a need to know.  However, just like with other personal information kept by your health

DEVELOPMENT 
PHASE  Phase 2/3   
PROTOCOL TITLE  A Randomized Trial in 2 Parts: Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Crossover Part 1 and 
Open -label Part 2, Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Dasiglucagon for the 
Treatment of Children with Congenital Hyperinsulinism  
INDICATION  Congenital hyperinsulinism ( CHI)  
OBJECTIVES  Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of dasiglucagon in reducing glucose requirements in 
children with persistent CHI requiring continuous IV glucose administration to 
prevent/manage hypoglycemia.  
Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasiglucagon administered as a 
subcutaneous (SC) infusion in patients with CHI.  
TRIAL DESIGN  This is a combined phase 2 and 3, randomized, multinational trial to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of individually titrated dasiglucagon in chi ldren ≥7 days and <1  year 
of age who have been diagnosed with CHI, comprising 2 parts, a crossover (2 periods, 
48 hours each), double -blind, placebo -controlled Part 1, and an open -label, single -arm 
Part 2 of 21 days.  
After screening, eligible patients will complete a minimum 24 -hour run -in period to 
confirm the IV glucose randomization requirement (≥10 mg/kg/min). All 
non-nutritional carbohydrates and carbohydrate fortification of feeds are prohibited 
during this 24 -hour run -in period. After th e run -in period, patients will be randomly 
assigned in a double -blind fashion to receive dasiglucagon or placebo for 48 hours, after 
which they will be crossed over to the other trial treatment for an additional 48 hours. At 
the time of crossover, the trial drug will be initiated from the starting dose of 10  µg/hr, 
and IV  glucose infusion rate ( GIR) will be set to the rate obtained at the end of the run -
in period and titrated accordingly.  
There will be no washout between the 2 periods in Part 1 to limit th e length of time in 
which patients are reliant on IV GIR as their only means of preventing/treating 
hypoglycemia. This is deemed acceptable because:  
• The half -life (t ½) of dasiglucagon is short (~30 minutes for the 0.6 mg dose and 
potentially shorter for lo wer doses, ~22 minutes) relative to the 48 -hour duration of 
each crossover period. Moreover, for the primary endpoint, only the last 12 hours of 
the 48 -hour period will be used for endpoint assessment.  
• Assuming a positive effect of dasiglucagon, the absen ce of washout is more 
conservative with respect to key secondary endpoints since a potential carry over 
effect of dasiglucagon in Period 2 is attributed to placebo.  
During Part 1, the trial drug and IV GIR should be adjusted according to the 
protocol -specified algorithm. Non -nutritional carbohydrates and/or carbohydrate 
fortification of feeds during Part 1 is only allowed when the maximum tolerable volume 
and concentration of IV glucose for the patient is reached, and should be limited to the 
minimum neede d to ensure the patient’s safety. All feedings (administered as parenteral 
nutrition, by nasogastric [NG] tube, gastrostomy, or normal route), will be recorded 
during this period. Safety assessments will be performed daily after initiation of the trial 
drug (active or placebo).

After Part 1, patients will continue in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for 
21 days. Additional CHI treatments can be introduced during Part 2 if needed, if 
up-titration of dasiglucagon is not possible because of undesirab le side effects or if the 
maximum dose level (70 µg/hr) has been reached. Gradual transfer from IV glucose to 
oral and gastric carbohydrates should be initiated in Part 2, enabling weaning of IV 
glucose and hospital discharge. Patients will continue to be hospitalized until IV GIR is 
weaned off; however, as soon as local site criteria for discharge are met, patients can be 
discharged to continue the treatment period at home. Visits are planned at Day 11 and 
Day 18 in Part 2. These visits can be converted to  telephone visits if appropriate, at the 
investigator’s discretion. On Day 25, the End of Treatment Visit will take place, and 
based on the investigator’s confirmation of continued positive benefit -risk balance, 
patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the long -term extension trial 
(Trial ZP4207 -17106) to continue dasiglucagon treatment. Patients who do not enter the 
long-term extension trial will have a Follow -up Visit 28  days after their last dose of trial 
drug.  
PLANNED 
NUMBER OF 
PATIEN TS A total of 12 patients is planned to be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo first and 
then dasiglucagon or vice versa.  
TRIAL ENTRY 
CRITERIA  Eligible patients will be ≥7 days and <12 months of age at screening with a body weight 
of ≥2.0 kg (4.4 lbs .) and a diagnosis of CHI established based on the following:  
• Hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin above the limit of detection of the assay 
documented during an event of hypoglycemia), and/or  
• Hypofattyacidemia (plasma free fatty acid <1.7 mmol/L), and/or  
• Hypoketonemia (beta -hydroxy -butyrate <1.8 mmol/L), and/or  
• Glyce mic response (increase in plasma glucose [PG] of >30 mg/dL after 1  mg IV 
or intramuscular [IM] glucagon administration)  
Eligible patients will be dependent on c ontinuous IV glucose to prevent hypoglycemia . 
INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCTS  Dasiglucagon injection 4  mg/mL in a 3 mL vial containing 1 mL for injection.  
Matching placebo for dasiglucagon injection in a 3 mL vial containing 1  mL for 
injection.  
REFERENCE 
PRODUCT  None  
TREATMENT 
REGIMENS  As long as the patient is receiving IV glucose, PG will be measured and reviewed 
hourly using a hand -held PG meter. The IV GIR will be titrated to achieve glycemia of 
at least 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (minimum GIR will be established as the rate up -titrated 
after the patient drops at least once below 70 mg/dL, or 3.9 mmol/L). When the patient 
is no longer on IV GIR, the PG will be checked according to local practice, but at least 
3 times daily. The PG will be measured using the same trial -supplied hand -held PG 
meter during the entire trial.  
Additionally, blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be started 24  hours 
prior to randomization using either the Dexcom G4  or G6 (all countries except 
Germany) , or Dexcom G6 system  (Germany ). CGM monitoring will  continue until the 
end of Part  2. 
Dosing of trial drug  
Dosing of dasiglucagon will approximate continuous infusion by delivering small doses 
at frequent intervals via a trial -supplied infusion pump. The adjustment of trial drug 
dosing is cl osely linked to the PG level achieved, which in turn will determine the 
adjustments to the IV GIR.

 Part 1 (Crossover, double -blind, randomized, placebo controlled)  
The starting dose of trial drug is 10 µg/hr at t=0. Every 2 hours (t=2, 4, 6h, etc.), the 
dose will be increased by an additional 10 µg/hr until either:  
• The patient is totally weaned off IV glucose, or  
• PG during the last 2 hours was constantly above 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L), or  
• IV GIR has not decreased despite 2 sequential dose increas es (in this situation the 
dose of trial drug product should be maintained until the IV GIR can be further 
decreased or until crossover or the end of the treatment period), or  
• The maximum dose of 70 µg/hr is reached, or  
• Adverse events (AEs) emerge that are considered to be related to the trial drug 
(e.g., nausea/change in feeding patterns or increased vomiting) and that are limiting 
further dose escalation  
The 2 -hour dose -adjustment interval will allow drug plasma levels to approach steady 
state before the dose is further increased.  
The cumulative dose will not exceed 1.26 mg over the first 24 hours and 1.68  mg for the 
subsequent 24 -hour periods.  
At the time of crossover from the first 48 -hour period to the second 48 -hour period, the 
trial drug  will again be titrated from the starting dose of 10 µg/hr, and IV GIR will be 
set to the rate obtained at the end of the run -in period and titrated accordin gly. 
 Part 2 (Open -label)  
After Part 1, all patients will continue in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for 
an additional 21 days. Since treatment allocation during Part 1 remains blinded, all 
patients are required to initiate dasiglucagon dosing at 10 µg/hr in Part 2, while IV GIR 
in Part 2 should be started at the rate obtained at the end of the run -in period. During 
Part 2, the dasiglucagon dose, the amount and route of administration of carbohydrates 
(IV GIR, parenteral nutrition, gastric carbo hydrate infusions, and carbohydrates from 
oral feeds) can be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator. Plasma glucose should 
be monitored at least hourly to adjust the IV GIR as appropriate and to avoid 
hypoglycemia. Additional concomitant medication s, including somatostatin analogs 
and/or sirolimus/ mechanistic target of rapamycin  (mTOR ) inhibitors, may be introduced 
at the investigator’s discretion if the maximum dose level of dasiglucagon (70 µg/hr) 
has been reached or if further up -titration is not  possible due to undesirable side effects.  
Adjustment of total carbohydrates administered (IV glucose, parenteral nutrition, gastric 
carbohydrate infusions, and carbohydrates from oral feeds) should continue throughout 
this period according to local practi ce to maintain PG levels in the range of 70  mg/dL to 
120 mg/dL (3.9 -6.7 mmol/L). The aim will be to obtain stable glucose levels with 
minimum rescue/hypoglycemia -prevention carbohydrates administered by invasive 
routes and to encourage/optimize oral feeds,  and achieve weaning off IV glucose. 
Regardless of their discharge status, all patients will be offered the opportunity to 
participate in the long -term safety extension trial (ZP4207 -17106), providing the 
investigator attests to the positive benefit -risk b alance of continued dasiglucagon 
treatment.

ENDPOINTS  Primary endpoint  
Part 1 (Day 1 to 4)  
• Mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period during Part  1 
(dasiglucagon or placebo administration)  
Key secondary endpoint  
Part 1 (Day 1 to 4, for each 48 -hour treatment period)  
• Total amount  (g) of carbohydrates administered (regardless of the  route) per day.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Continuous endpoints will be summa rized with number (n), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will 
be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively; the exception to this is 
the time of PG within prespecified ran ges, which will not have a baseline value. For 
categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
All data will be presented in the data listings.  
Analysis Populations  
Four  analysis populations have been defined for this trial:  
Safety analysis set: defined as all patients administered any randomized treatment.  
Full analysis set (FAS): defined as all patients in the Safety Set who have a valid 
baseline efficacy assessment. Patients will be analyzed according to randomized 
treatment (Part 1) or overall patients (otherwise).  
Per protocol (PP) set: defined as all patients in the FAS without any major protocol 
deviations. Patients will be excluded from the PP set if they do not receive both 
treatments and/or do not have efficac y data available to evaluate the primary endpoint 
for both treatments.  
Pharmacokinetic Set (PK): defined as all patients in the Safety Set who have at least 1 
measurement with quantifiable plasma concentration of dasiglucagon.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primar y analyses of the primary and the key secondary endpoint will be based on 
the FAS. Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint will be based on the PP.  
Primary Endpoint  
Part 1, Day 1 to 4  
The mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period will b e calculated as a 
weighted mean across the 12 hours, taking the actual time periods between the 
measurements into account (corresponding to calculating the area under the curve 
(AUC) and dividing it by the length of the time period , i.e., weighted mean IV GIR). 
The IV GIR endpoint is expressed as glucose in mg/kg/min, i.e., data reported from 
different concentrations of the glucose used for infusion will be transformed to this 
standardized unit prior to analysis.  
The primary analysis is defined by the estim and based on the treatment policy (de -facto) 
strategy, where the actual GIR measurement reported irrespective of adherence to 
treatment or use of subsequent therapy is used. The reduction in weighted mean IV GIR, 
as determined as the difference in weighted  mean IV GIR between placebo and 
dasiglucagon, will be estimated.  
The weighted  mean IV GIR will be analyzed using a mixed -model  regression approach, 
with treatment  and period  as fixed effects  and patient as a random  effect. The 2 -sided 
95% confidence inter val (CI) for the treatment difference will be calculated from the 
mixed  regression model.  
Handling of missing data and s ensitivity analyses are defined in the body of the 
protocol.

Key Secondary Endpoints  
Part 1, Day 1 to 4  
The key secondary endpoint of t otal amount of gastric carbohydrates administered will 
be analyzed by using a mixed -model  regression approach, with treatment  and period  as 
fixed effects  and patient as a random  effect.  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse events that begin after the first dose of trial 
drug will be defined as treatment emergent. The overall incidence of AEs will be 
displayed by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment. The incidence of AEs 
will also be presented by severity and by relationship to the trial drug. Vital signs, 
clinical laboratory measures (including hematology, biochemistry, and incidence of 
anti-drug antibodies [ADAs]), 12 -lead electrocardi ograms (ECGs), echocardiography, 
physical examinations, and local tolerability data will be summarized by treatment, 
where applicable. Out -of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, 
where applicable.  
Safety results will be summarized by t reatment received within treatment period and 
part and by trial visit, if applicable.  
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared to provide further details on 
the methods for statistical analysis.  
No interim analysis is planned.  
SAMPLE SIZ E 
DETERMINATION  A total of 12 patients will be randomized in this crossover trial on the basis of the 
following considerations:  
The GIR results from 40 infants treated with IV glucagon for 24 hours published in the 
JIMD Research Report “The Effect of Conti nuous Intravenous Glucagon on Glucose 
Requirements in Infants with Congenital Hyperinsulinism” (Hawkes et al 2019).  
“Overall there was a statistically significant reduction in the median (IQR) GIR during 
the 24h following initiation of continuous glucagon infusion compared to 24 h before 
initiation (18.5  (12.9, 22.8) to 11 (6.6, 17.5) mg/kg/min…”  
This trial is powered to detect an effect in GIR for dasiglucagon after 48  hours 
compared to placebo of at least this effect size. Based on the longer infusion and  
titration of dasiglucagon in this trial, this is considered a conservative approach, 
allowing for some uncertainty when translating the published data into a clinical trial 
setting. Using unpublished individual patient data from the above -referenced study , the 
difference in GIR between the 2 treatment groups is assumed to follow a normal 
distribution. Assuming the true mean difference is 7.5 mg/kg/min with a standard 
deviation of differences of 7.36, the trial will have 89% power using a one -sample t -test 
with 12  patients randomized to receive either placebo first and then dasiglucagon or 
vice versa.  
TRIAL AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION  The sequence and maximum duration of the trial periods will be as follows:  
1. Screening Period: up to 28 days, including a minimum 24 -hour run -in period  
2. Part 1 (2x48 -hour period: double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled): 96 hours  
3. Part 2 (Open -label Active Treatment Period): 21 days  
4. Follow -up Period: Patients who do not enter the extension trial will have a 
Follow -up Visit  28 days after their last dose of trial drug  
The maximum trial duration for each patient is 81 days.  
The maximum treatment duration for each patient is 25 days.

6. INTRODUCTION  
6.1. Background and Rationale  
Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare and challenging disorder in which β -cells in the 
pancreas secrete insulin irrespective of plasma glucose (PG) concentration, resulting in persistent 
and often severe hypoglycemia.1 Congenital hyperinsulinism affects up to 1 in 50,000  newborns. 
It is typically diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during the neonatal 
period or in infancy; however, the diagnosis may be made later in c hildhood. Mutations in 
several different β -cell genes have been described to cause CHI. Hypoglycemia that results from 
CHI is of particular concern because it is an important cause of brain injury in neonates, infants, 
and children with this disease, which  leads to long -term neurological impairments.1,2 Up to 
approximately 50% of children with CHI experience neurodevelopmental abnormalities caused 
by severe hypoglycemia that results from inadequate treatment and/or delays in diagnosis.1,3 
Severe brain damage is the consequence of severe hypoglycemia, which presents as coma and/or 
long-lasting epileptic seizures in neonates. Major intellectual disability is, therefore, most 
frequent in patients with neonatal initial onset, whereas hypoglycemia is usually less severe and 
brain damage less frequent in children with CHI diagnosed later in childhood.1 Since symptoms 
and severity of hypoglycemia can vary and pose a diagnostic challenge in neonates, infants, and 
children with CHI, prompt recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia is critical to reduce the 
risk of long -term neurological consequences.  
6.2. Current Treatment and Unmet Medical Need  
Medical treatment for CHI is focused on chronic therapies to avoid hypoglycemia, as well as on 
rescue therapy during acute episodes of severe hypoglycemia. Available medical therapies 
(mainly diazoxide, octreotide, or glucagon alone or in combination with glucose infusion) are 
often inadequate and accompanied by inability to control PG, as reflected in a large proportion of 
patients requiring sub -total pancre atectomy.4,5,6 With the exception of surgery for focal CHI, 
which is curative in the vast majority of patients, sub -total pancreatectomy for diffuse CHI has 
substantial inadequacies. A rec ent retrospective chart review7 showed that 60% of patients who 
underwent near -total pancreatectomy had persistent hypoglycemia after surgery. More over, 
96% had developed insulin -dependent diabetes within 11 years after surgery.  
First-line medical treatment of CHI is diazoxide, which is the only EU - and US -approved drug 
for treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Diazoxide acts to open K ATP chann els of the 
pancreatic β -cells, thereby inhibiting insulin secretion. Unfortunately, many patients with CHI 
are resistant to diazoxide because of mutations in the genes encoding the K ATP channel of the 
pancreatic β -cells.6 For those who respond to diazoxide treatment, the more common side effects 
comprise hypertrichosis, fluid retention, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms; however, side 
effects are usually not severe. In diazoxide nonresponders, second -line (and off -label) treatment 
is a somatostatin analog (octreotide or lanreotide [long acting]), which (among other effects) 
inhibits secretion of insulin and glucagon from the pancreas and suppresses GLP -1 secretion. 
Factors that limit their use comprise tachyphylaxis, as we ll as possible side effects, including 
necrotizing enterocolitis, gallstones, and hepatitis.6 
The glycogenolytic effect of glucagon and its ability  to increase PG levels has been confirmed in 
children with CHI or neonatal hypoglycemia .8,9 Administration of marketed glucagon 
(intravenous [IV] or subcutaneous [SC] injection) is often used in the diagnostic phase of CHI to

stabilize patients before surgery or initiation of other medical trea tments.10 In a retrospective 
review of 55  neonates with resistant hypoglycemia, native glucagon IV infusion achieved a 
median rise in plasma glucos e of 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) after an hour of administration, 
regardless of the underlying cause for the persistent neonatal hypoglycemia.9 Furthermore, 
glucagon is administered as single SC doses to treat severe hypoglycemic episodes. While IV 
administration of glucagon to patients with CHI is used short -term in the hospital set ting, 
e.g., before pancreatectomy,2,10,11 long-term glucagon treatment is challenging since currently 
available glucagon products are unstable and form fibrils within hours after recons titution.12 
Catheter obstruction and occlusion because of glucagon instability were observed daily to 2 to 
3 times weekly in a retrospective review  of 9 patients with CHI receiving continuous SC infusion 
of glucagon for weeks or months.11 In another series of patients, 60% of the patients treated with 
short -term SC glucagon experienced catheter occlusion.6 Instability of currently av ailable 
glucagon products and the associated risk of dosing errors contributing to hypoglycemic events 
is a major barrier for using glucagon for long -term treatment of patients with CHI.  
When successfully administered,  long-term home treatment with subcut aneously infused 
glucagon over extended periods (years) has been beneficial,  with a potentially good safety profile 
as compared to diazoxide and octreotide.6,11,13 
6.3. Dasiglucagon for the Treatment of Congenital Hyperinsulinism  
6.3.1.  Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon is a peptide analog of human glucagon in development for the treatment and 
prevention of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus and CHI via SC or intramuscular 
(IM) administration. Dasiglucagon is a stable analog of glucagon that has been specifically 
designed to overcome the issues with fibril formation and instability in solution observed with 
marketed glucagon products. Compared to native human glucagon, dasiglucagon also comprise s 
29 amino acids.  As a result of chemical modifications (7  amino acid substitutions compared to 
human glucagon), the pronounced tendency of glucagon to form fibrils and aggregate has been 
effectively prevented in dasiglucagon. In addition, the chemical stability in aqueous media at 
physiological pH has been improved.  
To support the use of dasiglucagon in the pump  for this trial , compatibility/in -use studies have 
been performed with dasiglucagon 4 mg/mL in Roche Accu -Chek® Combo pump using the 
Accu -Chek® Spirit 3.15  mL cartr idge system and the Accu -Chek® FlexLink infusion set. The 
studies support an in -use time for up to 6 days at 37ºC.  
Dasiglucagon has been granted orphan drug designation by the European Commission on 
20 June 2017 for the ‘ treatment of congenital hyperinsuli nism .’ Furthermore, the FDA granted 
an orphan drug designation for the ‘ treatment of hypoglycemia in patients with congenital 
hyperinsulinism (CHI) ’ on 10 August 2017.

6.3.2.  Nonclinical Experience  
The completed nonclinical pharmacology program has determined tha t dasiglucagon is a specific 
glucagon receptor agonist with comparable in vitro potency to glucagon, promoting a rapid onset 
of PG increase in both normoglycemic  and insulin -induced hypoglycemic animals, similar to that 
of glucagon.  
Results of the toxicity  studies with dasiglucagon are comparable to what has been reported for 
glucagon. Those from chronic toxicity studies with dasiglucagon in rats and dogs are in line with 
the results of short -term toxicity studies, indicating that long -term treatment with d asiglucagon is 
safe and that the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects noted do not adversely affect organ function 
following chronic use.  
6.3.3.  Clinical Experience  
Dasiglucagon is being developed to manage patients with CHI 1) as an initial short -term therapy 
to stabili ze PG levels and reduce glucose infusion needs, and 2) as a long -term treatment to help 
maintain euglycemia. Dasiglucagon has not previously been studied in patients with CHI. 
Clinical experience with dasiglucagon comes from the following studies in health y subjects and 
type 1 diabetics.  
The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and PD characteristics of dasiglucagon were 
investigated in 2 phase  1 trials , 3 phase  2 trials , and 2 phase 3 trials .  
ZP4207 -14013 was a phase 1 randomized, double -blind, 2 -part, single -dose trial designed to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics, PD, safety, and tolerability of dasiglucagon compared to 
GlucaGen®. Part  1 consisted of SC and IM administration of single ascending doses of 
dasiglucagon in 64 adult healthy volunteers. Par t 2 consisted of 20 adult patients with type  1 
diabetes using a crossover design with IM administration of 0.7 mg  dasiglucagon. 
GlucaGen  1.0 mg was used as a comparator in both parts of the trial.  
ZP4207 -15007 was a phase 1 randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, multiple -dose trial 
designed to evaluate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of repeated doses of dasiglucagon SC in 
24 healthy adult volunteers. The trial included 3 dose cohorts of 8  healthy volunteers each. In 
each cohort, patients were r andomly assigned in a 3:1  ratio to receive 5 repeated daily doses of 
0.1, 0.3, and 1.0  mg dasiglucagon (n=6) or placebo (n=2).  
After the 2  phase 1 trials were completed, the composition of the dasiglucagon formulation was 
optimized with respect to its exci pients (buffer, tonicity adjusting agent, and stabilizer). The PK 
and PD properties, safety, and tolerability of the optimized formulation were evaluated in the 
phase  2 trial s. 
ZP4207 -15126 was a phase  2 randomized, double -blind, single -dose trial designed  to evaluate 
the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of a single SC dose of dasiglucagon in the optimized 
formulation (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg) or GlucaGen (0.5 and 1.0 mg) in 58 adult patients with 
type 1 diabetes.  
ZP4207 -16051 was a phase 2 open -label, ra ndomized, crossover trial designed to evaluate the 
feasibility of using dasiglucagon 1  mg/mL SC in conjunction with insulin in a pump setting 
using an iLet algorithm as part of an automated dual hormone pump delivery system in 
12 patients with type 1 diabe tes. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of dasiglucagon compared to marketed glucagon (Lilly Glucagon™). The trial also aimed to 
demonstrate the functionality and accuracy of the iPhone -based bionic pancreas in a controlled,

clinical setting. Patients were randomly assigned to two 1 -day treatment arms: dasiglucagon or 
Lilly Glucagon in the iPhone -based bionic pancreas.  
ZP4207 -16098 was a phase 2 randomized, crossover, double -blind trial designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of dasiglucagon in 23 patients with type 1 diabetes using a 
4 mg/mL formulation of dasiglucagon  (0.03 mg, 0.08 mg, 0.2 mg, and 0.6 mg)  compared to an 
active comparator, Lilly Glucagon.  
ZP4207 -16136 was a phase 3 randomized, double -blind parallel -group safety trial designed to 
evaluate the immunogenicity of dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen in 111 adult patients with 
type 1 diabetes.  
ZP4207 -16137 was a phase 3 randomized, double -blind, parallel -group trial designed to confirm 
the cl inical efficacy and safety of  a single dose of dasiglucagon (0.6 mg) for the rescue treatment 
of hypoglycemia compared to placebo and with reference  to GlucaGen (1 mg) in 168 adult  
patients  with type 1 diabetes.   
Overall, no safety concerns were observed f or dasiglucagon at the doses investigated in these 
clinical trials. The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) in each trial was nausea, which is 
a known side effect after administration of glucagon, and appeared at a similar frequency to 
marketed glu cagon, which was used as active comparator in some of the trials. No local 
tolerability issues were reported. Injection site reactions were observed only sporadically after 
administration with dasiglucagon, placebo, or marketed glucagon in trials with SC o r IM 
administration, and all events were mild and transient. No treatment -induced or 
treatment -boosted anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) were noted in any of the reported trials, except 
for trial ZP4207 -16098, in which  1 patient tested positive for both anti -dasiglucagon and 
anti-glucagon antibodies. Due to the crossover nature of this trial, the induction of ADAs could 
not be associated with a specific treatment.  
Dose proportionality for dasiglucagon PK using the 1 mg/mL formulation was confirmed in the 
clinical  trials, with doses ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 mg, characterized by a fast absorption 
with a peak plasma concentration obtained after 35 minutes. The median time to maximum 
concentration was later for dasiglucagon compared to marketed glucagon (GlucaGen) 
(35 vs 20 minutes). In the phase 2 trial  ZP4207 -15126 , doses of 0.3 mg dasiglucagon and 0.5 mg 
GlucaGen and also 0.6 mg dasiglucagon and 1.0 mg GlucaGen were similar with regard to 
maximum observed concentration (C max). The total exposure in terms of area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-inf) was consistently higher for 
dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen. This was likely due to a higher bioavailability of 
dasiglucagon since nonclinical data consistently show that the bioavailability of dasiglucagon is 
higher compared to marketed glucagon formulations. For the 4 mg/mL formulation, 
dose-proportionality of dasiglucagon doses between 0.03 and 0.6 mg was indicated for 
AUC 0-240min  and AUC 0-inf in trial ZP4207 -16098 . Pharmaco kinetic parameters were all similar for 
dasiglucagon administration under both euglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions. An 
approximately 30 to 40% greater exposure in terms of AUC 0-inf and C max was observed with the 
4 mg/mL formulation as compared with the 1  mg/mL formulation.  
In the phase 2 trial ZP4207 -15126, all patients achieved a PG level of at least 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L) at all dose levels of dasiglucagon  after insulin -induced hypoglycemia, as well as an 
increase in PG by at least 20 mg/dL (1.1 mmo l/L) within 30 minutes postdose. The PD responses 
of 0.3  mg of dasiglucagon and 0.5 mg of marketed glucagon (GlucaGen) were similar in the first 
30 minutes postdose, as were the PD responses of 0.6  mg of dasiglucagon and 1.0  mg of 
Page 21 of 157

GlucaGen. The PD response  over the entire observation time (0 -360 minutes) was significantly 
greater after dosing with dasiglucagon than with GlucaGen for all prespecified dose 
comparisons. This was likely an effect of the higher total drug exposure (AUC 0-inf) of 
dasiglucagon ment ioned previously.  
In the phase 3 trial ZP4207 -16137, t he primary endpoint was time to plasma glucose  recovery  
after insulin -induced hypoglycemia,  which was defined as first increase in plasma glucose of 
≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from  baseline. Superiority was  shown for  dasiglucagon relative to 
placebo, with a median time to plasma glucose recovery of 10 versus  40 minutes . The median 
time to recovery for GlucaGen was 12 minutes.  All patients in the dasiglucagon and GlucaGen 
treatment arms recovered  from insulin -induced  hypoglycemia within 30 minutes. All patients but 
one receiving dasiglucagon and one receiving  GlucaGen had recovered within 20 minutes 
(dasiglucagon: 99% and GlucaGen: 98%). At  15 minutes, 99% of patients receiving 
dasiglucagon and 95% of those re ceiving GlucaGen had  recovered. At 10 minutes, 65% of 
patients receiving dasiglucagon and 49% of those receiving  GlucaGen had recovered.  
No major differences in PD responses were observed between dasiglucagon doses under 
euglycemic or hypoglycemic conditio ns in phase 2 trial ZP4207 -16098. Under euglycemic 
conditions, all patients achieved an increase in PG of at least 20 mg/dL (1.1  mmol/L) within 
30 minutes postdose with 0.08 mg dasiglucagon and above, while this target was reached only 
for 0.2  mg of market ed glucagon (Lilly Glucagon). Under hypoglycemic conditions, 
dasiglucagon met the target at doses of 0.2 mg and above. The PD response over the entire 
observation time of 240  minutes was significantly higher with dasiglucagon than with Lilly 
Glucagon at th e same doses. In the bionic pancreas feasibility trial ZP4207 -16051, results 
demonstrated comparable autonomous glycemic control with dasiglucagon compared to 
Lilly  Glucagon. This was despite the stressed conditions of the trial in terms of fasted patients  
being on up to twice their basal insulin rate to stimulate glucagon use during the 8 -hour test, and 
inclusion of a structured exercise period. With dasiglucagon, patients obtained a glucose value 
within target (70 -180 mg/dL [3.9 -10.0 mmol/L]) 70.9% of the  time vs 65.6% with Lilly 
Glucagon.  
6.3.4.  Literature Data  
In a retrospective review of 223 cases of diffuse or focal CHI, glucagon was reported to be used 
in 55% of patients with diffuse CHI and in 31% of patients with focal CHI.10 In an observational 
trial of 55 newborns who received glucagon because of hypoglycemia after birth, applied doses 
were mainly in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/day, and results indi cated an increase in PG from a 
mean of 36.3  md/dL to a mean of 93.0 mg/dL, observed within 4 hours after the start of glucagon 
infusion.9 The frequency of hypoglycemic episodes was significantly reduced, and no further 
episodes of severe hypoglycemia were observed.  
In another retrospective chart review of 40  children with CHI who received continuous IV 
glucagon for prevention  of hypoglycemi a,14 a median (inter quartile range) glucagon dose of 
205 (178, 235) mcg/kg/day  over a median duration of 5 (3, 9) days enabled a glucose infusion 
rate ( GIR) reduc tion from 18.5 (12.9, 22.8) to 11 (6.6, 17.5) mg/kg/min per 24 h (p < 0.001), and 
reduced hypoglycemia  frequency from 1.9  (1.3, 2.9) to 0.7 (0.3, 1.2)  episodes per day.  
The long -term use of glucagon in patients with CHI is limited by the instabil ity of marketed 
glucagon after reconstitution. A literature review on the long -term medical treatment of CHI 
revealed that only 1% of 619 patients identified received glucagon as part of their medical 
management.6 A retrospective review of 9 children with CHI who received continuous SC 
Page 22 of 157

infusion of glucagon for weeks or months showed that introduction of glucagon allowed the 
reduction or discontinuati on of central glucose infusion in all patients.11 Six of 9 patients were 
discharged with continued glucagon therapy that their parents were able to  continue without 
further symptomatic hypoglycemia, convulsions, or unconsciousness. In 3 children, glucagon 
therapy was continued for 1 to 4 years, which led to stable euglycemia.  
The data reported on marketed glucagon use in patients with CHI indicate t hat continuous SC 
infusion of a glucagon agonist could provide therapeutic benefit to patients by stabilizing PG 
levels and reducing the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes.5,6,9,10,11 
6.3.5.  Anticipated Medical Benefit of Dasiglucagon in the Treatment of CHI  
With its physio -chemical stability in liquid formulation, dasiglucagon could provide significant 
added benefit in the treat ment of CHI relative to currently marketed glucagon by enabling 
long-term reliable IV infusion. Long -term subcutaneous infusion of dasiglucagon through a 
pump may be an attractive alternative or addition to diazoxide and octreotide since it may reduce 
the dependency on intensive nutritional support, both IV and gastric (NG tube or gastrostomy), 
whilst maintaining euglycemia by harnessing physiological mechanisms for combating 
hypoglycemia. Furthermore, if long term euglycemia is achieved with medical therap y, 
pancreatectomy for the treatment of diffuse CHI could eventually be avoided. In one cohort of 
nonsurgically treated children, the mean clinical remission rate was 5  (1.5-12) years for diffuse 
CHI.5 This suggests that a significant proportion of infants with CHI could avoid surgery if 
medical treatment allowed for the effective long -term control of hyperinsulinism.  
The target population in this tria l is children with CHI who are especially challenging to treat, 
and who need continuous IV glucose infusion to prevent or treat hypoglycemia, necessitating 
ongoing hospitalization. These children have limited options in terms of other treatments, and 
repre sent very high unmet medical need group within already ultra -rare CHI population.  
6.3.6.  Anticipated Risks of Dasiglucagon in the Treatment of CHI  
So far, there is no previous clinical experience with dasiglucagon SC infusion for the treatment 
of CHI. The followi ng anticipated risks are derived from other clinical trials with dasiglucagon 
conducted in other indications, from marketed glucagon labelling information, and from native 
glucagon’s physiological effects.  
In clinical trials with dasiglucagon conducted up to now, the most frequent treatment -related AEs 
were nausea and vomiting, followed by headache.  
Glucagon exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects and may, therefore, cause 
tachycardia and hypertension. Transient increases in heart rate and hypert ension have been 
observed in clinical trials with dasiglucagon. Additionally , several episodes of hypotension and 
bradycardia have been noted in the clinical program , often in association with nausea and/or 
vomiting .  
Accidental overdose may occur due to i nappropriate handling of the infusion pump or due to 
pump malfunction. Overdose may result in nausea, vomiting, inhibition of GI tract motility, 
short -term increase in heart rate or blood pressure, and/or hypokalemia. Symptomatic care for 
nausea and vomiti ng, as well as monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and hypokalemia is 
advised.  
Injection site reactions are seen with many injectable peptides. Injection site reactions have been 
reported across trials, with similar  frequency in all treatment groups (dasiglucagon , marketed

glucagons , and placebo ), irrespective of dose. The injection site reactions were generally mild 
and transient.  
Overall, the clinical trial data indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of ADAs. 
Out of more than 350  doses of dasiglucagon administered to more than 200  patients, only 
1 low-titer transient ADA incident has been reported to date, in a patient following 
administration of 11  SC doses of dasiglucagon or Lilly Glucagon ranging from 0.03 to 0.6  mg, 
with low binding and low in vitro  neutralizing capability. No apparent clinical effects on PK, PD , 
or AEs were noted. Due to the crossover trial des ign, the ADA induction could not be ascribed to 
a specific treatment. Based on the current clinical experience and the product characteristics, the 
risk of dasiglucagon inducing an ADA response is considered low.  
Administration of glucagon or dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions 
similar to those observed for other therapeutic peptides or proteins.  
Data on the risks of chronic administration of dasiglucagon are not available. From sporadic 
reports of extended SC/IV infusion of ma rketed glucagon and in glucagonoma patients,15 
sustained exposure to high levels of glucagon may lead to development of the skin condition 
necrolyti c migratory erythema (NME), a highly specific migrating, erythematous rash with 
predilection for perioral, perianal, and lower leg distribution.11 
For further information on risks, please refer to the current version of the investigator’s brochure 
(IB).  
6.3.7.  Summary of Potential Benefits and Risks  
As with all treatment interventions, the anticipated benefits to trial patients should be balanced 
against the  potential risks. The accumulated experience from nonclinical studies and clinical 
trials with dasiglucagon supports that dasiglucagon is a specific glucagon receptor agonist and is 
well tolerated. Glucagon and its analogs belong to a well -known drug class  with known mode of 
action. The clinical investigators involved in the trial will all have had experience with use of 
glucagon in patients with CHI.  
The investigator will inform the patients/parent(s)/guardian of the potential risks of dasiglucagon 
treatm ent and other trial -related procedures before they enter the trial. The investigator must 
become familiar with all sections of the dasiglucagon  IB before the start of the trial.  
In this trial population, the major and clinically relevant benefit is the exp ected reduction and 
eventually elimination of need for IV glucose, together with the reduction in gastric nutritional 
interventions while avoiding  hypoglycemia. The reduced volume of nutritional interventions 
should limit the risk of volume overload . Furth ermore, by removing the invasive methods of 
nutrition, the children should better retain or re -establish orality – the intake of nutrients by 
mouth.   
In summary, with its marked improvements in stability in solution and solubility in aqueous 
media compared  to currently marketed glucagon products, dasiglucagon is expected to have 
significant clinical benefits in the treatment of CHI and to substantially reduce the disease burden 
in these patients. This includes discharge from the hospital by enabling conveni ent and reliable 
long-term treatment via a pump device in a home setting, together with the potential to delay and 
ultimately avoid pancreatectomy and its related exo/endocrine complications, particularly the 
development of insulin -dependent diabetes.  
Over all, the benefit to risk ratio for patients entering the ZP4207 -17103 trial is considered 
acceptable.

8. TRIAL DESIGN  
8.1. Overall Trial Design and Plan  
This is a combined phase 2 and 3, randomized, multinational trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of individually titrated dasiglucagon in children ≥7 days and <1 year of age who have 
been diagnosed with CHI, comprising  2 parts, a crossover ( 2 periods, 48 hours each), 
double -blind, placebo -controlled  Part 1, and an open -label, singl e-arm Part 2 of 21  days 
(Figure  1).  
Abbreviations: Min = minimum  
Figure  1 Design of Trial ZP4207 -17103  
After screening, eligible patients will complete a minimum 24 -hour run -in period to confirm the 
IV glucose randomization requirement (≥10 mg/kg/min). All non -nutritional carbohydrates and 
carbohydrate fortification of feeds are prohibited during this 24 -hour run -in period. After the 
run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned in a double -blind fashion to receive 
dasiglucagon or placebo for 48 hours, after which they will be crossed over to the other trial 
treatment for an additional 48 hours. At the time of  crossover, the trial drug will be initiated from 
the starting dose of 10 µg/hr, and IV GIR will be set to the rate obtained at the end of the run -in 
period and titrated accordingly.  
There will be no washout between the 2 periods in Part 1 to limit the le ngth of time in which 
patients are reliant on IV GIR as their only means of preventing/treating hypoglycemia. This is 
deemed acceptable because:  
• The half -life (t ½) of dasiglucagon is short (~30 minutes, for the 0.6 mg dose, and potentially 
shorter for lowe r doses, ~22 minutes) relative to the 48 -hour duration of each crossover

period. Moreover, for the primary endpoint, only the last 12 hours of the 48 -hour period will 
be used for endpoint assessment.  
• Assuming a positive effect of dasiglucagon, the absence  of washout is conservative with 
respect to key secondary endpoints since a potential carry over effect of dasiglucagon in 
Period  2 is attributed to placebo.  
During Part 1, the trial drug and IV GIR should be adjusted according to the protocol -specified 
algorithm (see Section 10.2). Non -nutritional carbohydrates and/or carbohydrate fortification of 
feeds during Part 1 is only allowed if the maximum t olerable volume and concentration of IV 
glucose for the patient is reached, and should be limited to the minimum needed to ensure the 
patient’s safety  (Section 9.5). All feedings (administered as parenteral nutrition, by NG tube, 
gastrostomy, or normal route), will be recorded during this period. Safety assessments will be 
performed daily after initiation of the trial drug (active or placebo).  
After Part 1, patients wi ll continue in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for 21  days. 
Additional CHI treatments can be introduced during Part 2 if needed, if up -titration of 
dasiglucagon is not possible due to undesirable side effects or if the maximum dose level 
(70 µg/hr) has been reached. Gradual transfer from IV glucose to oral and gastric carbohydrates 
should be initiated in Part 2, enabling weaning of IV glucose and hospital discharge. Patients will 
continue to be hospitalized until IV GIR is weaned off; however, as soon as local site criteria for 
discharge are met, patients can be discharged to continue the treatment period at home. Visits are 
planned on Day 11 and Day 18 in  Part 2. These visits can be converted to telephone visits if 
appropriate, at the investigator’s discretion . On Day 2 5, the End of Treatment Visit will take 
place, and based on the investigator’s confirmation of continued positive benefit -risk balance, 
patients will be offered the opportunity to enter the long -term extension trial (Trial ZP4207 -
17106) to continue dasiglucagon treatment. Patients who do not enter the long -term extension 
trial will have a Follow -up Visit 28  days after their last dose of trial  drug.  
8.2. Discussion of Trial Design  
The initial 2x48 -hour treatment period (Part 1) is double -blind and placebo  controlled to avoid 
bias in the assessment of the effect of dasiglucagon on GIR. A crossover design has been chosen 
to limit the influence of inhe rent variability of the population, which allows for recruitment of 
fewer patients compared to a parallel -group design, reflecting the ultra -rare status of the disease.  
All patients will receive dasiglucagon in open -label Part 2. According to International  Council 
for Harmonisation  (ICH) guidelines , for the conduct of clinical trials in rare diseases, where the 
anticipated likelihood of considerable benefit is high, such design has some potential efficiencies 
because all patients will be exposed to test dru g, which is of particular importance in rare 
diseases.16 
8.3. Trial Sites  
The trial will take place at 5 to 7  sites in the US and Europe  that are experie nced in the treatment 
of CHI . A total of 12 patients with CHI is planned to be randomized  and exposed to the trial 
product . Patients who withdraw prematurely will not be replaced.

8.4. Point of Contact  
A point of contact will be identified to provide informati on to each patient’s parent(s)/guardian 
about where to obtain information on the trial, the patient’s rights, and whom to contact in case 
of trial -related injury. This information will be provided in the patient information and informed 
consent form (ICF).  
9. PATIENT POPULATION  
9.1. Selection of Trial Population  
A screening log of potential trial candidates must be maintained at each trial site.  
9.2. Trial Entry Criteria  
9.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
A patient will be eligible for trial participation if he or she meets all of the following criteria:  
1. CHI diagnosis established based on the following:

is allowed for diagnosis of focal CHI.  
16. The use of prescription or non -prescription medications known to cause QT prolongation.  
9.2.3.  Randomization Exclusion Criteria  
A screened patient will not be randomized if:  
1. Mean IV glucose requirement is <10 mg/kg/min to maintain glycemia above 70  mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L) during the  previous 24 hours prior to randomization  
2. Use of glucagon within 24 hours before randomization . 
3. Use of additional enteral glucose within 24 hours before  randomization. Patients should be 
transitioned to IV glucose infusions only at least 24 hours before randomization.  
4. Is not sufficiently clinically stable on IV GIR only (± diazoxide, as applicable), in the 
opinion of the investigator, to undergo the place bo-controlled randomized Part 1 of the trial 
(2x48 hours).  
The Randomization Visit may be rescheduled once if Randomization Exclusion Criterion  2 is 
met. 
9.3. Premature Patient Withdrawal  
Randomization day exclusion criteria are described in Section 9.2.3 . 
Patients’ parent(s)/guardian will be advised that they are free to withdraw their chi ld from 
participation in this trial at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice. Every reasonable 
attempt should be made by the investigator to keep patients in the trial to obtain data for the 
primary endpoint in Part 1 and for safety follow -up eve n if trial treatment has been discontinued. 
However, patients must be withdrawn from the trial if their parent(s)/guardian withdraw consent 
to participate.

04-Jun-2021  Version: Final v14.0 (Germany)  
  
AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 29 of 84 
Investigators must attempt to contact patients’ parent(s)/guardian who fail to attend scheduled 
visits by telephone or other means to exclude the possibility of an AE being the cause of 
withdrawal. Attempts to contact the patient must be documented. At least 3  phone calls and 
3 written attempts to contact the patient will be made prior to considering th em lost to follow -up. 
Should an AE be the cause of withdrawal, it must be documented, reported, and followed up as 
described in Section  12.3. 
If a p atient/parent(s)/guardian withdraws consent, the reason for withdrawal and the date of 
withdrawal will be recorded on the appropriate page of the electronic case report form  (eCRF). 
Whenever possible and reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducte d at the completion 
of the trial should be performed at the time of premature withdrawal.  
9.4. Treatment Discontinuation  
To prevent missing data, patients should, to the extent possible, be kept in the trial; therefore, 
treatment discontinuation is often the pr eferred option in case of, e.g., substantial noncompliance 
with trial procedures or initiation of prohibited treatment that interferes with the efficacy and 
safety evaluation. If it is an investigator’s decision to discontinue the patient’s treatment, the 
investigator should, whenever possible, discuss the potential discontinuation of the treatment 
with the medical monitor. If the patient is discontinued from trial treatment by the investigator or 
by parent/guardian’s decision, the reason for treatment disc ontinuation and the date of treatment 
discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The patient should be 
asked to continue in the trial by following the planned visit schedule  and to have trial 
assessments performed according to th e Schedule of Events. This is especially important during 
Part 1 of the trial where the primary endpoint is evaluated . As a minimum, the patient will be 
asked to attend the Follow -up Visit 28 days (± 3 days) after discontinuation of trial treatment.  
9.5. Rescue  Criteria  
During Part 1, the IV glucose concentration and rate of infusion can be increased to avoid 
hypoglycemia. When the maximum (or maximum tolerable) dose of trial drug has been reached 
and the necessary amount of GIR to prevent hypoglycemia is likely  to cause (in the 
investigator’s opinion) a moderate or severe AE (e.g., volume overload), oral/gastric 
non-nutritional carbohydrates can be introduced to ensure the patient’s safety whilst maintaining 
the maximum tolerable concentration and infusion rate of IV glucose.  
During Part 2, p atients are allowed to initiate and titrate oral/gastric non -nutritional 
carbohydrates, and initiate any CHI treatment.  
9.6. Patient Replacement Criteria  
Patients who withdraw from the trial prematurely will not be replaced. If a substantial number of 
patients withdraw prematurely, the sponsor will evaluate the need for developing replacement 
criteria.  
Enrolled patients (defined as randomized) who are subsequently withdrawn from the trial may 
not re -enter. The patien t number for a withdrawn patient will not be reassigned to another 
patient.

10. TREATMENTS  
10.1. Identification of Investigational Product  
Dasiglucagon Injection, 4 mg/mL will be supplied by the sponsor in a 3 mL vial containing 1  mL 
of drug product.  
Matching placebo for dasiglucagon injection will be supplied by the sponsor in a 3  mL vial 
containing 1  mL of drug product.  
Dasiglucagon and matching placebo will be provided in the form of solution for injection for 
subcutaneous  administration through an  infusion pump.  
The trial drug product, as applicable, must be transferred from the vial to the Accu -Chek Spirit 
Cartridge. The amount of drug product dosed via the pump will vary among patients.  
Cartridges and infusion sets should be filled and replaced a s indicated in the instructions for use.  
10.1.1.  Packaging and Labeling  
Trial drug products will be packaged and labeled by the sponsor.  
Part 1 dispensing unit configuration: 3 vials containing dasiglucagon, 4  mg/mL or placebo for 
dasiglucagon, packed in an outer  carton. The vial s and carton will be packaged and labeled in 
local language without revealing the treatment.  
Part 2 dispensing unit configuration: 3 vials containing dasiglucagon, 4  mg/mL, packed in an 
outer carton. The vial s and carton will be packaged a nd labeled in local language, revealing the 
treatment.  
The storage conditions for trial drug products will be described on the trial drug product label. 
The labels will supply no information about patients. Each dispensing  unit ( 3 vials) will have a 
unique  Dispensing Unit Number for drug allocation, drug accountability, and traceability 
purposes.  
Labelling will be performed according to Annex 13 of the Good Manufacturing Practice 
guidelines of the European Commission, ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guide lines, local 
laws, and regulations.  
10.2. Treatments Administered  
As long as the patient is receiving IV glucose, the PG will be measured and reviewed hourly 
using a hand -held PG meter. The IV GIR will be titrated to achieve glycemia of at least 
70 mg/dL (3.9  mmol/L) (a minimum GIR will be established as the rate up -titrated after the 
patient drops at least once below 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]). When the patient is no longer on 
IV GIR, the PG will be checked according to local practice, but at least 3 times daily. Th e PG  
will be measured using the same trial -supplied hand -held PG meter during the entire trial.  
Additionally, blinded CGM will be started 24  hours prior to randomization and con tinued  until 
the end of Part 2.  
Dosing of dasiglucagon will approximate conti nuous infusion by delivering small doses at 
frequent intervals via the infusion pump. The adjustment of trial drug dosing is closely linked to 
the PG level achieved, which in turn will govern the IV GIR . In Part 1 the algorithm in Table  1 
should be used .

>120  >6.7 Reduce IV GIR by 2 mg/kg/min  
Abbreviations: GIR = glucose infusion rate; IV = intravenous  
The IV GIR will be reviewed, evaluated, and adjusted (if indicated) every hour according to the 
above PG -driven algorithm to maintain a PG of >70 mg/dL (>3.9 mmol/L). Rechecks of PG are 
allowed.   
Part 1 (Crossover, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled)  
The starting dose of trial drug is 10 µg/hr at t=0. Every 2  hours (t=2, 4, 6, etc.), the dose will be 
increased by an additional 10 µg/hr until either:  
• The patient is totally weaned off IV glucose, or  
• Plasma glucose during the last 2 hours was constantly above 120 mg/dL (6.7  mmol/L), or  
• IV GIR has not decre ased despite 2 sequential dose increments of trial drug (in this 
situation, the dose of trial drug should be maintained until the IV GIR can be further 
decreased or until crossover or the end of Part 1), or  
• The maximum dose of 70 µg/hr is reached, or  
• AEs e merge that are considered to be related to dasiglucagon (e.g.,  nausea/change in feeding 
pattern or increased vomiting) that are limiting further dose escalation  
The 2 -hour dose -adjustment interval will allow drug plasma levels to approach steady -state 
before the dose is further increased. The cumulative dose will not exceed 1.26  mg over the first 
24 hours and 1.68 mg for each of the subsequent 24 -hour periods.

At the time of crossover  from the first 48 -hour period to the second 48 -hour period , the trial dr ug 
will again be titrated from the starting dose of 10 µg/hr, and IV GIR will be set to the rate 
obtained at the end of the run -in period and titrated accordingly.  
Part 2 (Open label)  
After Part 1, patients will continue in open -label Part 2 to receive da siglucagon for a further 
21 days. Since treatment allocation during Part 1 remains blinded, all patients are required to 
initiate dasiglucagon dosing at 10 µg/hr in Part 2, while IV GIR should be started at the rate 
obtained at the end of the run -in period . 
During Part 2, the dasiglucagon dose, the amount and route of administration of carbohydrates 
(IV GIR, parenteral nutrition, gastric carbohydrate infusions, and carbohydrates from oral feeds) 
can be adjusted  at the discretion of the investigator . The PG should be monitored at least hourly 
to adjust the IV GIR as appropriate and to avoid hypoglycemia. Additional concomitant 
medications, including somatostatin analogs and/or sirolimus/mTOR inhibitors, may be 
introduced at the investigator’s discretion if th e maximum dose level of dasiglucagon (70  µg/hr) 
has been reached or if further up -titration is not possible due to undesirable side effects.  
Adjustment of total carbohydrate administered (IV glucose, parenteral nutrition, carbohydrate 
infusions, and carboh ydrates from oral feeds) should continue throughout this period according 
to local practice to maintain PG levels in the range  of 70 mg/dL  to 120  mg/dL (3.9 -6.7 mmol/L).  
The aim will be to obtain stable glucose levels with minimum rescue/hypoglycemia -preve ntative 
carbohydrates administered by invasive routes, and to encourage/optimize oral feeds, and 
achieve weaning off IV glucose. Regardless of their discharge status, all patients will be offered 
the opportunity to participate in the long -term safety exten sion trial (ZP4207 -17106), providing 
the investigator attests to the positive benefit -risk balance of continued dasiglucagon treatment.  
10.3. Trial Supplies  
The device and ancillaries listed in the following table will be supplied by the sponsor 
throughout the t rial. Trained trial personnel will train parent(s)/guardian on the use of the devices.

The infusion pump system is CE -marked for the management of diabetes mellitus in persons  
requiring insulin, as prescribed by a physician. In this trial, the pump system is used outside of  
the CE -marked intended use since the pump system will be delivering dasiglucagon to patients  
with CHI. The PG meter is used as intended according to the CE mark, except for the use by a  
lay person in a home care setting. The CGM devic es are  used as int ended according to the CE 
mark, except for the age group and the disease . 
The pump , the SMPG, and the CGM  will be labeled for use in an investigational trial.  For more 
information on the devices please refer to Section 20. 
10.4. Dispensing and Storage  
The trial drug products supplied by the sponsor is to be dispen sed exclusively to patients 
randomized in this clinical trial according to the instructions of this protocol and the pharmacy 
manual/trial materials manual (TMM). The investigator is responsible for dispensing the trial 
drug product according to the dosage  scheme. Trial drug products will be allocated using an 
interactive  automated web response system (IWRS), according to Section 10.5. 
Dasiglucagon a nd placebo for dasiglucagon injection must be stored at 2 –8°C in a refrigerator.  
The investigator must ensure the availability of proper storage conditions. All trial drug products 
provided for this trial will be stored at the trial site in a secure area w ith restricted access.  
The temperature should be monitored by recording the actual, minimum, and maximum 
temperatures using a calibrated thermometer or thermocouple, or by continuous recording using 
a qualified temperature monitoring system. The temperature should be evaluated and 
documented at least on working days on a temperature log. This log must be included in the 
Investigator Site File (ISF) upon trial termination.  
The investigator must contact the clinical research associate (CRA) in case of temperature 
deviations outside the acceptable range.  
Please see the pharmacy manual/ TMM  for additional information on handling of the trial drug.  
The investigator must maintain  adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, return, or other 
disposition of the trial drug, including the date, quantity, batch or code number, and 
identification of patients (patient number) who received the trial drug. The investigator will not 
supply the trial drug to any person except subinvestigators, designated trial personnel, and 
patients in this trial. The trial drug may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other patients. If 
any of the trial drug is not dispensed, is lost, stolen, spil led, unusable, or is received in a 
damaged container, this information must be documented and reported to the sponsor and the 
appropriate regulatory agencies as required.  
10.5. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
For Part 1, patients will be randoml y assigned 1:1 in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 2  sequences:  
• Dasiglucagon 4 mg/mL for 48 hours, followed by placebo for dasiglucagon for 48 hours, or  
• Placebo  for dasiglucagon  for 48 hours, followed by dasiglucagon 4 mg/mL for 48 hours.  
Randomization will be performed using a block randomization scheme stratified by region 
(US/non -US). The randomization scheme will be generated prior to the initiation of the trial by

an independent statistician/programmer who will not be a member of the trial team; investig ators 
will not be aware of the block size of the randomization scheme.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to a trial treatment sequence using an IWRS that has been 
validated for the intended use under the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineers Good 
automated manufacturing practice  guidelines, 21CFR Part 11 (FDA regulation for Electronic 
Records and Electronic Signatures) , and the ICH Guidance E6 for Industry on Good Clinical 
Practice.  
After completing Part 1, patients will continue in Part 2 to receive active treatment for a 
maximum of 21 days.  
10.6. Blinding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment  
Trial personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the trial blind to minimize bias in the 
conduct of the trial. Treatment unblinding is discouraged i f knowledge of the treatment 
assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. 
Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the 
patient’s treatment assignment.  
For emergency unb linding, the investigator will use the measures provided through the IWRS. 
Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor if possible. If the 
investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then he or she must notif y the 
medical monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the patient’s 
treatment assignment.  
The investigator or designee must record the date and reason for unblinding on the appropriate 
eCRF page for that patient.  
10.7. Select ion of Doses in the Trial  
Both the starting dose and the maximum allowed doses are based on experience with marketed 
glucagon products in this patient population.11 
At present, no pediatric PK data are available for dasiglucagon. However, an approximate 
estimation of expected drug concentration in a 3 kg patient has been made by extrapolation of a 
previously made PK model for pediatric patients with w eights between 25 and 45  kg.17 
In this trial, dasiglucagon will be titrated to meet the needs of the individual patient on the basis 
of PD effects i n regards to efficacy and tolerability , and it is expected that the majority of 
patients will be adequately treated with a dasiglucagon infusion rate of approximately 
20 to 40 μg/hr. The up -titration will stop when IV glucose is completely weaned , if undesirable 
side effects arise,  or when no additional PD effects are observed as the dasiglucagon infusion 
rate is increased.  
Based on the current PK/PD model, the predicted plasma concentration is expected to result in a 
medium PD response at the lowest dose level and be approaching maximum effect at the highest 
dose level. The PD response of patients will be monitored closely in this trial, and the 
appropriateness of the applied titration algorithm will be evaluated.  
Although the PK of dasiglucagon has b een shown to be dose -proportional in adults and in all 
toxicologically tested species over a wide range of doses, limited PK sampling at each dose level 
is planned  based on the limited available blood volume in this population.

Dosing details are provided in Section 10.2. 
10.9. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adjustment criteria are presented in Section 10.2. 
10.10.  Treatment Compliance  
Compliance data will be collected. Infusion details will be recorded in  the patient’s eCRF and 
drug accountability will be performed as detailed in the pharmacy manual/TMM.  
10.11.  Permitted and Prohibited Therapies  
All concomitant medications used (including over -the-counter medications and herbal 
supplements) will be recorded in th e source document and on the appropriate eCRF.  
Caution is advised when beta -blockers, indomethacin, antichol inergic drugs, and warfarin are 
prescribed due to reports of interaction with marketed glucagon products.  
10.11.1.  Permitted Therapies  
Regarding diazoxide, patients entering the trial either:  
• Have tried diazoxide, but discontinued due to lack of efficacy. Minimum of 6 days’ washout 
is required prior to randomization.  
• Have tried diazoxide, but discontinued due to adverse events, or family choice, even if 
efficacy was established. Minimum of 6 days’ washout is required prior to randomization.  
• Have initiated diazoxide prior to screening, and continue on the treatment. Diazoxide dose 
should remain stable during Part 1 of the trial. Diazoxide should not be initiated during 
screening.  
• Have never tried diazoxide. Diazoxide should not be initiated during screening or Part  1 of 
the trial.  
Prior use of octreotide is allowed after a minimum 48-hour washout  prior to randomization . 
Washout is required to eliminate t he effect of octreotide during Part 1, where adjustment of GIR 
has to follow the protocol -defined PG -driven algorithm ( Table  1) and the primary endpoi nt on 
mean GIR is assessed.  
Somatostatin analogs  and/or diazoxide can be introduced during Part 2 if needed, at the 
investigator’s discretion , when the maximal limit of dasiglucagon (70  µg/hr) has been reached or 
if further up -titration is not possible du e to undesirable side effects.   
Addition of o ther CHI -specific treatments  (e.g., sirolimus/mTOR inhibitors ) during Part  2 need 
to be discussed with the medical monitor.  
10.11.2.  Prohibited Therapies  
The following therapies are prohibited :  
During the  entire  trial:  
• Systemic corticosteroids, e.g., hydrocortisone >20 mg/m2 body surface area or equivalent 
within 5  days before screening . 
• Anti-inflammatory biological agents or other immune -modulating agents .

• Other investigational agents . 
• Marketed glucagon products within the last 24 hours prior to randomization and throughout 
the trial unless necessary for rescue therapy in case of severe hypoglycemia, as per local 
standard of care.  
• Prescription or non -prescription medications known to cause QT prolongation .  
During Screening and Part 1:  
• Somatostatin an alogs  and s irolimus (mTOR inhibitors ). No new CHI treat ment is to be 
initiated during screening and Part 1. Octreotide is allowed in the screening period if 
discontinued at least 48 hours before randomization . 
During Part 2 and follow -up:  
• Initiation of s omatostatin an alogs, diazoxide and  sirolimus (mTOR inhibitors)  unless the 
maximum dose level of dasiglucagon (70  µg/hr) has been reached or further dasiglucagon 
up-titration is not possible due to undesirable side effects . 
10.12.  Discharge of Patients for Home Treatment  
Patients can be discharged during Part 2 to complete the treatment at home as soon as IV GIR 
has been weaned off and local site criteria for discharge are met. Discharge for home treatment is 
contingen t on the parent(s)/guardian being capable of taking care of the administration of 
investigative product via pump at home , can use SMPG and CGM device, and are able  to attend 
planned assessment visits at the hospital.  
Before discharge of patients from hospi tal care, the investigator will ensure:  
• Appropriate training of patient’s parent(s)/guardian in the use of dasiglucagon in the Accu -
Chek Spirit Combo pump based on the training material provided. The first pump infusion

10.13.  Treatment After End of Trial  
On Day 2 5, the End of Treatment Visit will take place. B ased on the investigator’s c onfirmation 
of continued positive benefit -risk balance, patients will be offered the opportunity to enter the 
long-term extension trial (Trial ZP4207 -17106) to continue dasiglucagon treatment. Patients who 
do not enter the long -term extension trial will have a Follow -up Visit 28  days after their last dose 
of trial drug  and return to standard of care as per investigator discretion. No further treatment 
with dasiglucagon will be offered.  
11. TRIAL PROCEDURES  
Patients’ parent(s)/guardian (according to loca l law) must provide written informed consent 
before any trial -related procedures are initiated, including the cessation of prohibited 
concomitant therapy.  
For the timing of assessments and procedures throughout the trial, refer to the Schedule of 
Events (S ection  18.1). Throughout the trial, trial personnel should make every reasonable effort 
to follow the timing of assessments and procedures in Secti on 18.1 for each patient. If a patient 
misses a trial visit for any reason, it should be rescheduled as soon as possible.  
11.1. Trial Duration  
The sequen ce and maximum duration of the trial periods will be as follows:  
1. Screening Period: up to 28 days, including a minimum 24 -hour run -in period  
2. Part 1 (2x48 -hour period: double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled): 96  hours  
3. Part 2 (Open -label Active Treatmen t Period): 21 days  
4. Follow -up Period: Patients who do not enter the extension trial will have a Follow -up 
Visit 28 days after their last dose of trial drug  
The maximum trial duration for each patient is 81  days. The maximum treatment duration for 
each patie nt is 25  days.  
11.2. Assessments  
11.2.1.  Efficacy  
11.2.1.1.  Plasma Glucose Monitoring  
As long as the patient is receiving IV glucose, the GIR will be reviewed hourly, based on an 
hourly PG check performed by the StatStrip Xpress2 meter. The IV GIR will be reviewed, 
evaluated, and adjusted (if indicated) according to the IV GIR algorithm bas ed on PG levels 
specified in Table  1. If IV glucose has been stopped, PG will be checked according to local 
practice, but at least 3 times daily .  
Blood for PG check can be obtained either by finger or heel sticks or by an indwelling peripheral 
line. However, if using an indwelling peripheral line, the total blood volume drawn during a 
28-day period should be considered according to Section 11.2.3.1 . 
At each visit, the investigator will ensure that SMPG data are downloaded from the patient’s 
device. The investigator will check for patient compliance in SMPG measur ements. The 
procedure for download of SMPG data will be described in the pharmacy manual/TMM.  
Adjustments to the trial drug will be made as outlined in Section 10.2.

11.2.1.2.  Continuous Glucose Monitoring  
Dexcom CGMs , configured and labeled for use in the trial, will be provided. In Germany, only 
the Dexcom G6 CGM will be used. Enrollment in Germany will start only after Dexcom G6 
CGM is available.  
For other c ountries : the Dexcom G4 may be used until all required approvals for use of the 
Dexcom G6 are obtained, but no later than to the end of 2020, wh en the Dexcom G4 will be 
taken off the market by the supplier . Patients enrolled thereafter will all be using the Dexcom G6 
CGM. Patients who started in the trial using the Dexcom G4 CGM should continue using this 
device throughout the trial and should not switch to the Dexcom G6 device.  
The CGM will be started at leas t 24 hours prior to randomization and will be used during Parts 1 
and 2 in a blinded mode to evaluate efficacy in terms of hypoglycemic episodes. Short pauses of 
1 to 3 days due to skin irritation or discomfort are allowed  during Part 2 of the trial after 
consultation with the investigator.  
The CGM device should be calibrated and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 
At each visit, the investigator will ensure that CGM data are downloaded from the patient’s 
device. The procedure for download of  CGM data will be described in the pharmacy 
manual/TMM.   
The contract research organization (CRO) or delegate will handle the device sourcing, 
configuration for use in this trial, procedures for blinded data extraction, device service, and 
handling  of pote ntial returns . 
11.2.1.3.  Diary  
For patients who are discharged during the trial, the parent(s)/guardian will receive a paper diary 
to be completed at home. The investigator will instruct the patient’s parent(s)/guardian on how to 
complete the diary. The following i nformation should be recorded in the diary:  
• Type and volume of fluid administered through NG tube/gastrostomy  
• Hypoglycemic events, including related SMPG measurements  
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs  
• Hospitalizations, visits to health care providers or emergency room (ER)/accident & 
emergency (A&E) department, and visits by paramedics  
• Data regarding suspicion of NME and neurological findings  
Diary entries should be reviewed at each visit and the revi ew documented in the diary. Data from 
the diary entries should be transcribed to the eCRF on an ongoing basis.  
11.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics/Drug Exposure  
Blood samples will be collected in Part 2 to measure dasiglucagon levels at steady -state 
(Schedule of Events; Sect ion 18.1). The blood samples should be collected after a minimum of 
4 hours without changes to the dasiglucagon infusion rate. For patients with a b ody weight above 
4 kg, an additional PK sample should be collected at Day 5 . However, the total amount of blood 
collected should always be considered according to Section 11.2.3.1 . 
Details on sampling/collection, shipment, and analysis will be provided in the laboratory manual.

11.2.3.  Safety  
Safety assessments will include the evaluation of AEs, clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, biochemistry, and ADAs), vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, 
echocardiography, and local tolerability.  
11.2.3.1.  Laboratory Safety Assessments  
Trial procedures require a maximum total of 8 .8 to 9.2  mL of blood in a 28 -day period. Where 
this exceeds the 2.5  mL/kg maximum18,19, safety laboratory tests (2 mL per sampling) will be 
prioritized over immunogenicity (1 mL) and drug exposure (0.4 mL) samples.  
All measurements described in this section are recognized standard methods.  
Hematology and Biochemistry  
Samples for hematology and biochemistry will be collected at the time points specified in the 
Schedule of Events (Section  18.1). 
Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC indices, mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 
platelet count (or estimate), white blood cell count, including differential  
Biochemistry:  albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, 
alanine aminotransferase,  aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea 
nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, eGFR, 
ketones (measured with PG meter)  
Standard of care blood samples can be used as screening samples if they were collected within 
1 week of screening.  
Laboratory specimens will be analyzed at local laboratories.  
Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to test for antibodies against dasiglucagon at Visit 2 (Day  1, 
prior to dosing), Visit  7 (Day  25 ±3), and at the Follow -up Visit (Visit 8, Day 53 ±3) 
(Section  18.1) and processed and shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory 
manual. The samples will be stored until the ADA sc reening and confirmatory assays have been 
approved by the FDA. Afterwards, t he ADA samples will be analyzed in batches during the trial . 
The ADA samples will be analyzed at a specialty laboratory.  
The clinical ADA assays specific for dasiglucagon and gluca gon have been validated in 
accordance with existing guidelines and recommendations.19,21,22,23 
Samples will be measured in anti -dasiglucagon antibody screening and confirmatory assays. Due 
to the limited sample volume, the ADA characterization of confirmed positive sample s will be 
conducted according to the following priority:  
• Establishment of anti -dasiglucagon binding titer.  
• Cross -reactivity against endogenous glucagon  
The neutralizing potential in samples from ADA -positive patients will be evaluated on the basis 
of drug exposure/PD data (steady -state exposure and PG).  
The ADA samples will be analyzed in batches during the trial and any anti -dasiglucagon 
antibody -positive patients (treatment induced or treatment boosted , titer increase above 5 -fold)

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 40 of 84 
will be monitored at an additional follow -up visit, preferably 16 weeks after last ADA -positive 
sample. Patients who complete the trial before the ADA screening and confirmatory assays have 
been approved by the FDA and who do not continue treatment in the long -term extensio n trial 
will have this additional visit 16 weeks after the end of trial  visit (Visit 8).  Patients who are 
tested ADA positive after the additional Follow -up Period will be categorized as having 
persistent antibodies.  
It will not be possible to collect back -up ADA samples for long -term storage due to limited 
blood volume in these patients. However, any residual serum samples may be stored until 
approval of market authorization since further characterization of the antibody response may be 
request ed. 
Specimen Handling Requirements  
The transmission of infectious agents may occur through contact with contaminated needles and 
blood or blood products. Consequently, appropriate blood and body fluid precautions should be 
employed by all trial personnel i nvolved in the collection of blood and handling of specimens in 
both the clinic and laboratory settings. Refer to current recommendations of the appropriate 
authorities.  
In addition to appropriate handling of patient samples, specific regulations exist reg arding the 
shipment of biologic/etiologic samples. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and 
shipping of infectious samples are outlined in the laboratory manual. The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that all trial samples that are to be tra nsported to another location are 
packed and shipped appropriately according to the applicable regulations.   
Evaluation of Laboratory Values  
The normal ranges of values for the laboratory assessments in this trial will be provided by the 
responsible laborat ories and submitted to the sponsor before the beginning of the trial. They will 
be regarded as the reference ranges on which decisions will be made.  
If a laboratory value is out of the reference range, the investigator must evaluate if the value is 
clinica lly significant and record his or her assessment in the appropriate eCRF.  
All laboratory values that in the investigator’s opinion are clinically relevant during or after 
termination of the treatment have to be reported as AEs and followed, as described in  
Section  12.3. 
11.2.3.2.  Clinical Examinations  
Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO 2 will be measured 
while the child is sleeping or in a calm state at times specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Section  18.1). Vital signs can be performed using the beds ide monitoring device as per standard 
of care.  
Twelve -lead Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed while the child is sleeping or in a calm state at times 
specified in the Schedule of Events (Section  18.1). If it is not practical or possible, then a 2 -lead 
ECG may be used.24 If arrhythmia is detected  on a 2 -lead ECG, t his should be followed by 
12-lead ECG. All ECG recordings will be identified with the patient number, date, and time of 
the recording and will be a ttached to his or her medical record.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 41 of 84 
The ECG parameters (heart rate, PQ, QRS, QT, and QTcF) and any abnormality will be recorded 
and described in the eCRF, including the investigator’s assessment of clinical significance 
(Abnormal, Clinically Significant;  or Abnormal, Not Clinically Significant). At subsequent 
visits, any clinically significant deterioration of a pre -existing condition, as well as any new 
clinically significant findings, will be recorded as AEs.  
Echocardiogram  
An echocardiogram will be per formed according to the time points specified in the Schedule of 
Events (Section  18.1). 
Physical Examination and Neurological Examination  
A complet e physical examination of body systems according to standard of care and an 
age-appropriate neurological examination will be performed according to the Schedule of Events 
(Section  18.1). 
Local Tolerability  
Local tolerability data will be collected separately from AEs. Within the eCRF, data will be 
collected on the nature of any reaction (erythema, pain, swelling, etc.), the severity (mild, 
moderate, or severe), and any action taken (e.g.,  no action, interruption of infusion). The likely 
cause of the reaction will also be collected (e.g., insertion site, drug, adhesive dressing).  
Other skin findings will be collected along other AEs. If clinical suspicion of NME is made, data 
describing the lesion(s) will be collected as an AE of special interest (AESI) (see Section  12.1.8 ), 
togethe r with a photograph or series of photographs of the lesion(s) uploaded to a central 
repository.  
Assessment of Fluid Balance for Patients Receiving IV Glucose  
Fluid balance assessments are to be performed and documented at least every 8 hours as long as 
the patient is hospitalized and receiving IV glucose. These assessments will include administered 
IV and oral fluids, fluid loss from stools and urine by weighing of diapers, and vital signs of fluid 
balance status.  Furthermore, daily body weight will also be  part of the individualized assessment 
based on the patients overall status, at investigator’s discretion. According to Section 9.5, the 
investigator s hould evaluate whether the IV glucose concentration should be  increased to avoid 
volume overload or whether oral/gastric non -nutritional carbohydrates are to  be introduced to 
ensure the patient’s safety whilst maintaining the maximum tolerable concentration and infusion 
rate of IV glucose.  
All details on IV GIR (including any bolus given) will be recorded in the eCRF.  
11.2.3.3.  Reporting of Hypoglycemia Events  
All hypog lycemic episodes are to be reported via the dedicated hypoglycemia eCRF form. 
Hypoglycemic episodes that fulfill the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) should also be 
recorded as an SAE. The following information should be collected:  
• Date, start t ime 
• PG value  
• Selected symptoms (e.g., unconsciousness, seizures)

• Intervention, type, and amount of food; route of administration (oral vs. NG 
tube/gastrostomy); and use of marketed glucagon as rescue therapy  
• Subsequent PG measurements  
• End time and PG value  (time when PG exceeded a threshold of 70 mg/dL [3.9  mmol/L])  
• Contact to trial doctor or emergency services, paramedic visit, ER admission, 
hospitalization, if applicable  
A single hypoglycemia episode is defined as up until 60 minutes from the start of the  episode. If 
normoglycemia (>70 mg/dL) is not reached within this time, a new episode of hypoglycemia will 
be recorded.  
11.2.3.4.  Technical Complaints  
Reporting of Technical Complaints  
Technical complaints should be reported to the sponsor on any of the following pr oducts if 
technical issues occur between the first and last use:  
• Dasiglucagon 4 mg/mL / placebo vial containing 1 mL  
• Accu -Chek Spirit pump  
• Accu -Chek Spirit 3.15 mL Cartridge system, Accu -Chek Flex -Link Infusion set 
(Accu -Check UltraFlex Infusion set in the US), and Accu -Check Rapid -D Link infusion set  
• Accu -Chek Link -Assist Insertion device  
• SMPG meter, StatStrip Xpress2  
• Dexcom G4 /G6 system s (in Germany, only the Dexcom G6 CGM will be used ) 
The investigator must report whether the technical complaint is as sociated with any AEs or 
SAEs. Any AE/SAE associated with a technical complaint must be reported in accordance with 
Section  12.2; the relationship b etween the technical complaint and the AE/SAE must be assessed 
by the investigator.  
Technical complaints must be reported on a dedicated technical complaint form.  
The investigator must complete the technical complaint form in the eCRF according to the 
following timelines, starting from the time the trial site becomes aware of the technical 
complaint:  
• Technical complaint assessed as related to an SAE within 24 hours  
• Technical complaint which could have led to serious medical occurrence if either suitable 
action had not been taken, if intervention had not been made, or if circumstances had been 
less fortunate within 24 hours  
• All other technical complaints within 5 calendar days  
Use Trial the paper technical complaint form when reporting a technical  complaint for an item 
that is not yet allocated to a patient. The form should be sent by e -mail to e-mail address in the  
Appendix  A.

Collection, Storage, and Shipm ent of Technical Complaint Items  
The investigator must collect and store the item(s) and notify the CRA (including photo 
documentation) within 5 calendar days  of obtaining the item at the trial site. Upon request, the 
CRA must coordinate the shipment as pe r instruction from  the sponsor.  
11.2.3.5.  Adverse Events  
The definitions and management of and special considerations for AEs are provided in 
Section  12. 
12. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials 
are crucial for the protection of patients, investigators, and the sponsor, an d are mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide.  
12.1. Definitions  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial patient administered a medicinal 
(investigational or noninvestigational) product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a product, whether or not related t o the product  or medical device . 
AEs include:  
• A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness  
• A clinical laboratory AE: a clinical abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e., any 
abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires 
active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, 
e.g., change of dose or more frequent follow -up due to the abnormality.  
The following should not be considered as AEs:  
• Pre-existing  conditions, including those found as a result of screening procedures 
(pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness).  
• Preplanned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial -related activity after the patient has signed the informed 
consent.  
12.1.2.  Severity  
When assessing the severity of an AE, the following definitions are used:  
Mild:  No or transient symptoms, no interference with the patient's daily activities  
Moder ate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the patient's daily activities  
Severe:  Considerable interference with the patient's daily activities, which the patient find 
unacceptable. A severe reaction does not necessarily deem the AE as serious (SAE),  and an SAE 
is not always severe in nature.

04-Jun-2021  Version: Final v14.0 (Germany)  
  
AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 44 of 84 
12.1.3.  Causality  
When assessing the cause of an AE, the following definitions are used:  
Probable:  Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  
Possible:  A causal relationship is conceivable a nd cannot be dismissed  
Unlikely:  The event is most likely related to etiology other than the product  
Not related:  No relationship to product.  
Causality will take into consideration whether the cause of the AE was related to the trial drug, 
device, or procedures.  
12.1.4.  Outcome  
When assessing the outcome of an AE, the following definitions are used:  
Recovered/resolved : The patient has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment, the 
condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial -related activity after the patient 
signed the ICF  
Recovering/resolving:  The condition is improving and the patient is expected to recover from 
the event. This term is only applicable  as final outcome of an event  if the patient has completed 
the trial or has die d from another AE  
Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The patient has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment, or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE  
Not recovere d/not resolved:  The condition of the patient has not improved and the symptoms 
are unchanged, or the outcome is not known  
Fatal:  This term is only applicable if the patient died from a condition related to the reported 
AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in  a patient before he/she died should be assessed as 
“recovered/resolved,” “recovering/resolving,” “recovered/resolved with sequelae,” or “not 
recovered/not resolved.” An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE  
Unknown:  This term is only applicable if the patient is lost to follow -up. 
12.1.5.  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of the following:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or  prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• is otherwise medically important and may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization ma y be considered an SAE when (based on appropriate medical judgement) 
it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in the definition of an SAE. Examples could be ER or home treatment 
of allergic bronchospasm or convulsion

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 45 of 84 
12.1.6.  Other Important Events  
The following events must always be reported in the electronic data capture (EDC) system on a 
dedicated form, regardless of whether it is related to an AE:  
• suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product  
• overdose of the trial product  
• medication error involving the trial product  
• inadvertent or accidental exposure to the trial product  
12.1.7.  Nonserious Adverse Events  
A nonserious AE is any AE that does not fulfill the definit ion of an SAE.  
12.1.8.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For this trial, the following events are to be regarded as AESIs, with data collected under a 
specific eCRF form:  
• Suspicion of NME  
• Risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL AND total bilirubin >2  x UNL, 
where no alternative etiology exists (Hy’s law).  
• Loss of consciousness, partial, and generalized seizures  
• Clinically significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate  
12.1.9.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
An AE is considered a suspected  unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) if the nature or 
severity is not consistent with the applicable product Reference Safety Information (RSI). For 
dasiglucagon, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the 
RSI section of the investigator’s brochure.  
12.1.10.  Adverse Events Associated with Devices  
Adverse events  associated with devices must be reported to the ethics committee and competent 
authority according to local requirements. Such events include the following:  
12.1.10.1.  Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical device. 
This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, 
deployment, installation, operation, or any mal function of the investigational medical device. 
This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the 
investigational device.  
12.1.10.2.  Serious Adverse Device Effect  
A serious ADE  (SADE) is an ADE  that has resulted in an y of the consequence characteristics of 
an SAE, meaning that the SAE is related to one  of the investigational devices.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 46 of 84 
12.1.10.3.  Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipated SADE  (USADE) is a n SADE  which by its nature, incidence, severity, or 
outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.  
12.1.10.4.  Device Deficiency  
A device deficiency is the inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability,  reliability, safety, or performance. It also includes malfunctions, use errors, and 
inadequate labelling. In th is clinical trial, these are covered by  the term technical complaint  (see 
reporting requirements  in Section  11.2.3.4 ). Reporting of technical complaints is synonymous 
with device deficiency. The device deficiencies will be monitored and managed by the sponsor 
throughout the trial.  
12.2. Collection, Recording, and Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether serious or nonserious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is 
obtained unt il the end of the posttreatment follow -up period (which may include contacts for 
follow -up of safety)  or inclusion in the ZP4207 -17106 trial . Parent(s)/guardian will be asked 
about their child’s condition by open questioning, such as “How has your child be en feeling 
since you were last asked?” at each contact with the trial site (visit or telephone). 
Parent(s)/guardian  will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other 
time during the trial. In addition, patients will be observed for  any signs or symptoms.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to the trial drug, must be 
recorded and evaluated by the investigator. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when 
signs and symptoms are due to a common e tiology. If no diagnosis can be made, the investigator 
should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs. Investigators must record their opinion 
concerning the relationship of the AE to the trial drug. All measures required for AE 
management must be r ecorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.  
Each AE must be reported on the AE eCRF within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event.  
All AE information should at a minimum include the following:  
• Date and ti me of onset  
• Date and time of investigator's first information about the AE  
• Seriousness  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship with trial product  
• Measures taken due to AE  
• Interruption or discontinuation of treatment with trial product  
• Date and time of resolution and final outcome  
Each AE will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  
All SAEs, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days after the last 
dose of trial drug, must be report ed within 24  hours after obtaining knowledge about the event by

completing the SAE form in the EDC system. A separate SAE form should be completed for 
each SAE.  
All SAEs will be reported in EDC; for each reported event a system -generated e -mail will be 
sent to the safety CRO ( ), medical monitor, sponsor medical director, and trial 
manager.  
Specific information about AESIs will be collected via the SAE form (if qualifying for an SAE), 
as well as via the dedicated AESI eCRF page(s). Reporting requ irements for serious and 
nonserious AEs as described previously also apply for serious and nonserious AESIs.  
Other important events (Section 12.1.6 ) will be reported via a dedicated eCRF page. Reporting 
timelines will be within 24 hours if related to an SAE, and 5 calendar days for all other events.  
It is the responsibility of  to report all SUSARs that occur in this trial to competent 
autho rities, the institutional review board (IRB), or independent ethics committee (IEC) in 
accordance with the local requirements in force and ICH guideline for GCP.  
All SAEs, SADEs , and USADEs must be reported to the ethics committee and competent 
authority a ccording to local requirements.  
12.2.1.   Serious Adverse Event Reporting Process in Germany  
The Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte ( BfArM)  is to be informed about 
events as defined per Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, and the Ordinance on Medical 
Device Vigilance Section 3, Sub -section 6.  
The Principal Investigator must report all SAEs  and events with SADE potential to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours via the eCRF. Device - and/or procedure -related SAEs and events with SADE 
potential occurring in Germany will be reported individually by the Sponsor to the BfArM 
immediately by using the SAE Form available on the BfArM website. Device - or 
procedur e-related SAEs and events with SADE potential  occurring in all other countries in this 
trial will be reported by the Sponsor to the BfArM immediately using the European Medical 
Device Vigilance System  (MEDDEV) 2.7/3 SAE Reporting Form. Serious adverse even ts 
deemed unrelated to the device and the procedure, occurring both in Germany and in all other 
countries, will be reported by the Sponsor to BfArM quarterly by using the MEDDEV 2.7/3 SAE 
Reporting Form next to the procedure laid out in the protocol.  
12.2.2.  Conta ct Information  
Pharmacovigilance for this trial is outsourced to ; refer to Appendix  A for contact 
details.  
12.3. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The investigator must  record follow -up information on the eCRF for nonserious adverse event 
and on the SAE form for serious adverse events. Follow -up questions to investigators regarding 
serious adverse events are queried directly by  to the investigator.  
Follow -up information must be reported according to the following:  
• SAEs:  All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the events is “recovered/resolved,” 
“recovered/resolved with sequelae,” or “fatal,” and until all queries have been resolved. 
Cases of chronic cond itions, cancer, or AEs that are ongoing at time of death (where death is 
due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 48 of 84 
recovered/not resolved.” Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” 
when the patie nt has completed the follow -up period and is expected by the investigator to 
recover.  
The SAE follow -up information should only include new (e.g., corrections or additions) 
information and must be reported within 24 hours  of the investigator's first knowledge of the 
information. This is also the case for previously nonserious AEs which subsequently become 
SAEs.  
• Nonserious AEs:  Nonserious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is  
“recovered/resolved,” or “rec overed/resolved with sequelae” or until the end of the follow -
up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these 
AEs have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer, or AEs that are ongoing at 
time of de ath (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome of 
“recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved.” Cases can be closed with the 
outcome of “recovering/resolving” when a patient has completed the follow -up period and is 
expecte d by the investigator to recover  or if the patient continues in the extension trial .  
If a potential hypersensitivity reaction is observed, additional blood samples, as clinically 
indicated, may be required to further characterize the potential hypersensit ivity reaction. If an 
anaphylactic shock is suspected, samples may be taken for the measurement of tryptase. In this 
case, a blood sample should be taken 3  to 4 hours after the event and again approximately 
1 to 2 weeks later to determine tryptase baseline  levels. In addition, assessments for elevated 
histamine levels may be considered.  
The investigator must ensure that the worst -case severity and seriousness of an event is kept 
throughout the trial, from the start of trial product administration (i.e. the most severe of the 
applied severity/seriousness categories should be ascribed to the event). Accordingly, for AEs 
with onset after trial product administration, changes in the severity or seriousness of an event 
should not lead to reporting of separate AEs . In contrast, for AEs with onset before trial product 
administration, any worsening of severity/seriousness after trial product administration should be 
recorded as a separate AE, with onset date of the event corresponding to the date of the 
severity/seri ousness upgrade. Similarly, AEs with onset during the blinded treatment  that worsen  
after the switch to the second blinded treatment or to the unblinded treatment , should be recorded 
as separate AE s. 
If an AE is resolved and re -appears later then it should be reported as a new AE.  
Queries or follow -up requests must be responded within 14 calendar days from the date of 
receipt of the request, unless otherwise specified in the follow -up request.  
12.4. Precautions  
Normal precautions taken for a clinical trial , including the provision of emergency equipment, 
will be taken during this trial. Qualified and well -trained physicians and medical staff will 
instruct patients’ parent (s)/guardian . During a patient’s participation in the trial, the investigator 
should en sure that adequate medical care is provided to patients for any AEs, including clinically 
significant laboratory values related to the trial. The investigator should inform the patient’s 
parent (s)/guardian  when medical care is needed for intercurrent illne sses of which the 
investigator becomes aware.

12.5. Safety Committee  
An internal Zealand Safety Committee is constituted to perform ongoing safety surveillanc e of 
clinical trials with dasiglucagon, including this trial.  
If safety signals or concerns are observed, whether based on reported SAEs, review of all AEs 
and laboratory parameters reported, or any other notification of significant findings, the Safety 
Committee will respond appropriately to protect the safety of the patients. The Safety Committee 
meets quarterly and on an ad hoc basis as needed.  
12.6. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established for th is trial and follow 
the procedures outlined in the DMC Charter.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
This section details the null hypotheses for this trial. They are presented in the form H ij, where 
i = trial part (i = 1, 2) and j = hypothesis number (j = 1,  2, 3, 4, 5).  
The hypothesis relates to the primary endpoint of mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each 
treatment period during Part 1. Formally, the hypothesis is:  
H11:  Mean IV GIR dasiglucagon  = Mean IV GIR placebo  
The hypotheses relating to the key secondary endpoints (based on the last 48 hours of each 
treatment period in Part 1) are: 
H12:  Total amount  (g) of carbohydrates administered (regardless of the route) per day 
dasiglucagon  = total amount  (g) of carbohydra tes administered (regardless of the route) 
per day  placebo  
A fixed -sequence statistical strategy will test  first the primary (Section 7.2.1 ) and  then the key 
secondary endpoints of Part 1 (Section  7.2.2 ), all at the same significance level (α  = 0.05, 2 -sided 
test), moving to the next hypothesis only after rejecting the previous null hypothesis.  
The test hierarchy is:  
Part 1  
H11: Mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period during Part 1 (primary 
endpoint)  
H12: Total amount  (g) of carbohydrates administered  (regardless of the route)  per day  
(key secondary endpoint)  
13.2. Sample Size Determination  
A total of 12 patients is planned to  be randomized and exposed to trial product in this crossover 
trial on the basis of the following consid erations.  
The GIR results from 40 infants treated with IV glucagon for 24 hours published in the JIMD 
Research Report “The Effect of Continuous Intravenous Glucagon on Glucose Requirements in 
Infants with Congenital Hyperinsulinism.”14 
“Overall there was a statistically significant reduction in the median (IQR) GIR during the 24h 
following initiation of continuous glucagon infusion compared to 24 h before initiation 
(18.5  (12.9, 22.8) to 11 (6.6, 17.5) mg/kg/min…”  
This trial is powered to detect an effect in GIR for dasiglucagon after 48 hours compared to 
placebo of at least this effect size. Based on the longer infusion and titration of dasiglucagon  in 
this trial, this is considered a conservative approach, allowing for some uncertainty when 
translating the published data into a clinical trial setting. Using unpublished individual patient 
data from the above -referenced study, the difference in GIR be tween the 2 treatment groups is 
assumed to follow a normal distribution. Assuming the true mean difference is 7.5 mg/kg/min 
with a standard deviation of differences of 7.36, the trial will have 89% power using a 1 -sample 
t-test with 12 patients randomized to receive either placebo first and then dasiglucagon or vice 
versa.

13.3. Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations have been defined for this trial:  
• The Safety Set: defined as all patients administered any randomized treatment.  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS ): defined as all patients in the Safety Set who have a valid 
baseline efficacy assessment.  Patients will be analyzed according to randomized treatment 
(Part 1) or overall patients (otherwise).  
• Per protocol (PP) set: defined as all patients in the FAS with out any major protocol 
deviations. Patients will be excluded from the PP set if they do not receive both treatments 
and/or do not have efficacy data available to evaluate the primary endpoint for both 
treatments.  
• Pharmacokinetic Set (PK): defined as  all pa tients in the Safety Set who have at least 1 
measurement with quantifiable plasma concentration of dasiglucagon.  
The primary analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the FAS. 
Supportive  analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the PP. All 
safety analyses will be based upon the safety analysis set.  
Inclusion in the analysis populations will be determined prior to database lock.  
For the primary endpoint, baseline is defined as the IV GIR rate obtained at  the end of the run -in 
period which corresponds to the last value obtained before randomization. During the 24 -hour 
run-in period, all non -nutritional carbohydrates and carbohydrate fortification of feeds are 
prohibited as this might impact the GIR level a nd result in many updates during the run -in 
period. Therefore the IV GIR rate obtained at the end of the run -in period will give a better 
estimate of the stabilized value of GIR. For the second period of the cross over (Part 1), the IV 
GIR is also started a t the IV GIR obtained at the end of the run -in period. For the purpose of all 
other  efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the 
start of trial drug administration on Day 1.  
13.4. Statistical Analyses  
This s ection  presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) that describes the details of the analyses to be conducted will be finalized prior to database 
lock.  
Unless otherwise indicated, testing of statistical signif icance will be 2 sided with a significance 
level of α = 0.05.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time poi nt and summarized descriptively; the exception to this is the time of PG within 
prespecified ranges, which will not have a baseline value. For categorical endpoints, descriptive 
summaries will include counts and percentages.  
All data will be presented in t he data listings.  
Immunogenicity data will be analyzed descriptively. No statistical tests are planned. Baseline 
ADA -positive patients will be calculated as a percentage of the total number of patients whose 
baseline samples were tested for ADA. Overall AD A incidence, the combined results of 
treatment -induced and treatment -boosted ADA -positive patients will be calculated as a 
percentage of the total number of evaluable patients, excluding baseline positive patients without

any samples available after drug a dministration. Titers will be reported as median and 
interquartile range.  
Graphical presentations of selected endpoints will be prepared and will be outlined in the SAP.  
13.4.1.  Trial Patients and Demographics  
13.4.1.1.  Disposition and Withdrawals  
The numbers of patients randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated overall and by treatment sequence . The number of patients in each 
analysis population will be reported.  
13.4.1.2.  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol devia tions will be provided in a listing and summarized if appropriate.  
13.4.1.3.  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, and length) 
at screening will be summarized using desc riptive statistics. No formal statistical analyses will be 
performed.  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be summarized by treatment sequence 
(prior medications and procedures) or treatment and part (concomitant medications and 
procedures ), by the number and percentage of patients taking each medication, classified using 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classes and 
preferred term (PT).  
13.4.2.  Duration of Exposure and Compliance  
Trial drug administration (i .e., amount administered) will be summarized in terms of each 
patient’s mean, mode, and final dose, and in terms of duration of exposure. Descriptive statistics 
for these quantities, including the mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, and quartiles, will be 
provided by treatment and part . 
13.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
13.4.3.1.  Primary Analysis  
The mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period during Part 1 will be analyzed for 
the FAS and PP population s. The hypothesis:  
H11:  Reduction in weighted mean IV GIR dasiglucagon  = Reduction in weighted mean 
IV GIR placebo  
will be based  the last 12 hours of each treatment period , calculated as a weighted mean across the 
12 hours, taking the actual time periods between the measurements into account (correspo nding 
to calculating the area under the curve [AUC] and dividing by the length of the time period , 
i.e., weighted mean IV GIR ). The IV GIR endpoint is expressed as glucose in mg/kg/min, i.e., 
data reported from different concentrations of the glucose used for infusion will be transformed 
to this standardized unit prior to analysis.  
The primary analysis is defined by the estimand based on the treatment policy (de -facto) 
strategy, where the actual GIR measurement reported irrespective of adherence to treatmen t or

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 53 of 84 
use of subsequent therapy is used. The reduction in weighted mean IV GIR between placebo and 
dasiglucagon will be estimated.  
The weighted  mean  IV GIR will be analyzed using a  mixed -model regression approach, with 
treatment  and period  as fixed effects  and patient as a random effect . The 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the treatment difference will be calculated from the mixed  regression model.  
Missing data will be imputed using the following methodology: if the weighted mean I V GIR is 
missing for the placebo period, it will be imputed using the baseline weighted mean IV GIR; if 
the weighted mean IV GIR is missing for the dasiglucagon period, it will be imputed using the 
placebo -weighted mean IV GIR for that patient. As a sensit ivity analysis, the primary endpoint 
will be re -analyzed as follows: 1) using only complete cases (i.e., weighted mean IV GIR is 
non-missing for both placebo and dasiglucagon) and 2) imputing missing weighted mean IV GIR 
using the baseline weighted mean IV  GIR and 3) imput ing missing dasiglucagon values during 
one period with the placebo value for th at patient  and imputing missing placebo values with the 
mean values of placebo patients for that period . 
13.4.3.2.  Key Secondary Analyses  
The hypothesis:  
H12:  Total amou nt (g) of carbohydrates administered (regardless of the  route) per day   
dasiglucagon  = total amount (g) of carbohydrates administered  (regardless of the  route) 
per day placebo   
between the 2 treatment groups will be analyzed by using a mixed -model  regression approach, 
with treatment  and period  as fixed effects  and patient as a random  effect. The total amount  (g) of 
carbohydrates administered (regardless of the  route) per day  is the sum of the last 48 hours of 
each period in Part 1.  
For the key seco ndary endpoint, 2-sided 95% CIs for the treatment differences  will be estimated 
from the mixed -model.  Missing dasiglucagon values during one period will be imputed  with the 
placebo value for that patient  and missing placebo values will be imputed with the mean values 
of placebo patients for that period . In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using 
complete cases.  
13.4.3.3.  Secondary and Other Efficacy Analyses  
Part 1  
A mixed -model regression approach wil l be used to analyze the weighted mean IV GIR  over 48-
hour treatment period during Part 1 (dasiglucagon or placebo administration) similar to the 
primary analysis for the primary endpoint.  
A generalized estimating equation (GEE) method wit h a logit link fu nction will be used to 
analyze the weighted mean IV GIR  below 10 mg/kg/min in  the last 12 hours of each treatment 
period during Part 1 (yes/no) (dasigluca gon or placebo administration) to account for repeated 
observations in patients.  In case of non -conver gence , a Mc Nemar test will be used.  
No sensitivity analysis will be used on th ese endpoints.  
Part 2  
Due to the potential impact of pancreatectomy on the secondary endpoints during Part 2, any 
endpoint assessment after pancreatectomy will not be included i n the primary analyses

(endpoints set to missing after pancreatectomy). Sensitivity analyses will be run on those 
endpoint s including all assessment s in the descriptive analyses.  
For Part 2  efficacy endpoints, continuous and categorical endpoints will be p resented using 
summary statistics or frequencies, respectively; no formal testing will be performed.  For the time 
to complete weaning off IV GIR, the time to actual hospital discharge and the time to pancreatic 
surgery, Kaplan -Meier curves will be produced . 
13.4.4.  Safety and Tolerability Analyses  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section  13.3). Safety assessments will include the evaluation of AEs; clinical laboratory 
assessments (hematology, biochemistry, and ADAs); vital signs, physical examinations; ECGs, 
echocardiography, and local tolerability issues. No formal inferential analyses will be conducted 
for safety variables, unless otherwise noted.  
Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing assessment before the first exposure to  trial drug in the 
trial. 
All safety analyses will b e summarized by treatment received within treatment period and part 
and by trial visit, if applicable.  
13.4.4.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA.  
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as an AE with an onset at the t ime of or following the start 
of treatment with the trial drug through the  Follow -up Visit or Early Termination Visit, 
whichever occurs first.  
The number and percentage of patients with AEs , as well as the number of AEs,  will be 
displayed by system organ c lass, PT, and treatment group. The incidence of AEs will also be 
presented by severity and relationship to the trial drug. Serious AEs , AESIs  and AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of trial drug will be summarized separately in a similar manner. Patient list ings 
of AEs, SAEs, AESIs, and AEs causing discontinuation of trial drug and withdrawal from the 
trial will be produced.  
13.4.4.1.1.  Serious Adverse Events Associated with Devices  
The number and percentage of patients with SADEs, as well as the number of SADEs, will b e 
displayed by system organ class, PT and treatment group. Patient listing of SADEs will include 
information whether it was expected (yes/no), identification of the study device or a device 
procedure to which the SAE is considered related and will be produ ced in addition to listings of 
SADEs causing discontinuation of trial drug and withdrawal from the trial.  
Similar listings will be prepared for ADEs reported in German patients.  
13.4.4.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minim um, and maximum) of actual (absolute) values 
and changes from baseline values will be presented for clinical laboratory values.  
The number of patients with clinical laboratory values categorized as below, within, or above 
normal ranges will be tabulated sh owing change from baseline (shift tables) for each clinical 
laboratory analyte.

Laboratory values that are outside the normal range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with corresponding normal ranges. Any out -of-range values that are identif ied by the 
investigator as being clinically significant will also be shown in a data listing.  
13.4.4.3.  Vital Signs  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from baseline will be calculated for systolic blood pressu re, diastolic blood pressure, 
heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO 2. 
The number of patients with vital signs values categorized Abnormal, Clinically Significant or 
Abnormal, Not Clinically Significant  will be tabulated showing change from baseline (shift 
tables) for each parameter.  
13.4.4.4.  Twelve -lead Electrocardiograms  
The number and percentage of patients with normal and abnormal ECG findings will be 
summarized. Abnormal results will be grouped as Abnormal, Clinically Significant or Abnormal, 
Not Clinically Sign ificant.  
13.4.4.5.  Echocardiograms  
The number and percentage of patients with normal and abnormal echocardiogram  findings will 
be summarized. Abnormal results will be grouped as Abnormal, Clinically Significant or 
Abnormal, Not Clinically Significant.  
13.4.4.6.  Physical Examination Findings  
The number and percentage of patients with normal and abnormal findings in the complet e 
physical examination will be displayed.  
13.4.4.7.  Local Tolerability  
The number and percentage of patients with local tolerability findings, collected separately from 
AEs, will be summarized.  
13.4.5.  Interim Analysis

14. TRIAL CONDUCT  
The accu racy and reliability of data are ensured, among others, by the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate trial sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
associated personnel before the trial, periodic monitoring visits, and meticulous data 
management.  
14.1. Sponsor and Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1.  Sponsor Responsibilities  
The sponsor is obligated to conduct the trial in accordance with strict ethical principles 
(Section  16). The sponsor reserves the right to terminate participation of a trial site at any time 
(Section  14.7), and/or to discontinue the trial (Section 14.6 for US studies and Section  14.6.2  for 
studies conducted outside of the US).  
The sponsor agrees to provide the investigator with sufficient material and support to permit the 
investigator to conduct the trial according to the trial protocol.  
14.1.2.  Investigator Responsibilities  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement (Section  18.2), the investigator indicates that he/she has 
carefully read the protocol, fully understands the requirements, and agrees to conduct the trial in 
accordance with the procedures and requirements described in this protocol.  
The investigator also agrees to conduct this trial in accordance with all laws, regulations, an d 
guidelines of the pertinent regulatory authorities, including the November 2016 ICH Guidance 
for Industry E6(R2) GCP, and in agreement with the 2013  version of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
While delegation of certain aspects of the trial to subinvestigat ors and trial coordinators is 
appropriate, the investigator will remain personally accountable for closely overseeing the trial 
and for ensuring compliance with the protocol and all applicable regulations and guidelines. The 
investigator is responsible for  maintaining a list of all persons that have been delegated 
trial-related responsibilities (e.g., subinvestigators and trial coordinators) and their specific 
trial-related duties.  
Investigators should ensure that all persons who have been delegated trial -related responsibilities 
are adequately qualified and trained in the protocol, trial drugs handling, and their specific duties 
within the context of the trial. Investigators are responsible for providing the sponsor with 
documentation of the qualifications,  GCP training, and research experience for themselves and 
their staff as required by the sponsor and the relevant governing authorities.  
To ensure compliance with the guidelines, the trial may be audited by an independent person. 
The investigator agrees, b y written consent to this protocol, to cooperate fully with compliance 
checks by allowing access to all trial documentation by authorized individuals.

14.2. Site Initiation  
Trial personnel may not screen or enroll patients into the trial until after receiving notification 
from the sponsor or its designee that the trial can be initiated at the trial site. The trial site will 
not be authorized for trial initiation until:  
1. The trial site has received the appropriate IRB/IEC approval for the protocol and t he 
appropriate ICF.  
2. All regulatory documents have been submitted to and approved by the sponsor or its 
designee.  
3. The trial site has a Clinical Trial Agreement in place.  
4. Trial site personnel, including the investigator, have participated in a trial initiati on meeting.  
The regulatory documents must be received from the investigator before the sponsor will 
authorize shipment of trial drug to the trial site, Regulatory Green Light. Copies of the 
investigator’s regulatory documents must be retained at the trial site in a secure location in the 
ISF. Additional documents, including a copy of the protocol and applicable amendment(s), the 
dasiglucagon IB, eCRF completion guidelines, copies of regulatory references, copies of 
IRB/IEC correspondence, and trial drug acc ountability records should also be retained in the ISF. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that copies of all required regulatory documents 
are organized, current, and available for inspection.  
14.3. Screen Failures  
Patients who fail inclusion and /or exclusion criteria may be rescreened for the trial upon 
approval by the sponsor and medical monitor. Patients may only be rescreened once 30  days or 
more after the original Screening Visit. If a patient is eligible to enter the trial after having 
previ ously failed screening, the patient will be assigned a new patient identification number.  
14.4. Trial Documents  
All documentation and material provided by the sponsor for this trial are to be retained in a 
secure location and treated as confidential material.  
14.4.1.  Investigator’s Regulatory Documents

safety and rights of the patients are respected, (ii)  compliance with the protocol, GCP, and 
applicable regulations and guidelines, and (iii) that accurate, valid, and complete data are 
collected . The assigned CRA(s) will visit the investigator and trial site at peri odic intervals and 
maintain periodic communication, this are described in detail in the Monitoring Plan . The 
investigator agrees to allow the CRA(s) and other authorized sponsor personnel access to ISF 
and source data  (original documents, data, and records ). The CRA(s) will maintain current 
personal knowledge of the trial through observation, review of trial records and source 
documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the trial with the investigator and staff. While 
on site, the CRA(s) will review:  
• regulatory documents  
• entries in the EDC system compared with the source documents  
• consents  
• adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• AE records  
• storage and accountability of trial drug and trial materials  
• adherence to the protocol and ICH -GCP  
The CRA(s)  will ask for clarification and/or correction of any noted inconsistencies. Procedures 
for correcting eCRFs are described in the Trial Reference Manual. As representatives of the 
sponsor, CRAs are responsible for notifying project management of any noted p rotocol 
deviations.  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement (Section  18.2), the investigator agrees to meet with the 
CRA(s) during trial site visit s; to ensure that trial staff is available to the CRA(s) as needed; to

14.6.2.  Premature Trial Termination  
The trial may be terminated prematurely for any reason and at any time by the sponsor, the 
IRBs/IECs, regulatory authorities, re spective steering committees, or the coordinating 
investigator. A decision to terminate the trial prematurely is binding to all investigators at all trial 
sites.  
Within 15  days of premature termination of a clinical trial, the sponsor or its designee and/o r site 
will notify the IRBs/IECs and regulatory authorities on the premature termination as required 
according to national laws and regulations. The sponsor or its designee must clearly explain the 
reasons for premature termination.  
If the trial is termina ted prematurely, all investigators must inform their patients and take care of 
their appropriate follow -up and further treatment to ensure protection of their interests. Trial sites 
may be asked to have all patients currently participating in the trial com plete all of the 
assessments for an Early Termination Visit.  
14.7. Trial Site Closure  
At the end of the trial, all trial sites will be closed. The sponsor may terminate participation of a 
trial site at any time. Examples of conditions that may require premature termination of a trial 
site include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Noncompliance with the protocol and/or applicable regulations and guidelines  
• Inadequate patient enrollment  
14.7.1.  Record Retention

The investigator shall keep copies of these trial records (and all trial -related documents, 
including source data) f or the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or 
private practice.  
14.7.2.  Sample Retention  
Samples will only be used for purposes related to this trial.  
All b lood samples will be destroyed upon completion of the CTR, except for residual AD A 
samples, which will be stored until approval of market authorization because further 
characterization of the antibody response may be requested by the health authorities. Identifiable 
samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of the patient.  
14.8. Changes to the Protocol  
This protocol cannot be altered or changed except through a formal protocol amendment, which 
requires the written approval of the sponsor. The protocol amendment must be signed by the 
investigator and approved by the IRB/IEC before it  may be implemented. Protocol amendments 
will be filed with the appropriate regulatory agency(s) having jurisdiction over the conduct of the 
trial. 
14.9. Use of Information and Publication  
All information concerning dasiglucagon, the sponsor’s operations, patent  applications, 
formulae, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, and formulation information supplied 
by the sponsor or its designee to the investigator and not previously published, is considered 
confidential and remains the sole property of the s ponsor. Case report forms also remain the 
property of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to use this information for purposes of trial 
execution through finalization and will not use it for other purposes without the written consent 
of the sponsor.  
The i nformation developed in this trial will be used by the sponsor in connection with the 
continued development of dasiglucagon and thus may be disclosed as required to other clinical 
investigators or government regulatory agencies.  
The information generated b y this trial is the property of the sponsor. Publication or other public 
presentation of dasiglucagon data resulting from this trial requires prior review and written 
approval of the sponsor. Abstracts, manuscripts, and presentation materials should be pro vided to 
the sponsor for review and approval at least 30  days prior to the relevant submission deadline.

15. FINAL CLINICAL TRIAL REPORT  
The sponsor will retain ownership of the data.  
The final CTR will be prepared and reviewed in cooperation with the signatory investi gator. The 
coordinating investigator will be appointed by the sponsor to review and sign the CTR on behalf 
of all participating investigators. This report will include a summary of the trial results based on 
a statistical evaluation and clinical assessment  of the protocol -defined endpoints.  
The final CTR may be submitted to the regulatory authorities.  
16. ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1. Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the November 2016 ICH Guidance for Industry 
E6(R2) GCP (including archiving of essential trial documents), the 2013  version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the applicable regulations of the country(ies) in which the trial is 
conducted.  
See Appendix B for regulation and guidelines.  
16.2. Patient Information and Informed Consent  
According to the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP, patients’ parent(s)/guardian must 
provide their written infor med consent prior to enrollment in a clinical trial and before any 
protocol -specified procedures are performed. Patients’ parent(s)/guardian must declare their 
consent by personally signing and dating the ICF. The written ICF will embody the elements of 
informed consent as described in the Declaration of Helsinki and will also comply with local 
regulations.  
Each patient’s parent(s)/guardian should be made aware by the investigator of the nature of the 
trial (objectives, methods, and potential hazards and b enefits) and the procedures involved using 
the information on the ICF. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever 
possible and deemed appropriate by the IRB/IEC. Patients’ relatives, or, if necessary, legal 
representatives must be g iven ample opportunity to inquire about details of the trial.  
Patient information and the ICF must be in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective 
patient’s parent(s)/guardian. The written information must be provided to the patient’s 
parent(s)/g uardian to give him or her sufficient time to understand the information and to prepare 
questions before being asked for his or her consent. The investigator must confirm that the text 
was understood by the patient’s parent(s)/guardian. The patient’s paren t(s)/guardian will then 
sign and date the IRB/IEC -approved consent form indicating that he or she has given his or her 
consent for his or her child to participate in the trial. The signature confirms that the consent is 
based on information that has been u nderstood. The form will also be signed by the investigator 
obtaining the consent and annotated with the trial patient number. Each signed patient 
parent(s)/guardian ICF must be kept on file by the investigator for possible inspection by 
regulatory authori ties, the sponsor, and/or the sponsor’s designee. Collection of informed consent 
has to be documented on the eCRF.  
Furthermore, the patient’s parent(s)/guardian will be informed that if he or she wishes to 
drop-out or withdraw his or her child (see Section  9.2.3 ) at any time during the trial, this will not 
have any negative consequences. Patients may be withdrawn by the investigator if any change

related to safety or ethics precludes further participation in the trial. Patients’ parent(s)/guardian 
will be asked to agree to a final assessment in the event of an early termination of the trial.  
If information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue 
participating in the trial, the investigator must inform the patients’ parent(s)/guardian in a timely 
manner, and a revised written informed consent must be obtained.  
Patients’ parent(s)/guardian will be informed that data  from their children’s case may be stored 
in a computer without inclusion of their name and that such data will not be revealed to any 
unauthorized third party. Data will be reviewed by the monitor, an independent auditor, and 
possibly by representatives o f regulatory authorities and/or IRBs/IECs. The terms of the local 
data protection legislation will be applied as appropriate.  
16.3. Approval by Institutional Review Board and Independent Ethics Committee  
For Investigational New Drug studies, the minimum standard s of conduct and requirements for 
informed consent are defined in the FDA regulations.  
A valid IRB/IEC must review and approve this protocol before trial initiation. Written 
notification of approval is to be provided by the investigator to the sponsor’s mo nitor and project 
manager before shipment of investigational drug supplies, and will include the date of the 
committee’s approval and the chairperson’s signature. This written approval must consist of a 
completed sponsor form, IRB/IEC Approval Form, or wri tten documentation from the IRB/IEC 
containing the same information.  
Until written approval by the IRB/IEC has been received by the investigator, no patient may 
undergo any procedure not part of routine care for the patient’s condition . 
Protocol amendments must also be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC. Written approval 
from the IRB/IEC, or a designee, must be received by the sponsor before implementation. This 
written approval will consist of a completed IRB Approval Form or written documentat ion from 
the IRB/IEC containing the same information.  
16.4. Finance and Insurance  
Details on finance and insurance will be provided in a separate agreement between the 
investigator and the sponsor.

20. ADDENDUM  
20.1. Administrative Information  
The Coordinating  Investigator for Germany is:  
  
  
  
  
  
A list of all participating investigational sites , including name, address , and professional position 
of the Principal Investigator for each site is maintained in the trial master file .  
20.2. Device Information  
This clinical trial is being conducted solely to investigate the safety and efficacy of dasiglucagon  
usage in children with CHI. More information can be found in Section 6.2. 
This clinical trial is not being conducted to verify claims and new intended performance  of the 
medical device s. No risks and device effects will be formally assessed , but only  collected and , if 
appropriate, reported to the applicable bodies. The planned devices are only being used for the 
administration of dasiglucagon and  to measure  glucose le vels since no other approved device s 
are available as an alternative for this rare disease . The protocol will be submitted to competent 
authorities and ethics committees for approval. If additional requirements are imposed by these 
bodies, those recommenda tions will be followed.  
20.2.1.  Planned Devices  
20.2.1.1.  Pump System Accu -Chek Spirit Combo  
The planned drug delivery pump Accu -Chek  Spirit Combo System with its components as 
described in Section 10.3 will be used to administer the investigational drug dasiglucagon. The 
Accu -Chek Spirit Combo Pump is a portable, battery -operated pump indicated for subcutaneous 
or intraperitoneal continuous delivery of insulin for the management of diabetes mellitus in 
persons requiring insulin as prescribed by a physician. It is a CE -marketed Class  IIb product 
under the EC  directive 92/42/EEC and is also in conformity with the EU directive 1999/5/EC on 
radio  and telecommunications terminal equipment. The manufacturer is Roche Diabetes Care 
GmbH, Sandhofer Str . 116, 68305 Mannheim - Germany.  
The pump system consists of the following components:  
• Programmable Accu -Chek Spirit Combo pump with a display screen  
• Adapter that connects the cartridge to the infusion set  
• Batteries and battery key  
• Sterile disposables:  
o Accu -Chek Spirit 3.15 -mL cartridge with luer -lock connection  
o Infusion sets:  
▪ Accu -Chek FlexLink Infusion set  
▪ Accu -Chek Ultraflex

▪ Accu -Chek  LinkAssist insertion tool  
▪ Accu -Chek Rapid -D Link Infusion set cannula  
▪ Accu -Chek Rapid -D Transfer Set  
The single -use disposable infusion sets and sterile cartridges are packed in sealed pouches and 
are sterilized with ethylene oxide. Pictures of the pump an d system components are provided in 
the ZP4207 -17103  Trial Materials Manual for further information. Additional available 
accessories for the Accu -Check Spirit Combo System are an alcantara pouch in black and a 
neoprene pouch in white with a belly belt.  
The trial sites will be supplied with the pumps and their components and will be asked to 
document receipt of this equipment. Each pump will be identified by a serial number that will be 
used for accountability and traceability; the device will be labelled “ for investigational use only .” 
The trial sites must store the devices in a secure area with restricted access and at the storage 
conditions indicated in the user manual (+5 °C – 45°C). After a patient is enrolled into the trial, 
one (1)  pump device will be  allocated exclusively to this patient ; disposables are not accounted 
for. Upon completion of the trial and if the patient is not continuing in the ZP4207 -17106 trial, 
the pump must be returned to the site. The site will ship all returned pumps (with the ex ception 
of those continu ing in 17106 trial)  back to the sponsor upon completion of the trial. 
The Roche pump is CE -marked and marketed in Germany, and it can administer very low doses. 
The pump is designed to deliver 0.05 to 25.0 units of U -100 insulin per hour in basal rates, which 
correspond s to 2 to 1000  μg dasiglucagon per hour. This dosing accuracy allows reliable dosing 
of dasiglucagon between 10 and 70 μg per hour in the clinical trial. Further, this pump has been 
used in pediatric diabete s treatment in the EU since 2010. However, the Accu -Chek Spirit 
Combo pump system will not be used within its approved indication.  The pump will be used for 
the administration of the investigational glucagon analogue dasiglucagon for the indication of 
CHI.  Additional compatibility testing and assessments were performed to ensure that the 
Accu -Check Spirit Combo pump system and its components are not adversely affected by using 
dasiglucagon instead of insulin. Also, testing was performed to ensure that dasig lucagon is stable 
and effective when administered via this pump system. The general management of the device, 
as well as the duration of contact of the pump material and infusion sets with human tissue,  will 
be based on the approved intended use of the dev ice. The complete infusion set will be changed 
every 2 days (48  hours) for the Accu -Chek Rapid -D link infusion set, and every 3 days 
(72 hours) as a maximum for the Accu -Chek Flex Link infusion set. Only the application and 
dosage of dasiglucagon via the Ac cu-Chek pump system requires a n off -label change in practice 
compared to the procedure described in the general instruction for use for Accu -Chek Spirit 
Combo pump system. The pump is programmed to reflect doses of insulin in units (U), whilst 
dasiglucagon  requires weight -based dose administration (μg). The  site staff and the patient’s  
parent(s)/guardian(s) will be instructed  on the procedures for filling the content of the trial drug 
vials into the cartridge to be used in the infusion pump and how to conve rt dasiglucagon (μg) 
into units (U) as shown on the pump display. For  this purpose an extensive, trial-specific 
instruction for use  was developed to accommodate the training of site staff and the patient’s 
parent(s)/guardian(s) as described in Section 10.12 .

20.2.1.2.  Self-Monitoring Plasma Glucose StatStrip Xpress2  
To assess plasma glucose levels and events of hypoglycemia, SMPG measurements will be 
taken. Th e plasma glucose level will be assessed at least 3 times daily and in case s of suspected 
hypoglycemia throughout the trial.  
The hand -held StatStrip Xpress2 meter GLU/KET from Nova Biomedical is to be used to 
measure glucose and ketone levels in the design  of the trial. The ketone measurement will only 
be performed by trial staff when the patient is in the clinic.  
The SMPG mete r manufactured by Nova Biomedical is a small (size of 98.0 × 64.0 ×  22.9 mm 
and a weight of 78. 5 g) battery -powered meter. Blood sample strips are inserted and glucose (in 
mg/dl or mmol/L) and ketone values (in mmol/l) will be displayed on the screen. Func tion and 
data selection are done by choosing 1 of 3 buttons. Up to 400 measurements can be stored in the 
device memory.  
The test strip is designed with an electrode that measures glucose levels. Glucose in the blood 
sample mixes with reagent on the test st rip, which  produces an electric current. The amount of 
current that is produced depends on the amount of glucose in the blood. The electrical current is 
detected by the monitor and displayed as the glucose value. The test strip is designed such that 
when a  drop of blood touche s the end of the strip, the blood is drawn into the reaction space via 
capillary action. Test strips are available in cartons of 100 strips: 50 strips/vial. Additionally a 
QC control glucose/ketone solution is provided to test device  functionality.  
The manufacturer Nova Biomedical Corporation, 200 Prospect Street, Waltham, MA 
02454 -9141 – USA  (European Authorized Representative Nova Biomedical U.K.; Innovation 
House Aston Lane South, Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 3FY, UK ) have self -declared con formity 
with the EU Directive 98/79/EC In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive . This SMPG 
device is marketed as an In Vitro Diagnostic Device. The SMPG device is intended for in -vitro 
diagnostic use by health care professionals and for point -of-care u sage in the quantitative 
measurement of glucose in fresh capillary, venous, arterial, and neonate whole blood ; it can also 
be used for  quantitative determination of beta-hydroxybutyrate -ketone in fresh capillary and 
venous blood samples. It is not intended  for diagnosing or screening for diabetes.  
The SMPG  device  is reusable with single -use test strips. The SMPG  device  is not sterile ; 
however,  the strips themselves are in  sterile  packaging . Once the vial containing the strips is 
opened, the single strips ma y be used for 180 days or until the expiration date printed on the 
label has been reached, whichever comes first. The patient ’s blood  will be drawn via single -use 
lancing devices and a drop is applied  to the strip. The strip is then inserted into  the device and the 
glucose level is displayed.  
The rationale for selecting this device for the clinical trial is that this blood glucose meter is the 
only one approved for use in neonates in an intensive care unit setting, based on its accuracy and 
exten sive testing for possible concomitant medication interference . No BG meter for use by lay 
person in the home care setting is approved for the age group <1 year . To ensure consistency of 
data between the hospitalized and home -care periods in the trial, it was deemed preferable to 
continue with the same BG meter, rather than change to ones approved for use by lay persons in 
home -care settings, but that were not approved for this specific age group . 
The trial sites will be supplied with the StatStrip Glucose X press2 meter and the StatStrip 
Glucose and ketone test strips by the sponsor , and are asked to document the receipt of the

material. Each SMPG is identified by a serial number that will be used for accountability and 
traceability and the device is labelled  as “for investigational use only .” The trial sites are asked to 
store the devices in a secure area with restricted access at the storage conditions indicated in the 
user manual (+ 1°C – 30°C); the QC Control GLU/KET solution must be stored between +15  –
30°C. After a patient is enrolled into the trial, 1 SMPG device is exclusively allocated to th at 
patient ; disposable  accessories  are not accounted for. Upon completion of the trial and if the 
patient is not continuing in the ZP4207 -17106 trial, the SMPG devic e has to be returned to the 
site. The site will ship all returned SMPG  devices  back to the sponsor upon completion of th e 
trial. 
The same SMPG StatStrip Glucose Xpress2 meter will be used for each enrolled  patient during 
the hospital stay and at home. The home assessments will be performed by the 
parent(s)/guardian (s); however,  the use of the device by a lay -person is outside the intended 
purpose. The risk resulting from this deviation from the intended pur pose will be  minimized by 
offering extensive training of the parent(s)/guardian (s) by the site staff, before independent 
measurements are performed.  
Upon return to the site, the SMPG data will be uploaded to a tablet provided to the site 
personnel. The trial tablet is loaded with  the applicable software for sending the SMPG data to 
the Vitalograph Web Portal.  
20.2.1.3.  Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System  
In Germany, only the Dexcom G6 CGM will be used . The Dexcom  G6 is indicated for detecting 
trends and tracking patterns in patients  (aged 2 and older) with diabetes. The system  is intended 
for use  by patients at  home and  in healthcare facilities. It is designed to replace  fingerstick blood 
glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions.  The system aid s in the detection of episodes of 
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long -term therapy adjustments, 
which may minimize their excursions. Interpretation of CGM results should be based on the 
trends and patterns noted  in several sequent ial readings over time.  
The G6 system components include the following :  
• Sensor (Disposable)  – comprises a sensor applicator, an adhesive pad, transmitter mount, 
and the sensor probe. The sensor can be worn for up to 10 days. The sensor is a sterile 
device inserted by the user into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen or buttucks using 
the appl icator for that purpose. The applicator is attached to the surface of the skin with a 
standard medical grade adhesive pad. The applicator is a 26 -gauge introducer needle that 
contains the sensor probe. The needle is not exposed, or even visible, to the use r during the 
insertion process. After deployment of the introducer needle, the needle is retracted back 
into the applicator. The sensor probe remains beneath the surface of the skin and uses the 
enzyme glucose oxidase to convert the glucose in the intersti tial fluid around the sensor into 
an electrical current proportional to the ambient glucose concentration. The applicator is 
detached and discarded by the user, exposing a transmitter mount ready for placement of the 
transmitted current and signal.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 77 of 84 
• Transmi tter – The G6 transmitter transmits data with Bluetooth wireless technology. After 
sensor insertion and removal of the applicator, the user manually places the transmitter into 
the transmitter mount on the adhesive pad already attached to the skin. The tra nsmitter 
contains all the electrical circuitry necessary for the operation of the electrochemical sensor 
and to transmit the sensor signal to the receiver via Bluetooth wireless technology. The 
transmitter collects the small electrical current from the sen sor and transmits the sensor 
signal wirelessly to the receiver at regular 5 -minute intervals. The transmitter is reusable and 
can be used for repeated 10 -day sessions by a single user for up to three months.  
• Receiver  – The G6 receiver is a small hand -held device that receives the Bluetooth wireless 
technology signals from the transmitter. The receiver contains a rechargeable battery. In 
typical use, the receiver may last approximately 2 days before requiring recharging. The 
user must maintain the receiver w ithin 6 meters or less of the transmitter, which is attached 
to the sensor on the body. The receiver also contains calibration and signal processing 
algorithms required to convert the sensor electrical signal to glucose values.   
Other accessories include t he following:  
• Receiver USB charging  / download cable  
• Alternating c urrent (AC) power adapter  
• User’s guide s 
• Training checklist  
The manufacturer is Dexcom, Inc. located at 6340 Sequence Drive – San Diego, CA 92121 
United States of America . The European Author ized Representative is MediTech Strategic 
Consultants B.V., Maastrichterlaan 127 -129, 6291 EN Vaals, the Netherlands. The f ollowing 
device classifications and rules were applied to demonstrate co mpliance  with the Medical Device

The system components (applicator, transmitter housing, insertion needle and sensor are sterilized 
via electron beam radiation using the (VD)max25 method. Transmitters and receivers are not sterile 
products.  
The trial  sites will be supplied with the Dexcom CGM system by the sponsor and are asked to 
document the receipt of the material. Each CGM is ide ntified by a serial number which will be 
used for a ccountability and traceability and the device is labelled as “for investigational use

only.” The trial  sites are asked to store the devices in a secure area with restricted access at the 
storage conditions indicated in the user manual:  
• Sensors (+2 °C – 25°C) 
• Transmitter and receiver (0 °C – 45°C)  
After the patient is enrolled into the trial, a CGM device is allocated exclusively to this patient; 
disposable materials are not accounted for . Upon completion of the trial, the CGM must  be 
returned to the site. The site will ship all returned CGMs back to the sponsor upon completion of 
this trial.  
Congenital hyperinsulinism  is characterized by frequent, often severe episodes of hypoglycemia 
due to over -secretion of insulin regardless of  blood glucose. Therefore , CHI  closely mimics the 
exogenous insulin overdose occurring in insulin -dependent diabetes management.  The 
CGM  device is being used in this clinical trial to confirm potential treatment effects on a 
conti nuous basis.   
The rational e for selecting the Dexcom G6 CGM device for this clinical trial is that it can be used 
in a blinded mode. By using the blinded mode, the patient’s parent(s)/guardian(s) and the 
investigator will not be able to make any treatment decisions or change behavi or based on the 
CGM readings.  
The Dexcom G6 CGM system  will be used by the  patient during the hospital stay , as well as at 
home . For the purpose of this trial the device will be used outside the intended purpose in regard 
to the age of the patients (7 days  to 12 months instead of 2 years and older) and in regard to the 
indication (CHI instead of Diabetes).  No mechanical or design changes have been  made to the 
device. The CGM device is used as intended according to the CE mark, except for the age group 
and t he disease. The essential requirements testing performed for CE marking is assessed 
applicable for proposed use. Additionally, literature shows that CGMs have been successfully used 
in infants and neonates .26 The risk resulting from this deviation from the intended purpose , in terms 
of age , will be  minimized by offering extensive training to parent(s)/guardian (s) by the site staff, 
before the devi ce and its components are used independently.  
The results of the CGM assessments are blinded for review by  patient(s)/parent(s)/guardians and 
trial staff. The display will be visible and the menu functions available for the user, but the display 
will not s how any measurements nor will any alarm go off based on the measurements. The 
Dexcom G6 CGM does not require calibration.  
At every patient’s onsite visit, the site staff will transfer data of the CGM device via the CENDUIT 
Data Agent, after the device has been initially registered within the CENDUIT IRT system. Full 
instructions on data transfer are available in the CENDUIT user manual.  
20.2.1.4.  Other Medical Devices  
The f ollowing medical devices will be used within their intended purpose during this trial: 
• BD Lance t – BD Microtainer® CAL – contact -activated lancet  
• Disinfecting wipes (alcohol pads)  
• Disinfecting wipes – Diabete ezy  
The provided devices are disposable ; they will be provided to the patient but not accounted for.

20.2.2.  Risk Evaluation for Off-label Use of Devices  
20.2.2.1.  Anticipated Clinical Benefit of Planned Devices  
The main aim of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug 
dasiglucagon. To achieve this, the Accu -Chek Spirit Combo Pump system, the  Self-Monitoring 
Plasma Glucose StatStrip Xpress2  and Dexcom G6 CGM device are utilized in this trial outside 
their intended use. There is no direct clinical benefit anticipated by using the Accu -Chek  Spirit 
Combo Pump except the administration of dasiglucagon and therefore , only an indirect benefit can 
be anticipated, resulting from the drug administration as referenced in Section 6.3.5 . The clinical 
benefit of the SMPG is to help to assess if patients undergo hyper/hypoglycemic events requiring 
adjustments to gastric and oral feeds  or dose . For the usage of the CGM, there is no direct clinical 
benefit anticipated for the patients, but the CGM data will help to confirm treatment effect s 
independent from parents’/guardi ans’ ability to suspect hypoglycemia.  
20.2.2.2.  Risks Associated with the Planned Devices and their Control  
A risk analysis according to EN ISO 14971:2012 was performed specifically for risks related to 
the off -label use of the planned devices, to identify and mitigate potential risks due to the off -label 
use of the devices. The analysis rated risks based on the ir probability of occurrence and the severity 
of their consequence. Unacceptable risk levels were defined and risks, meeting this definition were 
mitigated as far as possible to get to an acceptable level. Results of the risk analysis were entered 
into a r isk management report. The identified risks were evaluated and risk mitigation measures 
were and will be implemented throughout this trial. The main task to mitigate the risks is to educate 
site staff, parents and guardians on the proper use of the devices  to minimize the risks associated 
with the off -label use.  
The f ollowing residual risks were identified, which will be specifically addressed in the planned 
training of the users and thereby risks will be mitigated:  
Accu -Chek® Spirit Combo Pump System and Self-Monitoring Plasma Glucose (SMPG) 
meter (Nova Biomedical / Xpress2 GLU/KET)  
Training will cover the following aspects:  
• Recognition of hypo - and hyperglycemia in the patient  
• Response to hypo - and hyperglycemia  
• Usage of the devices according to the instructions for use in the trial 
• Communication between patients/ parents/guardians  and the medical professionals of the 
trial team.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 80 of 84 
Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device  
The training will cover the following aspects:  
• Avoid to cover the sensor by the diaper in babies  
• Avoid that the transmitter is grabbed by baby by covering it with bandage or clothes  
• Avoid that the transmitter is misplaced under diaper area or child pollutes around diaper 
area 
Additionally, the assess ment identified other risks caused by potential Accu -Chek® Spirit Combo 
pump system/drug interaction e.g. unintentional misappropriation of drug delivery or hazards 
caused by direct drug/device interactions. These potential risks were assessed by additiona l 
compatibility and in -use stability testing and no unacceptable risk was noticed. Flow -rate 
assessments were performed and a conversion table for the use of dasiglucagon in the  
Accu -Chek® Spirit Combo pump system was developed and tested in a Human Factor  trial. This 
conversion table was included with further instructions in a trial specific “Instruction for Use”  
for the combination of dasiglucagon with the pump system. By this measure the risk of 
misappropriation of drug delivery was reduced to an accept able level.  
20.2.2.3.  Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatment  
The use of the planned devices is not expected to interfere with other concomitant medical 
treatments, except those treatments referenced in Section 10.11.2 . 
20.2.2.4.  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
At the present time there are no known CE Marked devices intended for the delivery of 
dasiglucagon for the treatment of CHI. Additionally, there are no known devices intended to 
monitor glycemic control in children with CHI. Since there are no devices curr ently approved to 
treat this condition, off -label use of the Accu -Chek Combo Insulin pump system, Dexcom G6 
CGM and Nova Biomedical / Xpress2 GLU/KET for the purpose of delivering dasiglucagon and 
monitoring glucose levels potentially presents a beneficial  alternative to the standard clinical 
practices of current treatment options, continuous gastric infusion and pancreatectomy for 
controlling CHI.  
The most relevant risks resulting from the off -label use in terms of their potential to cause harm in 
relation ship to their probability are the following:  
• Lay persons using devices which are not used according to their intended use e.g. perform 
and interpret blood glucose measurements  
• Lay person applying devices which require invasive procedures at home for very y oung 
children in skin areas which might be contaminated due to the expectable uncleanliness of 
babies and the fact that they might carry diapers.  
To evaluate the risks and the benefits of the clinical trial, the duration of the trial and the effect of 
the foreseeable risks during the trial period are compared to the current standard of care (SoC) 
treatment for CHI. This comparison is done without taking the possible positive results of the 
trial into account. A positive trial outcome would most likely resul t in a change in the treatment 
of CHI towards a continuous delivery of dasiglucagon with devices that are proven to be save in 
use by children.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 81 of 84 
In general, the current SoC treatment for patients with CHI bears higher risks than risks 
associated with the cl inical trial participation. The current risks associated with the SoC 
treatment result from:  
• Continuous application of glucose rich liquids via intravenous infusion (infection, skin 
injury, thrombi, contamination, dosage and content errors, risk of volume overload)  
• Frequent tube feedings or gastric infusions  
• For patients on diazoxide treatment, the more common side effects comprise hypertrichosis, 
fluid retention, and gastrointestinal symptoms  
• For patients on somatostatin analog (octreotide or lanreotide [l ong acting]) possible side 
effects include necrotizing enterocolitis, gallstones, and hepatitis  
• Pancreatectomy (and its related exo/endocrine complications, particularly the development 
of insulin -dependent diabetes)  
• Local wound infection  
Irrespective if the patient participates in the planned clinical trial or is treated by SoC, 
parent(s)/guardian (s) need to be able to detect and respond to hypoglycemic events, therefore the 
risk of not noticing such a situation is not increased by participating in the tr ial. The blood 
glucose measurements are performed by SMPG s, where the general functionality of the device 
can be considered as being equivalent to the proposed Nova Biomedical SMPG. It can be 
concluded, that there will be no additional risks for the clinic al trial participants by using the 
Nova Biomedical SMPG compared to patients who do not take part in the clinical trial, provided 
the users are adequately trained.  
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of dasiglucagon in  reducing 
glucose requirements in children with persistent CHI requiring continuous IV glucose 
administration to prevent/manage hypoglycemia. The clinical trial aims to determine practicable 
procedures for treating CHI with dasiglucagon that can eliminate,  minimize or postpone the need 
for continuous application of glucose via intravenous infusions, frequent tube feedings or 
continuous gastric infusions and finally, pancreatectomy in the treatment of children with CHI. 
This will significantly reduce the ris ks for the patient’s health. The nature of the residual risks 
introduced by the off -label use of the devices selected for the clinical trial is similar to the risks 
which already exist in the treatment of these patients and their severity is only minor. Th e most 
relevant risks result from the usage of the CGM  device  which is not intended to be used directly 
for the patient care in the trial. However, the duration of the trial will be shorter than the duration 
of the disease or of its long -term side -effects (either of the disease or the treatment). Thus, the 
potential benefit of a positive trial outcome is estimated higher than the risks introduced, 
especially when taking into account the risks which are present by the current SoC treatment of 
CHI. 
20.3. Device -related Safety  Section  
20.3.1.  Anticipated  Adverse Device Effects  
The following anticipated ADEs may be associated with the use of these medical devices, 
together with those associated with the application of dasiglucagon. All AEs and ADEs will be 
assessed if they meet the requirements for competent authority reporting.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 82 of 84 
The following device -related possible complications/AEs are anticipated:  
20.3.2.  Pump System Accu -ChekSpirit  Combo  
• Ketoacidosis, hypo- or hyperglycemic events resulting from  incorrect pump usage , a 
damaged pump , or infusion set blockage27,28 
• At infusion site:  
- Local infecti on 
- Irritation  
- Local pain  
- Redness  
- Swelling  
- Lumps  
- Heat  
• Strangulation if tubing becomes wrapped around the neck  
20.3.3.  Self-monitored  Plasma Glucose  StatStrip Xpress2  
Since the StatStrip Xpress 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use outside the 
body,  only the following limited ADEs are expected:  
• Hypo - or hyperglycemic events due to incorrect usage or damaged meter or strips  
• Indirectly related to SMPG: Local infections caused by the single -use lancing devices to 
obtain blood  
20.3.4.  Continuous  Glucose Monitoring  Dexcom G6 
The following events are possible ADEs of inserting a sensor or wearing the adhesive patch:  
• Local infection  
• Inflammation  
• Pain or discomfort  
• Bleeding at the glucose sensor inserting site  
• Bruising  
• Itching  
• Scarring or skin discol oration  
• Hematoma  
• Tape irritation  
• Sensor or needle fracture during insertion, wear of removal  
The f ollowing risks are inherent to the device, but not anticipated for the trial since  the device 
will be used in a blinded manner  and no treatment decisions will be  based on the CGM results. 
However, there are potential risks due to missed alerts, false alerts, false -negative hypoglycemia , 
hyperglycemic readings , false -positive hypoglycemi a, and hyperglycemia readings by the device. 
There are additional possible risks if the system inaccurately calculate s the rate of change of 
glucose.29

20.4. Protocol Clarifications  
20.4.1.  Informed  Consent  
A patient is considered enrolled in the trial as soon as the patients’ parent(s)/guardian(s) 
(according to local law) have signed the EC -approved ICF.  
20.4.2.  Vulnerable Population  
As discussed in Section 8.1 children between the ages of 7 days and 12 months with CHI will be 
enrolled in this clinical trial. The informed consen t process is referenced in Section  9.2.1 , 
Inclusion Criteria, Section  11, Trial Procedures, and Section 16.2, Patient Information and 
Informed Consent. No vulnerable patients other than children are planned to be enrolled in this 
trial and no enrollment under an emergency situation is allowed.  
20.4.3.  Addition to Statistical Section  
• Drop -out rate : The drop -out rate is expected to be low as the trial period is short and the 
primary endpoint is evaluated within the first 96 hrs after randomization . 
• Pass/ fail criteria: No pass/fail criteria were defined since  no trial endpoints are device 
related . 
• Criteria for termination of trial on statistical grounds: N/A. Please refer to 
Section  13.4.5  Interim Analysis.  
• Procedures for reporting deviation from statistical plan: Since  no medical device data 
will be evaluated  statistically, no reporting of deviations from statistical plan are anticipated 
in regard to the devices.  
• Enrollment rate per investigational site: Anticipated enrollment for the German clinical 
trial sites is 0  – 5 patients per German site. For analysis involving trial site, if the number of 
patients per site is small, sites may be pooled for analysis, or omitted from statistical 
models. The final determination will be made prior to database lock.  
20.4.4.  Protocol  Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as an event where the  investigator or site personnel did not 
conduct the trial  according to the protocol. Investiga tors are not allowed to deviate from the 
protocol unless it is necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of a patient in an 
emergency situation. Those emergency situations or other unforeseen circumstances that are 
beyond the investigator’s cont rol, e.g., the patient did not attend scheduled visits or blood 
samples were lost by the laboratory, are still considered deviations. Deviations will be reported 
to the sponsor, regardless of whether or not they are medically justifiable or done to protect  the 
patient in an emergency. All deviations will be reported in a timely manner on a protocol 
deviation form.  
In addition, the investigator is required to adher e to the ethics committee procedures for 
reporting protocol deviations. International regulatory body regulations require that investigators 
maintain accurate, complete, and current records, including documents showing the dates of and 
reasons for each dev iation from the trial protocol. The site will receive a list of all site -specific 
deviations upon completion of the trial.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 84 of 84 
Deviations include, but are not limited to the following list:  
• Failure to obtain informed consent prior to conducting trial-specific activities  
• Incorrect version of patient information and/or ICF used 
• Patient did not attend a visit or the visit was outside the required time frame  
• Assessments as detailed in the Schedule of Events  (Table 2) were not conducted or were 
performed incorrectly  
• Adverse events and deficiency with SADE potential not reported by investigators within the 
required timeframe as specified in the protocol  
• Source data were permanently lost  
As addressed in Section  14.5.1  of the protocol , the CRA will review the site compliance with 
regard to deviations a t each monitoring visit. The monitor will discuss any deviations directly 
with the investigator and will summarize the findings in a follow -up letter to the site.  
If a trial site deviates from the protocol, those deviations will  be analyzed and re -trainin g on the 
particular topic(s) will be initiated as appropriate , e.g., training on the informed consent process, 
training on visit window adherence , and planned assessment s, etc. Such trainings will be 
documented on the training logs for the applicable roles . If despite all training efforts an 
investigational site continues to deviate from the trial protocol, a site can be discontinued from 
the trial as agreed upon by the Principal Investigator according to his  or her signature on the 
Investigator’s Agreement  in Section 18.2.

DEVELOPMENT 
PHASE  Phase 2/3  
PROTOCOL TITLE  A Randomized Trial in 2 parts: Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Crossover Part 1 and 
Open -label Part 2, Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Dasiglucagon for the 
Treatment of Children with Conge nital Hyperinsulinism  
INDICATION  Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI)  
OBJECTIVES  Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of dasiglucagon in reducing glucose requirements in 
children wi th persistent CHI requiring continuous IV glucose administration to 
prevent/manage hypoglycemia.  
Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasiglucagon administered as a 
subcutaneous (SC) infusion in patients with CHI.  
TRIAL  DESIGN  This is a c ombined phase 2 and 3, randomized, multinational trial to evaluate t he 
efficacy and safety of individually  titrated dasiglucagon in children ≥7 days and <1  year 
of age who have been diagnosed with CHI, compris ing 2 parts, a crossover ( 2 periods, 
48 hours each), double -blind, placebo -controlled Part 1 , and an open -label, si ngle-arm 
Part 2 of 21 days.  
After screening, eligible patients will complete a minimum 24 -hour run -in period to 
confirm the IV glucose randomization requirement (≥10 mg/kg/min). All 
non-nutritional carbohydrates and carbohydrate fortification of feeds are prohibited 
during th is 24-hour run-in period. After the run -in period, patients will be randomly 
assigned in a double -blind fashion to receive dasiglucagon or placebo for 48 hours, after 
which they will be crossed over to the other trial treatment  for an additional  48 hours . At 
the time of crossover, the trial drug will be initiated from the starting dose of 10  µg/hr, 
and IV glucose infusion rate ( GIR) will be set to the rate  obtained at th e end of the run -
in period and titrated accordingly.  
There will be no washout between the 2 periods in Part 1 to limit the length of time in 
which patients are reliant on IV GIR as their only means of preventing/treating 
hypoglycemia. This i s deemed accept able because : 
• The half-life ( t½) of dasiglucagon is short (~30 minutes for the 0.6 mg dose and 
potentially shorter for lower doses, ~22 minutes) relative to the 48 -hour duration of 
each crossover period. Moreover, for the primary endpoint, o nly the last 12  hours of 
the 48 -hour period will be  used for endpoint assessment.  
• Assuming a positive effect of dasiglucagon, the absence of washout is more 
conservative  with respect to key secondary endpoints  since  a potential carry over 
effect of dasiglucagon in Period  2 is attributed to placebo.  
During Part 1, the trial drug and IV GIR should be adjusted according to the 
protocol -specified algorithm. Non -nutritional carbohydrates and/or carbohydrate 
fortification of feeds during Part 1 is only allowed when the maximum tolerable volume 
and concentration of IV glucose for the patient is reached, and should be limited to the 
minimum needed to ensure the patient’s safety. All feedings (administered as parenteral 
nutrit ion, by nasogastric [NG] tube, gastrostomy, or normal ro ute), will be recorded

during this period. Safety assessments will be performed daily after initiation of the trial 
drug (active or placebo).  
After Part 1, patients will continue in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for 
21 days. Additional CHI trea tments can be introduced during Part 2 if needed, if 
up-titration of dasiglucagon  is not possible because of  undesirable side effects or if the 
maximum dose level (70 µg/hr) has been reached. Gradual transfer from IV glucose to 
oral and gastric carbohydrat es should be initiated in Part 2, enabling weaning of IV 
glucose and hospital discharge. Patients will conti nue to be hospitalized u ntil IV GIR is 
weaned off ; however,  as soon as local site criteria for discharge are met, patients can be 
discharged to cont inue the treatment period at home. Visits are planned at Day 11 and 
Day 18 in Part 2. The se visits can be co nverted to telephone visits if appropriate, at the 
investigator’s discretion . On Day 25, the End of Treatment Visit will take place, and 
based on the investigator’s confirmation of continued positive benefit -risk balance, 
patients will be offered the oppor tunity to participate  in the long-term extension trial 
(Trial ZP4207 -17106) to continue dasiglucagon treatment. Patients who do not enter the 
long-term extension trial will have a Follow -up Visit 28 days after their last dose of trial 
drug.  
PLANNED 
NUMBER OF 
PATIENT S A total of 12 patients is planned to be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo first and 
then dasiglucagon or vice versa.  
TRIAL  ENTR Y 
CRITERIA  Eligible patient s will be ≥7 days and < 12 months of age at screening  with a body weight 
of ≥2. 0 kg (4.4 lbs.) and a diagnosis of CHI established based on the following : 
•Hyperinsulinemia  (plasma insulin above the limit of detection of the assay
documented during an event o f hypoglycemia ), and/or
•Hypofattyacidemia  (plasma  free fatty acid <1.7 mmol/L ), and/or
•Hypoketonemia  (beta-hydroxy -butyrate <1.8 mmol/L ), and/or
•Glycemic response  (increase in plasma glucose [ PG] of >30 mg/dL after 1  mg IV
or intramuscular [IM] glucagon administration).
Eligible patients will be dependent on c ontinuous IV glucose to prevent hypoglycemia.  
INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT S Dasiglucagon  injection  4 mg/mL  in a 3 mL vial containing  1 mL  for injection.  
Matching placebo for dasiglucagon injection in a 3  mL vial containing 1  mL for 
injection .  
REFERENCE 
PRODUCT  None  
TREATMENT 
REGIMENS  As long as the patient is receiving IV glucose, PG will be measured and reviewed 
hourly using a hand -held PG meter. The IV GIR will be titrated to achieve glycemia of 
at lea st 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (minimum GIR will be established as the rate up -titrated 
after the patient drops at least once below 70 mg/dL, or 3.9 mmol/ L). When the patient 
is no longer on  IV GIR, the PG will be checked according to local practice, but at leas t 
3 times daily. The PG will be measured using the same trial -supplied hand -held PG 
meter during the entire trial.  
Additionally, blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be sta rted 24  hours 
prior to randomization (using the Dexcom G4 or G6 system) and continued  until the end 
of Part  2. 
Dosing of trial drug  
Dosing of dasiglucagon will approximate continuous infusion by delivering small doses 
at frequent intervals via a  trial-supplied  infusion pump. The adjustment of trial drug 
dosing is closely linke d to the PG level achieved, which in turn will determine the 
adjustments to the IV GIR.

The starting dose of trial drug is 10 µg/hr at t=0. Every 2 hours (t=2, 4, 6h, etc.), the 
dose will be increased by an additional 10 µg/hr until either:  
•The patient is totally weaned off IV glucose, or
•PG during the last 2 hours was constantly above 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L), or
•IV GIR has not decreased despite 2 sequential dose increases (in this situation  the
dose of trial drug product should be maintained until the IV GIR can be further
decreased or until crossover or the end of the treatment period), or
•The ma ximum dose of 70 µg/hr is reached, or
•Adverse events (AEs) emerge that are considered to be rela ted to the trial drug
(e.g., nausea/change in feeding patterns or increased vomiting) and that are limiting
further dose escalation .
The 2 -hour dose-adjustment interval will allow drug plasma levels to approach steady 
state before the dose is further incre ased.  
The cumulative dose will not exceed 1.26 mg over the first 24 hours and 1.68  mg for the 
subsequent 24 -hour periods.  
At the time of crossover from the first 48 -hour period to the second 48 -hour period, the 
trial drug will again be titrated from the st arting dose of 10 µg/hr, and IV GIR will be 
set to the rate obtained at the end of the run -in period and titrated accordingly.  
Part 2 ( Open-label)  
After Part 1, all patients will continue in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for 
an additional  21 days. Since treatment allocation during Part 1 remains blinded, all 
patients are required to initiate dasiglucagon dosing at 10 µg/hr in Part 2, while IV GIR 
in Part 2 should be started at the rate obtained at the end of the run -in period. During 
Part 2, t he dasiglucagon dose, the amount and route of administration of carbohydrates 
(IV GIR, parenteral nutrition, gastric carbohydrate infusio ns, and carbohydrates from 
oral feeds) can be adjusted  at the discretion of the investigator . Plasma glucose should 
be monitored at least hourly to adjust the IV GIR as appropriate and to avoid 
hypoglycemia. Additional concomitant medications, including so matostatin analogs 
and/or sirolimus/ mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitors, may be introduced 
at the investi gator’s discretion if the maximum dose level of dasiglucagon (70 µg/hr) 
has been reached or if further up -titration is not possible due t o undesirable side effects.  
Adjustment of total carbohydrates administered (IV glucose, parenteral nutrition, gastric 
carbohydrate infusions, and carbohydrates from oral feeds) should continue throughout 
this period according to local practice to maintain PG levels in the range of 70 mg/dL  to 
120 mg/dL  (3.9-6.7 mmol/L). The aim will be to obtain stable glucose levels with 
minimum rescue/hypoglycemia -prevention carbohydrates administered by invasive 
routes and to encourage/optimize oral feeds, and achieve we aning off IV glucose. 
Regardless of their discharge status, all patients will be offered the opportunity to 
participate  in the long -term safety extension trial (ZP4207 -17106), providing the 
investigator attests to the positive benefit -risk balance of continued dasiglucagon 
treatment.

ENDPOINTS  Primary endpoint  
Part 1 (Day 1 to 4)  
•Mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period during Part  1
(dasiglucagon or placebo administration)
Key secondary endpoints  
Part 1 (Day 1 to 4, for each 48 -hour treatment period)  
•Total amount  (g) of carbohyd rates administered ( regardless of the route ) per day.
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will 
be calculated at  each time point and summarized descriptively; the excep tion to this is 
the time of PG within prespecified ranges, which will not have a baseline value. For 
categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
All data will be presented in the data listings . 
Analysis Populations  
Four analysis populations have been defined for this trial: 
Safety analysis set: defined as all patients administered any randomized treatment.  
Full analysis set (FAS): defined as all patients in the Saf ety Set who have a valid 
baseline efficacy assessment.  Patients will be analyzed according to randomized 
treatment (Part 1) or overall patients (otherwise) . 
Per protocol (PP) set: defined as all patients in the FAS without any major protocol 
deviations. Pa tients will be excluded from the PP set if they do not receive both 
treatments and/or do not have efficacy data available to evaluate the primary endpoint 
for both treatments.  
Pharmacokinetic Set (PK): defined as all patients in the Safety Set who have at least 1 
measurement with quantifiable plasma concen tration of dasiglucagon.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary analyses of the primary and the key secondary endpoint will be based on 
the FAS. Supportive  analyses of the primary endpoint will be based on the PP.  
Primary Endpoint  
Part 1, Day 1 to 4  
The mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period will be calculated as a 
weighted mean across the 12 hours, taking the actual time periods between the 
measurements into account (corresponding to calculating the area under the curve 
(AUC) and dividing it b y the length of the time period, i.e., weighted mean IV GIR). 
The IV GIR endpoint is expressed as glucose in mg/kg/min, i.e., data reported from 
different concentrations of the glucose used for infusion will be transformed to this 
standardized unit prior t o analysis.  
The primary analysis is defined by the estimand based on the treatment policy (de -facto) 
strategy, where the actual GIR measurement reported irrespective of adherence to 
treatment or use of subseq uent therapy is used. The reduction in weighted mean IV GIR, 
as determined as the difference in weighted mean IV GIR between placebo and 
dasiglucagon, will be estimated.  
The weighted mean IV GIR will be analyzed using a mixed -model regression approach, 
with treatment and period as fixed effects and pati ent as a random effect. The 2 -sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference will be calculated from the 
mixed regression model.

Handling of missing data and sensitivity analyses are defined in the body of the 
protocol.  
Key Secondary Endpo int 
Part 1, Day 1 to 4  
The key secondary endpoint of total amount of gastric carbohydrates administered will 
be analyzed by using a mixed -model regression approach, with treatment and period as 
fixed effects and patient as a random effect.  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse events that begin after the first dose of trial 
drug will be defined as treatment em ergent. The overall incidence of AEs wi ll be 
displayed by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment. The incidence of AEs 
will also be presented by severity and by relationship to the trial drug. Vital signs, 
clinical laboratory measures (including  hematology, biochemistry, and incidenc e of 
anti-drug antibodies [ ADA s]), 12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), echocardiography, 
physical examinations, and local tolerability data will be summarized by treatment, 
where applicable. Out -of-range safety endpoin ts may be categorized as low or high, 
where applicable.  
Safety results will be summarized by treatment received within treatment period and 
part and by trial visit, if applicable . 
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared to provide further  details on 
the methods for statistical  analysis.  
No interim analysis is planned.  
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  A total of 12 patients will be randomized in this crossover trial on the basis of the 
following considerations : 
The GIR results from 40 infants tre ated with IV glucagon for 24 hours published in the 
JIMD Research Report “The Effect of Continuous Intravenous Glucagon on Glucose 
Requirements in Infants with Congenital Hyperinsulinism” (Hawkes et al  2019). 
“Overall there w as a statistically significant reduction in the median (IQR) GIR during 
the 24h following initiation of continuous glucagon infusion compared to 24 h before 
initiation (18.5  (12.9, 22.8) to 11 (6.6, 17.5) mg/kg/min…”  
This trial is powered to detect an effe ct in GIR for dasiglucagon afte r 48 hours 
compared to placebo of at least this effect size. Based on the longer infusion and 
titration of dasiglucagon in this trial, this is considered a conservative approach , 
allowing for some uncertainty when translating  the published data into a clin ical trial 
setting. Using unpublished individual patient data from the above -referenced study, the 
difference in GIR between the 2 treatment groups is assumed to follow a normal 
distribution. Assuming the true mean difference  is 7.5 mg/kg/min with a standa rd 
deviation of differences of 7.36, the trial will have 89% power using a one -sample t -test 
with 12  patients randomized to receive either placebo first and then dasiglucagon or 
vice versa.  
TRIAL  AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION  The sequence and maximum duration of  the trial periods will be as follows:  
1.Screening Period: up to 28 days, including a minimum 24 -hour run -in period

6. INTRODUCTION  
6.1. Background and Rationale  
Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare and challenging disorder in which β -cells in the 
pancreas secrete insulin irrespective of plasma glucose  (PG) concentration, resulting in persistent 
and often severe hypoglycemia.1 Congenital hyperinsulinism affects up to 1 in 50,000  newborns. 
It is typically diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during the neonatal 
period or in infanc y; however , the diagnosis may be made later in childhood. Mutati ons in 
several different β-cell genes  have been described to cause CHI . Hypoglycemia that result s from 
CHI is of particular concern because it is an important cause of brain injury in neonates , infants, 
and children with this disease , which leads to long -term neurological impairme nts.1,2 Up to 
approximately 50% of children with CHI experience  neurodevelopmental abnorm alities caused 
by seve re hypoglycemia that result s from inadequate treatment and/or delays in diagnosis.1,3 
Severe brain damage is the consequence of severe hypoglycemia , which  present s as coma and/or 
long-lasting epileptic seizures in neonate s. Major i ntellectual disability is , therefore , most 
frequent in patients  with neonatal initial onset , whereas hypoglycemia is usually less severe and 
brain damage less frequent in children with CHI diagnosed later in childhood.1 Since  symptoms 
and severity of hypoglycemia can vary and pose a diagnostic challenge in neonates, infants, and 
children with CHI, prompt recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia is critical to reduce the 
risk of long -term neurol ogical c onsequences.  
6.2. Current Tre atment and Unmet Medical Need  
Medical treatment for CHI is focused on chronic therapies to avoid hypoglycemia, as well as on 
rescue therapy during acute episodes of severe hypoglycemia. Available medical therapies 
(mainly diazoxide,  octreotide, or  glucagon  alone or in combination with glucose infusion) are 
often inadequate and accompanied by inability to control PG, as reflected in a large proportion of 
patients requiring sub -total pancreatectomy.4,5,6 With the exception of surgery for focal CHI, 
which is curative in the vast majority of patients, sub -total pancreatectomy for diffuse CHI has 
substantia l inadequacies. A recent retrospective chart review7 showed that 60% of patients who 
underwent near -total pancreatectomy had persistent hypoglycemia after surgery. Moreover, 
96% had developed insulin -dependent d iabetes within 11 years after surgery.  
First-line medical treatment of CHI is diazoxide, which is the only EU - and US -approved drug 
for treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Diazoxide acts to open K ATP channels of the 
pancreatic β -cells, thereby inhi biting insulin sec retion. Unfortunately, many patients with CHI 
are resistant to diazoxide because of mutations in the genes encoding the K ATP channel of the 
pancreatic β -cells.6 For those who respond to diazoxi de treatment, the more common side effects 
comprise hypertrichosis, fluid retention, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms; however, side 
effects are usually not severe. In diazoxide nonresponders, second -line (and  off-label) treatment 
is a somatostatin analo g (octreotide or lanreotide [long acting]), which (among other effects) 
inhibits secretion of insulin and glucagon from the pancreas and suppre sses GLP -1 secretion. 
Factors that limit their use comprise tachyphy laxis, as well as possible side effects, incl uding 
necrotizing enterocolitis, gallstones, and hepatitis.6 
The glycogenolytic effect of glucagon and  its ability to increase PG levels has been confirmed in 
children with CHI or neonatal hypoglycemia .8,9 Administration of marketed glucagon 
(intravenous [ IV] or subcutaneous [ SC] inject ion) is often used in the diagnostic phase of CHI to

stabili ze patients before surgery or initiation of other medical treatments.10 In a retrospective 
review of 55  neonates with resistant hypoglycemia, native glucagon IV infusion achieved a 
median rise in plasma glucose of 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) after  an hour of administration, 
regardless of the underlying cause for the persistent neonatal h ypog lycemia.9 Furthermore, 
glucagon is administered as single SC doses to treat severe hypoglycemic episodes. While IV 
administration of glucagon t o patients with CHI is used short -term in the hospital setting, 
e.g., before pancreatectomy,2,10,11 long-term glucagon treatment is c hallenging since currently 
available glucagon products are unstable and form fibrils within hours after reconstitution.12 
Catheter obstruction and occlusion because of  glucagon instability  were observed daily to 2  to 
3 times weekly in a retrospective review of 9 patients with CHI receiving continuous SC infusion 
of glucagon for weeks or months.11 In another series  of patients, 60% of the patients treated with 
short -term SC glucagon experienced catheter occ lusion.6 Instability of currently available 
glucagon p roducts and the associated risk of dosing errors contributing to hypoglycemic e vents 
is a majo r barrier for using glucagon for long -term treatment of patients with CHI.  
When successfully administered,  long-term home treatment with subcutaneously infused 
glucagon over extended periods (years) has been beneficial,  with a potentially go od safety profile 
as compared to diazoxide and octreotide.6,11,13 
6.3. Dasiglucagon for the Treatment of  Congenital Hyperinsu linism  
6.3.1.  Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon is a peptide analog of human glucagon in development for the treatment and 
prevention of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus and CHI via SC or intramuscular 
(IM) administration. Dasiglucagon is a stable analog of  glucagon that has been specifically 
designed to overcome the issue s with fibril formation and instability in solution observed  with 
marketed glucagon products. Compared to native human glucagon, dasigluca gon also comprises 
29 amino acids. As a result of c hemical modifications (7  amino acid substitutions  compared to 
human glucagon ), the pronounced tendency of glucagon to form fibrils and aggregate has been 
effectively prevented in dasiglucagon . In addition,  the chemical stability in aqu eous media at 
physiol ogical pH has been improved . 
To support the use of dasiglucagon  in the pump  for this trial , compatibility /in-use studies  have 
been performed with  dasiglucagon  4 mg/m L in Roche  Accu -Chek® Combo pump using t he 
Accu -Chek® Spirit 3.15  mL cartridge system and t he Accu -Chek® FlexLink infusion set . The 
studies support an in -use time for up to 6 days  at 37ºC . 
Dasiglucagon has been granted orphan drug designation by the European Commission on 
20 June 2017 for the ‘ treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism .’ Furthermor e, the FDA granted 
an orphan drug designation for the ‘ treatment of hypoglycemia in patients with congenital 
hyperinsulinism (CHI) ’ on 10 August 2017.

6.3.2.  Nonclinical Experience  
The completed nonclinical phar macology program has determined that dasiglucagon is  a specific 
glucagon receptor agonist with comparable in vitro potency to glucagon, promoting a rapid onset 
of PG increase in both normoglycemic and insulin -induced hypoglycemic animals, similar to that 
of glucagon.  
Results of  the toxicity studies with das iglucagon are comparable to what has been reported for 
glucagon. Th ose from chronic toxicity studies with dasiglucagon in rats and dogs are in line with 
the results of short -term toxicity studies, indicat ing that long -term treatment with dasiglucagon is 
safe and that the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects noted do not adversely affect organ function 
following chronic use.  
6.3.3.  Clinical Experience  
Dasiglucagon is being developed to manage patients with CHI 1) as an in itial short -term therapy 
to stabilize PG levels and reduce glucose infusion needs, and 2) as a long -term treatment to help 
maintain euglycemia. Dasiglucagon has not previously been studied in patients with CHI. 
Clinical experience with dasiglucagon comes f rom the following studies in healthy subjects and 
type 1 diabetics.  
The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and PD characteristics of dasiglucagon were 
investigated in 2 phase  1 trials , 3 phase  2 trials , and 2 phase 3 trials . 
ZP4207 -14013 was a phase 1 randomized, double -blind, 2 -part, single -dose t rial designed to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics, PD, safety, and tolerability of dasiglucagon compared to 
GlucaGen®. Part  1 consisted of SC and IM administration of single ascending d oses of 
dasiglucagon in 64 adult healthy volunteers. Part 2 consisted of 2 0 adult patients with type  1 
diabetes using a crossover design with IM administration of 0.7 mg  dasiglucagon. 
GlucaGen  1.0 mg was used as a comparator in both parts of the trial.  
ZP4207-15007 was a phase 1 randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, mult iple-dose trial 
designed to evaluate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of repeated doses of dasiglucagon SC in 
24 healthy adult volunteers. The trial included 3 dose cohorts of 8  healthy volunteers each. In 
each cohort, patients were randomly assigned i n a 3:1  ratio to receive 5 repeated daily doses of 
0.1, 0.3, and 1.0  mg dasiglucagon (n=6) or placebo (n=2).  
After the 2  phase 1 trials were completed, the composition of the dasiglu cagon formulation was 
optimized with respect to its excipients (buffer, to nicity adjusting agent, and stabilizer). The PK 
and PD properties, safety, and tolerability of the optimized formulation were evaluated in the 
phase  2 trial s. 
ZP4207 -15126 was a phas e 2 randomized, double -blind, single -dose trial designed to evaluate 
the P K, PD, safety, and tolerability of a single SC dose of dasiglucagon in the optimized 
formulation (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg) or GlucaGen (0.5 and 1.0 mg) in 58 adult patients with 
type 1 diabetes.  
ZP4207 -16051 was a phase 2 open -label, randomized, crossove r trial designed to evaluate the 
feasibility of using dasiglucagon 1  mg/mL SC in conjunction with insulin in a pump setting 
using an iLet algorithm as part of an automated dual hormo ne pump delivery system in 
12 patients with type 1 diabetes. The primary o bjective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of dasiglucagon compared to marketed glucagon (Lilly Glucagon™). The trial also aimed to 
demonstrate the functionality and accura cy of the iPhone -based bionic pancreas in a controlled,

clinical setting. Patients were randomly assigned to two 1 -day treatment arms: dasiglucagon or 
Lilly Glucagon in the iPhone -based bionic pancreas.  
ZP4207 -16098 was a phase 2 randomized, crossover, dou ble-blind trial designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of dasiglucagon in 23 patients with type 1 diabetes using a 
4 mg/mL formulation of dasiglucagon  (0.03 mg, 0.08 mg, 0.2 mg, and 0.6 mg)  compared to an 
active comparator, Lilly Glucago n. 
ZP4207 -16136 was a phase 3 randomized, double -blind parallel -group safe ty trial designed to 
evaluate the immunogenicity of  dasiglu cagon compared to  GlucaGen in 111 adult patients with 
type 1 diabetes.  
ZP4207 -16137 was a phase 3 randomized, double -blind , parallel -group  trial designed to confirm 
the clinical efficacy and safety  of a single dose of dasiglucagon (0.6 mg) for the rescue treatment 
of hypoglycemia compared to placebo and with reference to GlucaGen (1 mg) in 168 adult  
patients  with type 1 diabetes.  
Overall, no safety concerns were observed for dasiglucagon at the dose s investigated in these 
clinical trials. The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) in each trial was nausea, which is 
a known side effect after administration of g lucagon, and appeared at a similar frequency to 
marketed glucagon, which was used as ac tive comparator in some of the trials. No local 
tolerability issues were reported. Injection site reactions were observed only sporadically after 
administration with das iglucagon, placebo, or marketed glucagon in trials with SC or IM 
administration, and al l events were mild and transient. No treatment -induced or 
treatment -boosted anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) were noted in any of the reported trials, except 
for trial ZP4207 -16098, in which  1 patient tested positive for both anti -dasiglucagon and 
anti-glucagon  antibodies. Due to the crossover nature of this trial, the induction of ADAs could 
not be associated with a specific treatment.  
Dose  proportionality for dasiglucagon PK  using the 1 mg/mL formulation was confirmed in the 
clinical trials, with doses ranging  between 0.1 and 1.0 mg, characterized by a fast absorption 
with a peak plasma concentration obtained after 35 minutes. The median time to maximum 
concentration was late r for dasiglucagon compared to marketed glucagon (GlucaGen) 
(35 vs 20 minutes). In the phase 2 trial  ZP4207 -15126 , doses of 0.3 mg dasiglucagon and 0.5 mg 
GlucaGen and also 0.6 mg dasiglucagon and 1.0 mg GlucaGen were similar with regard to 
maximum observed concentration (C max). The total exposure in terms of area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-inf) was consistently higher for 
dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen. This was likely due to a higher bioavailability  of 
dasiglucagon since nonclinical data consistently show that the bioavailability of dasigluc agon is 
higher compared to marketed glucagon formulations. For the 4 mg/mL formulation, 
dose-proportionality of dasiglucagon doses between 0.03 and 0.6 mg was ind icated for 
AUC 0-240min  and AUC 0-inf in trial ZP4207 -16098 . Pharmacokinetic parameters were all  similar for 
dasiglucagon administration under both euglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions. An 
approximately 30 to 40% greater exposure in terms of AUC 0-inf and C max was observed with the 
4 mg/mL formulation as compared with the 1  mg/mL formulation.  
In the  phase 2 trial ZP4207 -15126, all patients achieved a PG level of at least 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L) at all dose levels of dasiglucagon  after insulin -induced hypoglyce mia, as well as an 
increase in PG by at least 20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) within 30 minutes postdose . The PD responses 
of 0.3  mg of dasiglucagon and 0.5 mg of marketed glucagon (GlucaGen) were similar in the first 
30 minutes postdose, as were the PD responses of  0.6 mg of dasiglucagon and 1.0  mg of 
Page 105 of 157

GlucaGen. The PD response over the entire observation ti me (0 -360 minutes) was significantly 
greater after dosing with dasiglucagon  than with GlucaGen for all pre specified dose 
comparisons. This was likely an effect of  the higher total drug exposure (AUC 0-inf) of 
dasiglucagon mentioned previously.  
In the phase 3 trial ZP4207 -16137, the primary endpoint was time to plasma glucose  recovery  
after insulin -induced hypoglycemia,  which was defined as first increase in plasma g lucose of 
≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from baseline. Superiority was shown for dasiglucagon relative to 
placebo, with a median time to plasma glucose recovery of 10 versus 40 minutes. The median 
time to recovery for GlucaGen was 12 minutes. All patients in the dasiglucagon and GlucaGen 
treatment arms recovered from insulin -induced hypoglycemia within 30 minutes. All patients but 
one receiving dasiglucagon and one receiving GlucaGen had recovered within 20 minutes 
(dasiglucagon: 99% and GlucaGen: 98%). At 15 minu tes, 99% of patients receiving 
dasiglucagon and 95% of those receiving GlucaGen had recovered. At 10 minutes, 65% of 
patients receiving dasiglucagon and 49% of those receiving GlucaGen had recovered.  
No major differences in PD responses were observed betwe en dasiglucagon doses under 
euglycemic or hypoglycemic conditions in phase 2 trial ZP4207 -16098. Under euglycemic 
conditions, all patients achieved an increase in PG of at least 20 mg/dL (1.1  mmol/L) within 
30 minutes postdose with 0.08 mg dasiglucagon and  above, while this target was reached only 
for 0.2  mg of marketed glucagon (Lilly Glucagon). Under hypoglycemic conditions, 
dasiglucagon met the target at doses of 0.2 mg and above. The PD response over the entire 
observation time of 240  minutes was signif icantly higher with dasiglucagon than with Lilly 
Glucagon at the same doses. In the bionic pancreas feasibility trial ZP4207 -16051, results 
demonstrated comparable autonomous glycemic control with dasiglucagon compared to 
Lilly  Glucagon. This was despite t he stressed conditions of the trial in terms of fasted patients 
being on up to twice their basal insulin rate to stimulate glucagon use during the 8 -hour test, and 
inclusion of a structured exercise period. With dasiglucagon, patients obtained a glucose va lue 
within target (70 -180 mg/dL [3.9 -10.0 mmol/L]) 70.9% of the time vs 65.6% with Lilly 
Glucagon.  
6.3.4.  Literature Data  
In a retrospective review of 223 cases of diffuse or focal CHI, glucagon was reported to be used 
in 55% of patients with diffuse CHI and in 31% of patients with focal CHI.10 In an observational 
trial of 55 newborns who received glucagon because of hypoglycemia after birth, applied doses  
were mainly in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/day, and results indic ated an increase in PG from a 
mean of 36.3  md/dL to a mean of 93.0 mg/dL, observed within 4 hours after the start of glucagon 
infusion.9 The frequency of hypoglycemic episodes was significantly reduced, and no f urther 
episodes of severe hypoglycemia were observed.  
In another retrospective chart review of 40  children with CHI who receive d continuous IV 
glucagon for prevention of hypoglycemia ,14 a median (inter quartile ran ge) glucagon dose of 
205 (178, 235) mcg/kg/day over a median duration of 5 (3, 9) days enabled a glucose infusion 
rate ( GIR) reduction from 18.5 (12.9, 22.8) to 11 (6.6, 17.5) mg/kg/min per 24 h (p < 0.001), and 
reduced hypoglycemia frequency from 1.9  (1.3, 2.9) to 0.7 (0.3, 1.2) episodes per day.  
The long -term use of glucagon in patients with CHI is limited by the instability of marketed 
glucagon after reconstitution. A literature review on the long -term medical treatment of CHI 
revealed that only 1% of 61 9 patients identified rec eived glucagon as part of their medical 
management.6 A retrospective review of 9 children with CHI who received continuous SC

infusion of glucagon for weeks or months showed that introdu ction of glucagon allowed the 
reduction or discontinuation of central glucose infusion in all patients.11 Six of 9 patients were 
discharged with continued glucagon therapy that their parents were  able to continu e without 
further symptomatic hypoglycemia, convulsions, or unconsciousness. In 3 children, glucagon 
therapy was continued for 1 to 4 years, whi ch led to stable euglycemia.  
The data reported on marketed glucagon use in patients with CHI indicate that conti nuous SC 
infusion of a glucagon agonist could provide therapeutic benefit to patients by stabilizing PG 
levels and reducing the frequency of hyp oglycemic episodes.5,6,9,10,11 
6.3.5.  Anticipated Medical Benefit of Dasiglucagon in the Treatment of CHI  
With its ph ysio-chemical stability in liquid  formulation, dasiglucagon could provide significant 
added benefit in the treatment of CHI relative to currently marketed glucagon by enabling 
long-term reliable IV infusion. Long -term subcutaneous infusion of dasiglucagon through a 
pump may be an attracti ve alternative or addition to diazoxide and octreotide since  it may reduce 
the dependency on intensive nutritional support , both IV and gastric (NG tube or gastrostomy) , 
whilst maintaining euglycemia by harnessing physiolog ical mechanisms for combating 
hypoglycemia. Furthermore, i f long -term euglycemia is achieved with medical therapy, 
pancreatectomy for the treatment of diffuse CHI could eventually be avoided. In one cohort of 
nonsurgically treated children, the mean clinic al remission rate was 5  (1.5-12) years for diffuse 
CHI.5 This suggests that a significant proportion of infants with CHI could avoid surgery if 
medical treatment allowed for the effective long -term control of hyperinsulinism.  
The target populat ion in this trial is children with CHI who are especially challenging to treat, 
and who need continuous IV glucose infusion to prevent or treat hypoglycemia, necessitating 
ongoing hospitalization. These children have limited options in terms of other treat ment s, and 
represent very high unmet medical need group within already ultra -rare CHI population.  
6.3.6.  Anticipated Risks of Dasiglucagon in the Treatment of CHI  
So far, there is no previous clinical experience with dasiglucagon SC infusion for the treatment 
of CHI.  The following anticipated risks are derived from other clinical trials with dasiglucagon 
conducted in other indications, from marketed glucagon labelling information, and from native 
glucagon’s physiological effects.  
In clinical trials with dasiglucag on conducted up to now, the most frequent treatment -related AE s 
were nausea and vomiting, followed by headache.  
Glucagon exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects and may , therefore , cause 
tachycardia and hypertension. Transient increases in heart  rate and hypertension have been 
observed in clinical trials with dasiglucagon. Additionally , several  episodes of hypotension and 
bradycardia have been noted in the clinical program , often in association with nausea and/or 
vomiting . 
Accidental overdose may  occur due to inappropriate  handling of the infusion pump or due to 
pump malfunction. Overdose may result in nausea, vomiting, inhibition of GI tract motility, 
short -term increase in heart rate or blood pressure , and/or hypokalemia. Symptomatic care for 
nausea and vomiting , as well as monitoring of heart rate , blood pressure,  and hypokalemia is 
advised.  
Injection site reactions are seen with many injectable peptides. Injection site reactions have been 
reported across trials, with simi lar frequency in all tr eatment groups (dasiglucagon , marketed

glucagons , and placebo ), irrespective of dose. The i njection site reactions were generally mild 
and transient . 
Overall, the clinical trial data indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for indu ction of ADAs. 
Out of m ore than 350  doses of dasiglucagon administered to more than 200  patients, only 
1 low-titer transient ADA incident has been reported to date, in a patient following 
administration of 11  SC doses of dasiglucagon or Lilly Glucagon ranging from 0.03 to 0.6  mg, 
with low binding and low in vitro  neutralizing capability. No apparent clinical effects on PK, PD , 
or AEs were noted. Due to the crossover trial design, the ADA induction could not be ascribed to 
a specific treatment. Based on the current clinical experi ence and the product characteristics, the 
risk of dasiglucagon inducing an ADA response is considered low.  
Administration of glucagon or dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions 
similar to those observed for other therapeutic peptid es or proteins.  
Data on the risks of chronic administration of dasiglucagon are not available. From sporadic 
reports of extended SC/IV infusion of marketed glucagon and in glucagonoma patients ,15 
sustained expos ure to high levels of glucagon may lead to development of the skin condition 
necrolytic migratory erythema  (NME) , a highly specific migrating, erythem atous rash with 
predilection for perioral, perianal , and lower leg distribution .11 
For further information on risks, please refer to the current version of the investigator’s brochure 
(IB).  
6.3.7.  Summary of Potential Benefits and Risks  
As with all treatment interventions, the anticipated benefits to trial patients should be balanced 
against th e potential risks. The accumulated experience from nonclinical studies and clinical 
trials with dasiglucagon supports that dasiglucagon is a specific glucagon receptor agonist and is 
well tolerated. Glucagon and its analogs belong to a well -known drug clas s with known mode of 
action.  The clinical investigators involved in the trial will all have had experience with use of 
glucagon in patients with CHI.  
The investigator will inform the patients/parent (s)/guardian  of the potential risks of dasiglucagon 
treatm ent and other trial -related procedures before they enter the trial. The investigator must 
become familiar with all sections of the dasiglucagon  IB before the start of the trial.  
In this trial population, the major and clinically relev ant benefit is the exp ected reduction and 
eventually elimination of need for IV glucose, together with the reduction in gastric nutritional 
interventions while avoiding  hypoglycemia. The reduced volume of nutritional interventions 
should limit the risk of volume overload . Furth ermore, by removing the invasive methods of 
nutrition, the children should better retain or re -establish orality – the intake of nutrients by 
mouth.  
In summary, with its marked improvements in stability in solution and solubility in a queous 
media compared to currently marketed glucagon products, dasiglucagon is expected to have 
significant clinical benefits in the treatment of CHI and to substantially reduce the disease burden 
in these patients. This includes discharge from the hospita l by enabling convenie nt and reliable 
long-term treatment via a pump device in a home setting, together with the potential to delay and 
ultimately avoid pancreatectomy and its related exo/endocrine complications, particularly the 
development of insulin -dependent diabetes.  
Overa ll, the benefit to risk ratio for patients entering the ZP4207 -1710 3 trial is considered 
acceptable.

8. TRIAL  DESIGN  
8.1. Overall Trial  Design and Plan  
This is a combined phase 2 and 3, randomized, multinational trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of individually  titrated da siglucagon in children ≥7 days and <1 year of age who have 
been diagnosed with CH I, compris ing 2 parts, a crossover ( 2 periods,  48 hours each), 
double -blind, placebo -controlled  Part 1 , and an open -label, single -arm Part 2 of 21  days 
(Figure  1). 
Abbreviations: Min = minimum  
Figure  1 Design  of Trial ZP4207 -17103  
After screening, eligible patients will complete a minimum 24 -hour run -in period to confirm the 
IV glucose randomization requirement (≥10 mg/kg/min). All non -nutritional carbohydrates and 
carbohydrate fortification of feeds are prohibited during th is 24 -hour run-in period. After the 
run-in period, patients will be ra ndomly assigned in a double -blind fashion to receive 
dasiglucagon or pl acebo for 48 hours, after which they will be crossed over to the other trial 
treatment  for an additional 48 hours . At the time of crossover, the trial drug  will be initiated from  
the st arting dose of 10  µg/hr, and IV GIR will be set to the rate obtained at  the end of the run -in 
period and titrated accordingly.  
There will be no washout between the 2 periods in Part 1 to limit the length of time in which 
patients are reliant on IV GIR as t heir only means of preventing/treating hypoglycemia. This is 
deemed acc eptable because : 
• The half-life (t½) of dasiglucagon is short (~30 minutes, for the 0.6 mg dose, and potentially 
shorter for lower doses, ~22 minutes) relative to the 48 -hour duration of  each crossover

period. Moreover, for the primary endpoint, only the la st 12 hours of the 48 -hour period will 
be used for endpoint assessment.  
• Assuming a positive effect of dasiglucagon, the absence of washout is conservative with 
respect to key secondary endpoints  since  a potential carry over effect of dasiglucagon in 
Period  2 is attributed to placebo.  
During Part 1, the trial drug and IV GIR should be adjusted according to the protocol -specified 
algorithm (see Section 10.2). Non -nutritional carbohydrates and/or carb ohydrate fortif ication of 
feeds during Part 1 is only allowed if the maximum tolerable volume and co ncentration of IV 
glucose for the patient is reached, and should be limited to the minimum needed to ensure the 
patient’s safety  (Section 9.5). All fee dings (administered as parenteral nutrition, by NG tube, 
gastrostomy, or normal route), will be recorded during this period. Safety assessments will be 
performed daily afte r initiation of the trial drug (active or placebo).  
After Par t 1, patients will cont inue in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for 21  days. 
Additional CHI treatments can be introduced during Part 2 if needed, if up -titration of 
dasiglucagon is not possible due to undesirable side effects or if the maximum dos e level 
(70 µg/hr) has been reached. Gradual transfer from IV glucose to oral and gastric carbohydrates 
should be initiated in Part 2, enabling weaning of IV glucose and hospital discharge. Patients will 
continue to be hospitalized u ntil IV GIR is weaned o ff; however , as soon as local site criteria for 
discharge are met, patients can be discharged to continue the treatment period at home. Visits are 
planned on Day 11 and Day 18 in Part 2. The se visits can be converted to telephone visits if 
appropriate, at  the investi gator’s discretion . On Day 25, the End of Treatment Visit will take 
place, and based on the investigator’s confirmation of continued positive benefit -risk balance, 
patients will be offered the opportunity to  enter the  long-term extension trial ( Trial ZP420 7-
17106) to continue dasiglucagon treatment. Patients who do not enter the long -term extension 
trial will have a Follow -up Visit 28 days after their last dose of trial drug.  
8.2. Discussion of Trial  Design  
The initial 2x48 -hour treatment period ( Part 1) is double -blind and placebo -controlled to avoi d 
bias in the assessment of the effect of dasiglucagon on GIR. A crossover design has been chosen 
to limit the influence of inherent variability of the population, which allows for recruitment of 
fewer patients compared to a parallel -group design , reflecting the ultra -rare status of the disease.  
All patients will receive  dasiglucagon in open -label Part 2. According to International Council 
for Harmonisation ( ICH) guidelines, for the conduct of clinical trial s in rare diseases,  where the 
anticipated likelihood of considerable benefit is high,  such design has some potential efficiencies 
because all patients will be exposed to test drug, which is of particular importance in rare 
diseases.16 
8.3. Trial  Sites  
The trial will take place at 5 to 7 sites in  the US  and Europe  that are experienced in the treatment 
of CHI. A total of 12 patients with CHI is planned to be randomized  and exposed to the trial 
product . Patients who withdraw prematurely will not be replaced.

16. The use of prescription or non -prescription medications known to cause QT prolongation  
9.2.3.  Randomization Exclusion Criteri a 
A screened  patient  will not be randomized if:  
1. Mean IV glucose requirement is <10 mg/kg/min to maintain  glycemia  above 70  mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L) during the  previous 24 hours  prior to randomization  
2. Use of glucagon within 24 hours before random ization . 
3. Use of additional enteral glucose within 24 hours before random ization. Patients should be 
transitioned to IV glucose infusions only at least 24 hours before randomization . 
4. Is not sufficiently clinically stable on IV GIR only ( ± diazoxide, as appl icable), in the 
opinion of the investigator, to undergo the placebo -controlled randomized Part 1 of the trial 
(2x48 hours).  
The Randomization Visit may be rescheduled once if Randomization Exclusion Criterion  2 is 
met. 
9.3. Premature Patient  Withdrawal  
Randomiz ation day exclusion criteria are described in Section 9.2.3 . 
Patient s’ parent(s)/guardian  will be advised that they are free to withdraw their child from 
participation in this trial at any time, for any reason, and  without prejudice.  Every reasonable 
attempt should be made by the investigator to keep patient s in the trial to obtain data for the 
primary en dpoint in Part 1 and for safety follow -up even if trial treatment has been discontinued . 
However, patient s must b e withdrawn from the trial if the ir parent(s)/guardian  withdraw consent 
to participate.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 29 of 71 
Investigators must attempt to contact patient s’ parent(s)/guardian who fail to attend scheduled 
visits by telephone or other means to exclude the possibility of an AE b eing the cause of 
withdrawal.  Attempts to contact the patient must be documented. At least 3 phone calls and 
3 written attempts to contact the patient will be made prior to considering them lost to follow -up. 
Should an AE be the cause  of withdrawal , it must be documented, reported, and followed up as 
described in Section  12.3. 
If a patient/parent(s)/guardian withdraws consent, the reason for withdrawal and the date of 
withdrawal will be recorded on t he appropriat e page of the electronic case report form  (eCRF). 
Whenever possible and reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion 
of the trial should be performed at the time of premature withdrawal.  
9.4. Treatment Discontinuation  
To prevent missi ng data, patients should , to the extent possible , be kept in the trial ; therefore, 
treatment discontinuation is often the preferred option in  case of, e.g., substantial non compliance 
with trial procedures or initiation of prohibited treatment that interfer es with the efficacy and 
safety evaluation. If it  is an investigator ’s decision to discontinue the patient’s treatment, the 
investigator should, whenever possible, discuss the potential discontinuation of the treatment 
with the medical monitor. If the pati ent is discontinued from trial treatment by the i nvestigator  or 
by parent/guardian’s decision, the reason for treatment discontinuation and the date of treatment 
discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The patient should be 
asked to continue in the trial by following the pla nned visit schedule  and to have trial 
assessments performed according to the Schedule of Events. This is especially important during 
Part 1 of the trial where the primary endpoint is evaluated . As a minimum , the patient will be 
asked to attend the Follow -up Visit 28 days (± 3 days) after discontinuation of trial treatment.  
9.5. Rescue Criteria  
During Part 1, the IV glucose concentration and rate of infusion can be increased to avoid 
hypoglycemia. When the maximum (or maximum tolerable) dose of trial drug has bee n reached 
and the necessary amount of GIR to prevent hypoglycemia is likely to cause (in the 
investigator’s opinion) a moderate or severe AE (e.g., volume overload), oral/gastric 
non-nutritional carbohydrate s can be introduced to ensure the patient’s safet y whilst maintaining 
the maximum tolerable concentration and infusion rate of IV glucose.  
During Part 2 , patients are allowed to initiate and titrate oral/gastric non -nutritional 
carbohydrates, and initiate any CHI treatment.  
9.6. Patient  Replacement Criteria  
Patients  who withdraw from the trial prematurely  will not be replaced. If a substantial number of 
patient s withdraw prematurely , the sponsor will evaluate the need for developing replacement 
criteria.  
Enrolle d patient s (defined as ran domized) who are subsequently withdrawn from the trial may 
not re -enter. The patient  number for a withdrawn patient  will not be reassigned to another 
patient .

10. TREATMENTS  
10.1. Identification of Investigational Product  
Dasiglucagon  Injec tion, 4 mg/mL will be supplied by the sponsor  in a 3 mL vial containing 1  mL 
of drug product . 
Matching placebo for dasiglucagon injection will be supplied by the sponsor  in a 3 mL vial 
containing 1  mL of drug product . 
Dasiglucagon and matching placebo will  be provided i n the form of solution for injection for 
subcutaneous  administration through an infusion pump.  
The trial  drug product , as applicable,  must be transferred from t he vial  to the Accu -Chek Spirit 
Cartridge . The amount of drug product dosed via th e pump will vary among  patients.  
Cartridges and infusion sets should be filled and replaced as indicated in the instructions for use.  
10.1.1.  Pack aging and Labeling  
Trial drug  products will be pack aged  and labeled by the sponsor.  
Part 1 dispensing unit configurati on: 3 vials containing dasiglucagon , 4 mg/mL or placebo for 
dasiglucagon , packed in an outer carton. The v ials and carton will be pack aged  and label ed in 
local language without revealing the treatment.  
Part 2 dispensing unit configuration: 3 vials containi ng dasiglucagon, 4  mg/mL, packed in an 
outer carton. The v ials and carton will be pack aged and labeled in local language, revealing the 
treatment . 
The storage conditions for trial  drug products will be de scribed on the trial  drug product label. 
The labels will supply no information about patients. Each dispensing  unit (3 vials) will have a 
unique Dispensing Unit Number for drug allocation, drug accountability , and traceability 
purposes.  
Labelling will be performed according to Annex 13 of the Good Manufactu ring Practice 
guidelines of the European Commission, ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  guidelines, local 
laws, and regulations . 
10.2. Treatments Administered  
As lon g as the patient is receivin g IV glucose, the PG will be measured and reviewed hourly 
using a hand -held PG meter. The IV GIR will be titrated to achieve glycemia of at least 
70 mg/dL (3.9  mmol/L) ( a minimum GIR will be established as the rate up -titrated a fter the 
patient drops at least once below 70 mg/dL  [3.9 mmol/ L]). When the patient is no longer on  
IV GIR, the PG will be checked according to local practice, but at least 3 times daily. The PG  
will be measured using the same trial -supplied hand -held PG meter during the entire trial.  
Additionally, blinded CGM will be started 24  hours prior to randomiza tion (using the 
Dexcom  G4 or G6 system) and continued until the end of Part 2.  
Dosing of dasiglucagon will approximate  continuous infusion by delive ring small doses at 
frequent intervals via the infusion pump . The adjustment of trial drug dosing is closely  linked to 
the PG level achieved, which in turn will govern the IV GIR . In Part 1 the algorithm in Table  1 
should be used .

Abbreviations: GIR = glucose infusion rate; IV = intravenous  
The IV GIR will be r eviewed, evaluated, and adjusted (if indicated) every hour according to the 
above PG -driven algorithm to maintain a PG of >70 mg/dL (>3.9 mmol/L). Rechecks of PG are 
allowed.  
Part 1 (Crossover, double -blind, r andomized , placebo -controlled ) 
The starting dos e of trial drug is 10 µg/hr at t=0. Every 2  hours (t=2, 4, 6, etc.) , the dose will be 
increased by an additional 10 µg/hr until either:  
• The patient is totally weaned  off IV glucose , or 
• Plasma glucose  during the last 2 hours was constantly above 120 mg/dL ( 6.7 mmol/L), or  
• IV GIR has not decrease d despite 2 sequential dose  increments of trial drug  (in this situation , 
the dose of trial dru g should be maintained until the IV GIR can be further decreased or until 
crossover or the end of Part 1 ), or 
• The maximum dose of 70 µg/hr is reached, or  
• AEs emerge  that are considered to be related to dasiglucagon (e .g., nausea/change in feeding 
pattern or increased vomiting) that are limit ing further dose escalation . 
The 2-hour dose -adjustment interval will allow drug plasma  levels to approach steady -state 
before the dose is further increased . The cumulative dose will not exceed 1.26  mg over the first 
24 hours and 1.68 mg for each of the subsequent 24 -hour periods.

At the time of crossover  from the first 48 -hour period to the  second 48 -hour peri od, the trial drug  
will again  be titrated f rom the starting dose of 10  µg/hr, and IV GIR will be set to the rate 
obtained at the end of the run -in period and titrated accordingly.  
Part  2 (Open -label)  
After Part 1, patients will continue  in open -label Part 2 to receive dasiglucagon for a  further 
21 days. Since  treatment allocation during Part 1 remains blinded, all patients are required to 
initiate dasiglucagon dosing at 10 µg/hr in Part 2, while IV GIR  should be  started at the rate 
obtai ned at the end of the run -in period . 
During Part 2, the dasiglucagon dose, the amount and route of administration of carbohydrates 
(IV GIR, parenteral nutrition, gastric carbohydrate infusions, and carbohydrates from oral feeds) 
can be adjusted  at the disc retion of the investigator . The PG should be monitored at least hourly 
to adjust the IV GIR as appropriate and to avoid hypoglycemia. Additional concomitant 
medications, including somatostatin analogs and/or sirolimus/mTOR inhibit ors, may be 
introduced at the investigator’s discretion if the maximum dose level of dasiglucagon (70  µg/hr) 
has been reached or if further up -titration is not possible due to undesirable side effects.  
Adjustment of total carbohydrate administered (IV glucose , parenteral nutrition,  carbohydrate 
infusions, and carbohydrates  from oral feeds ) should continue throughout this period  according 
to local practice to maintain PG levels in the range of 70 mg/dL  to 120  mg/dL (3.9 -6.7 mmol/L) . 
The aim will be to ob tain stable glucose levels wit h minimum rescue/hypoglycemia -prevent ative 
carbohydrates administered by invasive routes , and to encourage/optimize oral feeds, and 
achieve weaning off IV glucose. Regardless of their discharge status, all patients will be off ered 
the opportunity to pa rticipate in the long -term safety extension trial (ZP4207 -17106), providing 
the investigator attests to the positive benefit -risk balance of continued dasiglucagon treatment.

The infusion pump system is CE -marked for the management of diabetes mellitus in persons  
requiring insulin, as prescribed by a physician. In this trial, the pump system is used outside of  
the CE -marked in tended use since the pump system will be delivering dasiglucagon to patients  
with CHI. The PG meter is used as intended according to the CE mark, except for the us e by a  
lay person in a home care setting. The CGM devices are  used as intended according to t he CE 
mark, except for the age group and the disease.  
The pump , the SMPG , and the CGM  will be labeled for use in an investigational trial . 
10.4. Dispensing and Storage  
The trial drug products supplied by  the sponsor  is to be dispensed  exclusively to patients 
randomized in this clinical trial according to the instructions of this protocol  and the pharmacy 
manual /trial materials manual (TMM) . The investigator is responsible for dispensing the trial 
drug product according to the dosage scheme . Trial drug products will be allocated using an 
interactive  automated web response system ( IWRS ), according to Section 10.5. 
Dasiglucagon and placebo for dasiglucagon injection must be stored at 2 –8°C in a refrigerator.  
The investigat or must ensure the availability of prop er storage conditions. All trial  drug products 
provided for this trial will be stored at the trial site in a secure area wit h restricted access . 
The temperature should be monitored by recording the actual, minimum , and maximum 
temperatures using a calibrated thermome ter or thermocouple, or by continuous recording using 
a qualified temperature monitoring system. The temperature should be evaluated and 
documented at least on working days on a temperature log. This log mu st be included in the 
Investigator Site File (ISF)  upon trial termination.  
The investigator must contact the clinical research associate (CRA) in case of temperature 
deviations outside the acceptable range.  
Please see the pharmacy manual /TMM  for additional  information on handling of the trial  drug.  
The investigator must maintain adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, return, or other 
disposition of the trial drug , including the date, quantity, batch or code number, and 
identificati on of patients (patient number) who received the trial drug. The investigator will not 
supply the trial drug to any person except subinvestigators, designated trial personnel, and 
patients in this trial. The trial drug may not be relabeled or reassigned fo r use by other patients. If 
any of the trial drug is not dispensed, is lost, stolen, spilled, unusable, or is received in a 
damaged container, this information must be documented and reported to the sponsor  and the 
appropriate regulatory agencies as requir ed. 
10.5. Method of A ssigning Patients  to Treatment Groups  
For Part 1, patients will be random ly assigned  1:1 in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 2  sequences:  
• Dasiglucagon 4 mg/mL for 48 hours, followed by placebo for dasiglucagon for 48 hours, or  
• Placebo  for dasi glucagon  for 48  hours, followed by dasiglucagon 4 mg/ mL for 48 hours.  
Randomization will be performed using a block randomization scheme stratified by region 
(US/non -US). The randomization scheme will be generated prior to the initiation of the trial by 
an independent st atistician/programmer who will not be a member of the trial team; investigators 
will not be aware of the block size of the randomization scheme.

Patients will be randomly assigned to a trial treatment sequence using an IWRS that has been 
validated for the intended use under the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineers Good 
automated manufacturing practice  guidelines, 21CFR Part 11 (FDA regulation for Electronic 
Records and Electronic Signatures) , and the ICH Guidance E6 for Industry on Good Clinica l 
Practice.  
After completing Part 1, patients will continue in Part 2 to receive act ive treatment for a 
maximum of 21 days . 
10.6. Blinding  and Unb linding  Treatment Assignment  
Trial  personnel will endeavor to s afeguard the integrity of the trial blind to minimize  bias in the 
conduct of the trial. Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment 
assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. 
Unblinding will b e permitted in a medical emergency that requires imme diate knowledge of the 
patient ’s treatment assignment.  
For emergency unblinding, the investigator will use the measures provided through the IWRS. 
Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medic al monitor if possible. If the 
investigator is not ab le to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then he or she must notify the 
medical monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the patient ’s 
treatment assignment.  
The i nvestigator or designee must record the date and reas on for unblinding  on the appropriate 
eCRF page for that patient . 
10.7. Selection of Doses in the Trial  
Both the starting dose and the maximum allowed doses are based on experience with marketed 
glucagon products in this patient population.11 
At present , no pediatric PK data are available for dasiglucagon . However , an approximate 
estimation of expected  drug concentration in a 3 kg patient  has been  made by extrapolation of a 
previously made PK model for pediatric patient s with weights b etween 25 and 45 kg.17 
In this trial, dasiglucagon will be titra ted to meet the needs of the individual patient on the basis 
of PD effects in regards to efficacy and to lerability , and it is expec ted that the majority of 
patients will be adequately treated with a dasiglucagon infusion rate of approximately 
20 to 40 μg/hr. The up -titration will stop when IV glucose is completely weaned , if undesirable 
side effects arise,  or when no additional PD effects are observed as the dasiglucagon infusion 
rate is increased.  
Based on the current PK/PD model, the predicted plasma concentration is expected to result in a 
medium PD response at the lowest dose level and be approaching maximum effect at the highest 
dose level. The PD response of patients will be monitored closely in th is trial, and the 
appropriateness of the applied ti tration algorithm will be evaluated.  
Although the PK of dasiglucagon has been shown to be dose -proportional in adults and in all 
toxicologically tested species over a wide range of doses, limited PK sampling at each dose level 
is planned  based on the limit ed available blood volume in this population.  
10.8. Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
Dosing details are provided in Section 10.2.

10.9. Dose Adjustmen t Criteria  
Dose adjustment criteria are presented in Section 10.2. 
10.10.  Treatment Compliance  
Compliance data will be collected. Infusion details will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF and 
drug accountability will be performed as detailed in the pharmacy manual /TMM. 
10.11.  Permitted a nd Prohibited  Therapies  
All concomitant medications used (including over -the-counter medications and herbal 
supplements) will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate eCRF.  
Caution is advised when beta-blockers, indomethacin, anticholinerg ic drugs, and warfarin are 
prescribed due to reports of interaction with marketed glucagon products.  
10.11.1.  Permitted Therapies  
Regarding diazoxide, patients entering the trial either:  
• Have tried diazoxide, but discontinu ed due to lack of efficacy . Minimum of 6  days’ washout 
is required prior to randomization.  
• Have tried diazoxide, but discontinued due to adverse events, or family choice, even if  
efficacy  was established . Minimum of 6  days’ washout is required prior to ran domization.  
• Have initiated diazoxide  prior  to screening , and continue on the treatment. Diazoxide dose 
should remain stable during Part 1 of the trial.  Diazoxide should not be initiated during 
screening.  
• Have n ever tried diazoxide. Di azoxide should not be initiated during screening or Part  1 of 
the trial.  
Prior use of octreotide is allowed after a minimum 48-hour washout  prior to randomization . 
Washout is required to eliminate the effect of octreotide during Part 1, where adjustment of GIR 
has to follow the protocol -defined PG-driven algorithm ( Table  1) and the primary endpoint on 
mean GIR is assessed . 
Somatostatin analogs  and/or diazoxide can be introduced during Part 2 if needed, at the 
investigator’s discretion , when the maximal limit of  dasiglucagon (70  µg/hr) has been reached or 
if further up -titration is not possible due to undesirable side effects.  
Addition of other CHI -specific treatments (e.g., sirolimus/mTOR inhibitors) during Part  2 need 
to be discussed with the medical monitor.  
10.11.2.  Prohibited  Therapie s 
The following therapies are prohibited : 
During the  entire  trial: 
• Systemic corticosteroids, e.g., hydrocortisone >20 mg/m2 body surface area or equivalent 
within  5 days before screening  
• Anti-inflammatory biological agents or other immun e-modulating agents  
• Use of paracetamol/acetaminophen is strongly discouraged for the duration of trial when 
patients are using the Dexcom G4 CGM because it interferes with the accuracy of the device. 
Parent(s)/guardian should contact the trial site before dosing child with

paracetamol/acetaminophen. Both the site staff and the parent(s)/guardian should explore 
other options of treating fever and mild pain before deciding paracetamol/acetaminophen is 
needed  
When patients are using the Dexcom G6 CGM the use o f paracetamol/aceta minophen is 
allowed  
• Other investigational agents . 
• Marketed glucagon products within the last 24 hours prior to randomization and throughout 
the trial unless necessary for rescue therapy in case of severe hypoglycemia, as per local 
standard of care.  
• Prescri ption or non -prescription medications known to cause QT prolongation.  
During Screening and Part 1:  
• Somatostatin analogs  and s irolimus (mTOR inhibitors). No new CHI treatment is to be 
initiated during screening and Part 1. Octreotide is allowed in the scree ning period if 
discontinued at least 48 hours before randomization.  
During Part 2 and follow -up: 
• Initiation of somatostatin a nalogs , diazoxide  and sirolimus (mTOR inhibitors) unless the 
maximum dose level of dasiglucagon (70  µg/hr) has been reached or furt her dasiglucagon 
up-titration is not possible due to undesirable side effects  
10.12.  Discharge of Patients for Home Treatment  
Patients can be discharged during  Part 2 to complete the treatment at home a s soon as IV GIR 
has been weaned off and local site criteria for discharge are met . Discharge for home treatment is 
contingent on the parent (s)/guardian  being  capable of t aking care of the administration  of 
investigative product via pump at home , can use SMPG and CGM devices, and are able  to attend 
planned assessmen t visits at the hospital.  
Before discharge of patients from hospital care , the investigator will ensure : 
• Appropriate training of patient’s parent (s)/guardian in the use of dasiglucagon in the Accu -
Chek Spirit Combo pump based on the training material  provi ded. The first pump infusion 
set change should be performed at the hospita l 
• Parent (s)/guardian  are trained appropriately o n the handling of CGM device  
• Parent (s)/guardian  are trained appropriately o n how to perform SMPG measurements  and 
how to complete the diary . They  will check their child’s SMPG at least 3 times daily 
(preferab ly before main meals) and in case of suspected hypoglycemia  
• Parent (s)/guardian  are instructed not to change the dose of trial drug without prior 
consultation with  the investigator  
• Parent(s)/guardian are instructed how to recognize and handle signs of hypoglycemia  
• Parent (s)/guardian  are instructed to call the investigator/site staff in case of questions  
Patients who are discharged from hospital before Day 25 will be contacted by the in vestigator by 
telephone the day after discharge. The investigator wil l ask the parent(s)/guardian if they have 
any questions about the trial procedures and if their child has experienced any AEs.

10.13.  Treatment After End of Trial  
On Day 2 5, the End of Treatment  Visit will take place. B ased on the investigator’s confirmation 
of continued positive benefit -risk balance, patients will be offered the opportunity to enter the 
long-term extension trial (Trial ZP4207 -17106) to continue dasiglucagon treatment. Patients w ho 
do not enter the long -term extension trial will have a Follow -up Visit 28 days after their last dose 
of trial drug  and return to standard of care as per investigator discretion. No further treatment 
with dasiglucagon will be offered.  
11. TRIAL  PROCEDURES  
Patients’ parent (s)/guardian  (according to local law) must provide written informed consent 
before any trial-related procedures are initiated, including the cessation of prohibited 
concomitant therapy.  
For the timing of assessments and procedures throughout the trial, refer to t he Schedule of 
Events ( Section  18.1). Throughout the trial, trial personnel should make every reasonable effort 
to follow the timing of assessments and procedures in Section  18.1 for each patient . If a patient  
misses a trial visit for any reason, it should be r escheduled as soon as possible.  
11.1. Trial  Duration  
The sequence and maximum duration of the trial periods will be as follows:  
1. Screening Period: up to 28 days, including a minimum 24 -hour run -in period  
2. Part 1 (2x48 -hour period: double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled): 96  hours  
3. Part 2 (Open -label Activ e Treatment Period): 21 days  
4. Follow -up Period: Patients who do not enter the extension trial will have a Follow -up Visit 
28 days after their last dose of trial drug  
The maximum trial duration for each patient is 8 1 days.  The maximum treatment duration for 
each patient is 2 5 days.  
11.2. Assessments  
11.2.1.  Efficacy  
11.2.1.1.  Plasma Glucose  Monitoring  
As long as the patien t is receiving IV glucose , the GIR will be reviewed hourly, based on an 
hourly PG check  performed by the StatStrip Xpress2 meter . The IV GIR will be r eviewed, 
evaluated, and adjusted (if indicated) according to the IV GIR algorithm based on PG levels 
speci fied in Table  1. If IV glucose  has been stopped , PG will be checked according to local 
practice , but at least 3 times daily . 
Blood for PG check can be o btained either by finger or heel sticks or by an indwel ling pe ripheral 
line. However , if using an indwelling peripheral line , the total blood volume  drawn during a 
28-day period  should be considered according to Section 11.2.3.1 . 
At each visit, the investigator will ensure t hat SMPG data are downloaded from the patient’s 
device. The investigator will check for patient compliance in SMPG measurements. The 
procedure for download of SMPG data will be described in the pharmacy manual/TMM.  
Adjustments to the trial drug will be mad e as outlined in  Section  10.2.

11.2.1.2.  Continuous Glucose Monitoring  
Dexcom CGMs ( Dexcom G4 and Dexcom  G6), configured and labeled for use in the trial, will 
be provided. The Dexcom G4 will be taken off the market by th e supplier during 2020  and 
patients enrolled thereafter  will be using the Dexcom G6  CGM . Patients using the Dexcom G4  
CGM  will continue usi ng this device throughout the trial  and should  not switch to the Dexcom 
G6 device . 
The CGM will be started at least 24 hours prior to randomization and will be used during P arts 1 
and 2 in a blinded mode to evaluate efficacy  in terms of hypoglycemic episodes . Short pauses of 
1 to 3 days due to skin irritation or discomfort are allowed  during Part 2 of the trial after 
consultation with the investigator.  
The CGM devices should be calibrated and used according to the manufacture r’s instructions; 
the Dexcom G4 should be calibrated 2 times per day , the Dexcom G6 does not require 
calibration . 
At each visit, the investigator wil l ensure that CGM data are downloaded from the patient’s 
device. The procedure for download of CGM data wil l be described in the pharmacy 
manual/TMM.  
The contract research organization ( CRO ) or delegate will handle  the device sourcing, 
configuration for us e in this trial, procedures for blinded data extraction, device service , and 
handling  of potential returns . 
11.2.1.3.  Diary  
For patients who are discharged during the trial, the parent(s)/guardian will receive a paper diary 
to be completed at home. The investigator will instruct th e patient’s parent(s)/guardian on how to 
complete the diary. The following information should be recorded in the diary:  
• Type and volume of fluid administered through NG tube/gastrostomy  
• Hypoglycemic events, including related SMPG measuremen ts 
• Concomitant m edications  
• AEs 
• Hospitalizations, visits to health care providers or emergency room (ER)/accident & 
emergency (A&E) department, and visits by paramedics  
• Data regarding suspicion of NME and neurological findings  
Diary entries should be review ed at each visit  and the review documented in the diary. Data from 
the diary entries should be transcribed to the eCRF on an ongoing basis.  
11.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics /Drug Exposure  
Blood samples will be collected in Part 2 to measure  dasiglucagon levels  at steady -state 
(Schedule of Events; Section 18.1). The blood samples should be collected after a minimum of 
4 hours without changes to the dasiglucagon infusion r ate. For patients with a body weight above 
4 kg, an addition al PK sample should be collected at Day 5. However , the total amount of blood 
collected  should always be considered according to Section 11.2.3.1 . 
Details on sampling/collection, shipment, and analysis will be pro vided in the laboratory manual.

11.2.3.  Safety  
Safety assessments will include the evaluation of AEs, clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, biochemistry, and ADAs ), vital signs, physical examinations , ECGs, 
echocardiography , and local tolerability . 
11.2.3.1.  Laborato ry Safety Assessments  
Trial procedures require a maximum total of 8 .8 to 9.2 mL of blood in a 28 -day period. Where 
this exceeds the 2.5  mL/kg maximum ,18,19 safety lab oratory tests  (2 mL per sampling) will be 
prioritized o ver immunogenicity (1 mL) and drug exposure  (0.4 mL) samples.  
All measurements described in this section are recognized standa rd methods.  
Hematology and Biochemistry  
Samples for hematology and biochemi stry will be collected at the time points specified in the 
Schedule of Events (Section  18.1). 
Hematology : hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC indices, mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpus cular hemoglobin concentration, 
platelet count (or estimate), white bloo d cell  count , including differential  
Biochemistry:  albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea 
nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, eGFR , 
ketones (measured with PG meter)  
Standard of care blood samples can be used  as screening samples  if they were collected within 
1 week of screening.  
Laboratory specimens will be analyze d at local laboratories . 
Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to test for antibodies against dasiglucagon at  Visit 2 ( Day 1, 
prior to dosing ), Visit 7 (Day 25 ±3), and at the F ollow -up Visit (Visit 8, Day 53 ±3) 
(Section  18.1) and processed and shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory 
manual . 
The samples will be stored u ntil the ADA screening and confirmatory assays have been approved 
by the FDA.  Afterwards, t he ADA samples will be a nalyzed in batches during the trial . The 
ADA samples will be analyzed at a special ty laboratory.  
The clinical ADA assay s specific for dasiglucagon and glu cagon have been validated in 
accordance with existing guid elines and recommendations .19,21,22,23 
Samples will be measured in anti-dasiglucagon antibody screening and confirmatory  assay s. Due 
to the limi ted sample volume, the ADA characterization of  confirmed positive samples will be 
conducted according to  the following  priority:  
• Establishment of anti-dasiglucagon binding titer . 
• Cross -reactivity against  endogenous  glucagon . 
The neu tralizing potential in samples from ADA -positive patient s will be evaluated on the basis 
of drug exposure /PD data (steady -state exposure and PG).

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 40 of 71 
The ADA samples will be analyzed in batches  during the trial and any anti-dasiglucagon 
antibody -positive patie nts (treatment induced or treatment boosted , titer increase above 5 -fold) 
will be monitored at an additional  Follow -up Visit, preferably 16 weeks after last ADA -positive 
sample.  Patients who complete the trial before the ADA screening and confirmatory assa ys have 
been approved by the FDA and  who do not continue treatment in the long -term extension trial 
will have this addit ional visit 16 weeks after the end of trial  visit (Visit 8) . Patients who are 
tested ADA -positive after the additional  Follow -up Period will be categorized as having 
persistent antibodies.  
It will not be possible to collect back -up ADA  samples  for long -term storage  due to  limited 
blood volume in  these patient s. However,  any r esidual serum samples may be stored until 
approval of market auth orization  since further characterization of the antibody response may be 
requested.  
Specimen Handling Requi rements  
The transmission of infectious agents may occur through contact with contaminated needles and 
blood or blood products. Consequently, appropri ate blood and body fluid precautions should be 
employed by all trial personnel involved in the collection  of blood and handling of specimens in 
both the clinic and laboratory settings.  Refer to current recommendations of the appropriate 
authorities . 
In add ition to appropriate handling of patient samples, specific regulations exist regarding the 
shipment of biol ogic/etiologic samples. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and 
shipping of infectious samples are outlined in the laboratory manual . The in vestigator is 
responsible for ensuring that a ll trial samples that are to be transported to another location are 
packed and shipped appropriately according to the applicable regulations.  
Evaluation of Laboratory Values  
The normal ranges of values for the l aboratory assessments in this trial will be provided by the 
responsible laborator ies and submitted to the sponsor  before  the beginning of the trial. They will 
be regarded as the reference ranges on which decisions will be made.  
If a laboratory value is out  of the reference range, the investigator must evalua te if the value is 
clinical ly significant and record his  or her assessment in the appropriate eCRF.  
All laboratory values that in the investigator’s opinion are clinically relevant during or after 
termin ation of the treatment have to be reported as AEs and  followed, as described in 
Section  12.3. 
11.2.3.2.  Clinical Examinations  
Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO 2 will be measured 
while the child is sleeping or in a calm state  at times speci fied in the Schedule of Events 
(Section  18.1). Vital signs can be performed using the bedside monitoring device as per standard 
of care.  
Twelve -lead Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed while the child is sleeping or in a calm state at times  
specified in the Schedule of Events (Section  18.1). If it is not practical or possibl e, then a 2 -lead 
ECG may be used.24 If arrhythmia is detected  on a 2 -lead ECG, t his should be followed by

12-lead ECG. All ECG recordings will be identified with the patient n umber, date, and time of 
the recordi ng and will be attached to his or her medical record.  
The ECG parameters (heart rate, PQ, QRS, QT, and QTcF) and any abnormality will be recorded 
and described in the eCRF, including the investigator’s assessment of clinical significance 
(Abnormal, Clinica lly Significant; or Abnormal, Not Clinically Significant). At subsequent 
visits, any clinically significant  deterioration of a pre -existing condition, as well as any new 
clinically significant findings, will be recorded as AEs.  
Echocardiogram  
An echocardio gram will be performed according to the time points specified in the Schedule of 
Events (Section  18.1). 
Physical Examination  and Neurological Examination  
A complete physical examination of body systems according  to standard of care and a n 
age-appropriate  neurological examination will be performed according to the Schedule of Events 
(Section  18.1). 
Local Tolerability  
Local tolerability data will be collected separately from AEs. Within the eCRF , data will be 
collected on the nature of any reaction (erythema, pain, swelling , etc.), the  severity (mild, 
moderate, or severe) , and any action take n (e.g., no action, interruption of infusion). The likely 
cause of the reaction w ill also be collected ( e.g., insertion site, drug, adhesive dressing).  
Other skin findings will be collected along ot her AEs. If clinical suspicion of NME is made, data 
describing the lesion (s) will be coll ected as an AE of special interest ( AESI ) (see Section 12.1.8 ), 
together with a photograph or series of photographs of the lesion (s) uploaded to a central 
repository.  
Assessment of Fluid Balance for Patients Receiving IV Glucose  
Fluid balance assessments are to  be performed and documented at least every 8 hours as long as 
the patient is hospitalized and receiving IV glucose. These  assessments will include administered 
IV and oral fluids, fluid loss from stools and urine by weighin g of diapers, and vital signs of  fluid 
balance status.  Furthermore , daily body weight will also be part of the individualized assessment 
based on the patients overall status, at investigator’s discretion. According to Section 9.5, the 
investigat or should evaluate whether  the IV glucose concentration should be increased to avoid 
volume overload or whether  oral/gastric non -nutritional carbohydrates are to be introduced to 
ensure the patient’s safety whilst maintaining the maximum tolerable concentr ation and infusion 
rate of IV glucose.  
All details on IV GIR (including any bolus given) will be recorded in the eCRF.  
11.2.3.3.  Reporting of Hypoglycemia Events  
All h ypoglycemic episodes  are to be reported via the dedicated hypoglycemia eCRF form. 
Hypoglycemic epis odes that fulfill the definition of a serious adverse event ( SAE ) should also be 
recorded as an SAE. The following information should be collected:  
• Date, sta rt time  
• PG value

•Contact to trial doctor or emerge ncy services, paramedic visit, ER admission, hospitalization,
if applicable
A single hypoglycemia episode is defined as up until 60 minutes from the start  of the episode . If 
normoglycemia ( >70 mg/dL) is not reached within this time, a new episode of hypogl ycemia will 
be recorded.  
11.2.4.  Technical Complaints  
Reporting of Technical Complaints  
Technical complaints should  be reported to the sponsor  on any of the following products  if 
technical issues occur between the first and last us e: 
•Dasiglucagon 4 mg/mL  / placebo  vial containing 1 mL
•Accu -Chek Spirit pump
•Accu -Chek Spirit 3.15 mL Cartridge system , Accu -Chek Flex -Link Infusion set
(Accu -Check UltraFlex Infusio n set in the US), and Accu -Check Rapid -D Link infusion set
•Accu -Chek Link -Assist Insertion device
•SMPG mete r, StatStrip Xpress2
•Dexcom  G4/G6 system s
The investigator must report whether the technical complaint is associated with  any AEs or 
SAEs.  Any AE/SAE associated with a technical complaint must be reported in accordance with 
Section  12.2; the relationship between the t echnical complaint and the AE/SAE must be assessed 
by the investigator.  
Technical complaints must be reported on a dedicated technical complaint form.  
The investigator must complete the technical com plaint form in the eCRF according to  the 
following timelines , starting from the time the trial site becomes aware of the technical 
complaint : 
•Technical complaint assessed as related to an SAE within 24 hours
•All other technical complaints within 5 calendar  days
Use the Trial paper technical complaint form when reporting a technical complaint for an item
that is not yet allocated to a patient. The form should be sent by e-mail to e-mail address in the 
Appendix A.

Collection, Storage, and Shipment of Technical Complaint Items  
The investigator must collect and store the item(s) and notify the CRA  (including photo 
documentation) within 5 calendar days  of obtaining the item at the trial site. Upon request, the 
CRA  must  coordinate the shipment as per instruction from  the sponsor.  
11.2.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The definitions and management of and special considerations for AEs are provided  in 
Section  12. 
12. ADVERSE EVENT S 
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials 
are crucial for the protection of patient s, investigators, and the sponsor, an d are mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide.  
12.1. Definition s 
12.1.1.  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medic al occurrence in a clinical trial patient  administered a me dicinal 
(investigational or non investigational) product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a product, whether or not related to the product.  
AEs include:  
• A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness  
• A clinical laboratory AE: a clinic al abnormality which is clinically significant, i .e., any 
abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires 
active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, 
e.g., change of  dose or more frequent follow -up due to the abnormality.  
The following should not be considered as AEs:  
• Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening procedures 
(pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or con comitant illness).  
• Preplanned procedure, unless  the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial -related activity after the patient  has signed the informed consent.  
12.1.2.  Severity  
When assessing the severity of an AE, the follo wing definitions are used:  
Mild:  No or transien t symptoms, no interference with the patient 's daily activities  
Moderate:  Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the patient 's daily activities  
Severe:  Considerable interference with the patient 's daily a ctivities, which the patient  find 
unacceptable.  A severe reaction does not necessarily deem the AE as serious (SAE) , and an SAE 
is not always severe in nature.

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 44 of 71 
12.1.3.  Causality  
When assessing the cause of an AE, the following definitions are used:  
Probable:  Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a  causal relationship  
Possible:  A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
Unlikely:  The event is most likely related to etiology other than the product  
Not related:  No relationship to product . 
Causality will take into consideration whethe r the cause of the AE was related to the trial drug, 
device, or procedures.  
12.1.4.  Outcome  
When assessing the outcome of an AE, the following definitions are used:  
Recovered/resolved : The patient  has fully recovered,  or by medical or surgical treatment, the 
condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial -related activity after the patient  
signed the ICF 
Recovering/resolving:  The condition is improving and the patient  is expected to  recover from 
the eve nt. This term is only applicable  as final outcome of an event  if the patient  has completed 
the trial or has died from another AE  
Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The patient  has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect du e to a disease, injur y, treatment , or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE  
Not recovered/not resolved:  The condition of the patient  has not improved  and the symptoms 
are unchanged, or the outcome is not known  
Fatal:  This term is onl y applicable if the patient  died from a condition related to the reported 
AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a patient  before he/she died should be assessed as 
“recovere d/resolved ,” “recovering/resolving ,” “recovered/resolved with sequelae ,” or “not 
recovered/not resolved .” An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE  
Unknown:  This term is only applicable if the patient  is lost to follow -up. 
12.1.5.  Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of the fol lowing:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• is otherwise medically importa nt and may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when (based on appropriate medical judgement) it 
may jeopardize the  patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outc omes listed in the definition of an SAE. Examples could be ER or home treatment of 
allergic bronchospasm or convulsion

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 45 of 71 
12.1.6.  Other Important Events  
The following events must alwa ys be reported in the electronic data capture (EDC) system on a 
dedicated form, rega rdless of whether it is related to an AE:  
• suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product  
• overdose of the trial product  
• medication error involving the trial product  
• inadvertent or accidental exposure to the trial product  
12.1.7.  Nonserious Adverse Events 
A nonserious AE is any AE that does not fulfill the definition of an SAE.  
12.1.8.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For this trial, the following events are to be regarded as AESIs, with data collected under a 
specific eCRF form : 
• Suspicion of NME  
• Risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL AND  total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where 
no alternative etiology exists (Hy ’s law) 
• Loss of consciousness , partial , and generalized seizures  
• Clinically significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate  
12.1.9.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
An AE is considered a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) if the nature or 
severity is not consistent with the applicable product Reference Safety Information (RSI). For 
dasiglucagon , the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the 
RSI section of the investigator ’s brochure.  
12.2. Collection, Recording , and Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether serious or nonserious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated I CF is 
obtained until the end of the posttreatment follow -up period (which may include contacts fo r 
follow -up of safety)  or inclusion in the ZP4207 -17106 trial . Parent(s)/ guardian  will be asked 
about their child’s condition by open questioning, such as “How  has your child  been feeling 
since you were last asked? ” at each contact with the trial site (visit or telephone). 
Parent(s)/ guardian  will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other 
time during the trial. In addition, patients wi ll be observed for any signs or symptoms.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity,  or presumed relationship to the trial drug , must be 
recorded and evaluated by the investigator. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when 
signs and symptoms are  due to a common etiology. If no diagnosis can be made, the investigator 
should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs. Investigators must record their opinion 
concerning the relationship of the AE to the trial drug . All measures required for AE 
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.  
Each AE must be reported  on the AE eCRF  within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event .

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 46 of 71 
All AE information should a t a minimum include the follo wing:  
• Date and time of onset  
• Date and time of investigator's first information about the AE  
• Seriousness  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship with trial product  
• Measures taken due to AE  
• Interruption or discontinuation of treatment with trial product  
• Date and time o f resolution and final outcome  
Each AE will be coded using the late st version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  
All SAEs, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days after the last 
dose of trial dru g, must be reported within 24  hours after obtaining knowledge about  the event by 
completing the SAE form in the EDC system. A separate SAE form should be completed for 
each SAE.  
All SAEs will be reported in EDC ; for each reported event a system -generated e -mail will be 
sent to the safety CRO ( ), medical monitor, sponsor medical director, and trial 
manager.  
Specific information about  AESI s will be collected via the SAE form ( if qualifying for  an SAE), 
as well as via the dedicated AESI eCRF page(s). Reporting requirements for serious and 
nonserious AEs as described previously  also apply for serious and non serious AESIs.  
Other important events ( Section 12.1.6 ) will be reported via a dedicated eCRF page. Repo rting 
timelines will be within 24 h ours if related to an SAE, and 5 calendar days for all other events.  
It is the responsibility of to report all SUSARs that occur in this trial to competent 
authorities , the institutional review board (IRB), or independent ethics committee ( IEC) in 
accordance with the local requirements in force and ICH guideline for GCP.  
12.2.1.  Contact Information  
Pharmacov igilance for  this trial is outsourced to ; refer to Appendix  A for contact 
details.  
12.3. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The investigator must record follow -up information on the eCRF for non serious adverse event 
and on the SAE form for serious adverse events. Follow -up questions  to investigators regarding 
serious adverse ev ents are queried directly by  to the inves tigator.  
Follow -up information must be reported according to the following:  
• SAEs:  All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the events is “recovered/resolved ,” 
“recovered/resolved with sequelae ,” or “fatal,” and until all queries have been resolved. 
Cases of chronic conditions, cancer , or AEs that are ongoing at time of death (where death is 
due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving ” or “not 
recovered/not resolved .” Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving ”

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 47 of 71 
when the patient  has completed the follow -up period and is expected by the investigator to 
recover.  
The SAE follow -up information should only include new ( e.g., corrections or addition s) 
information and must be reported within 24 hours  of the investigator's first knowledge of the 
information. This is a lso the case for previously non serious AEs which subsequently become 
SAEs.  
• Nonserious AEs:  Nonserious AEs must be  followed until the outcome of the even t is 
“recovered/resolved ,” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae ” or until the end of the follow -up 
period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs 
have been resolved. C ases of chronic conditions, cancer , or AEs that are ongoing at time of 
death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome of 
“recovering/resolving ” or “not recovered/not resolved .” Cases can be closed with the 
outcome of “recovering/re solving ” when a patient  has completed t he follow -up period and is 
expected by the investigator to recover  or if the patient continues in the extension trial . 
If a potential hypersensitivity reaction is observed, additional blood samples , as clinically 
indicated,  may be required to further chara cterize the potential hypersensitivity reaction. If an 
anaphylactic shock is suspected, samples may be taken for the measurement of tryptase. In this 
case, a blood sample should be taken 3  to 4 hours after the event a nd again approximately 
1 to 2 weeks lat er to determine tryptase baseline levels. In addition, assessments for elevated 
histamine levels may be considered.  
The investigator must ensure that the worst -case severity and seriousness of an event is kept 
throughout the trial, from the start of trial product administration  (i.e. the most severe of the 
applied severity/seriousness categories should be ascribed to the event). Accordingly, for AEs 
with onset af ter trial product  administration, changes in the severity or seriousness of an event 
should not lead to reporting of separate AEs. In contrast, for AEs with onset before trial product 
administration, any worsening of severity/seriousness after trial produc t administration should be 
recorded as a separate AE, with onset date of the event corresponding  to the date of the 
severity/seriousness upgrade.  Similarly, AEs with onset during the blinded treatment  that worsen  
after the switch to the second blinded trea tment or to the unblinded treatment , should be recorded 
as separate AE s. 
If an AE is resolved an d re-appears later then it should be reported as a new AE.  
Queries or follow -up request s must be responded within 14 calendar days from the date of 
receipt of t he request, unless otherwise specified in the follow -up request.  
12.4. Precautions  
Normal precautions taken for a clinical  trial, including the provision of emergency equipment, 
will be taken during this trial. Qualified and well -trained physicians and medical s taff will 
instruct patient s’ parent (s)/guardian . During a patient ’s participation in the trial, the investigator 
should ensure that adequate medical care is provided to patient s for any AEs, including clinically 
significant laboratory values related to the trial. The investigator should inform the patient ’s 
parent (s)/guardian  when medical care is nee ded for intercurrent illnesses of which the 
investigator becomes aware.

12.5. Safety Committee  
An internal Zealand Safety Committee is constituted to perform ongoing safety surveillance of 
clinical trials with  dasiglucagon , including this  trial. 
If safety signals or concerns are observed, whether based on reported SAEs, review of all AEs 
and laboratory parameters reported, or any other notification of significa nt findings, the Safety 
Committee will respond appropriately to protect the safe ty of the patients.  The Safety Committee 
meets quarterly and on an ad  hoc basis as needed.  
12.6. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC)  will be established for this trial and follow  
the procedures outlined in the DMC Charter .

13. STATISTIC S 
13.1. Statistical H ypotheses  
This section details the null hypotheses for this trial. They are presented in the form H ij, where 
i = trial part (i = 1, 2) and j =  hypothesis number (j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
The hypothesis relates to the primary endpoint of mean IV GIR in the last 12 hours of each 
treatment period during Part 1. Formally, the hypothesis is:  
H11: Mean IV GIR dasiglucagon  = Mean IV GIR placebo  
The hypothes es relating to the key secondary endpoints ( based on the last 48 hours of each 
treatment period in Part 1) are:  
H12: Total amount (g) of carbohydrates administered (regardless of the route ) per day  
dasiglucagon  = total amount (g) of carbohydrates administe red (regardless of the route ) 
per day  placebo  
A fixed -sequence statistical strategy will test first the primary (Section 7.2.1 ) and then the key 
secondary endpoint of Part 1 (Section  7.2.2 ), all at the same significance level (α  = 0.05, 2 -sided 
test), moving to the next hypothesis only after rejecting the previous null hypothesis.  
The test hierarchy is:  
Part 1  
H11: Mean IV GIR in  the last 12 hours of each treatment period during Part 1 (pri mary 
endpoint)  
H12: Total amount (g) of carbohydrates administered (regardless of the route ) per day 
(key secondary endpoint)  
13.2. Sample Size Determination  
A total of 12 patients is planned to be randomized  and exposed to trial product  in this crossover 
trial on the basis of the following considerations.  
The GIR results from 40 infants treated with IV glucagon for 24 hours published in the JIMD 
Research Repor t “The Effect of Continuous Intravenous Glucagon on Glucose Requirements in 
Infants with Congenital Hype rinsulinism .”14 
“Overall there was a statistically  significant reduction in the median (IQR) GIR during the 24h 
following initiation of continuous glucagon infusion compared to 24 h before initiation 
(18.5  (12.9, 2 2.8) to 11 (6.6, 17.5) mg/kg/min…”  
This trial is powered to detect an effect in GIR for dasiglucagon after 48 hours compared to 
placebo of at least thi s effect size. Based on the longer infusion and titration of dasiglucagon in 
this trial, this is consider ed a conservative approach , allowing for some uncertainty when 
translating the published  data into a clinical trial setting. Using unpublished individual patient 
data from the above -referenced study, the difference in GIR between the 2 treatment groups is 
assumed to follow a normal distribution. Assuming the true mean difference is 7.5 mg/kg/ min 
with a standard deviation of differences of 7.36, the trial will have 89% power using a 1-sample 
t-test with 12 patients randomized to receive either placebo first and then dasiglucagon or vice 
versa.

13.3. Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations hav e been defined for this trial: 
• The Safety Set: defined as all patients administered any randomized treatment . 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS): defined as all patients in th e Safety Set who have a valid 
baseline efficacy assessment.  Patients will be analyzed according to randomized treatment 
(Part 1) or overall patients (otherwise).  
• Per protocol (PP) set: defined as al l patients in the FAS without any major protocol 
deviation s. Patients will be excluded from the PP set if they do not receive both treatments 
and/or do not have efficacy data available to evaluate the primary endpoint for both 
treatments.  
• Pharmacokinetic S et (PK): defined as  all patients in the Safety Set who hav e at least 1 
measurement with quantifiable plasma concentration of dasiglucagon.  
The primary analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the FAS. 
Supportive  analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the P P. All 
safety analyses will be based upon the safety analysis set.  
Inclusion in the analysis populations will be determined prior to database lock.  
For the primary endpoint, baseline is defined as the IV GIR rate obtained at the end of the run -in 
period wh ich corresponds to the last value obtained before randomization. During the 24 -hour 
run-in period, all non -nutritional carbohydrates and carbohydrat e fortification of feeds are 
prohibited as this might impact the GIR level and result in many updates during  the run -in 
period. Therefore the IV GIR rate obtained at the end of the run -in period will give a better 
estimate of the stabilized value of GIR. F or the second period of the cross over (Part 1), the IV 
GIR is also started at the IV GIR obtained at the end  of the run -in period. For the purpose of all 
other efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the 
start of trial drug administration on Day 1.  
13.4. Statistical Analyses  
This section  presents a summary of the planned  statistical analyses.  A statistical analysis plan  
(SAP)  that describes the  detail s of the analyses to be conducted will be finalized  prior to datab ase 
lock. 
Unless otherwise indicated, testing of statistical significance will be 2 sided  with a significanc e 
level of α = 0.05.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively; the exception to th is is the time of PG within 
prespecified ra nges, which will not have a baseline value. For categorical endpoints, descriptive 
summaries will include counts and percentages.  
All data will be presented in the data listings.  
Immunogenicity data will be analyz ed descriptively. No statistical tests are planned. Baseline 
ADA -positive patient s will be calculated as a percentage of the total number of patient s whose 
baseline samples were tested for ADA. Overall ADA incidence , the combined results of 
treatment -induc ed and treatment -boosted ADA -positive patie nts will be  calculated as a 
percentage of the total number of evaluable patients, excluding baseline positive patients without

any samples available after drug administration. Titer s will be reported as median and  
interquartile range.  
Graphical presentatio ns of selected endpoints will be prepared and will be outlined in the SAP.  
13.4.1.  Trial  Patients  and Demographics  
13.4.1.1.  Disposition  and Withdrawals  
The numbers of patients  randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with re asons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated overall and by treatment sequence . The number of patient s in each 
analysis population will be reported.  
13.4.1.2.  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be provided in a listing  and summarized if appropriate . 
13.4.1.3.  Demographic s and Other Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, and length ) 
at screening will be summarized using descriptive statistics. No formal statistical analyses will be 
performed.  
Prior an d concomitant medications and procedu res will be summarized by treatment sequence 
(prior medications and procedures) or treatment and part (concomitant medications and 
procedures) , by the number and percentage of patients  taking each medication, classified  using 
World Health Organization Drug  Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classes and 
preferred term (PT).  
13.4.2.  Duration of Exposure and Compliance  
Trial drug administration (i .e., amount administered) will be summarized in terms of each 
patient’s mean, mode, and final dose, and in terms of duration of exposure. Descriptive statistics 
for these quantities, including the mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, and quartiles, will be 
provided by treatment and part . 
13.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
13.4.3.1.  Primary Analysis  
The mean IV  GIR in the last 12 hours of each treatment period during Part 1 will be analyzed for 
the FAS and PP populations. The hypothesis:  
H11: Reduction in weighted mean IV GIR dasiglucagon  = Reduction in weighted mean 
IV GIR placebo  
will be based the last 12 hour s of each treatment period, calculated as a weighted mean across the 
12 hours, taking the actual time periods between the measurements into account (corresponding 
to calculating the  area under the curve [AUC] and dividing by the length of the time period , 
i.e., weighted mean IV GIR ). The IV GIR endpoint is expressed as glucose in mg/kg/min, i.e., 
data reported from different concentrations of the glucose used for infusion will be tra nsformed 
to this standardized unit prior to analysis.  
The primary analysis is defined by the estimand based on the treatment policy (de -facto) 
strategy, where the actual GIR measurement reported irrespective of adherence to treatment or

AD-MW -07.05 15 -Apr-2016   Page 52 of 71 
use of subsequent t herapy is used. The reduction in weighted mean IV GIR between placebo and 
dasiglucagon will be estimated.  
The weighted mean IV GIR will be analyzed using a mixed -model regression approach, with 
treatment and period as fixed effects and patient as a random effect. The 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the treatment differen ce will be calculated from the mixed regression model.  
Missing data will be imputed using the following methodology: if the weighted mean IV GIR is 
missing for the placebo period, i t will be imputed using the baseline weighted mean IV GIR; if 
the weighted mean IV GIR is missing for the dasiglucagon period, it will be imputed using the 
placebo -weighted mean IV GIR for that patient. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint 
will be re -analyzed as follows: 1) using only complete cases (i.e., weighted mea n IV GIR is 
non-missing for both placebo and dasiglucagon) and 2) imputing missing weighted mean IV GIR 
using the baseline weighted mean IV GIR  and 3) imput ing missing dasiglucagon values during 
one period with the placebo value for th at patient  and imputi ng missing placebo values with the 
mean values of placebo patients for that period. . 
13.4.3.2.  Key Secondary Analyses  
The hypothesis:  
H12: Total amount (g) of carbohydrates administered (regardless of the route ) per day  
dasiglucagon  = total amount  (g) of carbohydrat es administered (regardless of the route ) 
per day placebo  
between the 2 treatment groups will be analyzed by using a mixed -model regression approa ch, 
with treatment and period as fixed effects and patient as a random effect. The total amount  (g) of 
carbohy drates administered (regardless of the route ) per day  is the sum of the last 48  hours of 
each period in Part 1.  
For the key secondary endpoint, 2 -sided 95% CIs for the treatment differences will be estimated 
from the mixed -model . Missing dasiglucagon value s during one period will be imputed with the 
placebo value for that patient  and missing placebo values will be imputed with the mean values 
of placebo patients for that period . In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using 
complete cases.  
13.4.3.3.  Secondary and Other Efficacy Analyses  
Part 1  
A mixed -model regression approach wil l be used to analyze the weighted mean IV GIR  over 48-
hour treatment period during Part 1 (dasiglucagon or placebo administration)  similar to the 
primary analysis for the primar y endpoint . 
A generalized estimating equation (GEE) method with a logit link fu nction will be used  to 
analyze the weighted mean IV GIR  below 10 mg/kg/min in  the last 12 hours of each treatment 
period during Part 1 (yes/no) (dasigluca gon or placebo administ ration)  to account for repeated 
observations in patients . In case of non -conver gence , a Mc Nemar test will be used.  
No sensitivity analysis will be used on th ese endpoints.  
Part 2  
Due to the potential impact of pancreatectomy on the secondary endpoints dur ing Part 2, any 
endpoint assessment after pancreatectomy  will not be included in the primary analyses

(endpoints set to missing after pancreatectomy). Sensitivity analys es will be run on those 
endpoint s including all assessment s in the descriptive analys es. 
For Part 2  efficacy endpoints, continuous  and categori cal endpoints will be presented using 
summary statistics or frequencies, respectively; no formal testing will be performed.  For the time 
to complete weaning off IV GIR, the time to actual hospital dis charge and the time to pancreatic 
surgery, Kaplan -Meier curves will be produced.  
13.4.4.  Safety and Tolerability Analyses  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section  13.3). Safety assessments will include the evaluation of AEs; clinical laboratory 
assessments (hematology, biochemistry, and ADAs) ; vital signs, physical examinations; ECGs, 
echocardiography, and local tolerability issues.  No formal infer ential analyses will  be conducted 
for safety variables, unless otherwise noted.  
Base line is defined as the last non missing assessment before the first exposure to  trial drug in the 
trial. 
All safety analyses will be summarized by treatment received within treatment period and  part 
and by trial visit, if applicable.  
13.4.4.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA . 
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as an AE with an onset at the time of or following the start 
of treatment with the trial drug through the  Follow -up Visit or Early Termination Visit, 
whichever occurs first . 
The number and percentage of patient s with AEs , as well as the number of AEs,  will be 
displayed by system organ class , PT, and treatment group . The incidence of AEs will also b e 
presented by severity and relationship to the trial drug. Serious AEs, AESIs  and AEs resulting in 
discontinuation  of trial drug  will be summarized separately in a sim ilar manner. Patient  listings 
of AEs, SAEs , AESIs , and AEs causing discontinuation of trial drug  and withdrawal  from the 
trial will be produced.  
13.4.4.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual (absolute) values 
and changes from baseline values will be presented for clinical laboratory v alues.  
The number of patient s with clinical laboratory values categorized as below, within, or above 
normal ranges will be tabulated showing change from baseline (shift tables)  for each clinical 
laboratory analyte.  
Laboratory values that are outside the no rmal range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with corresponding normal ranges. Any out -of-range values that are identified by the 
investigator as being clinically significant will also be shown in a data listing.  
13.4.4.3.  Vital Signs  
Descriptive summ aries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from baseline will be calculated for systolic blood pressure, diastol ic blood pressure, 
heart rate, respiratory rate , and SpO 2.

14. TRIAL  CONDUCT  
The accuracy and reliabili ty of data are ensured, among others , by the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate trial sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
associated personnel before  the trial, periodic monitoring visits, and meticulous data 
management.  
14.1. Sponsor and Investigator Respon sibilities  
14.1.1.  Sponsor Responsibilities  
The sponsor is obligated to conduct the trial in accordance with strict ethical principles 
(Section  16). The spo nsor reserves the righ t to terminate participation of a trial site at any time 
(Section  14.7), and/or to discontinue the trial (Section 14.6 for US studies  and Section  14.6.2  for 
studies conducted outside of the US ). 
The sponsor  agrees to provide the investigator with sufficient material and support to permit the 
investigator to conduct the trial according to the trial protocol . 
14.1.2.  Investigator Resp onsibilities  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement (Section  18.2), the investigator indicates that he/ she has 
carefully read the protocol, fully understands the requirements,  and agrees to conduct the trial in 
accordance with the procedures and requiremen ts described in this pro tocol.  
The investigator also agrees to conduct this trial in accordance with all laws, regulations, and 
guidelines of the pertinent regulatory authorit ies, including the November 2016  ICH Guidance 
for Industry E6 (R2) GCP , and in agreement with the 2013  version of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
While delegation of certain aspects of the trial to subinvestigators and trial coordinators is 
appropriate, the investigator will remain personally a ccountable for closely overseeing the trial 
and for ensuring complia nce with the protocol and all applicable regulations and guidelines. The 
investigator is responsible for maintaining a list of all persons that have been delegated 
trial-related responsibi lities ( e.g., subinvestigators and trial coordinators) and their spe cific 
trial-related duties.  
Investigators should ensure that all persons who have been delegated trial-related responsibilities 
are adequately qualified and trained in the protocol, trial drugs handling , and their specific duties 
within the context of the trial. Investigators are responsible for providing the sponsor  with 
documentation of the qualifications, GCP training, and research experience for themselves and 
their staff as required by  the sponsor and the relevant governing authorities.  
To ensure compl iance with the guidelines, the trial may be audited by an independent person. 
The investigator agrees, by written consent to this protocol, to cooperate fully with compliance 
checks by all owing access to all trial documentation by authorized individuals.

14.2. Site Initiation  
Trial  personnel  may not screen or enroll patient s into the trial until after receiving notification 
from the sponsor or its designee that the trial can be initiated at the trial site. The trial site will 
not be authorized for trial initiation until:  
1. The trial site has received the appropriate IRB/ IEC approval for the protocol and the 
appropriate ICF . 
2. All regulatory documents have been submitted to and approved by the sponsor or its 
designee . 
3. The trial site has a Clinical Trial Agreement in place . 
4. Trial  site personnel, including the investigator, have participated in a trial initiation meeting.  
The regulatory  documents must be received from the investigator before the sponsor  will 
authorize shipme nt of trial drug to the trial site, Regulatory Green Light. Copies of the 
investigator’s regulatory  documents must be retained at the trial site in a secure location in the 
ISF. Additional documents, including a copy of the protocol and  applicable amendmen t(s), the 
dasiglucagon  IB, eCRF completion guidelines, copies of regulatory references, copies of 
IRB/IEC correspondence, and trial drug accountability records should also be retained in the ISF. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that copie s of all required regulatory  documents 
are organized, current, and available for inspection.  
14.3. Screen Failures  
Patients  who fail inclusion and/or exclusion criteria may be rescreened for the trial upon 
approval by the sponsor and medical monitor . Patients  may only be rescreened once 30  days or 
more after the original Screening Visit. If a patient  is eligible to enter the trial after having 
previously failed screening, the patient  will be assigned a  new patient  identification number.  
14.4. Trial  Documents  
All documentation and material provided by the sponsor  for this trial are to be retained in a 
secure location and treated as confidential material.  
14.4.1.  Investigator’s Regulatory Documents  
The regulatory  docum ents will be maintained by the investigato r in the ISF. 
14.4.2.  Case Report Forms  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement (Section  18.2), the investigator agrees to maintain 
accurate eCRF s and source documentation as part of the case histories for all patient s who sign 
an ICF.  
Case report forms are considered confidential doc uments and should be handled and stored 
accordingly. The sponsor or its designee will provide the necessary training on the use of the 
specific eCRF system used during the trial to ensure th at the trial information is captured 
accurately and appropriately.  
To ensure data accuracy, eCRF data for individual patient  visits should be completed as soon as 
possible after the visit. All requested information must be entered in the EDC system accordi ng 
to the completion guidelines provided by the sponsor or its des ignee.

The sponsor  will retain ownership of the data.  
The final CTR will be prepared and reviewed in cooperation with the signatory  investi gator. The 
coordinating  investigator will be appointed by the sponsor  to review and sign the CTR on behalf 
of all participating investi gators . This report will include a summary of  the trial results based on 
a statistical evaluation and clinical  assessment  of the protocol -defined endpoints . 
The final CTR may be submitted to the regulatory authorities.  
16. ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1. Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the November 2016  ICH Guid ance for Industry 
E6(R2) GCP (including archiving of essential trial documents), the 2013  version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki,  and the applicable regulations of the country (ies) in which the trial is 
conducted.  
See Appendix B for regulation and guidelines.  
16.2. Patient  Information and Informed Consent  
According to the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP, patient s’ parent(s)/guardian  must 
provide  their written informed  consent prior to enrollment in  a clinical trial and before any 
protocol -specified procedures are perfor med. Patients’ parent( s)/guardian  must declare their 
consent by personally signing and dating the ICF. The written ICF will embody the elements of 
informed consent as described in the Declaration of H elsinki and will also comply with local 
regulations.  
Each patient ’s parent(s)/guardian should be made aware by the investigator of the nature of the 
trial (objectives , methods , and potential hazards and benefits) and the procedures involved using 
the infor mation on the ICF. Information should be given in both o ral and written form whenever 
possible and deemed appropriate by the IRB /IEC . Patient s’ relatives, or , if necessary, legal 
representatives must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of t he trial. 
Patient  information and the ICF must be in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective 
patient ’s parent(s)/guardian . The written information must be provided  to the patient ’s 
parent(s)/guardian to give him  or her sufficient time to underst and the information and to prepare 
questions before being asked for his  or her consent. The investigator must confirm that the text 
was understood by the patient’s parent(s)/guardian . The patient ’s parent(s)/guardian will then 
sign and date the IRB /IEC -approved consent form indicating that he  or she has given his  or her 
consent for his or her child to participate in the trial. The signature confirms that the co nsent is 
based on information that has been understood. The form will also be signed by the invest igator 
obtaining the consent and annotated with the trial patient  number. Each signed patient  
parent(s)/guardian ICF must be kept on file by the investigator for possible inspection by 
regulatory authorities, the sponsor , and/or the sponsor’s designee . Col lection of informed c onsent 
has to be documented on the eCRF.  
Furthermore, the patient ’s parent(s)/guardian  will be informed that if he  or she wishes to 
drop-out or withdraw his or her child (see Section  9.2.3 ) at any time during the trial, this will not 
have any negat ive consequences. Patients  may be withdrawn by the investigator if any change

related to safety or ethics precludes further particip ation in the trial. Patients’ parent(s)/guardian  
will be asked to agree to a final assessment in the event of an early termination of the trial. 
If information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue 
participating in the trial, the investigator must inform the patients’ parent(s)/g uardian in a timely 
manner, and a revised wr itten informed consent must be obtained.  
Patients’ parent(s)/guardian  will be informed that data from their children’s case may be stored 
in a computer without inclusion of their name and that such data will not be revealed to any 
unauthori zed third party. Data will be reviewed by the monitor, an independent auditor , and 
possibly by representatives of regulatory authoritie s and/or IRBs/IECs . The terms of the local 
data protection legislation will be applied as app ropriate.  
16.3. Approval by Institutional Review Board and Independent Ethics Committee  
For Investigational New Drug studies, the minimum standards of conduct and requir ements for 
informed consent are defined in the FDA regulations.  
A valid IRB/ IEC must review a nd approve  this protocol before trial initiation. Written 
notification of approval is to be provided by the investigator to the sponsor ’s monitor  and project 
manager before shipment of investigational drug supplies, and will include the date of the 
committ ee’s approval and the chairperson’s signature. This written approval must consist of a 
completed sponsor  form , IRB/IEC  Approval F orm, or written docum entation from the IRB /IEC  
containing the same information.  
Until written approval by the IRB/IEC has been received by the investigator, no patient  may 
undergo any procedure not part of routine care for the patient ’s condition . 
Protocol amendments must also be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC . Written approval 
from the IRB/IEC , or a designee, must be receiv ed by the sponsor  before implementation. This 
written approval will consist of a completed IRB Approval Form or written d ocumentation from 
the IRB/IEC containing the same information.  
16.4. Finance and Insurance  
Details on finance and insurance will be provided  in a separate agreement between th e 
investigator and the sponsor.

Note: Unscheduled visits can occur at any time if the investigator deems it necessary for patient safety.  
a The Follow -up Visit will only be performed for patients who will not enter the extensio n trial.  
b After screening, eligible patients will complete a minimum 24 -hour run -in period to confirm the IV glucose randomization re quirement (≥10 mg/kg/min). All non -nutritional 
carbohydrates and carbohydrate fortification of feeds are prohibited during  this 24 -hour run -in period.  
c Visits 5 (Day 11) and 6 (Day 18)  can be converted to phone visits at the investigator’s discretion.  
d Patients who are discharged from the hospital before Day 25 will be contacted by the investigator by telephone the day afte r discharge. The investigator will ask the 
parent(s)/guardian if they have any questions about the trial procedures and if their child  has experienced any AEs.  
e Body length will be measured at screening and at the End of Treatment  Visit. 
f For CHI diagnosis: Data on biochemical parameters, genotyping results, and information about PET  CT should be captured when available.  
g An e chocardiogram performed within 1 month of screening can be used.  
h Vital signs should be measured at 6  ± 1, 12 ± 2, and 24  ± 4 hours after initiation of the trial drug  and every 8 ± 2 hours hereafter . 
i Fluid balance assessments are to be performed and doc umented every 8 hours as long as the patient is receiving IV glucose.  
j Clinical laboratory tests include hematology and bi ochemistry.  
k Blood test for anti -drug antibodies to be performed prior to dosing.  Any anti -dasiglucagon antibody -positive patient (t reatment induced  or treatment boosted) will be monitored 
at an additional Follow -up Visit preferably 16 weeks after last ADA -positive sample.  Patients completing the trial before the ADA screening and confirmatory assay s have 
been approved  by the FDA and w ho do not continue treatment in the long -term extension trial will have this additional visit 16 weeks after the end of trial visit (visit 8) .

l Sampling for drug exposure at Day 5  is only applicable for patients with a body weight of ≥4 k g. This sample should only be collected if it does not compromise the total 
amount of blood drawn according to Section 11.2.3.1 . 
m The diary should be dispensed if a patient is discharged from the hospital during Part 2. At subsequent visits, the parent(s)/guardian will return the completed diary and obtain a 
new one.

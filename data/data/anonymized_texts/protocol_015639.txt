Protocol Title:  Belatacept Therapy for the Failing Renal Allograft  
Site Numbers & 
Names: Protocol IM103-133, Emory University 
Research Hypothesis:  Belatacept will effectively inhibit sensitization (ie donor-
specific allo-antibody production) in patients  with a failing  or 
failed renal allograft and as a result will facilitate  re-
transplantation .  In addition treatment with belatacept will 
more favorably impact residual allograft function (ie preservation of GFR) in patients with IF/TA as compared to treatment with conventional immunosuppression thereby 
prolonging time to dialysis or need for re-transplant.

Length of Treatment)  -Standard of ca re arm- 
Upon enrollment into the study- wean  tacrolimus , or sirolimus 
dose to target level of 3 -5 (or equivalent CNI or mTOR 
inhibitor level), and if applicable continue mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA) (equivalent of at 
least 1g dail y) or azathioprine, and/or prednisone (at least 5 
mg daily) 
 Upon initiation of dial ysis or in subjects already requiring 
dialysis at time of enrollment- discontinue CNI or mTOR inhibitor over 5 days, if applicable MMF/MPA  or 
azathioprine dose decreased b y half then discontinued 2 
weeks later, steroid withdrawal beginning 1 month after t he 
initiation of dialysis with monthly reduction by half with plans to discontinue at 3 months after initiation of dialysis.      -Belatacept arm - 
 Upon enrollment into the study- initiate  Belatacept, dosing 
10mg/kg- day 0, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks; subsequent doses 5mg/kg qmonth through duration of 
trial or until re -transplantation, whichever is first. Dose of 
CNI or mTOR inhibitor  will be reduced by 50% at t ime of 
first dose of belatacept. CNI or mTOR inhibitor will be 
discontinued at week 2 dose of belatacept.  If applicable 
continue MMF or MPA  (equivalent of at least 1g daily) or 
azathioprine , and/or prednisone 
 
Upon initiation of dialysis or in subjects alr eady requiring 
dialysis at time of enrollment - wean 
remaining  immunosuppression as above in standard of care 
arm except for  belatacept which they will remain on for the 
duration of the study or until re -transplant.   
Study Objectives:  
• Primary:  
• Secondary:  Primary:  To prevent the formation of donor -specific 
alloantibody in patients with chronic allograft injury (grade II 
or III IF/TA), thereby facilitating re -transplantation by 
avoiding sensitization 
Secondary:  To determine if treatment with belatacept better 
preserves GFR in those patients with marginal renal function 
as compared to those patients who continue calcineurin inhibitor therapy or mTOR inhibitor therapy and as a result delays time to initiation of dialysis.

Presence of donor-sp ecific antibody  at the time of enrollment 
Age>70 years  
Extra-renal organ transplant 
Biopsy proven acute rejection > Banff grade Ia within the last

Criteria for Evaluation:  
(Efficacy, safety,  
stopping rules, etc.)  A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor emerging 
efficacy and overall safety data regularly to ensure that the benefits and risks of study participation remain acceptable.  
During its regular reviews, the DMC will also assess the rate progression to dialysis, development of allo-antibody, and serious adverse events (SAEs), including serious infections and malignancies.  Bas ed on the regular reviews of emerging 
data, the DMC may recommend to the sponsor alt eration 
and/or termination of the trial or cessation of further enrollment into a treatment group. 
10 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Statistics:  There will be two main methods of analyzing the primary 
outcome at the end of the study.  One will be a chi -squared 
test comparing the proportion of patients who developed 
donor-specific antibody in each study group.  The second 
analysis will be a log -rank test comparing the survival curves 
(survival being defined as the time until development of donor 
specific antibody) between the two study groups.   A separate 
set of similar analyses will evaluate both the need and time to 
initiating dialysis.  Subjects requiring dialysis at the time of 
enrollment will be excluded  from this analysis.  In both 
calculations there are s imilar assumptions made; we will use a 
two-sided test with a significance level of 0.05 and the  sample 
size for each arm will be 30 patients. Other measures that will be evaluated with standard statistic al methods include t he 
change in PRA, the level of allo- antibody intensity, GFR and 
change in GFR.

1.1 Research Hypothesis 
Treatment with belatacept will effectively inhibit sensitization (ie donor -specific antibody 
production) in patients with a failing or failed renal allograft and as a result will facilitate 
re-transplantat ion.  In addition treatment with belatacept will more favorably impact 
residual allograft function (ie preservation of GFR) in patients with IF/TA as compared to 
treatment with conventional immunosuppression thereby prolonging time to dialysis or 
need for re-transplant. 
1.2 Summary of Results of Investigational Program  
Belatacept represents a new class of immunosuppressive therapy. As a soluble chimeric 
protein, belatacept was designed to selectively inhibit the co- stimulation of T -cells by 
targeting the bl ockade of key co -stimulatory signals required for T -cell activation. 
Belatacept was derived from the novel fusion protein CTLA4Ig (abatacept, 
BMS-188667) and differs from its parent molecule at 2 point mutations. Compris ed of a 
modified extracellular domain of human CTLA4 fused to a fragment of the Fc domain of 
a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody, bel atacept contains 2 amino acid 
modifications. Like its predecessor, b elatacept differs from existing immunosuppressants 
in the selective distribution of its  molecular target an d the specificity of its effect. 
Additionally, it has demonstrated a higher  avidity for the blockade of specific humoral 
responses.  
1.2.1  Pharmacology of Belatacept  
T-cell activation requires 2 signals: T-cell receptor antigen binding and a subsequent 
co-stimulatory signal. The first signal, which is antigen specific, is delivered by 
engagement of the T-cell receptor with antigen presented in context wi th major 
histocompatibility complex molecules on the antigen presenting cell (APC). The second, 
or co-stimulatory signal, is delivered by engagement of a co- stimulatory ligand on the 
APC with a receptor on the T-cell. A key co -stimulatory signal is provided by the 
interaction of B7- 1 (CD80) and B7- 2 (CD86) on APCs with CD28 expressed on T -cells. 
In the absence of this second signal, the T -cell becomes anergic (unresponsive) or 
undergoes apoptosis. Engagement of this second signal allows for full T -cell activation 
12 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  and initiation of the inflammatory cascade. When the T -cell becomes fully act ivated, 
CTLA4 (CD152) becomes expressed on the cell surface. CTLA4 has a substantially 
higher avidity (approximately 500- to 2,500- fold) than CD28 for CD80 and CD86. 
CD28/CTLA4 engagement blocks further activation of T -cells. The increased avidity of 
endogenous CTLA4, in comparison with CD28, affords a homeostatic mechanism to 
down-regulate T -cell activity. By binding avidly to CD80/86, the fusion protein 
CTLA4Ig  (abatacept)  blocks the interaction of the T -cell’s CD28 with the APC’s 
CD80/CD86, thus preventi ng T-cells from receiving the required second co- stimulatory 
signal. Belatacept has the same mechanism of action, but demonstrates a higher avidity 
for the CD86. 
Belatacept ’s parent molecule, CTLA4Ig  (abatacept),  has been shown to be effective in a 
wide variety of preclinical models and in subjects with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). With respect to transplantation, CTLA4Ig (abatacept)  demonstrated efficacy in 
rodent models of transplantation, but did not demonstrate substantial efficacy in a 
non-human primate renal transplant model (cynomolgus monkey). Therefore, belatacept, 
a 2 amino acid variant of CTLA4Ig, was developed. This alteration resulted in markedly increased binding avidity for B7 molecules, in particular B7- 2 (CD86). Belatacept was 
subsequently shown to prevent allograft rejection in a non human primate renal transplant 
model in which CTLA4Ig was not effective (see Investigator Brochure for additional details). 
1.2.2  Preclinical Toxicology of Belatacept  
In a single -dose IV toxicity st udy, cynomolgus monkeys were treated with 0 (control), 9,  
30, or 90 mg/kg of belatacept.
1 No drug-related toxicity was observed in monkeys given 
belatacept at doses of up to 90 mg/kg. At doses of 9 and 30 mg/kg, antibodies to belatacept developed 5 and 6 w eeks after drug administration, respectively. In the 
presence of these antibodies, the rate of drug elimination from serum was increased.  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies
2,3 conducted in cynologus monkeys , IV belatacept was 
well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/kg every other day for 1 month (15 doses), and once 
weekly for 6 months (26 doses). Major nonclinical findings were reversible, related to the pharmacology of the drug, and consisted of minimal decreases in serum IgG levels. 
Minimal to moderate lymphoid  depletion of germinal centers in the spleen and/or lymph 
nodes at all dose levels was noted. Functional activity of the immune system was demonstrated at all doses by a robust antibody response to the immunogenic KLH 
13 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  following immunization after an 8 -week dose-free recovery -period. Immunogenicity 
when observed followed the treatment peri od. 
Although belatacept has demonstrated an increase in binding affinity in human and 
non-human primates for CD80 and CD86, the binding affinity for murine CD80 and 
CD86 is lower with belatacept as compared to abatacept.4 In studies evaluating the 
in vivo activity of belatacept in various species, belatacept was found to be either 
as active as, or less active than, abatacept in rodents and rabbits. Thus, belatacept’s 
increase in bioactivity seen in monkeys and humans do not directly translate to other 
species. As a result, the nonclinical safety assessment for belatacept was conducted in the cynomolgous monkey. To support this data, abatacept nonclinical safety assessments, 
including 6- month rodent toxicity, genetic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive 
toxicity studies were pro vided (see Investigator’s Brochure for further details).  
Currently, a complete battery of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with belatacept is being conducted in rats and rabbits. Early results show that there were no 
effects of belatacept on reproductive function in either male or female rats, and no effect 
on early embryonic development at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (human exposure m ultiple 
of 38-fold.

1.2.3  Other Toxicity Studies  
1.2.3.1 Immunogenicity  
Belatacept, a human protein, is immunogenic in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys based 
on the ability of each species to induce belatacept -specific antibodies.1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 
However, as expected, belatacept -specific antibodies were generally detected only during 
the recovery period, suggesting that belatacept -specific antibodies were not formed until 
after belatacept serum lev els had dropped below immunosuppressive levels. Thus, in 
each species tested, belatac ept suppressed the antibody response against itself. Once 
belatacept specific antibodies were present, clearance of drug from the blood vascular compartment was often accelerated. However, exposure was maintained during the treatment period of each pivota l study. The appearance of belatacept -specific antibodies 
was not associated with any acute or target -organ toxicity. 
14 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  1.2.4 Human Pharmacokinetics of Belatacept  
In a Phase 1 study14 assessing the pharmacokinetic (PK) of escalating single IV doses of 
belatacept in healthy volunteers, the Cmax appeared to increase proportionally to dose, 
and AUC(INF) appeared to increase in a more than dose -proportional manner. The 
observed T -HALF ranged between 86- 222 hours at the dose levels tested. Following a 
single IV infusion of 1- 20 mg/kg, CLT values ranged from 0.45- 0.49 mL/h/kg. The VSS 
values were small, indicating that the drug (with high molecular weight) was confined 
mainly in the b lood and in the extracellular space. Both CLT and VSS appeared to be 
dose independent between the 1 and 20 mg/kg dose levels. The PK of belatacept appears 
to be linear following IV administration in healthy subjects at dose levels of 1 -20 mg/kg. 
The mean P K parameters in healthy patients are summarized in the table below.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  In a Phase 1 study15 assessing the single subcutaneous doses of bel atacept in healthy 
volunteers, belatacept was dose dependent. From 50 to 100 mg, the Cmax increased 
slightly greater than the dose increment, whereas the AUC (INF) increased in a 
dose-related manner. From 100 to 150 mg, both Cmax and AUC incr eased in a 
proportion greater than the dose increment. 
The Cmax and AUC(0- 6h) values of belatacept following IV  infusion to renal transplant 
subjects were dose proportional  at 5 and 10 mg/kg. Accumulation index values <  1.5 
indicated minimal belatacept acc umulation after multiple dosing at the dosing intervals of 
2-8 weeks. The steady state was reached after approximately 3 doses for every 4- week 
dosing or after 1- 2 doses for every 8 -week dosing. The steady- state Cmin levels at 5 
mg/kg were 2-4 μg/mL for eve ry 4-week dosing and 0.2-0.4 μg/mL for every 8- week 
dosing. During the long term extension phase (LTE), belatacept exposure [area under the 
concentration -time curve in 1 dosing interval, AUC(TAU)] for subjects on the 4- week 
schedule was slig htly higher (1.3 -fold) than those [AUC(0- T)] on the 8- week schedule, 
indicating minimal accumulation upon 4- week multiple dosing. The mean steady- state 
VSS was 0.12 L/kg, indicating that this high molecular weight drug was confined mainly in the blood in t he extracellular space. Mean T -HALF of belatacept in renal transplant 
subjects was 197 hours (~8 days). Belatacept geometric mean steady- state Cmin for 
subjects on the 4- week schedule was 5.7 μg/mL. In contrast, geometric mean belatacept 
trough level for subjects on the 8-week schedule was 0.25 μg/mL. Overall, belatacept PK in renal transplant recipients was comparable to that in healthy subjects. 
In a multiple -dose Phase 2 study,
16 the PK profile was evaluated in subjects with RA. 
Both Cmax and AUC(TAU) values appeared to increase in ratio comparable to the dose 
increment ratio after first and last dose administration. Accumulation of belatacept was found to be minimal in t he applied dosing schedule. The mean PK parameters are 
summarized in the table below.

1.2.5  Clinical Safety with Belatacept  
1.2.5.1 Healthy Subjects  
No deaths or discontinuations due to AE’s were reported in healthy subjects treated with 
belatacept.14,15,17 Medical events including skin infection (n=1) and pharyngitis (n=1) 
was reported in subjects treated with 50 and 75 mg of belatacept, respectively. Common 
AEs included headache and nasopharyngitis. 
1.2.5.2 Post Transplant 
Study IM103100 
In a Phase 2 Study (IM103100)  18 the safety of belatacept vs. cyclosporine (CsA) was 
assessed as part of a quadruple therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and 
basiliximab in de novo renal transplant recipients.  
17 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Subjects treated with belatacept were randomized to 2 dosing groups: more intensive 
(MI) and less intensive (LI). For the MI regimen, subjects were dosed at 10 mg/kg on 
Days 1, 5, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 113, 141, and 169, and then at 5 mg/kg every 4 or 8 
weeks starting on Day 197. For the LI  regimen, subjects were dosed at 10 mg/kg on Days 
1, 15, 29, 57, and 85. Staring on Day 113, these subjects received 5 mg/kg belatacept every 4 or 8 weeks. PK parameters, such as AUC(0- 6h), Cmax, and Cmin, were assessed, 
and the data are presented in Tables 5.2.5.1A, 5.2.5.1B, and 5.2.5.1C. 
Overall, almost all subjects in each treatment group  experienced at least 1 AE.

Study IM103100 Long T erm Extension  
Among the 164 patients who completed the 12- month phase, 128 patients continued in a 
long term extension (LTE) phase of the study; 102 and 26 patients were entered into the 
pooled (MI+LI) belatacept and CsA groups, respectively. As of 12- OCT-07, a LTE safety 
analysis determined that overall rates of AEs, SAEs and discontinuations were similar 
between belatacept and CsA treated subjects. The safety summary of patients entered in 
the LTE phase is summarized in Table 1.2.5.2D below.

The most commonly reported AEs ( ≥ 10% in each arm) reported among the pooled 
belatacept patients (MI + LI) in the LTE were psychiatric disorders (22%), cough (17%), 
pyrexia (16%), bronchitis (14%), reproductive system and breast disorders (22%), cough 
(17%), influenza (12%) and hyperlipidemia (11%).  
The most frequently reported SAEs ( ≥ 2/5% subjects) among pooled belatacept patients 
included neoplasms and malignancies (12%), infections and infestations (16%), and 
immune disorders (11%). The belatacept group reported congenital, familial and genetic disorders (4 subjects, 4%) more frequently than the CsA group. 
During the LTE phase (as of 12- OCT-2007), 9 subjects discontinued belatacept (MI or 
LI). The most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation among belatacept treated 
subjects was transplant rejection in 2 subjects (2%). 
During the IM103100 LTE, 3 deaths (2 belatacept MI and 1 belatacept LI) were reported 
in the belatcept group. Of these, 2 deaths were considered unrelated to study drug (severe 
cardio-respiratory arrest and cardiac infarction). One death attributed to P. carinii  
pneumonia, was considered possibly related to the study drug.

Phase III Studies: IM103008 and IM103027 
Two phase III, randomized, controlled studies were performed to assess the efficacy and 
safety of Belatacept in de novo kidney transplant patients.  Study IM103008 (Study 1) 
23 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  evaluated its use in recipients receiving standard criteria donor kidneys and study 
IM103027 (Study 2) evaluated its performance in recipients who were tr ansplanted with 
kidneys from extended criteria donors.  Belatacept was studied at the currently 
recommended dose and frequency in a total of 401 patients compared to a cyclosporine 
control regimen in a total of 405 patients. These two trials also included a total of 403 
patients treated with a belatacept  regimen of higher cumulative dose and more frequent 
dosing than currently recommended. All patients also received basiliximab  induction, 
mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Patients were treated and followed for 3 
years. 
CNS PTLD, PML, and other CNS infections were more frequently observed in  
association with a belatacept  regimen of higher cumulative dose and more frequent  
dosing compared to the  current recommended regimen; therefore, administration of 
higher than the recommended doses and/or more frequent dosing of belatacept will not be 
used in this trial.  The average age of patients in these studies was 49 years, ranging from 
18 to 79 years.  Approximately 70% of patients were male; 67% were white, 11% were black, and 22% other races. About 25% of patients were from the United States and 75% 
from other countries. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of patients treated 
with the recommende d dose and frequency of belatacept were anemia, diarrhea, urinary  
tract infection, peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, pyrexia, graft dysfunction, cough, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and leukopenia.  The 
proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was  13% for 
the recommended belatacept  regimen and 19% for the cyclosporine control arm through 
three years of treatment. The most common adverse reactions leading  to discontinuation 
in belatacept -treated patients were cytomegalovirus infection (1.5%)  and complications 
of transplanted kidney (1.5%).  Information on selected significant adverse react ions 
observed during clinical trials is summarized below.  
 
24 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder 
Reported cases of post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) up to 36 months 
post transplant were obtained for belatacept by pooling both dosage regimens of 
belatacept in both studies (804 patients) with data from a third study in kidney 
transplantation (145 patients) which evaluated two belatacept dosage regimens similar, 
but slightly different, from those  of Studies 1 and 2 (see table below ). The total number 
of belatacept patients from these three studies (949) was compared to the pooled cyclosporine control groups from all three studies (476 patients). 
Among 401 patients in Studies 1 and 2 treated with the recommended regimen of  
belatacept  and the 71 patients in Study 3 treated with a very similar (but non- identical)  
belatacept  regimen, there were 5 cases of PTLD: 3 in EBV seropositive patients and 2 in 
EBV seronegative patients. Two of the 5 cases presented with CNS involvement.  Among 
the 477 patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 treated with the belatacept  regimen of  higher 
cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended, there were  8 cases of 
PTLD: 2 in EBV seropositive patients and 6 in EBV seronegative or serostatus  unknown 
patients. Six of the 8 cases presented with CNS involvement. Therefore, administration of higher than the recommended doses or more frequent dosing of  belatacept  is not 
recommended.  
One of the 476 patients treated with cyclosporine developed PTLD, without CNS  
involvement.   All cases of PTLD reported up to 36 months post transplant in belatacept - 
or cyclosporine -treated patients presented within 18 months of transplantation.  Overall, 
the rate of PTLD in 949 patients tr eated with any of the belatacept regimens was  9-fold 
higher in those who were EBV seronegative or EBV serostatus unknown (8/139)  
compared to those who were EBV seropositive (5/810 patients). Therefore belatacept  is 
recommended for use only in patients who are EBV seropositive.

EBV Seropositive Subpopulation 
Other Malignancies  
Malignancies, excluding non- melanoma skin cancer and PTLD, were reported in Study 1 
and Study 2 in 3.5% (14/401) of patients treated with the recommended belatacept 
regimen and 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen.  
Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% (6/401) of patients treated with the 
recommended belatacept regimen and in 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with 
cyclosporine. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  
Two fatal cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been  
reported among 1096 patients treated with a belatacept -containing regimen: one patient in 

26 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  clinical trials of kidney trans plant (Studies 1, 2, and 3 described above) and  one patient in 
a trial of liver transplant (trial of 250 patients). No cases of PML were  reported in 
patients treated with th e recommended belatacept  regimen or the control  regimen in these 
trials. 
The kidney transplant recipi ent was treated with the belatacept  regimen of higher  
cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than currently recommended, mycophenolate  
mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids for 2 years. The liver transplant recipient was  treated 
with 6 months of a belatacept  dosage regimen that was more intensive than that studied in 
kidney transplant recipients, MMF at doses higher than the recommended dose, and 
corticosteroids. 
Bacterial, Mycobacterial, Viral, and Fungal Infections 
Adverse reactions of infectious etiology were reported based on clinical assessment  by 
physicians. The causative organisms for these reactions are identified whe n provided by 
the physician. The overall number of infections, serious infections, and select infections 
with identified etiology reported in patients treated with the belatacept recommended 
regimen or the cyclosporine control in Studies 1 and 2 are shown below . Fungal 
infections were reported in 18% of patients receiving belatacept compared to 22% 
receiving cyclosporine,  primarily due to skin and mucocutaneous  fungal infections. 
Tuberculosis and herpes infections were reported more frequently in patients receiving 
belatacept  than cyclosporine. Of the patients who developed tuberculosis through 3 years, 
all but one belatacept  patient lived in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis

Infections Reported in the CNS  
Following three years of treatment in Studies 1 and 2, cryptococcal meningitis was 
reported in one patient out of 401 patients treated with the belatacept  recommended 
regimen (0.2%) and one patient out of the 405 treated with the cyclosporine control  
(0.2%).  Six patients out of the 403 w ho were treated with the belatacept  regimen of 
higher cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended in Studies 1 and 2  
(1.5%) were reported to have developed CNS infections, including 2 cases of  
cryptococcal meningitis, one  case of Chagas encephalitis with cryptococcal meningitis,  
one case of cerebral aspergillosis, one case of West Nile encephalitis, and one case of 
PML (discussed above). 

28 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Infusion Reactions  
There were no reports of anaphylaxis or drug hypersensitivity in pa tients treated with 
belatacept in Studies 1 and 2 through three years.  Infusion- related reactions within one 
hour of infusion were reported in 5% of patients treated with the recommended dose of 
belatacept, similar to the placebo rate. No serious events w ere reported through Year 3. 
The most frequent reactions were hypotension and hypertension. 
Proteinuria  
At month 1 after transplantation in Studies 1 and 2, the frequency of 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick in patients treated with the belatacept recommend ed regimen was 33% 
(130/390) and 28% (107/384) in patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen. The frequency of 2+ proteinuria was similar between the two treatment groups between 
one and three years after transplantation (<10% in both studies).  There were no 
differences in the occurrence of 3+ proteinuria (<4% in both studies) at any time point, and no patients experienced 4+ proteinuria. The clinical significance of this increase in 
early proteinuria is unknown. 
New-Onset Diabetes After Transp lantation 
The incidence of new -onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) was defined in 
Studies 1 and 2 as use of an antidiabetic agent for ≥30 days or ≥2 fasting plasma glucose values ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) post- transplantation. Of the patients treate d with the 
belatacept recommended regimen, 5% (14/304) developed NODAT by the end of one year com pared to 10% (27/280) of patients on the cyclosporine control regimen. 
However, by the end of the third year, the cumulative incidence of NODAT was 8% (24/304) in patients treated with the belatacept  recommended regimen and 10% (29/280) 
in patients treated  with the cyclosporine regimen. 
Hypertension  
Blood pressure and use of antihypertensive medications were reported in Studies 1 and 2. 
By Year 3, one or more antihypertensive medications were used in 85% of belatacept -
29 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  treated patients and 92% of cyclosporine- treated patients. At one year after 
transplantation, systolic blood pressures were 8 mmHg lower and diastolic blood 
pressures were 3 mmHg lower in patients treated with the belatacept recommended 
regimen compared to the cyclosporine control regimen. At t hree years after 
transplantation, systolic blood pressures were 6 mmHg lower and diastolic blood pressures were 3 mmHg lower in belatacept -treated patients compared to cyclosporine -
treated patients. Hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 32% of belatacept -
treated patients and 37% of cyclosporine- treated patients.  
Dyslipidemia  
Mean values of total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were reported in Studies 1 and 2.  At one year after transplantation these values were 183 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 102 
mg/dL, and 151 mg/dL, respectively, in 401 patients treated with the belatacept 
recommended regimen and 196 mg/dL, 48 mg/dL, 108 mg/dL, and 195 mg/dL, 
respectively, in 405 patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen. At three years 
after transplantation, the total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were 176 mg/dL, 
49 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, and 141 mg/dL, respectively, in belatacept -treated patients 
compared to 193 mg/dL, 48 mg/dL, 106 mg/dL, and 180 mg/dL in cyclosporine -treated 
patients.  The clinical significance of the lower mean triglyceride values in NULOJIX -
treated patients at one and three years is unknown.

Twelve subjects reported SAEs , and none was considered drug related by the  
investigators. Sixteen subjects reported SAEs, and only 1 was considered possibly drug 
related by the investigators (elbow infection in an abatacept subject in the 2 mg/kg 
group). No deaths were reported during the treatment period or the follow -up period 
(through Day 169). All AEs and SAEs reported in belatacept -treated subjects that  were 
not also reported in the renal t ransplant patients are listed in the updated Investigator’s 
Brochure. Please refer to that d ocument for further details. 
1.2.6  Clinical Efficacy of Belatacept  
In study IM103100 the efficacy of belatacept in post transplant  patients was assessed. 
The trial evaluated  the incidence of clinically -suspected and biopsy -proven acute 
rejection (CSBPAR) in patients at 6 months post -transplantation. Secondary variables 
including biopsy- proven acute rejections (BPARs), CSBPAR, death, and/or graft loss 
were assessed at 1 year.  
1.2.6.1 Acute Rejection  
CSBPAR at 6 months, occurred infrequently across all treatment groups  (Table 1.2.6) . 
The incidence rate of CSBPAR was slightly lower in the belatacept groups than in the 
CsA group. The distribution of events by severity (as indicated by histological grade) was 
similar across the 3 treatment groups. Identical resu lts were observed at 12 months. The 
criteria for non -inferiority to CsA were easily satisfied for both belatacept groups; 
however, the number of events was too small to support any further conclusions 
regarding the relative efficacy of the 3 regimens.  
The secondary endpoint of BPAR occurred 2 to 4 times more frequently than the primary 
endpoint of CSBPAR, indicating that most BPAR episodes were subclinical (ie, not associated with an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL). These episodes of 
subclinical rejection were observed on biopsies taken to satisfy the protocol requirements, according to local practice, or for other reasons than an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL. 
BPAR occurred most frequently in the belatacept LI group. As the rate of CSBPAR was 
comparable across treatment groups, the difference in the rate of BPAR was due to an increase in the number of subclinical rejection episodes in the belatacept LI treatment 
32 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  arm. Reallocation to 8 -week treatment was associated with an increased  frequency of 
subclinical rejection. Overall, the histologic severity grade of acute rejection episodes 
appeared to be similar across the 3 treatment groups.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  1.2.6.2 Chronic Allograft Nephropathy 
Biopsy specimens were also examined for chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN ) 
including arteriolar hyalinosis, interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and tubular 
atrophy. By Month 12, CAN was approximately 30% to 50%, in relative terms, less 
common with belatacept than with CsA.

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020   
1.2.6.4 Renal Function  
Renal function was assessed by measurement of iohexol clearance. Iohexol clearance was 
greater in the belatacept groups than in the CsA group at all time points. Serum creatinine 
and creatinine -based estimates of renal function were also assessed. These measures are 
known to be less sensitive and more variable than true measures of GFR. However, 
assessments of renal function by these measures generally favored belatacept.  
Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was slightly higher with CsA (133 mm Hg) than with 
belatacept by Month 12 (SBP: 130 and 129 mm Hg in the MI and LI groups, respectively). Antihypertensive medication use was also somewhat more common with CsA use than with bel atacept use.  
At Month 12, mean total cholesterol was slightly lower with both the belatacept MI and 
LI groups, respectively, than with CsA (198 and 201 mg/dL vs. 212 mg/dL), as were both 
the mean non- high density lipoprotein (non- HDL) fraction (145 and 144 mg/dL vs. 151 
mg/dL) and the mean HDL fraction (53 and 56 mg/dL vs. 59 mg/dL). Lipid-lowering medications were used more frequently with CsA (53%) than with belatacept 
(32%-36%). 
At Month 12, mean HbA1c was slightly lower with belatacept (5.8% in both groups) than 
with CsA (6.2%). The incidence of new -onset PTDM was slightly lower with belatacept 
than with CsA (2 and 0 subjects in the MI and LI groups, respectively vs. 3 subjects). 
1.2.6.5 IM103100 Long Term Extension 
Of the 164 subjects  who completed the  12-month phase, 128 subjects (102/113 subjects 
from the MI + LI belatacept group and 26/51 subjects in the CsA group) consented to 
continue in the long term extension (LTE) phase of the study. 
During the LTE phase, a low rate of acute rejection, death, or  graft loss  was reported  in 
belatacept subjects. Two cases of acute rejection (CSBPAR) were reported in the 
belatacept group (1 each in the MI/8- week and LI/8 -week groups). Six cases of BPAR, 
including 2 cases of CSPAR , were reported in the combined belatacept group. All of 
these cases were mild or moderate in severity.  The incidence of CAN was reported in 25 
cases in the combined belatacept group and 9 cases in the CsA group. 
36 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  In the LTE phase, mean calculated GFR (MDRD formula) was reportedly higher in the  
belatacept group. At Months 12 and 60, GFR was reported as 75.8 and 
77.2 mL/min/1.73  m2, respectively in the combined belatacept group and 74.4 and 
59.3 mL/min/1.73  m2, respectively, in the CsA group. 
Five deaths were reported: 3 in the combined belatacep t group (2 died with a functioning 
graft) and 2 in the CsA group (both died with a functioning graft). The causes of death 
reported among the belatacept subjects were myocardial infarction (LI), cardiopulmonary 
arrest (MI) and pneunomia (MI).  
1.3 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
1.3.1 Potential Benefits  
The field of transplantation is moving towards optimizing immunosuppression to avoid the toxicities of the current immunosuppressive regimens while at the same time 
achieving  acceptable efficacy. Belatacept i s being developed as an immunosuppressive  
agent for kidney transplant to provide comparable efficacy to the current standard immunosuppressive class, CNIs, with an improved safety profile. At present, CNI -based 
regimens are suboptimal for several reasons. First, CNIs are frequently not initiated until 
after there is sufficient clinical evidence of allograft function. This potential for delayed administration in a critical immunologic window may lead to increased acute rejection rates. Polyclonal antilymphocyte preparations may be used as an immunosuppressive bridge until a CNI may be safely administered; however, these preparations have 
short-term adverse effects (infection) as well as long -term sequelae (PTLD). These 
adverse effects must be factored into th e risk burden of a CNI- based regimen.  
Second, the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects of CNI -based regimens further 
weigh on the benefit -risk ratio of these agents. Since CNIs are well known to cause or 
exacerbate conditions such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes mellitus, 
renal transplant recipients are vulnerable to these adverse effects of CNIs. Unfortunately, while alternative CNI -free regimens have been previously tested, none have been proven 
to offer a favorable benefit -risk relationship. Therefore, CNIs remain the cornerstone for 
immunosuppression in these subjects despite their known liabilities. 
An alternative strategy to promote improvement in kidney transplant function has been 
the use of mTOR inhibitors, s irolimus or everolimus, instead of  CNI or in combination 
37 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  with low dose CNI.  While conceptually this strategy had promise, in practice this has not 
borne true.  Attempts to wean patients from CNI and convert to mTOR -based therapy 
have been hampered by an increase in acute rejection upon removing CNI.  In addition to the detrimental effects of acute rejection, including a higher incidence of new donor specific antibody formation, patients required higher doses of mTOR inhibitor leading to an increased incidence of advers e events/side effects including hyperlipidemia, mouth 
ulcers, edema, anemia, proteinuria resulting in intolerability of the regimen and a high rate of discontinuation.  Belatacept, an immunosuppressive agent with a novel mechanism of action, is a promising non- nephrotoxic candidate for use in renal transplant 
recipients. Unlike CNIs  or mTOR inhibitors , belatacept acts selectively rather than 
through ubiquitous pathways to afford immunosuppression. This targeted mechanistic approach may provide immunosuppres sive efficacy while circumventing the intrinsic 
toxicities of CNIs. Consistent with this notion, existing data show comparable rates of acute rejection, with favorable trends in subject and graft survival, GFR, CAN, and 
cardiovascular adverse effect profile.  
Two dose regimens of belatacept are being studied in Phase 3. Both regimens are based 
on the regimens successfully studied in Phase 2, with minor modifications to increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. 
1.3.2 Potential Risks  
Post-Transplant Lymp hoproliferative Disorder 
Reported cases of post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) up to 36 months 
post transplant were obtained for belatacept by pooling both dosage regimens of 
belatacept in both studies (804 patients) with data from a third study in kidney 
transplantation (145 patients) which evaluated two belatacept dosage regimens similar, 
but slightly different, from those of Studies 1 and 2 (see table below). The total number 
of belatacept patients from these three studies (949) was compared to the pooled 
cyclosporine control groups from all three studies (476 patients). 
Among 401 patients in Studies 1 and 2 treated with the recommended regimen of 
belatacept and the 71 patients in Study 3 treated with a very similar (but non- identical) 
belatacept regimen, there were 5 cases of PTLD: 3 in EBV seropositive patients and 2 in 
38 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  EBV seronegative patients. Two of the 5 cases presented with CNS involvement.  Among 
the 477 patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 treated with the belatacept regimen of higher 
cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended, there were 8 cases of 
PTLD: 2 in EBV seropositive patients and 6 in EBV seronegative or serostatus unknown 
patients. Six of the 8 cases presented with CNS involvement. Therefore, administration of 
higher than the recommended doses or more frequent dosing of belatacept is not 
recommended.  
One of the 476 patients treated with cyclosporine developed PTLD, without CNS 
involvement.  All cases of PTLD reported up to 36 months post transplant in belatacept- 
or cyclosporine -treated patients presented within 18 months of transplantation.  Overall, 
the rate of PTLD in 949 patients treated with any of the belatacept regimens was 9 -fold 
higher in those who were EBV seronegative or EBV serostatus unknown (8/139)  
compared to those who were EBV seropositive (5/810 patients). Therefore belatacept is recommended for use only in patients who are EBV seropositive. 
Malignancy 
Malignancies, excluding non- melanoma skin cancer and PTLD, were reported in Study 1 
and Study 2 in 3.5% (14/401) of patients treated with the recommended belatacept 
regimen and 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen.  
Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% (6/401) of patients treated with the 
recommended belat acept regimen and in 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with 
cyclosporine. 
Infection  
Adverse reactions of infectious etiology were reported based on clinical assessment by 
physicians. The causative organisms for these reactions are identified when provided by 
the physician. The overall number of infections, serious infections, and select infections with identified etiology reported in patients treated with the belatacept recommended 
regimen or the cyclosporine control in Studies 1 and 2 are shown above . Fungal 
39 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  infections were reported in 18% of patients receiving belatacept compared to 22% 
receiving cyclosporine, primarily due to skin and mucocutaneous fungal infections. 
Tuberculosis and herpes infections were reported more frequently in patients receiving 
belatacept than cyclosporine. Of the patients who developed tuberculosis through 3 years, 
all but one belatacept patient lived in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis 
Other Potential Risks  
Other potential risks include those events that may theor etically be associated with 
belatacept, or that have been observed more frequently in belatacept -treated subjects in a 
single clinical trial. These events include graft thrombosis, infusional reactions, 
proteinuria, pulmonary edema, and autoimmune disorders. None of these events have 
been consistently associated with belatacept treatment. These events are undergoing augmented surveillance in the clinical trials.  
1.3.3 Summary of Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Belatacept, an immunosuppressive agent with a novel mechanism of action, is a 
promising non- nephrotoxic candidate for use in renal transplant recipients. Clinical data 
from approximately 1000 belatacept -treated patients in 3 trials in de novo renal 
transplantation indicate that belatacept results in similar ra tes of adverse events, serious 
adverse events, infections and malignancies to a CNI -based regimen. Overall rates of 
infection and malignancy were similar in belatacept and CNI -treated subjects.  
  
Appropriate screening for TB, per local guidelines, is required before treatment with 
belatacept.  
Although rare, PTLD and CNS PTLD have been observed more frequently in belatacept -
treated subjects. A thorough analysis indicates that the elevated risk of PTLD, an 
expected event in transplant patients, appears to be  restricted to EBV -negative recipients, 
with no increase in risk in EBV- positive recipients treated with belatacept.  
Therefore, the current study offers a favorable benefit/risk relationship to study subjects, and the potential to provide important data for the development of new immunosuppressive regimens that have improved safety and tolerability when compared to existing therapies. 
40 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  End stage renal disease is a major health problem affecting over 350,000 people in the 
US alone. Kidney transplantation is now the ideal treatment for renal failure, with nearly 
17,000 transplants performed annually.  While early outcomes have improved 
dramatically over the past 30 years, long- term results continue to be disappointing.  Ten 
years after transplant nearly all ren al allografts have histologic evidence of chronic injury 
with accompanying impaired renal function.  Many patients with failing allografts 
ultimately return to dialysis.  Fortunately, a significant proportion of these patients are re -
transplant candidates.   Indeed 10- 15% of all renal transplants are performed in recipients 
of prior renal allografts.   There is an ongoing debate regarding the management of 
patients with a failed kidney transplant.  Those patients who require dialysis and are 
maintained on immunosuppression continue to be subjected to increased risks of 
infection, cardiovascular disease, malignancies, etc.  In fact several studies have shown a significantly increased risk of infection and death for those who continue immunosuppression after gra ft failure. Thus most centers favor tapering 
immunosuppressive therapy off once a patient requires dialysis.  Unfortunately, this puts 
the patient at risk for developing allo- antibody which may limit options for re -transplant.  
The development of an immunosuppressive strategy to minimize the complications of persistent therapy while preventing sensitization could greatly enhance the likelihood of 
re-transplantation.   
1.4 Study Rationale  
Kidney transplantation is an accepted form of treatment for end stage renal disease.  
Indeed transplant recipients not only live longer than those patients who remain on 
dialysis, their quality of life is superior and the therapy is cost effective.  Unfortunately, 
ten years after transplant nearly all renal allografts have h istologic evidence of chronic 
injury and over 60% have evidence of severe chronic allograft nephropathy, grade III 
interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA).   Many of these patients  ultimately return to 
dialysis. Given the increased risks of infection, cardiovascular disease and malignancy 
most patients have their immunosuppression discontinued when they start dialysis.  Unfortunately this puts the patient at increased risk for developing allo- antibody which 
limits options for re -transplant.  Indeed a s ignificant proportion of these patients will be 
re-listed for a subsequent transplant.  Belatacept has a unique mechanism of action as an 
immunosuppressive agent.  Given its favorable side -effect profile, lack of nephrotoxicity 
and effectiveness in prevent ing T-cell dependent antibody production including allo-
antibody, belatacept represents an ideal agent to test in this patient population.   
41 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  The current study proposes a randomized clinical trial of first -time renal transplant 
recipients who now have impai red renal function (eGFR <35 with a decline in GFR of > 
10 % in the year prior to enrollment with biopsy proven grade II or III IF/TA OR a GFR 
< 20 in the 6 month period prior to enrollment absent other causes for graft dysfunction 
and deemed to have a fail ing allograft by the patient’s transplant nephrologist .  Patients 
must be re -transplant candidates and have completed or be actively undergoing the 
evaluation process for re- listing.  Patients will be randomized to a belatacept- based 
immunosuppressive regi men or standard of care with a calcineurin inhibitor -based or 
sirolimus therapy.  Endpoints include rate of donor -specific antibody production as well 
as renal function and rate/time to dialysis.  We hypothesize that belatacept will 
effectively inhibit sen sitization (ie donor -specific antibody production) in patients with a 
failing or failed renal allograft and as a result will facilitate re -transplantation.  In 
addition treatment with belatacept will more favorably impact residual allograft function 
(ie preservation of GFR) in patients with IF/TA as compared to treatment with 
conventional immunosuppression thereby prolonging time to dialysis or need for re -
transplant. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To prevent the formation of donor -specific alloantibody in patients with chronic allograft 
injury, thereby facilitating re-transplantation by avoiding sensitization 
Primary Endpoint:  The rate of donor-specific antibody formation 36 months following 
randomization. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
To determine if treatment with belatacept better preserves GFR in those patients with 
marginal renal function as compared to those patients who continue calcineurin inhibitor 
therapy and as a result delays time to initiation of dialysis.  Subjects already requir ing 
dialysis at the time of enrollment will be excluded from this analysis.  
Secondary Endpoints:   
-Rate of change in GFR  compared to participants maintained on CNI- based or mTOR -
based regimen. Subjects already requiring dialysis will be excluded from this endpoint 
analysis. 
-Time to dialysis measured from the time of randomization to initiation of dialysis  
compared to participants maintained on CNI- based or mTOR -based regimen.  
42 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Subjects already requiring dialysis at the time of enrollment will be excluded from this 
endpoint ana lysis.   
- Overall level of alloantibody as indicated by PRA.   
- Incidence of infectious complications.    
3 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
3.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as 
defined by the Inte rnational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and in accordance with 
the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United 
States Code of Federal Regulations, Title  21, Part 50 (21CFR50). 
The study will be conducted in compliance  with the protocol. The protocol , any 
amendment s, and the subject informed consent will re ceive Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC)  approval/favorable opinion before 
initiation of the study. 
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMS) 
immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in 
connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, 
the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific 
value of the study. 
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, 
training, and experience to perform their respective tasks. This study will not use the 
services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been 
scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure ; debarment).  Systems with 
procedures that en sure the quality of every aspect of the study will be implemented. 
3.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opinion from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment 
materials/process (eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided 
43 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  to subjects. The investigator  should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the 
Investigator Brochure or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects, and any 
updates. The investigator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates , and other 
information (eg, expedited safety r eports, amendments, and administrative letter s) 
according  to regulatory requirements or institution procedures. 
3.3 Informed Consent  
Investigators must ensure that subjects (or, in those situations where consent cannot be 
given by subjects, the legally acceptable representative) are clearly and fully informed 
about the purpose, potential risks , and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in 
which they volunteer to par ticipate. Freely given written informed consent must be 
obtained from every subject (or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by 
subjects, the legally acceptable representative ) before clinical study participation, 
including informed consent for any screening procedures conducted to establish subject  
eligibility for the study . 
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society. 
4 INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN 
4.1 Study Design and Duration  
This is an open-label, prospective, random ized, controlled clinical trial.  First-time renal 
transplant recipients who now have impa ired renal function (est imated GFR <35 with a 
decline in renal function of > 10% in the year prior to enrollment with biopsy proven 
grade II or III IF/TA ) OR a GFR of < 20 over the 6 month period prior to enrollment 
absent other causes for graft dysfunction and deemed to have a failing allograft by the 
patient’s transplant nephrologist  will be identified f or randomization to either treatment 
(belatacept -based) or to continue standard of care (CNI- based or mTOR-based) regimen .  
There will be a total of 72 subjects, randomized in equal numbers, 36 patients in each 
arm.  Patients must be candidates for  re-transplantation.  Those subjects who are EBV 
seronegative or have a history of PTLD will be excluded.  Follow up will be planned for 36 months after randomization.  The study will proceed in two sequential phases with 
distinct funding periods.  Phase I  will enroll 18 patients in each arm, 36 total patients.  
After discussions with BMS we will proceed with phase II, contingent on funding 
44 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  availability and preliminary results from phase I.  Phase II will enroll an additional 36 
patients for a total of  72 patients , 36 in each arm.  
 
Study Design  
 
-Standard of care arm - 
 
GFR<35 - wean tacrolimus  or sirolimus  dose to target level of 3 -5 (or equivalent  CNI or 
mTOR inhibitor  level), and if applicable continue MMF or MPA  (equivalent of at le ast 
1g daily) or azathioprine, and/or prednisone 
 Upon initiation of dialysis  or in subjects already requiring dialysis at time of enrollment -
 discontinue CNI or mTOR inhibitor  over 5 days, if applicable  MMF, MPA or 
azathioprine dose decreased by half th en discontinued 2 weeks later, steroid withdrawal 
beginning 1 month after the initiation of dialysis with monthly reduction by half with plans to discontinue at 3 months after initiation of dialysis.      -Belatacept arm - 
 
GFR <35- initiate Belatacept ; dose of CNI or mTOR inhibitor  will be decreased by half 
at time of first dose. CNI or mTOR inhibitor  will be discontinued at time of second dose 
of belatacept (week 2). Belatacept dosing 10mg/kg- day 0, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 
and 12weeks ; subsequent doses  5mg/kg q month through duration of trial or until 
retransplantation, whichever is first.  If applicable continue MMF or MPA  (equivalent of 
at least 1g daily)  or azathioprine and/or prednisone 
 Upon initiation of dialysis  or in subjects already requiring dialysis at time of enrollment- 
wean remaining  immunosuppression (if applicable)  as above in standard of care arm 
except for  belatacept which they will remain on for the duration of the study or until re -
transplant. If a subject progresses to dialysis dependence wh ile still receiving belatacept 
at the 10 mg/kg dosing, the subject will continue to receive 10 mg/kg dose as scheduled through week 12 (5 total doses) and then decrease to 5 mg/kg IV q month for the duration of study participation.  At the time of anticipated enrollment study patients will be greater than one (1) year post -
transplant and likely have already had their immunosuppression reduced.  Indeed, they 
probably do not require the same level of immunosuppression as they did in the 
immediate post-transpl ant period.  Thus the protocol is written to accept patients 
receiving CNI or mTOR monotherapy, or a CNI or mTOR based regimen with the 
equivalent of at least 1g daily of  MMF or comparable dose of MPA or azathioprine , 
and/or corticosteroid . (i.e. Total immunosuppression may be less intense than currently 
recommended in the prescribing instructions for Belatacept.  We would allow participants receiving reduced dose MMF (500mg BID)  or equivalent  and/or weaned off 
corticosteroids for any  reason, or patients weaned off MMF or equivalent  being 
45 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  maintained on prednisone. This allows for inclusion of additional patients without 
subjecting them to increased immunosuppression.

incarceration  for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious 
disease) illness . 
48 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Subjects who discontinue from the study for any reason other than withdrawal of 
consent will be asked to continue in the study under a reduced follow-up plan. 
4.3 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor emerging efficacy and overall safety data regularly to ensure that the benefits and risks of study participation remain acceptab le.  The DMC will assess the incidence of acute rejection, development 
of donor-specific antibody, graft loss, infectious complications, death, PTLD, and other 
serious adverse events (SAEs) in this study. In addition, other safe ty and efficacy 
variables (to be defined in the DMC charter) will be monitored by the DMC in order to 
minimize potential risks to study participants.   
 The first review of data by the DMC will occur either after 10 subjects have been enrolled and randomized or approximately 6 months  after the first subject is enrolled, 
whichever comes first.   The second review of the data by the DMC will occur either after 30 subjects have been enrolled or 6 months after the first patient is enrolled, whichever comes first.  Subsequent reviews of data by the DMC will occur every 3 months during the remainder of the first year and approximately every 6 months thereafter.    Based on regular reviews of the emerging data, the DMC may recommend alteration and/or termination of the trial or cessation of further enrollment.  Meeting structure, schedule, procedures, and communication between the Sponsor and the DMC, the content and format of DMC reports, and other relevant details will be determined in consultation with the DMC members and will be detailed in a separate charter.

50 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to a Treatment  
Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to the following treatment groups: 
1) CNI (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) or mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus or everolimus)  
based regimen (with or without MMF/MPA/azathioprine and/or steroids) 
2) Belatacept  based regimen (with or without MMF/MPA/azathioprine  and/or 
steroids) 
At the time of enrollment, immediately after written informed consent is obtained and 
before performing any study- related procedures, each subject will be assigned a unique 
sequential subject number for identification throughout the study.  This subject number will not be reu sed for any other participant during the study.  Once the subject has met all 
the entry criteria (inclusion and exclusion), the subject will be randomized to one of the two described treatment regimens.  Adverse event reporting for all subjects will begin at 
the time of randomization.   
5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Patients will be randomized as described above.  In the standard of care arm patients will 
remain on CNI  or mTOR inhibitor  therapy.  The tacrolimus  or sirolimus  dose will be 
weaned to achieve trough levels of 3-5 (if on equivalent medication , dose will be adjusted 
to achieve similar potency levels) .  If on MMF they will continue on MMF, equivalent of 
at least 1 gram daily , or if on MPA or azathioprine , a comparable dose.  If on steroids 
they will continue on corticosteroids. If on both MMF/MPA /azathioprine and steroids 
they will continue on both.  Upon initiation of dialysis  or in subjects already requiring 
dialysis at the time of enrollment, the CNI (tacrolimu s or cyclosporine ) or mTOR 
inhibitor ( sirolimus or everolimus)  will be discontinued over a 5 day period.  The MMF, 
MPA or azathioprine dose will be decreased by 50% and then discontinued 2 weeks later.  
Steroid dose will be weaned by 50% at one month after returning to dialysis, w ith a 
subsequent 50% reduction at 2 months and discontinuation at 3 months. 
In those patients randomized to receive belatacept, the CNI (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) 
or mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus or everolimus)  will be weaned in the following fashion: 
dose of CNI or mTOR inhibitor will be reduced by 50% at time of first dose of 
belatacept. CNI or  mTOR inhibitor  will be discontinued at week 2 dose of belatacept. 
Subjects will receive Belatacept 10mg/kg IV on the first study day, at 2 weeks,1 month, 2 
51 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  months, and 3 months.  Subsequent belatacept doses will be 5mg/kg IV every month 
through the duration of the trial or until re -transplantation occurs, whichever is first.  A 
month will be defined as one true calendar month.  There will be a ±2 days window for 
the 2nd (2 week) belatacept infusion, and a ±5 days window for subsequent infusions.  If 
on MMF subjects will continue their MMF (equivalent of at least 1g daily)  or if on MPA 
or azathioprine , a comparable dose.  If on steroids t hey will continue on corticoste roids. 
If on MMF/MPA/azathioprine  and steroids they will continue on both.  Upon initiation of 
dialysis or in subjects already requiring dialysis at the time of enrollment, the MMF or 
azathioprine dose will be decreased by 50% and then discontinued 2 weeks later.  Steroid 
dose will be weaned by 50% at one month after returning to dialysis, with a subsequent 
50% reduction at 2 months and discontinuation at 3 months. Belatacept will be continued 
at 5mg/kg IV monthly (± 5 days) for the duration of the study or  retransplantation 
whichever occurs first.  If a subject progresses to dialysis dependence while still 
receiving belatacept at the 10 mg/kg dosing, the subject will continue to receive 10 mg/kg 
dose as scheduled through month 3  (5 total doses) and then decrease to 5 mg/kg IV q 
month for the duration of study participation. 
Infusion doses will be based on the subject’s actual body weight  at enrollment , and will 
not be modified during the course of the study, unless there is a change of body weight 
greater than ±10%. Study drug should be administered to the subject at a relatively 
constant rate over approximately 30 minutes. Once subjects have initiated hemodialysis, 
study infusion visits will be scheduled on non- dialysis days.  If patients perform 
peritoneal dialysis, study infusion visits will be scheduled without regard to dialysis 
schedule.  
5.4.1 Dose Modifications 
In the absence of AEs deemed at least possibly related to study drug treatment, subjects 
will complete their scheduled infusions as pres cribed by the protocol. In the event of new, 
serious, and unexpected toxicity potentially related to belatacept, study drug administration should be interrupted. The investigator must immediately notify the medical monitor. The subject will be considered e ligible to receive further study drug 
treatment only after discussion with the medical monitor. Under no circumstances should 
the dose of belatacept be modified. Subjects in whom belatacept dosing is dis continued 
should be placed on the standard of care re gimen.

Not Applicable 
5.6 Concomitant Treatment s 
5.6.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments  
Use of immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids must be limited to those specified 
in the protocol. For full prescribing information, see the package i nserts. 
5.6.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Vaccination 
There is limited information available regarding the effectiveness of immunizations in non-human primates and humans that have been treated with belatacept. No data are 
available on the effect of therapeutic vaccinations in subjects receiving belatacept. Due to 
the risk of infection, vaccination of subjects with any live vaccine is absolutely 
contraindicated during the course of the study, as is the administration of LIVE oral polio 
or varicella vaccine to household contacts. The Centers for Disease Control recommend 
that subjects should not be administered a live virus vaccination for at least 3 months after discontinuing high- dose corticosteroid therapy (defined as > 20 mg/day of 
prednisone for  > 2 weeks). In view of the long half -life of belatacept, study subjects 
should not be administered a live virus vaccine for a minimum of 3 months following the last dose of study medication. 
Peri-infusional Reactions 
The infusion of protein biologic agents can be  associated with hypersensitivity or acute 
allergic reactions. Subjects should be monitored frequently during and following study drug administration. Appropriate emergency equipment should be present at the treatment facility in the event of a ser ious anaphylactic reaction.  
53 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Other Potential Risks  
Proteinuria and pulmonary edema was reported more frequently as an AE among 
belatacept -treated subjects in clinical trials. Proteinuria, pulmonary edema, and 
congestive heart failure have been identified as  events of special interest future trials.  
5.7 Treatment Complianc e 
All medications specified in this protocol must be administered as described within the protocol.  Belatacept will be exclusively administered at the study site.  Compliance for the other medi cations will be discussed with the subjects at each study visit  and will be 
documented by the study coordinator .  Patients in the standard of care arm will have 
periodic CNI (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) or mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus or everolimus) levels evaluated to document compliance.   
6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
6.1 Time and Events Schedule  
Baseline and study evaluations are summarized in table 6.1 
All assessments will be performed or administered prior to study drug administration 
unless otherwise indicated.  
If a subject needs to withdraw from the study, the next scheduled set of assessments will 
be performed early.  The reason for study discontinuation will be documented.

6.2 Screening  Evaluation  
Obtain written consent and enroll the subject.  Consent will be obtained prior to 
any change in medical therapy or any procedure perform ed solely for the purpose 
of this study. 
Review inclusion and e xclusion criteria with patient; determine if they remain a 
candidate for the trial  
Obtain a serum or urine pregnancy test 
EBV serology done at any previous time point will be accepted for eligibility 
criteria and will be documented.  If serology results are not available then serum 
will be sent for EBV antibody quantification.  Both EBV and CMV viral titers 
will be checked prior to randomization.  If the EBV viral load is positive in an 
EBV seropositive individual, the subject will have the EBV viral load r epeated 
and the subject may be considered for enrollment when the result is undectable.   
If CMV titer is positive, the subject will be appropriately treated and reconsidered 
for enrollment once the viral load is undetectable for >1 month period. 
Obtain blood sample for donor specific antibody evaluation and overall allo-
antibody levels.  Donor specific antibody/anti -HLA antibody will be evaluated 
using the FlowPRA assay in the Emory University Hospital Clinical HLA 
Laboratory. The Emory Medical laboratory is a CLIA certified facility.  If allo-
antibody is detected then antigen specificity will be assessed using single -antigen 
HLA beads.  Results from donor HLA typing will be used to determine if new anti-HLA antibody is donor specific constituting a new DSA.   
Obtain a complete medical history and physical examination including a 
neurologic exam. 
Obtain body weight (clothes on, shoes off) and height, measure vital signs (BP, 
HR, temp, respiration) 
 
61 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  All women 50 years or older must have a screening mammogram, or provide 
results of a screening mammogram performed within the last year.  Women of 
any age who have first degree relatives with a history of breast carcinoma or who 
have other risk factors of breast carcinoma must undergo increased surveillance for breast cancer according to local practice  
Check and record all medications  
Obtain baseline laboratory tests including serum Cr and related estimated GFR 
6.3           Post-Enrollment/Randomization  
Prior to the first treatment time point, confirm all inclusion/e xclusion criteria.  
Randomize when all entry criteria are satisfied.   Randomization may take place 
prior to the first post-screening visit if required due to scheduling constraints. 
Obtain vital signs, monitor for any adverse events, check and record any c hanges 
in medications immediately prior to first treatment session  
For subsequent study assessments see respective charts for either belatacept -
treated arm or standard of care group. If during the course of immunosuppressive withdrawal, the kidney allograf t 
becomes a source of symptoms (swelling, fever, local pain, and/or hematuria) or 
infection then trial participants will be treated according to standard of care as 
deemed appropriate by the treating physician including, if appropriate, a limited 
course of oral or intravenous corticosteroids or if required allograft nephrectomy.  
Study participants will remain on their treatment protocol (i.e. continue to receive 
belatacept or wean quickly off the corticosteroid treatment back to no immunosuppression in the  standard of care arm).  For the purposes of statistical 
analyses participants will be treated in an intent to treat fashion.  
Study participants  will have the option to consent for storage of a banked blood 
sample for future mechanistic assays. If the subj ect consents to blood for storage, 
an additional 10 ml sample of blood will be collected at enrollment and every 3 months during pre -dialysis period, upon initiation of dialysis, and every 3 months 
during post -initiation of dialysis period  as noted on the schedule of events. 
 
62 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Banked samples will be stored in the PI’s research lab. Samples may remain 
stored indefinitely. Subjects will have the ability request destruction of samples at 
any time. 
6.4 Study Materials 
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) will provide belatacept  for this study. 
6.5 Safety Assessments 
All subjects who are randomized and remain in the study will be evaluated for safety.  
Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events, clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examination, neurologic assessment, or laboratory test abnormalities.  
The investigator will determine the severity of each adverse event as mild, moderate, 
severe, or very severe.  All adverse events will be documented.  In addition the 
investigator will determine the relat ionship of the adverse event to the administration of 
belatacept .   
All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported as described in Section  7.3.1. All 
nonserious adverse events must be collected as well and documented according to the procedures of the investigational site. They do not need to be sent to BMS. 
If the patient is a WOCBP, pregnancy tests (blood or urine; minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L 
of HCG) must be performed within 72 hours before the first infusion.  If the patient becomes pregnant at any p oint during the study, she will exit the study and belatacept 
treatment will be discontinued. 
Laboratory tests may be performed as part of routine standard of care as directed by the investigator. Laboratory specimens should be obtained before bela tacept infusions. 
Additional tests may be ordered if deemed necessary for monitoring the patient’s safety. 
PTLD Safety Surveillance  
Specific surveillance for PTLD will  be conducted for all subjects in this study. The PTLD 
safety surveillance should be impl emented as soon as IRB/IEC approvals and subject 
consent are obtained.  
 
63 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Neurologic Examinations 
To assess for PTLD, neurologic examinations will  be conducted periodically  for the 
duration of the subject’s participation in the study. The neurologic history will include the 
subject’s description of any new neurologic symptoms, such as: 
• changes in personality 
• changes in memory 
• headaches  
• pain 
• seizures 
• impairment of consciousness 
• difficulty swallowing  
• changes in vision, hearing, or language function 
• changes in coordination or gait 
• weakness  
• sensory alterations 
• sphincter disturbance, or 
• involuntary movements. 
In addition, the following will be recorded:  
• time course of any new symptoms (onset and duration) 
• corroboration of any complaints with other individuals 
• medical illnesses, and  
• medication use.  
 
The neurologic examination will include assessment of:  
• mental status  
• gait 
• speech 
• cranial nerves  
• cerebellar function  
• sensory function 
• motor function. 
 
64 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  Any new or worsening findings should be reported as adverse events and evaluated with 
a follow up neurologic examination, additional modalities, and/or neurologic consultation 
as appropriate.  
EBV Titers 
Subjects receiving belatacept who are on dialysis will have samples sent for EBV viral 
titers periodically for the duration of the study.  Positive titers will be confirmed and 
subjects will exit the study and belatacept treatment will be discontinued if they have persistent positive titers .  Again only patients who are seropositive for EBV will be 
enrolled in the study. 
Subjects with Suspected PTLD  
CNS imaging and/or neurologic consultation should be considered for any subject with a 
new or worsening neurologic finding. For subjects who undergo biopsy for suspicion of PTLD, the biopsy specimen will be evaluated for CD3, CD20, C D79 and EBER. 
Management of belatacept and other immunosuppressants in subjects with suspected PTLD should be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor. BMS should be informed of all confirmed cases of PTLD.  
6.6 Efficacy Assessments 
6.6.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment  
The primary endpoint is the incidence of donor -specific allo -antibody formation in 
patients treated with belatacept vs standard of care arm.   Serum samples from study 
subjects will be evaluated periodically (see table 6.1) for the presence of donor -specific 
alloantibody using standard flow cytometric techniques.   
6.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Secondary endpoints will include assessment of renal function including estimated GFR 
and rate of change in GFR, the need for and time to initiation of  dialysis, the overall level 
of alloantibody as indicated by PRA and the incidence of infectious complications .  GFR 
will be calculated based upon serum creatinine using the Diet in Renal Disease (study) 
formula as suggested by Levey et al. Subjects alread y requiring initiation of dialysis at

7 ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational ( medicinal ) product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use  of investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product. 
7.1.1 Serious Adverse Event s 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life-threatening (defined as an ev ent in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see note below for exceptions) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitaliz ation but, based on 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require inte rvention ( eg, medical, surgical ) to prevent one of the other serious 
 
66 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but are not l imited to 
intensive treatment in an emergency department  or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.  
All pregnancies, regardless of outcome, must be reported to BMS, including 
pregnancies that occur in the female partner of a male study subject . All 
pregnancies must be followed to outcome.  See Section  7.6 for instructions on reporting 
pregnancies.  
Although overdose and cancer are not always serious by regulatory definition, these 
events should also be reported to BMS. 
NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies : 
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department lasting less than 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important 
medical event” or a life-threatening  event) 
• elective surgery planned before signing consent 
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status (eg, routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical admission for purpose other tha n remedying ill health state that 
was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases. 
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries  no bearing on 
health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family  circumstances, administrative) . 
7.1.2 Nonserious Adverse Event s 
Nonserious adverse events are all adverse events that are not classified as SAEs. 
7.2 Assignment of A dverse Event  Intensity and Relationship  to 
Investigational Product  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded by the physician 
investigator as follows: 
• Mild (Grade 1) : awareness of event but easi ly tolerated  
 
67 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  • Moderate (Grade 2) : discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual 
activity 
• Severe (Grade 3) : inability to carry out usual activity  
• Very Severe (Grade 4) : debilitating ; significantly incapacitates subject despite 
symptomatic therapy . 
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to investigational product  
as determined by a physician should be used: 
• Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event. 
• Not Related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
The expression “ reasonable causal relationship ” is meant to convey in general that there 
are facts (eg, evidence such as de- challenge/re- challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.  
7.3 Collection  and Reporting  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. T o prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events . 
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather 
than its individual symptoms. The following information shoul d be captured for all AEs: 
onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product , action 
taken, and treatment r equired. If treatment for the event  was administered, it should be 
recorded in the medical record. The investigator must suppl y BMS and the IRB/IEC with 
any additional information requested, notably for reported deaths of subjects. 
7.3.1 Serious Adverse Events  
Following the randomization of the subject , all SAEs must be collected, including those 
thought to be associated with p rotocol-specified procedures.  Collection of a ll SAEs must 
continue for  8 weeks after the last administration of the investigational product . If 
applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified procedure 
(eg, a follow -up skin biopsy). The investigator should notify BMS of any SAE occurring 
 
68 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  after this time period that is believed to be related to the investigational product  or 
protocol-specified procedure. 
All SAEs, whether considered related or unrelated to  belatacept , must be r eported to 
BMS (by the investigator or designee) within 24 hours of study personnel  becoming 
aware of the event. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are 
required. The original SAE form must be kept on file at the study sit e. 
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at: 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epidemiology 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609-818-3804 Email: Worldwide.safety@bms.com
  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND , any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the F ood and Drug Administration  (FDA) as soon as 
possible and no later than 7  days (for a death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (for 
all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the 
information. BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed 
with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be 
accessed at:  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/sc ripts/medwatch/. 
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:  
MEDWATCH  
5600 Fishers Lane 
Rockville, MD 20852-9787 
Fax: 1-800- FDA-0178 (1-800-332-0178) 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ medwatch /   
All SAEs should simultaneously be faxed or e -mailed to BMS at: 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epidemiology Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609-818-3804 
Email: Worldwide.safety@bms.com
    
 
69 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  If the investigator believes that an SAE is not relate d to the investigational product  but is 
potentially related  to the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, 
or a complication of a study procedure), the potential relationship should be spe cified in 
the narrative sect ion of the SAE report. 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationsh ip to the investigational product, a 
follow-up SAE report should be sent immediately to BMS. As follow -up information 
becomes available it sh ould be sent immediately using the same procedu re used for 
transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization.  
7.3.2 Handling  of Expedited Safety Reports  
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investiga tors of all SAEs that are 
suspected ( related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously 
described in the Investigator Brochure). In the European Union, an event meeting these 
criteria is termed a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactio n (SUSAR). BMS will 
send investigators an  expedited safety report (ESR)  to notify them of such an event. 
Other important findings that BMS may report as ESR s include increased frequency of a 
clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered as sociated with study procedures 
that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard 
to study subjects, clinically significant safety findings from a nonclinical (eg, animal) 
study, important safety recommendations from  a study data monitoring committee, or the 
decision by BMS to end or temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons. 
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with 
the Investigator Brochure. Where required by loc al regulations or when there is a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, BMS will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The 
investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC  procedures for reporting any other 
safety information. 
In addition, BMS will report suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) to the relevant health authorities in all concerned countries according to local 
regulations (either a s expedited and/or in aggregate reports).

Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  7.3.3 Nonserious Adverse Events  
The collect ion of nonserious adverse event  (NSAE) information will begin at 
randomization. This NSAE information will also be collected from the start of a placebo 
lead-in period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the 
subjects. 
All identified NSAEs will be recorded and described in the medical record. If an ongoing 
NSAE worsens in its intensity , or if its relationship to the investigational pr oduct 
changes, a new NS AE entry for the event should be completed. N SAEs should be 
followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. 
Follow-up is also required for NSAEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
investigationa l product, or those that are present at the end of study participation. 
Subjects with NS AEs at study completion should receive post -treatment follow -up as 
appropriate. 
7.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
All laboratory test values captured during treatment must be documented appropriately, including the following: 
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an 
SAE 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to have belatacept discontinued 
or interrupted 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to receive specific corrective 
therapy. 
When reporting laboratory abnormalities, the clinical term rather than the laboratory term 
should be used by the reporter (eg, document “anemia,” not “low hemoglobin value”). 
7.5 Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion or infusion of any dose 
of a product that is considered both ex cessive and medically important. All occurrences 
of overdose must be reported as an SAE. 
 
71 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  7.6 Pregnancy  
Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course 
of the study, in such a manner that the risk of failure  is minimized . (See Section  4.2.1 for 
the definition of WOCBP .) Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the 
importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and of the potential risk 
factors for an unintentional pregnancy. 
7.6.1 Requirements for Pregnancy Testing  
All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours before receiving 
belatacept . The minimum sensitivity of  the pregnancy test must be 25 IU/L or equivalent 
units of HCG. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive Belatacept  
and must not continue in the study. 
In addition, all WOCBP must be instructed to contact the investigator and/or other study 
personnel immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late 
menstrual period) at any time during study participation. 
7.6.2 Reporting of Pregnancy 
If, followi ng initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently di scovered that a 
study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product 
exposure, including during 8 weeks after administration, the investigational product will 
be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for 
subject safety). The investiga tor must immediately notify BMS of this event and record 
the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance  Form (not on an SAE form) . Initial 
information on a pregnancy must be reported immediately to B MS, and information on 
the outcome provided once it is available . Completed Pregnancy Surveillance Forms 
must be forwarded  to BMS according to SAE reporting procedures. 
Note: Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study subject must be 
reported. 
Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
for the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
 
72 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered i f indicate d. Information r egarding 
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, must be reported. 
7.7 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential  safety assessments, whether or not 
these procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded in the medical 
record. 
Subjects who prematurely withdraw or are terminated from study participation, for 
reasons other than withdrawal if consent, will be asked to continue in a reduced safety follow-up schedule. The study team will contact the patient every 3 months for the 
duration of the trial to assess patient survival, dialysis status, and serious adverse event 
occurrences.  
7.8               Influ enza Guidelines  
Per current CDC  influenza recommendations for persons with immunosuppression, 
including those caused by medications, subjects should be counseled to obtain influenza 
vaccination in accordance with CDC guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/index.htm ).  
In addition, they will be advised to promptly contact a healthcare provider upon onset of any fevers or flu like symptoms in order to  determine w hether early or empirical 
antiviral therapy is indicated in accordance with CDC guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary -clinicians.htm).  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
This is a single -center, randomized , controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of belatacept 
to prevent the formation of donor -specific antibody in patients with a failing renal 
allograft thereby pr eventing sensitization and facilitating re -transplantation.  Based on 
clinical and statistical judgment, it is anticipated that a sample size of 3 6 patients per 
group will provide valuable preliminary data to assess the  impact of belatacept on this 
growing population of patients. 
 
73 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  The sample size for each arm will be 3 6 patients (Phase I 18 patients in each arm, Phase 
II 18 patients in each arm, total for each phase 36 patients).  From previous work it is 
assumed that the control arm will have about 60% of patients developing antibodies 
within a 3 year period. (unpublished results, analysis of patients at Emory Hospital)  It is 
proposed that the group treated with belatacept will have a dramatic decrease in allo -
antibody production.  Assuming a rate of 20% in the treatment group, the power would 
be calculated at 90%.   
8.2 Endpoint Definitions  
Primary Endpoint:  The rate of donor-specific antibody formation 36 months following 
randomization. 
Secondary Endpoints:   
-Rate of change in GFR  
-Time to dialysis measured fr om the time of randomization to initiation of dialysis   
- Overall level of alloantibody as indicated by PRA.   
- Incidence of infectious complications.   
8.3 Analyses  
8.3.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects will be summarized descriptively by 
means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency distribution for 
categorical variables.  Summaries will be performed based on all randomized  subjects. 
8.3.2 Safety Analyses 
All adverse events and serious advers e events will be summarized by treatment group.  
Serious adverse events will be collected and summarized following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study.  Non- serious adverse events will be collected and 
summarized beginning at the time of randomization.  Laboratory abnormalities will be 
descriptively summarized.  
 
74 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  8.3.3 Efficacy Analyses 
There will be two main methods of analyzing the primary outcome at the study end.  One 
will be a chi -squared test comparing the proportion of patients who developed donor 
specific antibodies in each study group.  The second analysis will be a log- rank test 
comparing the Kaplan-Meier time to event curves between the two study groups.  In both 
cases we will use a two -sided test with a significance level of  0.05.   
The sample size for each arm will be 3 6 patients.  This sample size calculation is based 
on several assumptions.  We assume that the incidence of developing donor -specific 
antibody among the control group is 60% and among the belatacept -treated gr oup it is 
20% or less.  We also assume an alpha level of 0.05 and corresponding Z -alpha = 1.96 
and a one -to-one ration of exposed to unexposed subjects.  Calculations with these 
estimates yield a power of 90% to detect a three -fold difference in risk of de veloping 
donor specific antibodies between the control and belatacept-treated group.   
In addition to the aforementioned assumptions, additional assumptions required for the 
log-rank test include no loss to follow -up in 36 months and that the distribution of the 
incidence of the primary endpoint follows an exponential distribution.  Assuming an 
incidence of development of anti -donor antibody in the control group is 60% at 36 
months then the hazard rate can be calculated as 0.02545.  In the treatment arm, if  the 
incidence of the primary endpoint is 30% then the hazard ratio becomes 0.0099 and if the 
incidence is 20% then the hazard rate is 0.00619. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be performed at the end of the study period. 
Differences in the mean level of allo-antibody (ie PRA)  by control and belatacept -treated 
groups will be compared using a t -test statistic. The rate of decline of GFR among the 
belatacept group will be compared to the rate of decline of the control group using a Rate Ratio and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals using the Mantel -Haenszel chi -square 
test statistic for significance. The time from randomization to initiation of dialysis will be 
compared between groups using Kaplan- Meier analysis and the log -rank test for 
significance.  The small subset of subjects already requiring dialysis at the time of 
enrollment will be excluded from this analysis. The incidence of overall infectious 
episodes will be compared among the belatacept vs. control group by calculating a Risk 
Ratio and corre sponding 95% Confidence Intervals  and using the Mantel -Haenszel chi -
 
75 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  square test statistic for significance. For all secondary endpoint analyses, two- tailed p 
<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.   
Interim analyses will be performed at 18 mon ths to compare the primary endpoint 
between the belatacept -treated and control groups, using the log- rank test for 
significance.  A two -sided test with a more stringent significance level of 0.001 will be 
used to preserve the overall significance level of the trial. 
9 ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION  
9.1 Compliance  with the Protocol  
The study must be conducted as described in the final IRB/IEC-approved protocol. 
Documentation of approval , signed by the IRB/IEC chairperson or designee , will be sent 
to the BMS protocol manager.  
All protocol amendments and revisions to the informed consent will be submitted to the 
BMS protocol manager  and to the IRB/IEC . No protocol amendments will be 
implemented until written approval has been given by the IRB/IEC, except when 
necessary to el iminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Administrative letters 
should also be sent to the BMS protocol manager  and IRB/IEC; however, they do not 
require approval .  
If a protocol amendment mandates a revision to the informed consent, the revised cons ent 
must be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if it affects 
them (eg, if it contains new information regarding safety), and the revised consent must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects before enrollment.  
9.2 Records Retention 
The investigator will retain, in a confidential manner, all data pertinent to the study for all treated subjects as well as those entered as control subjects.  The investigator will retain 
source documents  and accurate case histories that record all observations and other data 
pertinent to the investigation (eg, the medical record) for the maximum period required 
by applicable regulations and guidelines or following institutional procedures. If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation or r etirement) , the records will be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee, such as another investigator or an IRB. 
Written documentation of such transfer will be provided to BMS.  
 
76 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020  The investigator will ensure that  a current record of dispositi on of investigational product 
is maintained at each study site where the investigational product is inventoried and 
disposed. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and 
should include:  
• amount received and placed in storage area 
• amount currently in storage area 
• label identification number or batch number and use date or expiry date 
• dates and initials of person responsible for each inventory entry/movement 
• amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subj ect 
identifiers 
• amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storage 
• non-study disposition (eg, lost, wasted, broken), and 
• amount destroyed at study site. 
9.3 Destruction of Investigational Product  
If the investigational product is to be destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal, and that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines, and institutional procedures. Appropri ate records of the disposal must be 
maintained.

Appendix 1 :  DSMB Charter  
 
Belatacept Therapy for the Fa iling Renal Allograft (Protocol IM103-133) 
 Dr. Idelberto R. Badell , M.D., Principal Investigator  
Emory University  
 The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to monitor patient safety and evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Dr. Idelberto R. Badell, Emory University, Atlanta, GA is conducting a clinical trial entitled, Belatacept Therapy for the Failing Renal Allograft (Protocol IM103-133).  
At periodic intervals as described in the study protocol, the DSMB responsibili ties are to:  
• review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data 
safety and monitoring;  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality 
and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retent ion, participant risk 
versus benefit, performance of the trial site, and other factors that can affect study 
outcome;  
• consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial;  
• review clinical center performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems reported by the PI;  
• protect the safety of the study participants;  
• report on the safety and progress of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the the PI, and, if required, to the FDA concerning continuation, termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under stu dy;  
• if appropriate, conduct interim analysis of efficacy;  
• ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring  
  
 
 
84 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020   
MEMBERSHIP  
The Data Safety Monitoring Board will consist of 3 membe rs. Two members will 
constitute a quorum. Membership consists of persons completely independent of the 
investigators who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the trial. The DSMB includes experts in or representatives of the fields of:  
• Transplant Surgery,  
• Transplant Nephrology 
• General nephrology  
• Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine 
Dr. Avinash Agarwal,  University of Virginia has been selected to serve as the chairperson. He is responsible for overseeing the meetings, developing the agenda in consultation with the PI. The chair is the contact person for the DSMB.  
 
Board Process  
The first review of data by the DMC will occur either after 10 subjects have been 
enrolled and randomized or approximately 6 months after the first subject is enrolled, whichever comes firs t.   The second review of the data by the DMC will occur either after 
30 subjects have been enrolled or 6 months after the first patient is enrolled, whichever comes first.  Subsequent reviews of data by the DMC will occur every 3 months during the remaind er of the first year and approximately every 6 months thereafter. 
Meetings will be conducted via teleconference and scheduled/coordinated by the site study team. Meetings will be attended by the principal investigator and members of his/her staff. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time at the request of the PI or the DMC Chairperson should questions of patient safety arise.  
REPORTS  
Interim Reports. Interim reports will be prepared by the study team and distributed to the 
DSMB at least 3 business days prior to a scheduled meeting. Additions and modifications 
to the content of the reports may be directed by the DSMB. Interim data reports generally consist of two parts. Part 1 provides information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline characteristics, and other general information on study status. Part 2 may contain data on study outcomes, including safety data and depending on the study, perhaps efficacy data. Reports are considered co nfidential. Data files to be used for interim 
 
 
85 
Belatacept IM 103 -133 Version10.0 02Aug2020   
analyses should have undergone established editing procedures to the extent possible. 
Interim analyses of efficacy data are performed only if they are specified and approved in advance and criteria for possible stopping is clearly defined.  
Reports from the DSMB. A formal report from the Chair will be sent to the full DSMB 
within 3 weeks of the meeting. Once approved by the DSMB, the Chair will forward the approved minutes to the PI within 6 weeks of each meetin g.  
Each report should conclude with a recommendation to continue or to terminate the study. This recommendation should be made by formal majority vote. A termination recommendation may be made by the DSMB at any time by majority vote. The Chair should tra nsmit such a recommendation to the PI as rapidly as possible, by immediate 
telephone if sufficiently urgent. In the event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. The report should not include unblinded data, discussion of the unblinded data, etc.  
Mailings to the DSMB: On a scheduled basis (as agreed upon by the DSMB) blinded 
safety data should be communicated to all DSMB members. Any concerns noted should be brought to the attention of the Chair who will take appropriate action.  
Access to Interim Data: Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as 
small a group as possible. Limiting the access to interim data to the DSMB members relieves the investigator of the burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to randomize patients and helps protect the study from bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. 
Members and other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality.

19(127)Duration of treatment
The study will start with a 2-week screening period. Eligible p atients will enter a 4-week 
single-blind placebo lead-in period and then be randomized to d ouble-blind treatment in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive either:
a) Dapagliflozin 10 mg tablet plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg tablet,
b) Dapagliflozin 10 mg tablet plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg placebo ta blet,
             or
c) Dapagliflozin 10 mg placebo tablet plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg pl acebo tablet,
administered once daily for the 24-week double-blind treatment period and followed 
up for 3 weeks after the treatment period.
Investigational product, dos age and mode of administration
Dapagliflozin 10 mg alone or dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxaglipt in 2.5 mg will be 
administered orally once daily during the 24-week double-blind,  treatment period.
Comparator, dosage and mode of administration
Placebo to match dapagliflozin 10mg and placebo to match saxagl iptin 2.5mg will be 
administered orally once daily during the 4-week single blind p lacebo lead-in period and the 
24-week double-blind treatment period.
Other treatments
x Insulin, antihypertensive drugs, lipid lowering drugs, and oral  anti-diabetic drugs 
(except SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors) a re allowed during 
the study. The dose should be kept constant throughout the enti re study from start of 
run-in to end of follow-up (week 27). CCI
Clinical Study Protocol

20(127) x Patients may receive open-label rescue medication added on to, but not as a 
replacement for their current study drug regimen. Rescue medica tion in this 
protocol refers to any approved, appropriate anti-diabetic agen t, except SGLT2 
inhibitor, GLP1 agonist and DPP4 inhibitors, for which there is  either initiation or 
upward titration, in accordance with the approved label and con ventional standards 
of care. 
x The dose of any concomitant anti-hypertensive medication should  be kept constant 
as far as possible throughout the entire study from start of ru n-in to the end of 
follow-up (week 27). However, in case of symptomatic hypotensio n or severe 
uncontrolled hypertension, anti-hypertensive treatment can be a djusted according to 
the Investigator’s judgement.  
Statistical methods 
Multiplicity due to the two active treatment groups will be con trolled by a Bonferroni 
adjustment, such that statistical significance will be determin ed according to a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.025. Within the saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 1 0 mg treatment group the 
control of the alpha level in the testing of both co-primary en dpoints (the percent change in 
urine albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to 24 we eks and the change in HbA1c 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require that each achieves stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints.  Within the dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the control of the alpha 
level for the primary endpoint (the percent change in urine alb umin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require the achievement of stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints. Parallel sequential testing strategies wil l be used for comparing each 
active treatment group to placebo for the secondary endpoints. 
The analysis of the change in HbA1C from baseline to Week 24 wi ll be based on a repeated 
measures model (RMM) including all scheduled time points follow ing randomization up to 
and including week 24. The analysis of percent change in UACR f rom baseline to Week 24 
will be conducted on the log-transformed UACR values using RMM.

30(127) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study 
Dapagliflozin (Forxiga®, Farxiga®) is a stable, reversible, hig hly selective, and orally active 
inhibitor of human renal sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2 ), the major transporter 
responsible for renal glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Dapag liflozin’s mechanism of action 
results in the direct and insulin-independent elimination of gl ucose by the kidneys. 
Traditionally, the presence of glucose in the urine has been se en as a sign of poor glycemic 
control and, thus, something to be avoided. Familial renal gluc osuria in humans, however, due 
to genetic mutations that reduce the function of SGLT2, is asso ciated with life-long glucosuria 
that is generally asymptomatic. Results from nonclinical- and c linical studies have shown that 
dapagliflozin can be used to promote urinary excretion of gluco se as a well-tolerated and 
effective method of reducing blood glucose levels. Thus, treatm ent with an SGLT2 inhibitor 
may affect hyperglycaemia directly by increasing glucose excret ion in the urine as well as 
indirectly by ameliorating underlying defects in glucose homeos tasis in patients with T2DM. 
Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action reduces plasma glucose rega rdless of the patient’s 
insulin sensitivity and β -cell secretory function. Because this mechanism is independent  of 
insulin secretion or insulin action, this approach to anti diab etic therapy provides an 
opportunity to achieve clinically important glycemic efficacy w ith a comparatively low risk of 
hypoglycemia. This insulin-independent mechanism is also potent ially applicable to a broad 
spectrum of patients. In addition, the excretion of glucose may  promote weight loss or prevent 
weight gain, as a consequence of calorie loss, a potential bene fit for many patients with T2DM. 
The dapagliflozin clinical development program was designed to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy of dapagliflozin in a wide range of patients with T2DM . The program included both 
placebo-controlled and active comparator studies in drug-naïve patients at an early stage of 
disease and patients who require additional therapy after failu re to reach adequate glycemic 
control with their current regimen. Dapaglif lozin’s pharmacodynamic effect of glucosuria is 
detected almost immediately (within 1 hour post-dose), is maint ained through 2 years of 
treatment, and results in reductions in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Post-prandial Glucose 
(PPG), and HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin). Treatment with dap agliflozin, with its unique 
mechanism of action, results in a persistent loss of glucose wi th associated calories in the 
urine, resulting in a consistent and maintained reduction of th e total body weight, in addition 
to the improved glycemic control. The weight loss is predominan tly a result of a reduction in 
fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tis sue in T2DM. Dapagliflozin 
also has a mild diuretic effect, which in combination with weig ht loss, has the potential to 
reduce blood pressure.  
Saxagliptin (Onglyza®) is a highly potent, selective, reversibl e, and competitive dipeptidyl l 
peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor. DPP4 is the enzyme responsible fo r the inactivation of 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Gastric inhibitory polypept ide (GIP). By inhibiting the 
enzyme DPP4, saxagliptin potentiates active endogenous GLP-1 co ncentrations, augmenting 
the physiological mechanism of insulin secretion and decreasing  glucagon release, thereby 
reducing postprandial and fasting glucose levels in patients wi th T2DM.

31(127)The results from the saxagliptin Phase IIb and IIIprograms in over patients support the 
oral dose of saxagliptin 2.5 and 5 mg once daily in a wide rang e of patients with T2DM, as 
either monotherapy, add-on combination therapy with metformin, a thiazolidinedione (TZD ), 
a sulfonylurea (SU), insulin or initial combination therapy wit h metformin and the results 
from the Phase III studies confirmed clinically meaningful bene fits on HbA1c, as well as 
fastin g plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG), insulin, C -peptide, and glucagon 
levels. 
Diabetic subjects with renal impairment are of interest because  diabetic nephropathy affects 
approximately 30% of patients with diabetes. In the United Stat es, for instance, about 20% of 
individuals with diabetes have an estimated glomerular filtrati on rate (eGFR) lower than 60 
ml/min/1.73m2(chronic kidney disease, CKD stage ≥3). As diabetic patients pr ogress from 
normal to diminished renal function over the natural history of  their disease, there is a medical 
need for safe and effective oral anti-diabetic therapy. Several  existing anti-diabetic agents are 
contraindicated in this population, are associated with increas ed risk of hypoglycemia, or have 
not been adequately studied in these patients. Safety and effic acy data in subjects with normal, 
mildly, and moderately impaired renal function have been collec ted in previous studies in the 
dapagliflozin and saxagliptin development program.
While saxagliptin 2.5 mg daily has been shown to be well tolera ted and improve glucose 
control even in individuals with CKD stage >3  (Nowicki et al 2 011), dapagliflozin’s ability to 
inhibit renal glucose reabsorption declines with decreasing eGF R and in CKD3, urinary 
glucose excretion with dapagliflozin is about 50% lower than in  patients with normal or 
mildly impaired renal function. In a previous study in CKD3, dap agliflozin 5 and 10 mg daily 
was well-tolerated but did not have a significant impact on gly cemic control in patients with 
more advanced CKD, although there was a modest decrease in HbA1 c and FPG in patients
with a GFR of 45 –59 ml/min (Kohan et al 2014). However, that study suffered from  several 
limitations. The use of insulin-based regimens in almost two-th irds of patients, often with 
sliding scale administration, made accurate capture of insulin dosing difficult. Differential 
adjustments of insulin between placebo and dapagliflozin could have blunted the apparent 
efficacy of dapagliflozin. A second limitation was the relative ly small size of the study, which 
was powered for a 0.6% change in HbA1c, and therefore limited i n its ability to demonstrate 
smaller glycemic effects and thus, the study may be considered underpowered and subject to 
type 2 error. Other limitations including, a very short placebo  lead-in period, and a relatively 
large placebo effect in this study could potentially also have affected its generalizability and 
obscured the interpretation of the data. 
In other clinical studies, which did not suffer from the limita tions described above, SGLT2-
inhibitors have been shown to be well-tolerated and effective i n T2DM patients with reduced 
kidney function lending support to further studies in this popu lation.  
There is a growing body of evidence indicating that SGLT2 inhib ition might be beneficial 
from a nephroprotective standpoint. This effect is thought to b e achieved partly by 
mechanisms independent of overall blood pressure and blood gluc ose reductions. Such other 
mechanisms are thought to be reduced intra-glomerular pressure through an enhanced CCI

32(127) tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism (De Nicola 2014 and Thomas 2014) as well as a 
reduced glucose and sodium transport over the proximal tubule c ells (Pollock et al 1991 and 
Komala et al 2013) 
Preclinical data in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes and obesit y show similar reductions in 
renal inflammatory response after dapagliflozin treatment as ha s been seen with ARB 
treatment (Terami et al 2014 and Sato-Horiguchi et al 2012). Fu rther, data from a type 2 
diabetic nephropathy model have indicated that a combination th erapy with SGLT2i and 
ACEI is more effective in lowering blood pressure and more neph roprotective than 
administration of either agent alone (Kojima et al 2013). Of no tice, treatment with a SGLT2i 
in a type 1 diabetic nephropathy (eNOS knockout) rat model did not have any 
nephroprotective effect.  
Preclinical data do also support nephroprotective effects of DP P4 inhibitors. Thus, in rodent 
models of T1 and T2DN, treatment with DPP4 inhibitors has been found to decrease renal 
injury markers such as albuminuria, fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress (Tanaka et al 
2014). Even clinical data suggest nephroprotective effect of SG LT2 and DPP4 inhibitors as 
reduced urinary albumin excretion have been observed in T2DN tr ials with both these agents. 
(Scirica et al 2013).  
Despite the glucose lowering effect of dapagliflozin is reduced  in parallel with a declining 
renal function, reduced urinary albumin excretion has been foun d in patients with moderate 
renal impairment on top of RAAS blockade for up to 1 year (Sjös tröm et al 2015). 
Although a causal relationship is debated, changes in albuminur ia over time predicts mortality 
and both cardiovascular and renal outcomes significantly better  than glucose status and blood 
pressure control in patients at a high cardiovascular risk (Sch mieder et al 2014). 
The combination of DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibition has therefore bee n proposed as a promising 
future option for T2DM patients with CKD (Schernthaner et al 20 14). 
Rationale for study design, doses and control groups   
This study will be performed as part of the clinical developmen t program for dapagliflozin for 
treatment of T2DM. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy,  safety and pharmacodynamics 
of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin in combination with saxaglip tin in CKD patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuria treated with ACEi or ARB wh o have inadequate glycemic 
control, defined as HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤11.0%, and renal impairmen t (eGFR ≥25 to ≤75 
ml/min/1.73 m2).  
The pharmacodynamic effects of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin ha ve previously been studied 
in patients with renal impairment. Saxagliptin 2.5mg once daily  significantly reduced UACR 
and HbA1c (Mosenzon et al 2014, Nowicki et al 2011, Kohan et al  2014) and dapagliflozin 
reduced UACR and HbA1c albeit the effect on HbA1c was not stati stically different from 
placebo (Kohan et al 2014). All these doses were well-tolerated  in this population and the 
saxagliptin dose of 2.5 mg is currently in the approved label f or treatment of subjects with 
moderate or severe renal impairment. Dapagliflozin 10mg once da ily was chosen because the

33(127) overall safety has not been different from 5mg once daily and t he long term albuminuria 
lowering effects are thought to be more robust. Because the ant i-glycemic effect of 
dapagliflozin vanes with decreasing GFR, HbA1c is the primary e ndpoint in the dapagliflozin 
+ saxagliptin arm and secondary in the dapagliflozin arm. 
Patients will be randomized to 24 weeks treatment with dapaglif lozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 10 
mg plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg or matching placebo. The study will be an international multi-
centre study at approximately 100 centres in North America, EU & ROW. It is planned to 
randomize a total of 450 patients (150 patients per treatment a rm). The study is powered to 
detect a difference of 0.42% in mean HbA1c and 35% difference i n UACR between active 
treatment and placebo following 24 weeks of treatment. 
Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily, saxagliptin 2.5 mg once daily o r matching placebo will be 
added to usual care of patients who have inadequate glycemic co ntrol on their existing 
therapies.  
This double-blind, randomized phase II/III study requires a pla cebo group to determine 
efficacy of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin in  a specific patient segment in 
order to discriminate effects caused by the study treatment fro m effects caused by other 
factors. All patients in the study are protected from harm by r escue criteria, which call for 
withdrawal from the study if the patient shows evidence of inad equately controlled disease. 
Randomization will be stratified by pre-enrolment anti-hypergly cemic therapy 
(long/intermediate-acting and mixed insulin regimen, metformin- based regimen, sulfonylurea 
(SU)-based regimen, thiazolidinedione (TZD)-based regimen, and other regimen.  
Any patients on metformin treatment need to have a dose suitabl e according to local 
guidelines and investigator’s judgement for the targeted CKD se gments (i.e., eGFR – 25-75 
ml/min/1.73 m2, calculated using the MDRD formula or specific formulas for Ja panese and 
Taiwanese see 5.2.1). The study consists of a 2-week screening period, a 4-week single-blind 
placebo lead-in period, a 24-week double-blind,  placebo-controlled treatment period, and a 3-
week follow-up (FU) period. The study drugs are taken once dail y in the morning. The main 
efficacy assessments will be performed at regular intervals and  will include HbA1c, UACR, 
weight, waist circumference, FPG, seated BP and heart rate. Dur ing the double-blind 
treatment period, HbA1c and urinary glucose values will be blin ded to the Investigator and to 
the Sponsor. These values will be provided to the Investigator after the study has been 
completed. FPG value will be reported as an un-blinded value th roughout the study. The main 
safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and w ill include physical 
examination, vital signs, orthostatic reaction, renal function (change in s-creatinine), safety 
laboratory test, and AE monitoring. 
1.2 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
Risk category 
Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin have global market approval and h ave been administered to 
thousands of T2DM patients. Details regarding potential risks a ssociated with administration

34(127) of dapagliflozin once daily and saxagliptin once daily are prov ided in respective Investigator’s 
Brochures. 
Considering dapagliflozin’s and saxagliptin's mechanism of acti on, the previous clinical 
experience with these compounds, the study’s design features (i ncluding the inclusion, 
exclusion, and discontinuation criteria), and the planned safet y procedures, participation in 
this study presents a minimal, and thus acceptable, risk to the  individual patients that will be 
included.  
Potential risks 
Details regarding potential risks associated with administratio n of saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for each medication.  
Dapagliflozin:  
Inhibition of SGLT2 results in increased urinary glucose excret ions, which is commonly 
believed to increase the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs ). In some of the global Phase III 
studies, events of UTI were reported in a slightly higher propo rtion of dapagliflozin-treated 
patients than the placebo group. Increased urinary glucose excr etion may also lead to an 
increased risk of developing genital infections. In global Phas e III studies, the proportions of 
patients treated with dapagliflozin who reported AEs that match ed a predefined list of Medical 
dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) preferred terms t hat were indicative of genital 
infection were higher than those seen for placebo. 
Based on the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin and results o f animal and clinical studies, 
there may be a potential risk for this compound to cause hypovo laemia or electrolyte 
imbalance. Severe hypovolaemia can cause hypotension, reduced r enal perfusion and, in worst 
cases, acute renal failure. As a precaution, patients who, in t he judgment of the Investigator, 
may be at risk for dehydration or volume depletion due to co-ex isting conditions or 
concomitant medications, such as loop diuretics, should have ca reful monitoring of their 
volume status. In patients already receiving dapagliflozin who develop conditions that may 
cause hypovolaemia or electrolyte imbalance, decisions to inter rupt or discontinue 
dapagliflozin therapy and management of patients should be base d on clinical judgment. 
Higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormali ties of hyperphosphatemia 
were reported in dapagliflozin vs. placebo but the clinical mea ning of this is unclear. 
Hepatic laboratory markers were assessed in all the clinical st udies with dapagliflozin. In the 
pooled analyses, the proportion of patients with elevated liver  function tests was similar in the 
dapagliflozin and comparator groups and no clinically meaningfu l or consistent mean changes 
from baseline in liver function tests were observed in the dapa gliflozin and placebo groups 
across the Phase IIb and III clinical studies. One patient had a SAE reported as drug-induced 
acute hepatitis that was later diagnosed as most comparable wit h autoimmune hepatitis. 
There have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis, includin g diabetic ketoacidosis, in 
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus taking dapagl iflozin and other SGLT2

35(127) inhibitors, although a causal relationship has not been establi shed. Dapagliflozin is not 
indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes me llitus. 
 
Patients treated with dapagliflozin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with 
ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malai se, and shortness of breath, 
should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose leve ls are below 14 mmol/ (250 
mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinuation or tempor ary interruption of 
dapagliflozin should be considered and the patient should be pr omptly evaluated. 
 
Predisposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta-cell fu nction reserve resulting from 
pancreatic disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreati tis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin 
dose reduction, reduced caloric intake, or increased insulin re quirements due to infections, 
illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be u sed with caution in these 
patients. 
 
No study procedure will put patients at a risk beyond those ord inarily encountered during the 
performance of routine medical examinations or routine tests. 
Saxagliptin:  
Prior to approval, saxagliptin was evaluated in 6 pivotal Phase  III, randomized, double-blind 
controlled trials. The majority of adverse events (AEs) reporte d in clinical studies have been 
of mild intensity and few have required treatment discontinuati on. Post approval, the 
cardiovascular safety of saxagliptin was evaluated in 8280 pati ents with T2DM with high CV 
risk. When added to the standard of care, saxagliptin neither r educed nor increased the risk of 
the primary composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarcti on (MI), or ischemic stroke 
(Scirica et al 2013). However, in subgroups analysis, increased  risk for hospitalization for 
heart failure was found in patients treated with saxagliptin.  
Joint pain (arthralgia) was reported during post marketing use of saxagliptin, as well as other 
m e di ci n es  f rom  th e  s am e  m e di ci n e  g rou p  (D P P 4  i n h ibi tors ).  P a ti e nts experienced joint pain 
which could be severe in some cases. Some patients experienced relief of symptoms when the 
medication was discontinued.  Some patients experienced recurre nce of symptoms when 
restarting the same or another DPP4 inhibitor medication. 
 
Protection against risks 
This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place  so as to monitor and 
minimize any of the potential health risks to participating pat ients. In order to ensure the 
safety of all patients participating in this study, AstraZeneca  will conduct a real-time review of 
all safety information from all ongoing clinical dapagliflozin studies as they become available. 
Safety signal detection will include the integration of all ava ilable sources of safety 
information, including clinical study data, AE reports, pre-cli nical data, epidemiological 
studies and literature reports, to identify and characterize un recognized safety risks or changes

36(127) in those which are currently expected Adverse Drug Reactions. A ny information that may 
affect the benefit-risk profile of dapagliflozin will be immedi ately communicated to relevant 
Health Authorities and appropriate actions will be taken regard ing the clinical program as 
needed. Thus real-time, active safety surveillance will be cond ucted during the entire duration 
of this study. In addition, all dapagliflozin studies are subje ct to a carefully designed patient 
risk management plan that includes the temporary and if necessa ry permanent discontinuation 
of investigational product (IP) in individual patients in whom a potential health risk or a 
laboratory abnormality of clinical concern has been identified.  
Potential benefits to patients 
All patients will receive counselling on dietary and life-style  modifications. Global phase II 
and phase III studies have established the effect of dapagliflo zin and saxagliptin therapy on 
glycemic control. This phase II/III study will evaluate these e ffects of dapagliflozin and 
dapagliflozin together with saxagliptin in T2DM patients with C KD. In addition, dapagliflozin 
is expected to help decrease body weight (or prevent weight gai n) as well as help lower BP 
especially in patients with elevated baseline BP. Patients are also expected to receive some 
benefit in the form of increased medical care/attention when pa rticipating in study procedures, 
which includes at least 10 clinical visits. 
Informed consent and alternatives to participation 
All prospective participants will be fully informed of the poss ible risks and benefits associated 
with this study, and their consent will be obtained prior to pe rforming any study-specific 
activity. Should a prospective participant elect to not partici pate in the study or to withdraw 
from the study, other medications are available to treat their diabetes, and the patient will not 
be disadvantaged in any way. 
Conclusion 
Considering the pre-clinical and clinical experience with dapag liflozin and saxagliptin and the 
precautions included in the study protocol, participation in th is study presents a minimal and 
thus acceptable risk to patients who meet the inclusion and non e of the exclusion criteria and 
consent to take part in the study.  
1.3 Study Design  
This is an exploratory phase II/III study in patients with CKD (eGFR= 25-75 
mL/minute/1.73m2), type 2 diabetes mellitus with micro- or macroalbuminuria (ur ine 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) 30-3500 mg/g). The study is randomized, double-blind, 
placebo controlled and parallel group designed, multi-national,  multi-centre study to evaluate 
pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (od) and dap agliflozin 10 mg once daily 
in combination with saxagliptin 2.5 mg once daily on top of bac kground ACEi or ARB 
treatment. The study consists of a 2-week screening period foll owed by a 4-week single-blind 
placebo lead-in period, 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled  treatment, and a 3-week 
follow-up period. Patients will be screened within two weeks be fore the lead-in period.

Date 18-Sep-2017 
37(127) Patients will be stratified according to background anti-diabet es medication. All patients must 
have had a stable anti-diabetic treatment during the previous 1 2 weeks.  
The study will be an international multi-centre study at approx imately 100 clinical sites in 
North America, EU & ROW. It is planned to randomize a total of 450 patients (aim 150 
patients per treatment). Each clinical site is expected to enro l at least 4 patients. Competitive 
enrolment will be applied. The study is primarily designed to i nvestigate the effect of 
dapagliflozin alone or in combination with saxagliptin on HbA1c  and UACR. 
The main efficacy assessments will include HbA1c and morning sp ot urine albumin to 
creatinine ratio (UACR). 
Safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and w ill include physical 
examination, vital signs (including measured orthostatic reacti ons), renal function, body 
weight, safety laboratory test, hypoglycaemia and AE monitoring .

At Visit 1, patients will be screened for an HbA1c (HbA1c ≥7.0%  and ≤11.0%), eGFR level 
(eGFR 20-80 mL/minute/1.73m2) and micro or macroalbuminuria (UACR 30 – 3500 mg/g). 
Patients who meet these criteria will be enrolled and further e xamined for all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. At Visit 2 (start of lead-in visit), patien ts will be examined for lab panel. If

and none of the exclusion criteria are met the patients will en ter a 4-week single-blind placebo 
lead-in period. At Visit 3, patients who meet all of the inclus ion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at Visit 1 and 2 spaces will be randomized t o the 24-week double-blind 
placebo-controlled treatment period. The prescription of anti-d iabetic and anti-hypertensive 
drugs, (including diuretics) should be kept constant throughout  the entire 4-week lead in 
period. At randomization, patients will be stratified according  to the pre-enrolment anti-
hyperglycaemic therapy. 
After either completion of the treatment period or permanent pr emature discontinuation of 
study medication, patients will enter a 3-week safety and susta ined efficacy follow-up period 
without study medication. The follow-up visit (Visit 10) provid es the opportunity to further 
evaluate changes in physical signs, symptoms or laboratory para meters that may be related to 
dapagliflozin with/without co-administration of saxagliptin. Th e total planned study duration 
from Visit 1 to the safety follow-up (Visit 10) will be 33 week s.

51(127)3.5 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized 
subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive study medication.  There can be no exception s to this rule.  Subjects who 
are enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligib ility criteria must not be 
randomized or initiated on treatment, and must be withdrawn fro m the study.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but i s randomized in error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the following steps need to b e taken: 
xThe Investigator or monitor should inform the AstraZeneca study  physician immediately, 
ensuring patient safety must always be the number one priority.
xStudy Treatment must be discontinued in all cases where continu ed treatment is deemed to 
pose a safety risk to the patient. A discussion should occur be tween the AstraZeneca study 
physician and the investigator, a decision may be reached that w hether to continue or 
discontinue the patient from study treatment. The AstraZeneca s tudy physician must ensure 
all decisions are appropriately documented.
xIn those cases where continuation of study therapy is judged no t to present a concern 
related to safety and disease management, the rationale for con tinuing study therapy must 
be clearly documented. The patient should continue follow up in  accordance with defined 
study procedures.

52(127)3.7 Methods for ensuring blinding
The study has a single blind placebo Lead-in period of 4 weeks from Visit 2, where patients 
will be blinded to treatment. Other, as members at AstraZeneca,  investigational centres or any 
Contract Research Organization (CRO) handling data will be awar e of the placebo treatment 
during this period.
The study will be conducted in a double-blind & double dummy fa shion. The matching 
placebo are identical in size, colour, smell, taste, packaging and labelling to their respective 
active tablets of dapagliflozin 10 mg and saxagliptin 2.5 mg.
Until the completion of the 24-week randomised treatment period , no member of the study 
team at AstraZeneca, at the investigational centres or any CRO handling data will have access 
to the randomisation scheme, with the exception of AstraZeneca personnel generating the 
randomisation scheme as well as relevant persons at Pharmaceuti cal Development Supply 
Chain at AstraZeneca or their designee, where the information i s needed to package study 
medication, the Patient Safety data entry site and the CRO comp anies providing the 
IVRS/IWRS and carrying out the packaging and labelling of inves tigational products. Patients 
and investigators will remain blinded past the 24-week randomis ed treatment period. The 
treatment codes and results will be kept strictly within AstraZ eneca to safeguard the integrity 
of the blind of the investigators and patients, and hence to mi nimize any possible bias in data 
handling. 
The exception is for those personnel analyzing the PK data.  Th e randomisation code will be 
provided to ensure that only samples from patients who were on the relevant active study 
treatment are analysed.  The randomization list will be kept in  a secure location until the end 
of the studyC

53(127) 3.8 Methods for unblinding  
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisat ion for each randomised 
subject, will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacist s from the IVRS/IWRS. Routines 
for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that wi ll be provided to each centre. 
<<(JP) Replace the above paragraph with: Individual treatment codes, i ndicating the 
treatment randomisation for each randomised subject, will be av ailable to the Investigator(s) 
or pharmacists, and the personnel who are independent to the st udy evaluation at the Patient 
Safety Department, AstraZeneca from the IVRS/IWRS.>> ( End JP)  
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emerg encies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment r andomisation. The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, w ithout revealing the treatment 
given to subject to the AstraZeneca staff. 
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that a re unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the 
planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluabilit y of the data from each individual 
subject have been made and documented. 
3.9 Restrictions 
x All patients will visit the clinic fasting in the morning, betw een 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.

Guidelines due to Acute Kidney Injury). 
Clinical indications for discontinuation because of hypoglycemi a may include the following: 
x Multiple occasions of episodes outlined below that, in the opin ion of the 
Investigator, indicate that continued treatment with study ther apy is not in the best 
interest of the patient.  This includes, but is not limited to:  
- Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia (e.g, sweating, shakiness, increased 
heart rate, confusion, dizziness, light-headedness, or hunger) in the absence of 
environmental factors known to contribute to hypoglycemia (ie, excess physical 
activity, concurrent illness, or missed or delayed meal) 
and/or  
- Documented finger stick glucose values <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L).   
3.10.1  Discontinuation Guidelines due t o Protocol-Defined Major Hypogl ycemia 
Episode or Recurrent Non-Major Hypoglycemia Episodes 
Subjects will be discontinued from study medication if they exp erience severe and/or frequent 
hypoglycemia episodes, defined as more than one major episode o r recurring non-major 
episodes in the event where the possibility of down-titration o f insulin and/or oral anti-diabetic 
medication(s), (other than blinded study medication) and/or oth er contributing factors (e.g., 
excessive physical activity) have been evaluated and corrected.  NOTE: Dose titration of 
blinded study medication is not permitted at any time during the study.  
x A Major Hypoglycemia Episode is defined as a symptomatic episod e which meets 
all of the following criteria: 
- External (the 3rd party) assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or  
behaviour. 
- Capillary or plasma glucose value of < 3 mmol/L (< 54 mg/dL) 
- Prompt recovery after glucose or glucagon administration 
x Recurring Non-Major Episodes are defined as any recurrent hypog lycemia episodes, 
as determined by the Investigator, not meeting the definition o f Major Episodes. 
It is the Investigator’s clinical assessment whether subjects w ho experience non -recurrent and 
non-major episodes of hypoglycemia should be discontinued from study medication.

56(127) 3.10.2  Discontinuation Guidelines due to Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) 
For patients with signs of deterioration in renal function, add itional monitoring needs to be 
conducted. Any patients with >1.5 x baseline serum creatinine i ncrease needs to be scheduled 
for a new serum creatinine test within 4 days whenever possible .  
x If the new serum creatinine value is >1.5 x basal level, the pa tient should be 
evaluated for any suspected new, temporary and reversible cause  of renal 
dysfunction, e.g. concurrent use of NSAIDs, antibiotics, or oth er medications 
known to affect creatinine clearance; volume depletion; urinary  tract infection, and 
obstructive uropathy. 
 If there is no suspected cause of the acute drop in renal funct ion, the subject 
must permanently discontinue study medication and the Sponsor i s notified. 
The investigator will follow the subject until the event has re solved or 
stabilized. 
 If there is a suspect reversible cause, the following actions s hould be taken: 
- Study medication should be withheld.  
- The suspected cause of renal dysfunction should be identified a nd corrected. 
- Serum creatinine should be checked again after approximately on e week: 
 If serum creatinine is still >1.5 x baseline level: 
¾  The subject must permanently discontinue study medication and the 
Sponsor is notified. The Investigator will follow the subject u ntil the 
event has resolved or stabilized 
 If serum creatinine is <1.5 x baseline level: 
¾  Study medication can be resumed. 
¾  Serum creatinine should be checked after approximately one wee k 
¾  The subject may continue in the study and will be followed acc ording 
to the protocol. Additional monitoring of serum creatinine may be 
performed according to the local prac tice or Investigator’s judgment.  
3.10.3  Rescue Due to Lack of Glycemic Control in the Treatment Period 
Rescue Medication  
Patients with lack of glycemic control during the 24 week treat ment period may be eligible to 
receive open-label rescue medication in addition to their blind ed treatment in order to treat 
ongoing hyperglycemia. Patients may receive open-label rescue m edication added on to, but 
not as a replacement for, their current study medication regime n. Rescue medication in this 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
57(127) protocol refers to any approved, appropriate anti-diabetic agen t, except SGLT2-inhibitors, 
GLP-1 agonists or DPP4 inhibitors, in accordance with the appro ved label and conventional 
standards of care. Open-label rescue medication is to be titrat ed as needed to obtain adequate 
glycemic control.  
During the treatment period, all rescue decisions will be based  on central laboratory FPG and 
confirmatory FPG results. If patients meet the protocol-specifi ed glycemic criteria based on 
FPG, they will be recommended for open-label rescue medication.  
Patients in the follow-up phase will not need to adhere to the protocol defined rescue criteria, 
and may have their anti- diabetic regimen adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion, exc ept to 
start treatment with a SGLT2 inhibitor, a GLP1 agonist or a DPP 4 inhibitor. 
 
The sections and tables listed below define the lack of glycemi c control criteria for initiation 
of open-label rescue medication. 
Protocol-Defined Lack of Glycemic Control Cr iteria for Initiation of Open-Label Rescue 
Medication 
Pre-specified glycemic criteria (see Table 1 below), based upon  central laboratory FPG and 
confirmatory, repeat FPG, have been established during the 24 w eek treatment period, starting 
at Week 4 and up to Week 24 visits, to determine eligibility fo r open-label rescue medication 
initiation/titration. Table 1 Lack of Glycemic Control Criteria for Initiation of Ope n-Label Rescue 
Medication 
Visit Label Central Laboratory FPG 
From Week 4 to Week 12 (excluding week 12)  FPG > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L)  
From Week 12 to Week 24 (excluding  Week 24)  FPG > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)  
 
Patients with a central laboratory FPG value meeting the lack o f glycemic control criterion at 
a pre-specified visit will be scheduled for a follow-up visit ( within 3 - 5 days) to obtain a 
second central laboratory FPG value and review the patient’s gl ucose meter readings. If the 
repeat central laboratory FPG value still meets the criterion, the patient will receive rescue 
medication. 
Irrespective of study visit number, patients who meet rescue cr iteria in the treatment period 
must first complete the Week 24 visit procedures (within 5 days  whenever possible) before 
being rescued to ensure that important trial endpoint measureme nts are collected. 
Followin g completion of the Week 24 “Rescue” visit, rescued patients wi ll be administered 
open-label rescue medication in addition to their blinded study  medication. Rescued patients 
will then continue in the treatment period according to their o riginal visit schedule. Patients 
who received a first rescue medication, who subsequently fulfil  lack of glycemic control 
criteria, may have other rescue medications added or substitute d, according to Investigator 
judgment, without repetition of rescue visits.

58(127) 3.10.4  Guidelines with regard to changes in insulin dose 
Each subject’s baseline insulin therapy should remain unchanged  wherever possible 
throughout the double-blind treatment period. The stable insuli n regimen aims to continue 
insulin as it was being used by the subject at enrollment and l ead-in, with no changes to 
insulin type and with as few changes in insulin dosage as possi ble. A stable insulin regimen is 
pivotal, because it makes it possible for the study to measure any differences in glycaemic 
control between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm. During the double-blind 
treatment period, a few subjects will experience poor glycaemic  control, as measured by 
increased fasting plasma glucose measurements from the central laboratory during study visits. 
When glucose measurements exceed certain limits (as specified),  the subject will be 
‘‘rescued’’.   
Up-titration in insulin dose is not allowed, unless fasting blo od glucose rescue criteria is 
fulfilled or if insulin requirement has increased only temporar ily, e.g., due to an infection and 
the increase in insulin dose is ≤10 percent of the baseline level after 1 week. If lasting incre ase 
in insulin dose is made i.e. the insulin dose is still >10 perc ent higher than the baseline level 1 
week after up-titration, the subject shall be handled as admini stration of anti-diabetic rescue 
medication and be treated as “rescued” (i.e., the patient must complete the Week 24 visit 
procedures, as outlined in section 4.5.7 and the patient will c ontinue in the treatment period 
according to their original visit schedule.  
Down-titration of insulin is allowed only as necessary to preve nt low blood glucose or 
hypoglycemia.  
3.10.5  Procedures for discontinuation of a subject from investigationa l product  
If a subject was withdrawn before completing the study, the rea son for withdrawal must be 
entered on the appropriate case report form (CRF) page. 
At any time, subjects are free to discontinue investigational p roduct or withdraw from the 
study (i.e., investigational product and assessments – see Section 3.11), without prejudice to 
further treatment.  A subject that decides to discontinue inves tigational will always be asked 
about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse events.  If  possible, they will be seen and 
assessed by an Investigator(s).  Adverse events will be followe d up (See Section 6); << diary 
cards, questionnaires (e.g., for patient reported outcomes) >> and all study drugs should be 
returned by the subject. 
All patients who discontinue study drug will be asked to remain  in the study for FU and 
complete all scheduled study visits through Week 27. At the tim e of discontinuation the Week 
24 (Visit 9) procedures will be performed. Patients will then c omplete all scheduled study 
visits and procedures. Patients unable or unwilling to return f or scheduled visits as part of 
follow-up will have the opportunity to receive follow-up via te lephone calls placed by the site 
mainly to review safety and concomitant medications. The only e xception to this procedure is 
when a patient withdraws consent for all study procedures or lo ses the ability to consent freely 
(i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the trea tment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illness).  
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
59(127) If a subject is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.11. 
3.11 Criteria for withdrawal  
3.11.1  Screen failures  
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibili ty criteria for the study, and 
therefore must not be randomized.  These patients should have t he reason for study 
withdrawal recorded as ‘Incorrect Enrolment’ (i.e., patient doe s not meet the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria).  This reason for study withdrawa l is only valid for screen failures 
(not randomized patients). Patients can be re-enrolled one sing le time, but they cannot be re-
randomized. 
3.11.2  Withdrawal of the informed consent 
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (inves tigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. 
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events (AE).  The Investigator will follow up AEs o utside of the clinical study.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then hi s/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be repl aced.  
3.11.3  Lost to follow-up 
Patient fails to return for study visits and cannot be reached with reasonable, repeated attempts. 
To prevent patients being lost to follow-up, their contact deta ils, including next of kin contacts 
should be collected initially and updated regularly by the site  staff or representative. The 
Investigator should educate the patient on the importance of co ntact with the Investigator 
throughout the study. Every effort will be made to ensure that the patient continues to return to 
the clinic for study visits and to avoid “lost to follow -up” during the conduct of the study. The 
study staff should make diligent attempts to contact patients w ho fail to return for study visits 
by using institutional datab ases, patient’s health professionals, and any other means that 
comply with country and local laws and regulations. After the f irst missed visit, patients who 
are considered temporarily lost to follow-up will have 2 docume nted telephone contact 
attempts and 1 certified letter in an effort to contact patient s. 
 
3.12 Discontinuation of the study 
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of AstraZeneca, tr ial subjects are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically significant findings that: 
x meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered s ignificant  
x are assessed as causally related to study drug  
x are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the st udy 
Clinical Study Protocol

60(127) Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available fo r the subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the CRF. All r easons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate  consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interes ts. 
4. STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES  
4.1 Study flowchart details 
At Visit 1 patients will be screened for an HbA1c (HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤11.0%), eGFR level 
(eGFR 20-80 mL/minute/1.73m2,) and micro- or macroalbuminuria (UACR 30 – 3500 mg/g). 
Patients who meet these criteria will be enrolled and further e xamined for all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. At Visit 2 (start of lead-in visit), patien ts will be examined for lab panel. If 
the eGFR value is 25-75 mL/minute/1.73m2 at Visit 1 or Visit 2 and all other inclusion and 
none of the exclusion criteria are met, the patients will enter  a 4-week single-blind placebo 
lead-in period. At Visit 3, patients who meet all of the inclus ion and none of the exclusion 
criteria at Visit 1 and 2 spaces will be randomized to the 24-w eek double-blind placebo-
controlled treatment period. The prescription of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive drugs, 
(including diuretics) should be kept constant throughout the en tire 4-week lead in period. At 
randomization, patients will be stratified according to pre-enr olment anti-hyperglycaemic 
therapy. 
After either completion of the treatment period or permanent pr emature discontinuation of 
study medication, patients will enter a 3-week safety and susta ined efficacy follow-up period 
without study medication. The follow-up visit (Visit 10 (FU)) p rovides the opportunity to 
further evaluate changes in physical signs, symptoms or laborat ory parameters that may be 
related to dapagliflozin with/without co-administration of saxa gliptin. The total planned study 
duration from Visit 1 to the safety follow-up (Visit 10) will b e 33 weeks. 
Summary scheme for inclusion based on HbA1c, eGFR and UACR

5.1 Efficacy assessments
Blood and urine samples will be obtained at specified time poin ts for laboratory evaluations.
The central laboratory for this study will perform the analysis  of all scheduled laboratory tests 
and will provide reference ranges for these tests. The detailed  methods for specimen collection, 
handling, processing, shipping, and storage will be supplied in  the Investig ator’s Laboratory 
Manual provided by the Central Laboratory. All clinical laborat ory tests will be performed by 
the Central Laboratory or designated reference laboratory.
During the double -blind treatment and follow -up period, HbA1c and spot urinary glucos e
values will be blinded to the Investigator and to the Sponsor. These values will be provided to 
the Investigator after the study has been completed. FPG value will be reported as an un -
blinded value throughout the study. During the whole study, 
 will be blinded to Investigator and to the Sponsor.
All glycemic efficacy objectives will be based on values measur ed by central laboratory. Any 
self-monitored plasma glucose measured by the patient and FPG m easured by the site using 
glucose meter will be used only for safety purposes. [Note: The  patients will be asked to check 
their blood glucose only if they develop symptoms suggestive of  hypoglycemia or 
hyperglycemia and to record hypoglycemia symptoms in the patien t diary.]
5.1.1 UACR
Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio is the primary assessment f or the determination of the anti-
proteinuric efficacy. Morning spot urine sample (first morning void) will be collected for each 
study visit (except Visit 2 and 4) and analysed according to th e procedures described in the 
Laboratory Manual. Note that three samples are needed for each visit, except Visit 1 (one 
sample).
5.1.2 HbA1c
HbA1c is the primary assessment for the determination of glycem ic efficacy and will be 
analysed by a central laboratory according to the procedures des cribed in the Laboratory

The patient’ s weight will be recorded in kilogram (kg) to one decimal place , with light 
clothing and no shoes. All readings should be recorded as accur ately as possible and the same 
scale should be used for all assessments for a given patient. T he patient’s height (on ly at Visit 
1) will be recorded in centimetres, with no shoes.
5.1.5 BMI
BMI is a calculated ratio between weight and height (weight / h eight2, where weight is 
measured in kg, and height in metres) and will be computed by A straZeneca.
5.1.6 Seated blood pressure and pulse
Pulse and BP measurements must be taken consistently throughout  the study. Pulse and BP 
should be recorded using the same equipment at each visit. Use only the right or the left arm 
when measuring these parameters. Document which arm was used, a long w ith the observer’s 
initials. The same arm should be used at all visits for each po sition. At each study visit, BP 
and pulse measurements should be obtained prior to blinded stud y drug administration. Pulse 
and BP will be measured thrice (1 minute apart) before any bloo d sampling is done after the 
patient has been sitting and resting for least 5 minutes. BP re adings should be taken while the 
patient is in a comfortable seated position with the arm suppor ted at the level of the heart. All 
three readings must be recorded in eCRF. For study analyses, th e average of the three BP and

The Investigator should make an assessment of the available results with regard to clinically 
relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at 
centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on 
laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3. 
NB. In case a subject shows an AST or ALT >3xULN or total Bilirubin > 2xULN please refer 
to Appendix D ‘ Algorithm on Management of Sustained Elevated Liver Safety Abno rmalities ’, 
for further instructions. 
5.2.3 Physical examination 
A brief physical examination should include the CV system, lung s, abdomen, and extremities, 
and any organ system pertinent to the patient’s signs, symptom s, or AEs. The patient should 
always be evaluated for the presence of oedema. A complete phys ical examination should 
include general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, nec k, CV system, lungs, abdomen, 
lymph nodes, extremities, neurological system, skin, and muscul oskeletal system. The patient 
should always be evaluated for the presence of oedema. 
5.2.4 ECG 
A 12-lead ECG will be taken after the patient has been lying do wn resting for at least 5 
minutes. The ECG will be evaluated by the investigator and en tered as ‘Normal’ or 
‘Abnormal’ in the eCRF. If the ECG is evaluated as “Abnormal” t he investigator should 
document the specific abnormality. 
5.2.5 Vital signs 
5.2.5.1  Pulse and blood pressure 
As BP is both efficacy and safety variable in this study, measu rement of seated BP is 
described in Sections 5.1.6 
Orthostatic BP: At selected visits where orthostatic BP and pul se are collected, supine and 
standing measurements should be made after the seated BP and pu lse measurements have 
been made, using the same arm that was used for the seated BP m easurements. All readings 
should be recorded in eCRF. Ideally, BP should be measured with  the same equipment, at the 
same time of day, and by the same personnel at each visit. 
The supine BP and pulse must be measured prior to the standing BP and pulse. After the 
patient rests in the supine position for at least 5 minutes, su pine BP and pulse will be

81(127) determined from three replicate measurements obtained at least 1 minute apart. All three 
readings must be recorded in eCRF. For study analyses, the aver age of the three BP and pulse 
readings will be used. 
After the supine BP and pulse measurements are obtained, the pa tient will stand for 2 to 3 
minutes. After this time, the BP will be measured with the arm supported at the level of the 
heart. Standing BP and pulse will be determined from three repl icate measurements obtained 
at least 1 minute apart. All 3 readings must be recorded in eCR F. For study analyses, the 
average of the three BP and pulse readings will be used. 
5.2.6 Other safety assessments 
5.2.6.1  Self-monitored blood glucose and hypoglycemic events 
The patients will be asked to check their blood glucose when th ey develop symptoms 
suggestive of hypoglycemia and to record specific symptoms in a  hypoglycemia/blood 
glucose diary. Any results collected in the diary will be revie wed by the investigator at each 
visit. The investigator is responsible for questioning the pati ent about all symptoms reported 
in the diary and for determining if they meet the clinical defi nition of hypoglycemia. Only 
symptoms and/or blood glucose values that meet the definition o f hypoglycemia should be 
reported on the hypoglycemia eCRF pages see Section 6.3.8. Gluc ometers will be provided by 
AstraZeneca. 
Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator anytime  they experience a hypoglycemic 
event. Hypoglycemic events must be recorded in the diary anytim e a patient experiences 
either of the following: 
x Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (regardless of blood glucose  value by finger 
stick) 
x Blood glucose value by finger stick <63 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) (reg ardless of 
symptoms). 
x Data to be collected for each hypoglycemic event: 
x Date and time of episode (start and stop) 
x Whether symptoms were present, and list of symptoms 
x Possible contributing factors 
x Whether a finger stick value was obtained, and if so, the plasm a glucose value 
x Whether intervention was needed for recovery 
x How the episode was treated

5.2.6.2  Hepatic events (Hepatic Adjudication Committee) 
An independent Hepatic Adjudication Committee, blinded to the t reatment of the patients, will 
determine the probability that drug-induced liver injury (DILI)  is the cause of liver-related 
abnormalities, including, but not limited to: 
x Hepatic events timely related to death (within 30 days before d eath) 
x AST and/or ALT >3x ULN and TB >2x ULN (within 14 days of the AS T and/or 
ALT elevation);  
x AST and/or ALT >10x ULN 
A separate Adjudication Manual will define and describe the pro cedure for the handling, 
reporting and classification of these cases. 
5.2.6.3  Asymptomatic bacteriuria 
The following is presented to assist in the classification and management of asymptomatic 
bacteriuria in studies with dapagliflozin. It is not intended t o supplant investigators clinical 
judgement. 
During enrolment, treatment and follow up of patients in this s tudy, the investigator may 
discover a patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the 
presence of ≥105 colony forming units/mL of bacteria, in a prop erly collected voided urine 
specimen, without signs or symptoms typically attributed to uri nary tract infection (UTI). 
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is prevalent among diabetic women, and  is associated with pyuria 
in 70% of cases. Neither guidelines from the US (Nicolle et al 2005, US Preventative Services 
Taskforce 2008 (USPSTF 2008)) nor 
Europe (European Association of Urology 2014 (EAU 2014)) recomm end screening for, or 
treatment of, asymptomatic bacteriuria in non-pregnant diabetic  patients. In this study, the 
central laboratory will report urinary dipstick test results fo r haemoglobin but will not 
routinely report the results of urinary dipstick tests for leuk ocyte esterase as a screening test 
for pyuria in surveillance urine examinations. 
5.2.6.4  Microscopic Haematuria 
In the event that haematuria is observed during a patient’s par ticipation, the spon sors 
recommend standard of care in diagnosing the cause of the haema turia. This section presents 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin
Study Code D1690C00023Edition Number 6.0
Date 18-Sep-2017
83(127)references and an example of standard of care evaluation of mic roscopic haematuria. Local
standards of care should be followed.
Patients with repeated reports of microscopic haematuria in 2 o r more properly collected urine 
samples need to have follow-up for this result according to sta ndard of care. The American
Urological Association defines microscopic haematuria as three or more red blood cells per 
high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two or mor e properly collected 
urinalysis specimens (Grossfeld et al 2001). These Best Practic e guidelines have been 
evaluated by Jung in a study of 772000 patients (Jung et al 201 1).
Patients who show microscopic haematuria that is accompanied by  significant proteinuria, red 
blood cell casts, or dysmorphic red blood cells in the sediment  should be evaluated for the 
presence of primary renal disease and need to be referred to a nephrologist (AUA, Grossfeld 
et al 2001).
Patients who lack other explanation for their haematuria, or wh o have risk factors for 
significant urologic disease, will need a urological evaluation  and should be referred to an 
urologist. Risk factors for significant urological disease incl ude unexplained microscopic
haematuria as well as smoking history, occupational exposure to  dyes or chemicals (such as 
benzenes or aromatic amines), visible haematuria, age >40 years , previous urologic history, 
history of irritative voiding symptoms, history of UTI, analges ics or phenacetin abuse, history 
of pelvic irradiation, or cyclophosphamide use (Greenwood M 192 6). Results from any 
procedure or investigations should be reported on the eCRF.
5.2.6.5 Volume Depletion
The risk of electrolyte abnormalities, volume depletion, and im paired renal function is 
enhanced when two diuretics are used in combination. For this r eason, caution should be 
exercised when administering dapagliflozin, which has a modest diuretic effect, to patients 
who are taking loop diuretics. These patients should have caref ul monitoring of electrolytes, 
volume status, and renal function. Loop diuretic dose adjustmen ts should be made if clinically 
indicated.

Collection of additional blood and urine biological samples for  potential future analysis are 
performed at visit 3 and visit 9 (Rescue and Discontinue visit,  if applicable). The donation of 
these extra samples is optional and the subject needs separatel y informed consent. After 
collection, the samples are stored for potential future analysi s for exploratory biomarkers to 
assess correlations with disease activity, effects of study dru g, clinical outcomes and toxicity. 
Storage, re-use and destruction of biological samples
Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the Last Subject’s Last 
Visit, after which they will be destroyed.  The results of this  biomarker research will be 
reported either in the Clinical Study Report itself or as an ad dendum, or separately in a

5.7.1 Labelling and shipment of biological samples 
The Principal Investigator ensures that samples are labelled an d shipped in accordance with 
the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that d o not meet Category A criteria), 
see Appendix C ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.  
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials are n ot shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the subject unless agreed with Astra Zeneca and appropriate 
labelling, shipment and containment provisions are approved. 
5.7.2 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughou t their lifecycle. 
The Principal Investigator <<at each centre>> keeps full tracea bility of collected biological 
samples from the subjects while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where 
appropriate) and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival. 
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples whil e in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documen tation of receipt of arrival. 
AstraZeneca keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through in ternal procedures, monitoring of 
study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers. 
Samples retained for further use are registered in the AstraZen eca Biobank during the entire 
life cycle. 
5.7.3 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples  
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated biological  samples, the samples will be 
disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented.  If samples a re already analysed , 
AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this resea rch. 
The Principal Investigator: 
x Ensures subjects’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to AstraZeneca 
x Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at  the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented 
x Ensures the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed  about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/ destroyed, the

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all  staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section. 
6.1 Definition of adverse events 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical c ondition or the deterioration 
of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposur e to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachyc ardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings , electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occ urring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs . 
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study pha se (i.e., run-in, treatment, 
washout,follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following c riteria: 
x Results in death 
x Is immediately life-threatening 
x Requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing  hospitalisation. 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
88(127) x Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject o r may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed abov e. 
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B  to the Clinical Study 
Protocol. 
6.3 Recording of adverse events 
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events 
AEs will be collected from the start of the placebo lead-in per iod throughout the treatment 
period (Visit 2 to 9) and including the follow-up period (Visit  10). 
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent is obta ined until the end of the study 
(Visit 10) 
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment  visit in the study are followed 
up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the 
CRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional inform ation for any subject with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessa ry. 
6.3.3 Variables  
The following variables will be collect for each AE; 
x AE (verbatim) 
x The date when the AE started and stopped 
x Maximum intensity 
x Whether the AE is serious or not 
x Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no) 
x Action taken with regard to investigational product 
x Outcome.  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs : 
x Date AE met criteria for serious AE 
x Date Investigator became aware of serious AE 
x AE is serious due to 
x Date of hospitalisation 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
89(127) x Date of discharge 
x Probable cause of death 
x Date of death 
x Autopsy performed 
x Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) 
x Description of AE. 
Maximum intensity will be graded according to the following rat ing scale: 
x Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
x Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with norm al activities) 
x Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activi ties) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Sec tion 6.2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious .  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE un less it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE w hen it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. 
6.3.4 Causality collection 
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between Invest igational Product and each 
Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you  consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?’  
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other me dication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study proc edure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is foun d in Appendix B to the CSP. 
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or care provider or reported in response to the 
open question from the study personnel: “Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked?”, or revealed by observatio n will be collected and recorded 
in the CRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis  is known and there are other 
signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis,  the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.

Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
90(127) 6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests 
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital s igns will be summarized in the 
CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated  laboratory values, vital 
signs, and other safety variables should therefore only be repo rted as AEs if they are clinically 
significant, fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason f or discontinuation of treatment 
with the investigational product. 
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated  with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associate d laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible  the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaem ia versus low Hb value). In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant dete riorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical find ing at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an  AE. 
6.3.7 Hy’s Law  
Pre-defined liver enzyme elevations will undergo adjudication. The definitions of the events to 
be adjudicated are provided in the Hepatic Adjudication Manual.  
For all events identified for adjudication, the Investigator wi ll complete the appropriate eCRF 
pages and provide source documentation as detailed in the Hepat ic Adjudication Manual. See 
also Section 5.2.6.2 
6.3.8 Hypoglycemic events 
A separate section in the eCRF will be used to document all rep orted episodes of 
hypoglycaemia (see Section 5.2.6.1). Hypoglycemic episodes shou ld also be reported on the 
AE eCRF page if the event fulfils protocol criteria for a SAE ( see Section 6.2). 
x Major hypoglycemic events, defined as symptomatic events requir ing external 
assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behavio ur, with a capillary 
or plasma glucose value <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L), and prompt rec overy after 
glucose or glucagon administration. 
x Minor hypoglycemic event, defined as either a symptomatic episo de with a 
capillary or plasma glucose measurement <63 mg/dL (<3.5 mmol/L)  regardless of 
need for external assistance or an asymptomatic capillary or pl asma glucose 
measurement below 63 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L), that does not qualify as a major 
episode. 
6.3.9 Potential events of diabetic ketoacidosis 
All potential events of DKA will be recorded in the eCRF and su bmitted to an independent 
DKA Adjudication Committee. The DKA Adjudication Committee T2DM  will assess 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
91(127) available information on each potential DKA event and will clas sify the event in accordance 
with the definitions in the DKA Adjudication Charter T2DM.  
The DKA Adjudication Committee will be kept blinded to the stud y drug treatment received 
by each patient with a potential DKA event in the clinical stud y. A separate DKA 
Adjudication Manual will define and describe the procedures for  the collection of DKA 
information, handling, adjudication criteria and reporting of t hese events/cases. 
6.3.10  Adverse events (AEs) leading to amputation and potential risk f actor AEs for 
amputations affecting lower limbs (“preceding events”)  
To ensure that data on amputations is systematically collected,  amputations and underlying 
conditions relevant to amputation will be recorded on a specifi c eCRF page. 
If any of these relevant events have occurred, relevant informa tion must be provided (this will 
be collected on a dedicated eCRF page). 
 
6.4 Reporting of seriou s adverse events 
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causall y related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorde d in the CRF. 
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigator s or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day i.e. , immediately but no later 
than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Sa fety data entry site within 1  
calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar  
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. 
For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or  relevant information is missing, 
active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or o ther site personnel inform 
AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a p reviously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it. 
AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a p reviously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it. 
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE i s serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
92(127) If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or o ther study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by designated back-up 
procedures. 
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/stu dy site personnel how to 
proceed. 
The reference document for definition of expectedness is the IB  for the AstraZeneca drug. 
 
6.5 Overdose 
Overdose is defined as >100 mg for dapagliflozin or >40 mg for saxagliptin per day. 
Dapagliflozin has been well tolerated at doses of up to 500 mg per day in single dose testing 
in healthy volunteers and up to 100 mg per day in repeat dose t esting for 14 days in healthy 
volunteers and patients with T2DM. If an overdose is suspected,  monitoring of vital functions 
as well as treatment as appropriate should be performed 
x An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis /symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module. 
x An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the  Overdose CRF 
module. 
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the cours e of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZe neca representatives 
immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she become s aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Saf ety data entry site. 
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting tim elines apply, see Section 6.4. 
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days. 
6.6 Pregnancy 
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to  AstraZeneca. 
6.6.1 Maternal exposure 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study IP  should be discontinued 
immediately. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a sus picion that the IP under study 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive m edication. Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should  be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be ha ndled as AEs. The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective terminati on, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
93(127) birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and docu mented even if the patient 
was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the In vestigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day  i.e., immediately but no 
later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Saf ety data entry site within 1 or 5 
calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for  all other pregnancies. 
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy a nd the PREGOUT is used 
to report the outcome of the pregnancy.  
6.6.2 Paternal exposure  
There is no restriction on fathering children or donating sperm  during the study. 
6.7 Management of IP related toxicities  
Dose reductions of IP are not permitted in the study 
6.8 Study governance and oversight 
The safety of all AstraZeneca clinical studies is closely monit ored on an on-going basis by 
AstraZeneca representatives in consultation with Patient Safety . Issues identified will be 
addressed; for instance this could involve amendments to the st udy protocol and letters to 
Investigators.

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA 
8.1 Statistical considerations 
Multiplicity due to the two active treatment groups will be con trolled by a Bonferroni 
adjustment, such that statistical significance will be determin ed according to a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.025. Within the saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 1 0 mg treatment group the 
control of the alpha level in the testing of both co-primary en dpoints (the percent change in 
urine albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to 24 we eks and the change in HbA1c 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require that each achieves stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints.  Within the dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the control of the alpha 
level for the primary endpoint (the percent change in urine alb umin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require the achievement of stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints. Parallel sequential testing strategies wil l be used for comparing each 
active treatment group to placebo for the secondary endpoints.

99(127)8.2 Sample size estimate
With 142 subjects per treatment group with post-baseline measur ements, there is 90% power 
to detect a difference of 0.42% in mean change from baseline in  HbA1c between 
saxagliptin/dapagliflozin treatment group and placebo and, sepa rately dapagliflozin treatment 
group and placebo at significance level of 0.025, using a two si ded alpha and assuming a 
standard deviation (SD) of 1.0%. Assuming 5% of the subjects do  not have a post-baseline 
assessment, a total of 450 subjects (150 subjects per treatment  group) need to be randomized.  
The estimated sample size of 142 subjects per group will also yi eld 92% power to detect a 
35% difference in UACR for each comparison at an alpha level of  0.025, assuming a SD = 
80%.  Based upon existing pooled data for dapagliflozin in trea ting patients with eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.73 m2on ACEi/ARB the minimal detectable difference for this study is  0.27% for 
HbA1c and 21% for UACR
The significance level used to infer statistical significance f or comparisons of primary and 
secondary endpoints will be 0.025, representing a two sided alp ha level. Within the 
saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the co ntrol of the alpha level in the 
testing of both co-primary endpoints (the percent change in uri ne albumin-to creatinine ratio 
(UACR) from baseline to 24 weeks and the change in HbA1c from b aseline to 24 weeks) will 
require that each achieves statistical significance at the 0.02 5 level for a claim of superiority to 
placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of secondary  endpoints.  Within the 
dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the control of the alpha le vel for the primary endpoint 
(the percent change in urine albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR)  from baseline to 24 weeks) 
will require the achievement of statistical significance at the  0.025 level for a claim of 
superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparis on of secondary endpoints.   
Parallel sequential testing strategies will be used for compari ng each active treatment group to 
placebo for the secondary endpoints.  In all analyses p-values will be represent two-sided tests, 
and will not be adjusted for multiplicity. 
8.3 Other statistical considerations
If superiority of is demonstrated within the saxagliptin 2.5 mg  + dapagliflozin 10 mg 
treatment group the for each of the two primary endpoints (HbA1 c and percent change from 
baseline UACR) at the 0.025 level and/or within the dapaglifloz in 10 mg treatment group the 
for the primary endpoints (percent change from baseline UACR) a t the 0.025 level then 
secondary endpoints will be compared separately between that tr eatment group and placebo at 
an alpha level of 0.025.  Comparisons of secondary endpoints wi ll be performed sequentially 
in the order prescribed in Section 2.2, and will cease for a gi ven treatment group at the first 
instance a secondary endpoint dose not statistical significance  in a secondary endpoint, or at 
the last comparisons, whichever occurs first.  Superiority of a  treatment to placebo will be 
inferred if statistical significance is demonstrated and greate r improvement occurred with that 
treatment than placebo.

evaluated in sensitivity analyses. Co ntinuous secondary and exploratory endpoints that are 
statistically compared and are only measured at baseline and at  the end of the 24 week double -
blind treatment period will be evaluated using analysis of vari ance models (ANOVA). 
Analyses of secondary, safety, and exploratory categorical endp oints that represent

Analyses on the variables shown below will only include measure ments obtained prior to or 
on the date of rescue medication for some analyses.  For other efficacy variables and 
exploratory variables, measurements after rescue medication wil l not be excluded from the 
analyses.
-Change from baseline in HbA1c (%)
-Change from baseline in FPG (mg/dL)
-Proportion of patients with HbA1c < 7%
Further details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP).
8.6.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
The analysis of the change in HbA1C from baseline to Week 24 wi ll be based on a repeated 
measures model (RMM) including all scheduled time points follow ing randomization up to 
and including week 24. The analysis of percent change from base line in UACR from baseline 
to Week 24 will be conducted on the log-transformed UACR values  using RMM.  Separate 
RMM models will be used to compare saxagliptin/dapagliflozin wi th placebo, and to compare 
dapagliflozin 10 mg alone with placebo.  RMM represent a longit udinal repeated measures 
analysis using ‘direct likelihood’, and include patients in the  Full Analysis Set who have a
baseline measurement and at least one post-baseline measurement . Analyses on HbA1c will 
only include measurements prior to the administration of rescue  medication. Measurements 
made following rescue administration will not be included in Hb A1c analysis. 
The SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used for primary analyses.  The primary analysis 
models will each include the fixed categorical effects of treat ment, week, randomization C

well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement  and baseline measurement-
by-week interaction. (In UACR analyses the natural logarithmic transformation will be 
applied to baseline UACR values prior to analysis.)  An unstruc tured matrix for the within-
patient error variance-covariance will be used. The denominator  degrees of freedom will be 
calculated according to the Kenward-Roger method. A number of b ack-up models will be 
defined in the statistical analysis plan in case of non-converg ence of the preferred model or 
other issues.  
Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the mean chang e in HbA1c within each 
model for each treatment group as well as the difference in mea n change between the 
saxagliptin/dapagliflozin treatment group and placebo will be c alculated. P-value of the 
differences in Week 24 estimates between saxagliptin/ dapaglifl ozin and placebo will be 
calculated. For UACR, point estimates and 95% confidence interv als for the mean percent 
change in UACR within each treatment group will be obtained by exponention of model 
estimates, and differences in mean percent change will be simil arly calculated. P-values of the 
differences in Week 24 percent change estimates between each tr eatment group 
(saxagliptin/dapagliflozin and, separately, dapagliflozin 10 mg  only) and placebo from each 
model will be calculated. 
8.6.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s) 
Comparisons of the secondary efficacy endpoints between dapaglf lozin 10 mg and placebo 
will be performed only if the test for the primary UACR endpoin t is significant. Secondary 
efficacy endpoints will only be compared between saxagliplin/da pagliflozin and placebo will 
only be performed if each comparison of both co-primary endpoin ts is significant.  If 
statistical significance is achieved as prescribed above, then the secondary endpoints will be 
compared between that treatment (those treatments) and placebo in the order specified in 
Section 2.2. A sequential testing procedure will be employed fo r secondary comparisons in 
order to control the type I er ror rate at the 0.025 leve l.  Sta tistical comparisons between each 
treatment and placebo will be only performed for a given second ary endpoint if all previous 
sequential tests for that comparison are also significant. Othe rwise, the testing procedure will 
stop at the secondary endpoint that does not reach statistical significance.    
The secondary endpoints percent change from baseline in total b ody weight at Week 24, 
change from baseline in FPG at Week 24, change from baseline in  seated SBP at Week 24, 
and change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 (Dapagliflozin 10 mg) will be analyzed by 
RMM analyses, as described for the primary analyses.   
The secondary analyses of proportions for subjects with at leas t a 30 percent reduction in 
UACR from baseline to Week 24 and, separately, proportions for subjects with an HbA1c of 
less than 7 percent at Week 24 will be analyzed using a logisti c regression model with 
adjustment for randomization strata and baseline measurement.

119(127) 12. APPENDIX A ADDITIONAL SAFETY INFORMATION 
12.1 Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) 
Life threatening 
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of de ath from the AE as it  
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the pr oduct would result in the patient’s  
death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in  a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without he patic failure). 
Hospitalisation 
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a se rious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital ad missions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in decidin g whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediatel y life threatening or result in 
death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopar dize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  
These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an im portant medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. 
x Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requirin g iv hydrocortisone 
treatment 
x Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose r equiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm 
x Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood tr ansfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation 
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
12.2 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question 
When making an assessment of causality consider the following f actors when deciding if there 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
120(127) is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused b y the drug.  
x Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually  received the 
suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relatio nship to the 
administration of the suspect drug? 
x Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with  the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
x De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopp ing or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug? 
x No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or envi ronmental factors. 
x Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected dr ug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not n ormally 
recommend or support a re-challenge. 
x Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if perfo rmed) has confirmed 
the relationship. 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
x Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? 
x Is there a known mechanism? 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the rel evant data, there is evidence for a  
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the ind ividual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to c onvey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available da ta including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insuf ficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not r elated’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

DOCUMENT 
13.1 Labelling and Shipment of Biohazard Samples 
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classif ies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories.  For transport purposes the classification of infec tious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) i n the 46th edition (2005).  
Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt.  There 
is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B. 
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-thr eatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus: 
x Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instructio n 602. 
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatiti s A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are ass igned the following UN 
number and proper shipping name: 
x UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B 
x are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens  
x Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt unde r IATA regulations 
x Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported  at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging  
x Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional da ngerous goods

14. APPENDIX C ALGORITHM ON MANAGEMENT OF 
SUSTAINED ELEVATED LIVER SAFETY ABNORMALITIES 
14.1 Algorithm on Management of Sustained Elevated Liver Safety 
Abnormalities 
The monitoring for liver safety will be performed using the ser um levels of AST, ALT and TB 
(see Figure 1  Sustained elevated liver safety abnormalities flow chart). 
Patients with a central laboratory ALT and/or AST >3 X ULN  will be scheduled for a 
follow-up visit within 3 days following receipt of the initial laboratory results, to obtain repeat 
central laboratory ALT, AST, TB and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALK-P ). In the event that the 
repeat laboratory assessments cannot be obtained within 3 days,  the Investigator is encouraged 
to discuss possible alternatives with the Sponsor. Patients sho uld remain on study medication 
until confirmatory results are obtained, unless otherwise contr aindicated. 
x If the repeat ALT and AST are ≤ 3X ULN, patient should continue study 
treatment according to their original visit schedule unless oth erwise contraindicated. 
x If the repeat ALT and/or AST are >3X ULN but ≤ 8X ULN and TB ≤ 2X ULN, 
the patient’s medical history, including details of risk factor s for liver diseases,  
should be evaluated for potential underlying aetiologies. In ad dition, specialized  
blood sampling will be performed to evaluate liver function as well as identify  
potential causes of laboratory elevation(s). The Investigator s hould continue to  
monitor the patient’s liver tests every 3 days following receip t of the prior  
laboratory results until the ALT and AST are ≤ 2X ULN or until ALT and AST are  
at or below baseline levels. The frequency of retesting can dec rease to once a week  
or less if abnormalities stabilize and the patient is asymptoma tic. Patients should  
remain on study medication unless confirmatory results indicate  that a criterion for  
discontinuation has been met or continuing study medication wou ld be otherwise  
contraindicated.  
14.2 Patients must be Discontinued from the Study if an Initial and 
Repeat Confirmatory Laboratory Tests Meet any of the Following 
Criteria: 
x ALT and/or AST are > 3 x ULN and TB > 2 x ULN

123(127) x ALT and/or AST are >5 x ULN for > 14 consecutive days, at any t ime after initial 
confirmatory results 
x ALT and/or AST are >8 x ULN 
In each of these situations, study medication will be discontin ued, the Sponsor notified and the 
End of Treatment Visit performed within 3 days of the confirmed  laboratory results (see 
Section 3.10in the CSP). 
At the End of Treatment Visit, medical history including detail s of risk factors for liver 
diseases (if not previously assessed) will be requested and add itional blood sampling 
performed (Specialized Liver Panel and Liver Discontinuation Pa nel, see detailed below). 
Patient should also be scheduled for a Follow-up Visit (ie, pro cedures of Visit 10) 3 weeks 
after discontinuation of investigational product. A referral co nsultation to a hepatologist or 
gastroenterologist (specializing in liver abnormalities) should  be obtained. 
Any additional tests and/or examinations should be carried out at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Any further investigations and laboratory results  for patients with abnormal 
laboratory values at the Follow-up Visit should be made availab le to the Sponsor upon request. 
Additional information, including but not limited to completion  of supplemental eCRFs may 
be requested for certain adverse events and/or laboratory abnor malities which are 
reported/identified as part of the hepatic safety surveillance.  
Following the End of Treatment Visit, the Investigator should c ontinue to monitor the 
patient’s liver tests every 3 days following receipt of the pri or laboratory results unti l the ALT 
and AST are ≤2 x ULN or until ALT and AST are at or below basel ine levels. The frequency 
of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormaliti es stabilize and the patient is 
asymptomatic. 
14.3 Guidance on Assessment of Hepatic Laboratory Abnormalities 
The following is presented to assist in the evaluation and mana gement of hepatic laboratory 
values. It is not intended to supplant Investigators’ clinical judgment.  
Patients who experience ALT and/or AST values >3 x ULN confirme d with a repeated test 
will have the following performed within 3 days of the confirme d laboratory results: 
x AE assessment 
x Physical Examination for jaundice and other signs of liver dise ases 
x Review of relevant risk factors and current history focusing on  possible causes of 
the increased ALT and/or AST and/or TB, including: 
 Use of suspect concomitant medication [including over-the-count er (ie, 
acetaminophen/paracetamol), herbal and vitamin preparations]

 Recent unaccustomed physical exertion 
 Occupational or environmental exposure to hepatotoxins 
 Other conditions which may cause liver diseases or which may ca use abnormal 
test results 
x Specialized Liver Laboratory Panel (see below) 
14.4 Specialized Liver Panel 
For patients who are being monitored frequently as a result of confirmed AST and/or 
ALT >3X ULN, additional central laboratory tests will be perfor med within 3 days of receipt 
of confirmatory results. These laboratory tests will study the possible causes of the increased 
ALT and/or AST and/or TB, and may include, but are not limited to, the following tests: 
Hepatitis A IgM 
x Hepatitis BsAg 
x Hepatitis B Core Ab IgM 
x Hepatitis C virus RNA 
x Hepatitis C Ab 
x Hepatitis E IgM 
x Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) IgM Ab 
x Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 
x Gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) 
x Carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) 
x Prothrombin time (PT/INR) 
x Iron Panel - iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC)  
x Immunology Panel including Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), Anti-Smo oth Muscle 
Antibody (SMA) and Anti-Liver/Kidney Microsomal Antibody (Anti- LKM) 
x Anti-tissue Transglutaminase Antibody

125(127) 14.5 Liver Discontinuation Panel 
For patients who are discontinued from the study as a result of  sustained elevated liver safety 
abnormalities, additional central laboratory tests will be perf ormed at the time of End of 
Treatment Visit. Similar to the Specialized Liver Panel, these laboratory tests will study the 
possible causes of the increased ALT and/or AST and/or TB, and may include, but are not 
limited to, the following tests: 
x Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM Ab 
x Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 and 2 
x Ceruloplasmin 
x Toxoplasmosis 
x Alpha-1 antitrypsin

15.1 New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification 
The NYHA classification will be based on the following definiti ons: 
Class I  No limitation: Ordinary physical exercise does not cause undue fatigue, dyspno ea or palpitations. 
Class II Slight limitation of physical activity: 
Comfortable at rest but ordinary activity results in fatigue, p alpitations, dyspnoea. 
Class III Marked limitation of physical activity: 
Comfortable at rest but less than ordinary activity results in symptoms. 
Class IV Unable to carry out any physical activity without disc omfort: 
Symptoms of congestive heart failure are present even at rest w ith increased discomfort with any physical activity.

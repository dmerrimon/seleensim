BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Inflammation of the sinuses and nasal mucosa results in symptoms such as thick nasal mucus, tissue swelling, nasal congestion or obstruction, and pain and pressure in the face[1, 2]. Patients with sinus pain typically describe the quality of the pain as pressure[3]. Sinonasal inflammation can be caused by infection, allergies, air pollution, or structural problems in the nasal passages. Sinonasal inflammation is a common condition that affects all age groups and women are often more affected than men. Tivic Health Systems Inc. (the Sponsor) intends to introduce a new Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) device named ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief. The device relieves sinus pain by applying micro-amp electrical stimulation to facial nerves around the sinuses. i.e., the regions around the nose and the supraorbital region of the eye.

Description of the ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief Device ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief (Active Device) ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief is a handheld micro-current TENS device used for the temporary relief of sinus pain.  The device uses an average current that is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of previously cleared TENS devices used in the facial area. The design of ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief was optimized to provide transcutaneous nerve stimulation to the regional areas associated with the sinuses. The pear-shaped device is held in the hand, with the rounded tip of the device applied to the facial skin in the region of the sinus passages. The tip is the active electrode of a monopolar design. The housing of the device serves as the return electrode. The hand holding the device completes the electrical path.  When the user turns the device on and presses the tip to the skin, the device lights up and initiates a low-frequency, pulsed AC circuit that is maintained at a constant current. The device uses the current to calculate the impedance in the path between the tissue at the tip and the hand in contact with the device.

Conversely, when the impedance falls below the impedance threshold, the device enters a “Treatment” mode. The impedance threshold is calculated dynamically by an adaptive algorithm that incorporates the measured parameters of the individual user. The user is instructed to glide the tip of the device along the skin along the cheek, nose and under brow bone. When a low-impedance point is detected, the device signals the user via a slight haptic (vibration) feedback. The user is instructed to hold the device in place until the Treatment period has passed as indicated by cessation of the haptic indicator (approximately 7 seconds). Once the Treatment period ends, the device resets to Detection mode. The user is instructed to glide the device along an indicated path until reaching the next low-impedance area. The user may adjust the current setting of the device (low, medium, high) if they prefer more or less current intensity. The default setting for the device is low. 3. INDICATIONS FOR USE  The ClearUPTM Sinus Pain Relief device is to be used for the temporary relief of sinus pain.  4. STUDY OBJECTIVES To assess the feasibility of at-home use of ClearUP and collect data on the longitudinal safety and efficacy of ClearUP as a treatment for pain and congestion.  5. STUDY DESIGN This single-arm (N=30) open label study will be carried out at the Allergy and Asthma Associates of Santa Clara Valley Research Center (San Jose, CA) in collaboration with principle investigator Dr. Alan Goldsobel. Study subjects will be recruited from Dr. Goldsobel’s allergy practice and from the surrounding community. Eligible subjects will complete informed consent and be enrolled into the study.  Validated questionnaires will be used to quantify sinonasal symptoms including pain (numeric rating scale) and congestion (Congestion Quantifier 7), medication use, and user experience. Subjects will use the ClearUP device for five minutes during the study visit and then take the device home with them with instructions to use the device once daily and up to four times daily as needed, with each treatment lasting five minutes. Acute pain relief data will be collected after the first treatment (0-6 hours) and data on pain, congestion, and medication use will be collected weekly for four weeks. To facilitate a real-world pragmatic trial, subjects will be allowed to use medication during the study. Study visits will take place at enrollment and at 4 weeks.

Subject Screening  Subjects suffering from sinus pain will be invited to participate and will score their pain level using the numeric rating scale. If they meet the inclusion criteria of a pain score ≥ 5 they will be entered into a Subject Screening log and assigned a unique subject ID number starting with 201.  Using the ID number, subject information will be entered into a Subject Demographics log, the subject will sign an Informed Consent form, and the initial pain score will be recorded in the subject’s Enrollment Pain Data sheet. b. Randomization Subjects will not be randomized.  c. Study procedure After enrollment and informed consent procedures, subjects will fill out questionnaires related to demographics, sinus pain (numeric rating scale), congestion (congestion quantifier 7, nasal obstruction symptom evaluation), sinus symptoms (sinonasal outcome test 22), and medication use (medication diary). Then study subjects will read the instructions for use for ClearUP and self-administer a five minute treatment with the device.  Subjects will fill record their numeric rating scale for pain after the first treatment at the following timepoints: 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours. Subjects will be given the device and instructions for use and a study binder to take home with them.  They will be instructed to use the device once daily and up to four times daily as needed for the four week duration of the study.  Subjects will be asked to fill out the weekly questionnaires found in the study binder (see above Study Flow and Data Collection).  Text message reminders will be sent to use the device daily and to fill out questionnaires weekly.  At the four-week study visit, subjects will return their study devices, fill out questionnaires describing their symptoms in the final week of treatment, and respond to a questionnaire detailing their user experience. Compensation for the study will be $250 in the form of a Visa gift card.  d. Data analysis All data will be tabulated. The difference between the symptom scores before and after treatment will be computed for each individual in the study.   An appropriate two-sided statistical test (paired t-test or repeated measure one-way ANOVA) will be used to assess the pre and post differences in symptom severity.

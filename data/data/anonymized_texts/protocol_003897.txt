INTERTECC TRIAL  
 4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Gynecologic malignancies  are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women 
worldwide [ 1-2]. Many of these malignancies are attributable to human papillomavirus 
(HPV), the primary cause of cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, and anus. In North 
Ameri ca, endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in women, 
with over 50,000 new  cases annually. Often these disease present in later stages where 
surgical treatment alone is insufficient, and either adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or 
prima ry CRT is required.  
 
Locoregionally advanced gynecologic  malignancies are frequently treated with primary 
CRT. Multiple clinical trials have established concurrent CRT as a standard treatment 
approach for locally advanced cervical cancer [ 3-8]. Increasingl y, CRT has been used to 
treat advanced endometrial cancer as well.  However, w ith this approach, acute and late 
toxicity are significant pr oblems, while  the incidence of locoregional failure, distant 
metastasis, and cancer mortality remain high [ 3-10]. Therefore, strategies to reduce 
toxicity and permit treatment intensification are needed.  
 
4.2 Efficacy and Toxicity of Chemoradiation for Pelvic Cancers  
Multiple studies have established that intensifying both  concurrent and adjuvant CRT  
improves  treatment outcomes for pelvic malignancies  [9-12].   However , acute toxicity, 
particularly gastrointestinal (GI) and hematologic toxicity , are increased. Rates of high 
grade toxicity as high as 80% or more have been reported from multi -center trials [ 12].  
Methods to reduce toxicity of CRT , particularly gastrointestinal and hematologic  toxicity , 
could reduce barriers to intensifying chemotherapy and improve the therapeutic ratio of 
CRT. 
 
 4.3 Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy  
Conventional pelvic RT techniques often employ  opposed anterior -posterior / posterior -
anterior (AP/PA) and lateral fields, resulting in a box -shaped dose distribution that 
encompasses both targeted tissues (e.g. tumor, parametria, pelvic lymph nodes, etc.) 
and normal tissues (e. g., bowel, rectum, bladder, bone marrow, etc.). Field borders are 
frequently  defined based on standard bone landmarks rather than by expressly defined 
targets.  
 
Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a modern RT technique that differs from 
conventional techniques in many ways. First, patients undergo computed tomography 
(CT) simulation so that customized target volumes can be defined 3- dimensionally. 
IMRT treatment planning involves multiple beam angles and uses computerized inverse 
treatment planning optimization algorithms to identify dose distributions and intensity 
patterns that conform dose to the target, reducing radiation dose to surrounding tissues. 
IMRT delivery is typically accomplished with the use of multileaf collimators, which 
involve  small motorized leaflets (collimators) that move in and out of the beam path, 
modulating the dose intensity.  
 
Multiple studies in gynecologic cancer have shown that IMRT plans reduce dose to 
pelvic organs while maintaining acceptable target coverage [ 13-15]. Comparisons of 
IMRT to conventional treatments in patients have found reduced acute and late GI 
toxicity and hematologic toxicity with IMRT  [16-18]. Studies have also shown that IMRT 
plans can be optimized to intensively reduce normal tissue dose [ 13-15] and have 
established evidence- based guidelines for dosimetric planning to reduce toxicity [ 19-21]. 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 9 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 Validated predictive models indicate that optimized IMRT plans are clinically feasible and 
can be expected to decrease the rates of acute toxicity by approximately two- fold [ 21-
22]. Retrospective studies have also indicated that IMRT is associated with low acute 
and late toxicity and favorable long- term outcomes [ 23-25]. Prospective clinical trials of 
IMRT, however , are still limited. A prospective trial of IMRT for gynecologic cancer 
showed that IMRT is feasible in the multi -institutional setting for post -operative patients 
[26], with low toxicity. A small randomi zed trial of IMRT in India also found that toxicity 
was reduced with IMRT  [27].  
 
4.4 Quality of Life and Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Validated QOL measurements used in patients treated for cervical cancer have 
demonstrated that a considerable proportion of patients report debilitating functional 
compromise and psychosocial morbidity [ 28]. Studies hav e indicated that reducing pelvic 
radiation dose in women with endometrial cancer reduces urinary incontinence, diarrhea, 
and fecal leakage, leading to fewer limitations in daily activities [ 29-30]. However, 
detailed studies of the  effect of IMRT on QOL in  gynecologic  cancer patients are  
lacking, particularly in the international setting. Longitudinal assessments of QOL and 
key functions such as activ ities of daily living, bowel and urinary habits, psychosocial 
function, and sexual function are included as sec ondary end points of this study.  
 
We will explore the impact of IMRT on QOL using several validated QOL instruments: the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -C30 form 
and the disease site- specific module QLQ -CX24. The 30- item EORTC QOL 
questionnaire (QLQC 30) is a psychometrically robust, cross -culturally accepted 
questionnaire that was designed to be applicable to a broad spectrum of cancer patients 
as a core questionnaire [ 31]. The form has been translated into many languages 
including English, Mandarin, Hindi, Thai, Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, Korean, Spanish, 
Turkish, and Vietnamese. Previous studies have shown that, despite regional variations 
in responses that need to be considered, the QLQ -C30 is suitable for use in a wide 
variety of countries and settings [ 32].  
 
The QLQ -CX24 is a validated and reliable psychometric module consisting of 3 multi -
item scales and 5 single -item scales. It is characterized by high internal consistency, 
good compliance and fast completion with no or minimal assistance [ 33]. Cross -cultural 
studies in Asian samples, for example, have found the module to be a reliable and valid 
measure of  QOL [34 -35]. The module has been translated into many languages 
including English, Mandarin, Hindi, Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, Korean, and Spanish.  
 
4.5 Image -Guided Bone Marrow -Sparing IMRT   
Hematologic toxicity (HT) is a key barrier to intensifying chem oradiotherapy in 
patients with pelvic malignancies. It is well -known that both radiation and chemotherapy 
are myelosuppressive, but the extent to which pelvic radiation contributes to HT in 
patients undergoing CRT is unknown. Radiation causes apoptosis of bone marrow (BM) 
and peripheral blood stem cells and BM stromal damage, resulting in myelosuppression 
and characteristic pathologic and radiographic BM changes [ 36-38]. BM stem cells are 
exquisitely sensitive to low doses of radiation [ 39]. Older c linical studies have shown that 
radiation BM injury depends on both radiation dose and volume of BM irradiated [ 40-42]. 
CT-based IMRT plans can be optimized to reduce BM irradiation [ 14-15], but the large 
avoidance volume constrains IMRT plan optimization. R efinin g IMRT plans to focus on 
sparing BM subregions may therefore be a more effective strategy. Previous studies 
have shown that functional imaging can help optimize IMRT plans to spare active BM 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 10 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 [43-47]. However, the locations of BM subregions most important f or sparing remain 
unknown, and studies investigating functional BM imaging are needed to optimally 
design BM -sparing IMRT plans.  
We have implemented functional imaging to identify “active” BM subregions for 
avoidance. It is known from pathology and imaging studies that BM is comprised of 
subregions of hematopoeitically active, fat -poor, “red” BM and inactive, fat -rich, “yellow” 
marrow [48- 52]. Red BM contains approximately 40% fat, 40% water, and 20% protein; 
yellow BM contains approximately 80% fat, 15% w ater, and 5% protein [48]. Up to  50% 
of the body’s red BM may be located in the pelvis and lumbar spine [53] and thus 
contained within conventional RT ports. These active and inactive regions cannot be 
distinguished on computed tomography (CT) [54- 55], whi ch is the principal imaging 
modality used for RT planning. Functional imaging studies indicate that active BM tends 
to be concentrated particularly in vertebral and ilial subregions [44- 46,49]. These regions 
co-localize with regions which, by MRI studies, show longer T1 relaxation times and 
longer T2 indicative of red vs. yellow BM [48]. Reducing dose specifically to active 
subregions of pelvic BM may be beneficial, but the precise location of active BM 
subregions, variation in active BM distribution between individuals, and relationship 
between toxicity and radiation dose to these active BM regions are all unknown.  
 [18F] -deoxyfluorothymidine (18F-FLT) is an effective PET imaging tracer for 
proliferating BM. FLT is a DNA precursor that is phosphorylated and sequestered 
intracellularly by the enzyme thymidine kinase 1 [ 56], which is active during DNA 
synthesis, leading to specific tracer uptake in proliferating tissues [ 57]. Hayman et al. 
showed was useful for in vivo  measurements of proliferating BM [ 58]. Se veral studies 
have noted decreased tracer uptake in BM after irradiation with doses as low as 2 Gy, 
and complete absence of uptake after 10 -20 Gy [ 57,59-61]. 18F-FLT appears superior to 
18F-FDG for BM imaging, due to the inability of 18F-FDG to discriminat e between 
proliferating cells and metabolically active non- proliferating cells [ 58,62-63].  Recently a 
study found that increased radiation to BM sub- regions with higher 18F-FDG -PET activity 
was associated with increased HT [ 64], supporting the hypothesis that reducing dose to 
active subregions could mitigate HT. In this protocol, we will test the hypothesis that BM -
sparing IMRT plans designed to avoid active subregions identified by PET can reduce 
HT. This technique could improve patients’ tolerance to che motherapy and increase the 
therapeutic ratio of CRT for pelvic malignancies in general.  
 
4.6 Restriction Spectrum Imaging  
     Diffusion- weighted MRI (DW -MRI) has been intensively studied in cervical cancer for 
both diagnostic and prognostic utility. DW -MRI quantifies water diffusion within tissues, 
highlighting differences between normal tissue and tumors.  Tumors generally have 
higher cellular density and higher N/C ratio, which restricts water diffusion more than in 
normal tissue. A measure called the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a commonly 
used indicator of water diffusion detected with DW -MRI, and the ADC is often lower in 
tumors than surrounding normal tissue. Multiple studies have shown the utility of DW -
MRI for diagnosis, prognosis, and evalua tion of response to therapy.  For example, Lin et 
al. showed that change in ADC was associated with reduced tumor size in response to 
therapy, showing the promise of DW -MRI as an imaging biomarker. An important 
limitation of standard DW -MRI, however, is its inability to distinguish tumor 
hypercellularity from other causes of altered water diffusion, such as inflammation or 
hemorrhage. Moreover, standard diffusion imaging can have poor contrast resolution, 
and all MR diffusion imaging is susceptible to lar ge anatomic distortion from ever -
present inhomogeneity (or non -uniformity) in the MRI system’s magnetic field. As a 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 11 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 result, image quality is too poor to make DW -MRI useful for radiation therapy planning or 
for assessing response to therapy.  
     In contrast, Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) is a highly novel MRI technique 
developed at U CSD for cancer imaging (Figure ). The chief advantage of RSI over DW -
MRI is that it provides better functional information about tumors, particularly cellularity, 
with superior image contrast. Additionally, the anatomic distortion is removed from the 
RSI images by accounting for the magnetic field inhomogeneity, a critical step for 
accurately locating tumors. Unlike PET, the RSI technique delivers no ionizing radiation 
to pa tients, and may improve resolution over PET. Certain refractory tumors retain high 
cellularity after treatment. RSI is likely  to be a useful technique to determine response to 
therapy, and to identify patients who are not responding well  earlier in the course of 
treatment than can be done with standard imaging methods. The use of RSI in cervical 
cancer is completely novel, and there are no published studies of it in this context.

4.7 Knowledge -Based Planning  
Our research group has developed mathematical models to detect sub -optimal 
IMRT plans with high sensitivity and specificity, using a process termed Knowledge-
Based Planning (KBP) [43]. This system is built to identify optimal plans amongst prior 
training c ohorts, and use the resulting model to develop predictive dose- volume 
histograms (pDVH) for organs -at-risk (OARs) that give precise quantitative information 
on plan quality deficiencies. This approach will allow us to identify, quantify, and 
ultimately cor rect sub -optimal treatment plans, a process that is ideally suited for 
application to quality control in the multi -center clinical trial setting, particularly when new 
technologies or implementations are being introduced.

8.1.1  Pre-Registration Requirements for IMRT 
In order to register patients on this study, the institution must provide baseline physics 
information and an anonymized case study, including all contours and a sample 
treatment plan (“Dry Run”). For instructions on pre- registration requirements, contact the 
study PI ( lmell@ucsd.edu ) or the Physics Chair (kevinmoore@ucsd.edu).   
An IMRT phantom study may be required to be eligib le to register patients. Institutions 
will be notified with further instructions if they are required to submit a phantom study. 
Instructions for requesting and irradiating the phantom will be available at the 
Radiological Physics Center (RPC) at MD Anders on Cancer Center website 
(http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc )  
 
8.1.2  Central Review  
All external beam treatment plans  will be centrally reviewed at UC San Diego  to 
determine protocol compliance ( section 9.9).  
 
8.2 Registration  
8.2.1  Screening Procedures  
Diagnostic or laboratory studies will be performed  to determine eligibility. Studies or 
procedures that were performed for clinical indications or as standard of care (not 
exclusively to determine study eligibility)  may be used for baseline values , even if the 
studies were done before informed consent was obtained, provided they occur within the 
proper window . 
 
8.2.2  Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures .. Each institution 
should customize the consent form according to their institutional requirements . The 
investigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments involved 
and their attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will be 
carefully explained to the subject and a signed informed consent will be obtained. 
Documentation of informed consent (e.g. scanned record) will  be transmitted to UC San 
Diego via the secure FTP server.   
 
8.2.3  Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited at participating centers by local investigators.  
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 15 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
  
8.2.4  Registration Procedures  
Patients will be registered through UC San Diego’s Velos system .  Each participating 
site will be given a Velos account username and password. Eligible patient s will be  
assigned a case number  and study arm  through this system .  Velos will contain the data 
submission calendar including all data forms, images, and reports and the dates on 
which they are due.

9.2 Simulation  
All patients should be simulated according to the criteria below for this protocol.  
 
9.2.1  Bladder and Bowel Preparation  
The degree of bladder and rectal fullness should be made to duplicate that which 
is anticipated for daily treatment, i.e., if the patient is instructed to maintain a full 
bladder for treatment, she should be simulated as such. It is recommended to 
use a consistent bladder filling state (e.g. always full or always empty) for 
simulation and treatment. It is recommended for patients not to be s imulated or 
treated with a full rectum as this may result in irreproducible setup. Bowel 
preparatory agents (enema, stool softeners, etc.) may be applied at the 
discretion of the physician. If a full rectum is noted on the simulation study it is 
recommended that the patient undergo a new simulation scan.  
 
9.2.2  Contrast and Markers  
Intravenous contrast is recommended unless medically contraindicated. Oral 
contrast is optional. A radio- opaque cervical marker may be placed in the apex of 
the vagina to assist with target delineation and is optional. Implanted fiducials are 
optional.  
 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 16 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 9.2.3  Position  
Simulation will be done in the supine position.  
 
9.2.4  Immobilization  
All subjects will have a customized immobilization device (e.g., Alpha Cradle or 
Vac-Lok) fabricated at the time of simulation.   
 
9.2.5  Imaging  
All subjects should undergo a CT (or PET/CT) simulation scan using a slice 
thickness of 2.5- 3.0 mm and large fi eld-of-view pelvic protocol.  CT scans should 
be obtained from the T12 vertebral body to 5 cm below the ischial tuberosities .  
 
9.2.6 Isocenter placement  
Isocenter placement is left to discretion of treating physician, however,  it is 
recommended to place the isocenter along the patient’s midline 1.5 cm caudal to 
the inferior  border of the sacroiliac joint . 
 
 
9.3 Normal Tissue Delineation   
 9.3.1 General  
Normal tissues will be contoured on the simulation scan. The tissue within the skin 
surface and outside all other critical normal structures and the PTV is  designated as 
unspecified tissue.  
 
 All patients will have the following normal tissues delineated for this trial:  
 
9.3.2 Bowel  
The bowel will be contoured beginning from the axial slice situated 1 cm superior to the 
superior -most slice containing PTV (if bowel is not present at this level, the bowel 
contour will start from its most superior extent), and will continue to its most inferior 
extent in the pelvis.  The outermost extent of the bowel loops will  be outlined on each 
axial CT slice, as described in the literature [22]. Individual loops of bowel should not be 
contoured separately. Rectum should be contoured separately from bowel . An 
instructional video can be viewed  at https://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/som/radiation-
medicine/research/clinical -translational/clinical -
trials/intertecc/protocol/Pages/Vi deos.aspx .  
 
9.3.3 Rectum  
The outer rectal wall will be contoured and filled in, treating the organ as a solid 
continuous structure, and will be defined from the level of the sigmoid flexure to the 
anus.   
 
9.3.4 Bladder  
The outer bladder wall will be contoured and filled in, treating the organ as a solid 
continuous structure.    
 
9.3.5 Pelvic Bone Marrow  (PBM)  
The outer bone contour will be delineated and filled in, treating the bone marrow as a 
solid continuous structure. The regions contoured will include the os coxae, L4 and L5 
vertebral bodies , entire sacrum, acetabulae, and proximal femora. The superior extent of 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 17 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 the bone marrow contour should be at the level of the superior border of L4  or the iliac 
crest, whichever is more superior. The caudal -most extent of the bone marrow contour 
should be at the level of the ischial tuberosities. For examples see Mell et al. [ 20], Figure 
3. An instructional video can be viewed at https://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/som/radiation-
medicine/research/clinical -translational/clinical -
trials/intertecc/protocol/Pages/Videos.aspx . 
 
9.3.6 Femoral Heads  
The outer contours of the femoral heads will be delineated and filled in, treating each as 
a solid continuous structure. Do not include the femoral neck.   
 
9.3.7 Active  Bone Marrow  (ABM)  
Active  BM (ABM) will be a subset of the entire Pelvic BM (PBM) volume (delineated in 
9.2.3.5).  ABM will be defined as the subregion with a standardized uptake value (SUV) 
greater than the mean value over the BM volume. Automatic segmentation using 
commercially available software can be used to define ABM . The f unctional imaging 
technique will be either FDG -PET or FLT -PET depending on availability of funding for 
FLT-PET. This volume can be generated locally or (for patients on Arm A) the ABM can 
be generated centrally at UCSD and supplied to the treating site after the DICOM data 
has been transmitted.  
 
9.4 Target Delineation  
9.4.1  General  
For patients treated with conventional techniques, 3 -D planning with target delineation 
according to the criteria below is suggested , but not required. If target delineation i s not 
performed, follow the guidelines for blocking outlined in section 9.5.3.  
 
9.4.2  Image fusion 
Pelvic MRI and/or PET fusion is encouraged  to aid clinical target  volume delineation. 
Fusion should be optimized to match the MRI / PET scan to the treatment  position. The 
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and normal tissues will 
be contoured on all CT slices in which the structures exist. The definition of all volumes 
will be in accordance with the 1993 ICRU Report #50: Prescribing, Recording and 
Reporting Photon Beam Therapy 
(http://www.icru.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72 ).  
 
9.4.3 Definition of Target Volumes and Margins  
 
It is strongly recommended that investigators read guidelines for contouring target 
volumes [ 66-69]. A visual demonstration of target delineation procedure can also be 
viewed or downloaded from https://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/som/radiation -

 and superior third of the vagina (or half of 
the vagina, if the vagina is clinically 
involved). CTV3 will include the common, 
external, and internal iliac and presacral 
lymph nodes. It is acceptable for CTV1, 
CTV2, and/or CTV3 to overlap each other. 
The upper border of the CTV3 should not 
extend above the confluence of the common 
iliac arteries with the aorta (i.e., aortic 
bifurcation), and should begin no lower than 
superior border of L5. The nodal CTV 
(CTV3) will be obtained by ensuring an 
approximately 7 mm margin around the 
vessels, plus extension to include any 
adjacent visible lymph nodes, lymphoceles, 
or pertinent surgical clips. The presacral 
nodes should be contoured until the superior 
border of the S3 vertebral body is reached; 
below this point the nodal volume can be 
separated into two structures. The external 
iliac nodes should be contoured to the 
superior aspect of the femoral head. CTV3 
should be modified to exclude bone, muscle, 
and bowel. The CTV should not extend 
inferior to the ischial tuberosit ies.

9.5 Treatment Planning  and Delivery  
9.5.0 General   
The experimental arm (Arm A) will be treated with image- guided bone marrow sparing 
IMRT ( section 9.5.4.4.2 ). Standard radiation therapy (Arm B) will consist either of a 
conventional 4- field box technique (section 9.5.3 ) or non -bone marrow sparing IMRT 
(section 9. 5.4.4.1 ). Bone  marrow will not be used as an avoidance structure in 
treatment planning for patients assigned to Arm B .  
 
9.5.1  Photon Energy  
All treatment  plans must use 6- 18 MV photons. Heterogeneity corrections should be 
applied.  
 
9.5.2  Setup Verification  
For patients treated with conventional techniques, MV portal verification is required at 
least weekly.  For patients treated with IMRT, s keletal imaging (e.g., kV imaging and/or 
CBCT) must be performed daily  to verify setup accuracy.   
 
For patients undergoing CBCT with each fraction, a t the time of simulation, the isocenter 
should be placed along the patient’s midline 1.5 cm caudal to the inferior border of the 
sacroiliac joint.  Patients will undergo CBCT acquisition prior to each fraction, for a total 
of 25 scans. CBCTs should be obtained in half -fan mode, using 125kV, 80mA, and 
25ms/frame. If a marked discrepancy is observed between the patient’s imaged anatomy 
on the day of treatment versus the day of simulation, at the treating physician’s 
discretion, the patient may be taken down off the machine (e.g., to void the bladder or 
rectum) and may be treated later that same day. If the anatomical discrepancy is still 
present, the treating physician may elect to postpone treatment , and re -simulation be fused to generate the PTV. If the ITV 
approach is used,  PTV4 should be fused 
with PTV1 -PTV3 to generate PTV_4500.

 should be considered.  
 
9.5.3 Conventional Radiation Therapy  (Arm B only ) 
9.5.3.1 Field Ar rangement  
Conventional RT consist ing of a 4- field “box” arrangement using opposed AP/PA 
and lateral fields  is allowed for patients randomized to Arm B . For conventional 
RT, it is permissible to use bone landmarks to draw field borders or to use 3- D 
planning with explicit targeting as outlined above, using customized blocking to 
encompass the PTV. If explicit targeting is used, follow the target coverage 
requirements in 9.5.3.4. If bone landmarks are used, use the following portals:  
 
  • Superior border: L4 -5 
  • Lateral border: 1- 2 cm lateral to the border of the true pelvis  
• Inferior border: Obturator foramen or 4 cm inferior to vaginal cuff,  
whichever is lower  
• Anterior border: line from pubic symphysis to 1 cm anterior to common  
iliac nodes at L4 -5 
  • Posterior border: draw border posterior to or splitting the sacrum from  
S1-S4 
• Custom blocking to shield femoral heads. Do not block the obturator foramen or 
within 1 cm of the common iliac nodes  
 
9.5.3.2 Prescription Dose 
The initial prescription dose will be 45.0  Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions to the PTV.  
PTV_boost (if defined) may receive an additional 9.0- 14.4 Gy, either with 
conventional techniques or IMRT, at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
9.5.3.3 Normal Tissue  Const raints and Compliance Criteria 
No criteria for normal structure doses are applied for Conventional RT.  
 
9.5.3.4 Target Volume Constraints and Compliance Criteria 
If 3-D planning is used, create  the volume CTV_4500 as the union of CTV1, 
CTV2, and CTV3, and use the following guidelines:  
 
 
 
9.5.4 General Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy  Criteria  (Arm A or B ) 
 
9.5.4.1 Beam arrangement  
IMRT  plans may include static field arrangements (e.g. 5- 9 fields), modulated arc 
therapy, or Tomotherapy. Pseudo -step wedge techniques are also permitted.  
 
9.5.4 .2 Prescription dose  
For sequential boost plans or plans with no nodal boost, t he initial prescription 
dose will be 45.0  Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions to the PTV.  PTV_boost (if defined) may 
receive an additional 9.0 -14.4 Gy, with IMRT, at the discretion of the treating Name of

For simultaneous integrated boost technique, the primary PTV should be treated 
to 47.6 Gy in 1.7 Gy fractions (28 fractions) and PTV_boost should be treated to 
59.4 Gy in 2.12 Gy fractions (28 fractions). At the discretion of the treating 
radiation oncologist, the fraction size to PTV_boost may be reduced as low as 
1.93 Gy (i.e., total dose 54.0 Gy), in order not to overdose adjacent bowel  or 
other critical normal structures.  
 
If a pseudo -step wedge technique is used, the central pelvis (i.e., PTV1) should 
receive 20 Gy, with the remainder of dose to the central pelvis delivered via 
brachytherapy. Cervical cancer primaries should be boosted using intracavitary 
brachytherapy (see section 9. 6), unless the patient refuses or is otherwise unable 
to undergo brachytherapy  or is treated at a center without access to 
brachytherapy  (see section 9.8) .

9.5.5 Parametrial Boost  
Parametrial boost is optional according to the discretion of the treating physician.  
In this case either brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy (e.g., opposed anterior -
posterior field arrangements with appropriate blocking, to a total dose of 8.0- 14.4 Gy in 
4-8 daily fractions) is acceptable.  
 
9.5.6 Re-planning 
Re-planning (such as to account for changes in tumor volume) is allowed. If re- planning 
is necessary, the new treatment plan should meet the same criteria as the initial plan, as 
if the new plan were delivered for the entire treatment course (i.e., 25 or 28 fractions). 
The new treatment plan should be submitted for central review according to the same 
process as the initial plan.  
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 23 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
  
9.6 Brachytherapy  
9.6.1 General  
Either low dose rate (LDR) or high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is permitted 
according to each institution’s standard. Either standard (point -directed) or 
volume- directed brachytherapy techniques are permitted according to each 
institution’s standard. For  institutions wishing to implement pulse dose rate 
(PDR), please contact the study P.I. Interstitial brachytherapy may be used to 
treat disease that cannot be adequately treated with intracavitary treatment. 
External beam radiation and brachytherapy may not be administered on the 
same day. It is recommended to start brachytherapy after delivery of at least 39.6 
Gy of external beam RT.  
 
Iridium -192 should be used for HDR brachytherapy and Cs -137 should be used 
for LDR brachytherapy.   
 
In general,  HDR insert ions should be separated by a minimum of 24  hours and 
no more than 3 insertions should be performed per week.  
 
For volume- directed brachytherapy, a pelvic MRI ( ≤ 5 mm slice thickness) should 
be acquired with either the first or second insertion.  
 
9.6.2 Target and Normal Tissue Delineation (for volume- directed brachytherapy)  
The following targets and organs at risk (OAR) will be contoured at each 
insertion, according to the GEC ESTRO Recommendations [81- 82]. The MRI 
based target delineation can be reused by  superimposition in the process of 
contouring on CT, if for subsequent fractions of brachytherapy only CT can be 
used with the applicator in place. No planning margins will be added to the CTV.  
 
• GTVB: Macroscopic tumor (if present) at time of brachytherapy  
 
• High risk target (HR- CTV): GTVB + whole cervix + presumed extra 
cervical tumor extension  
 
• Point -A (left and right)  - Measure 2 cm along the intrauterine tandem 
from the cervical os or flange of the tandem and 2 cm laterally in the 
plane of the in tracavitary system.  
 
• Bladder (the outer bladder wall is contoured)  
 
• Rectum (the outer rectal wall is contoured from above the anal sphincter 
to the level of transition into the sigmoid)  
 
• Sigmoid (the outer sigmoid wall is to be contoured from the recto-
sigmoid flexure to 2 cm superior to the parametria and the uterus  
 
• ICRU bladder point  
 
• ICRU rectal point  
 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 24 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 9.6.3  Prescription Dose and Fractionation  
For HDR, p ermissible dose/fractiona tion schemes are:  
 • 5.5 Gy x 6 fractions  
• 5.5 Gy x 5 fractions  
• 6.0 Gy x 5 fractions  
• 6.0 Gy x 6 fractions  
• 7.0 Gy x 3 fractions  
• 7.0 Gy x 4 fractions  
• 7.0 Gy x 5 fractions  
• 7.5 Gy x 3 fractions   
  
For LDR, 35- 40 Gy (80- 85 Gy total in EQD2, α /β=3, T1/2 = 1.5 hours) will be 
delivered to point A in 1- 2 insertions. If 2 insertions are used they should be 
separated by a minimum of 7 and maximum of 21 days.  
 
For volume- directed brachytherapy, the following dose- volume criteria for HR -
CTV should be met:  
 
EBRT + Volume -directed Brachytherapy  
Note : Dose to HR -CTV  is cumulative EQD2 ( α/β=3, T 1/2 = 1.5 hours ).

INTERTECC TRIAL  
 Note : Doses to critical structures are cumulative EQD2 ( α/β=3, T 1/2 = 1.5 hours ). If CT is used 
for planning it is recommended to keep the maximum bowel dose < 25% of the brachytherapy 
prescription dose.  
 
For point -directed brachytherapy, the dose to points A and B, the rectal reference point dose, 
bladder reference point dose, and vag inal surface reference point dose, and central axis isodose 
curve must be calculated and reported. Please f ollow  the definitions in ICRB 38. 
 
For volume -directed brachytherapy, uniform dose volume reporting according to the G EC 
ESTRO guidelines is required . For each fraction the following parameters should be recorded:  
• TRAK  
• D100 for GTV, CTV  
• D90 for GTV, CTV  
• D50 for CTV  
• V100 for CTV  
• D2cc of the bladder, rectum and sigmoid, (converted to EQD2 doses per formula  
EQD2= D X [(d + α/β)/ (2 + α/β )]); use α /β=3.  
• ICRU bladder and ICRU rectal point s  
 
9.7 Radical IMRT for boost therapy  
Use of fractionated IMRT in place of brachytherapy to boost gross cervical cancer is 
considered a protocol deviation and is strongly discouraged. If deemed necessary or 
essential for the patient’s care (e.g., if a patient refuses brachytherapy), please notify the 
study PI.  
 
9.8 Stereotactic Boost Radiotherapy  
Patients treated at centers without access to brachytherapy or w ho otherwise are poor 
candidates for brachytherapy (e.g., refusal, medical comorbidities, etc.) should undergo 
SBRT with 5 fractions of 6 Gy prescribed to the high -risk CTV, with dose constraints 
identical to those for high dose rate, volume- direc ted brachytherapy (see section 9.6.3) . 
In this case it is recommended that the patient undergo arc therapy with a minimum of 
two arcs, and that on- line kV CBCT be used to verify the isocenter prior to each arc 
delivery. Patients should be resimulated for SBRT boost  planning.  
 
9.9 Protocol Compliance and Quality Assurance Review  
Quality assurance to verify protocol compliance will be performed by the protocol review 
committee at the UC San Diego . For instructions on data transfer, contact the study PI 
(lmell@ucsd.edu) or the Physics Chair (kevinmoore@ucsd.edu).  
 
External beam treatment plans should be submitted no later than 45 days  following 
completion of treatment. Criteria for IG-BMS -IMRT protocol compliance are listed below.

9.10 Treatment Modifications  
Modification of the radiotherapy protocol is  admissible if necessary in the opinion of the 
treating physician in order to ensure patient safety, but the rationale should be 
documented and communicated to the study P.I. Physicians may consider holding 
treatment for ANC <500/mm3, platelets < 20,000 mm3, febrile neutropenia, or 
uncontrolled bleeding. No radiation dose reductions are allowed, however . Treatment 
may be resumed upon resolution of neutropenia (ANC ≥500/mm3), thrombocytopenia 
(platelets ≥ 20,000 mm3), and febrile neutropenia (temperature<38.0º  C).

15.0 PATIENT SAFETY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1 Informed Consent  
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 30 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 Written informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures.  
 
15.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
All expected adverse events will be documented on the Symptom and Toxicity 
Evaluation Form (STEF). Any unsuspected or confirmed unanticipated adverse event 
should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the study principal investigator 
(lmell@ucsd.edu ) and Data Safety Monitoring Committee via the INTERTECC main 
email (irtoc@ucsd.edu) . This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for  
adverse events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute for reporting of  unanticipated 
serious adverse events (SAE). A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). Unanticipated 
SAE information will be collected, documented, and reported comprehensively starting 
with entry into the study and continuing through  1 month post treatment . SAEs will be 
reported to the study principal investigator, the patient’s institution’s IRB, and the Data 
Safety and Monitoring Committee . This reporting will include a description of the event, 
the subject’s study identification number, severity of the event, and its suspected cause. 
This form will include timing, severity and perceived causation of the events and followed 
until they either stabilize or resolve.  
 
15.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event is Reported in an Expedited Manner  
Step 1: Identify the type of adverse event using the CTCAE v4.   The CTCAE v4 provides 
descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed.  A copy of the 
CTCAE v4 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ).  Additi onally, if assistance is needed, the NCI 
has an Index to the CTCAE v4 that provides help for classifying and locating terms.   
 
 Step 2:  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.  
 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
Unrelated, Unlikely Related, Possibly Related, Probably Related, and Definitely 
Related.  
Note :  This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last day of 
protocol treatment.  Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last day of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the treatment must 
also be reported according to the instructions above.  
 
Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  Expected events are 
those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the 
treatment.  An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting 
purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:  
 
• the current known adverse events listed in the STEF of this protocol ;  
• the investigator’s brochure or the drug package insert  
 
 Step 5:  Review Section 15.2 to determine if:  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.  
 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 31 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
  15.4 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adve rse Events  
The investigator will report all unexpected SAEs that are determined to be possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the research within 10 working days of learning of the 
event to both the principal investigator ( lmell@ucsd.edu ) and the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee  via the INTERTECC main email (irtoc@ucsd.edu) .  
 
Toxicities from Experimental Treatment  
• Death on Study -  regardless of cause: Written Report  
• Grade 4 anaphylaxis: Written report  
• All other expected toxicities, grades 1 -4: Report in Continuing Review.  
 
15.5 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
a) Unacceptable toxicity  requiring removal from study . 
b) Non-compliance that in the opinion of the investigator does not allow for ongoing 
participation.  
c) Physician determines it is in the subject’s best interest.  
d) Patient refusal of protocol therapy  
 
15.6 Criteria for Removal from Study  
a) Loss to follow -up. 
b) Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission.  
 
 15.7 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The INTERTECC Data and Safety Monitoring Board  will assume the responsibility for 
the data and safety monitoring. Monitoring will be conducted remotely by review of 
electronically submitted eligibility forms, consents, primary endpoint data, and treatment 
plans. On- site audits by members of the DSMB will also be conducted at least once for 
each collaborating site, to review sample charts for registered subjects. All adverse 
events will be reported to the IRB in  accordance with regulations. Confidentiality of data 
will be maintained through subject de- identified numbers, the use of locked cabinets to 
store paper records , and a secure database which is maintained at the Moores UC San 
Diego  Cancer Center.  
 
Study data will be collected and managed using Velos  electronic data capture tools 
hosted at the Clinical and Translational Research Institute at UC San Diego. Velos  is a 
secure, web- based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research 
studies. Velos  provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with data validation); 2) 
audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) au tomated export 
procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, 
Stata, R); 4) procedures for importing data from external sources; 5) tools for on- the-fly 
generation of plots, descriptive statistics, and reports for study m onitoring and quality 
assurance; and 6) advanced features, such as branching logic and calculated fields. 
Creation of the forms via Velos  web interface will be conducted by Dr. Mell in 
conjunction with the Clinical and Translational Research Institute (CTR I) Biostati stics 
team at UC San Diego.  
 
15.8 Confidentiality Procedures 
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 32 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 All acquired data will be stored at UC San Diego on a secure password- protected server 
with access limited to the principal investigator, co -investigators, clinical trial coordinator, 
and authorized personnel (e.g., post -doctoral researchers, etc.). The database will be 
de-identified by removing subjects' names and only maintaining the subjects' medical 
record numbers as a unique identifier. Similarly, data acquired locally at each 
participating institution will be stored on a secure password- protected server with access 
limited to the site principal investigator, co- investigators, and authorized personnel. 
Deliberations and recommendations of the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee are  
strictly confidential. Each member of the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee must 
sign a statement of confidentiality.   
 
15.9 Oversight of Other Centers and Dissemination of Information  
  
Whenever there is an adverse event reported or a protocol amendment or change in the 
consent form or interim results or other information that may impact the risks to subjects 
or others, the study PI and/or coordinator at UC San Diego  will notify all the institution’s 
PI’s and study coordinators via email.  
 
16.0 STATIST ICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1 Definition of Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is progression- free survival (PFS). Patients will be 
randomized in a 3:2 ratio favoring the experimental arm. Unequal randomization is justified 
based on the “learning curve” argument as described by Dumville et al. [76].  Event time 
is calculated as the time from randomization to the date of first evidence of disease 
progression or death due  to any cause. Event t imes will be censored for surviving patients 
if there is no evidence of disease progression at the latest follow -up assessment or if the 
patient is lost to follow -up. If a new therapeutic course for cervical cancer is initiated after 
completing protocol therapy without documented evidence of progression, a progression 
event will be considered to have occurred at the time the therapeutic course is initiated.  
 
Prior data indicate that the median time  to progression or death on the control treatment 
is 3.2 ye ars, and that with better chemotherapy delivery, this may be extended to 5 years 
or more [12,75]. If the true median PFS times on the control and experimental 
treatments are 3.2 and 5 years , respectively, we will need to study 275 experimental 
subjects and  137 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the 
experimental and control survival curves are equal with 80% power and alpha=0.05 .    
 
16.2 Sample Size and Study Duration  
16.2.1  The primary aim of the study is t o test whether treatment with IG -BMS -IMRT 
improves progression- free survival compared to treatment with standard of care.  For this 
aim we consider a 2- arm group sequential design with progression -free survival as the  
primary endpoint. The sample size is based on testing the hazard ratio (HR) for 
Treatment A  vs B. We test the two -sided hypothesis : 
 
 
 
Based on past data [12] we assume that median survival in the standard care group is 
3.2 years,  and we power against the alternative that median survival in the IG -BMS -
IMRT group  is 5 years,  i.e. that the hazard ratio is as small as 0.64. The total sample 

                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 33 
INTERTECC TRIAL  
 size is 415 patients and a total  of 163 events is required for the final analysis. Planned 
recruitment duration is 5 years and the minimum follow -up planned is 1 year. Thus, the 
total expected study duration is 6 years.  Enrollment is assumed to be constant at a rate 
of 83.0 patients per month. The assumed dropout rate is 5% per year. There is a single 
interim analysis planned after 82 events have accrued which is expected to occur  after 
approximately 3.9 years.  
 
Timing, number of events, sample size, and boundaries (Z -values, nominal p- values, 
approximate hazard ratios) are shown in Table 16. 1, as well as the probability of 
crossing study boundaries  under the null and alternative hypotheses. Following are plots 
of the Z -values (Figure 16. 1) and approximate hazard ratios (Figure 16. 2) at the design 
bounds.  Table 16.2 shows the effect of the drop- out rate and randomization ratio on the 
design.

Secondary aims  
In secondary analyses, we will further test the effect of treatment on hematologic 
and gastrointestinal toxicities . Hematologic toxicity is typically measured with numeric 
biomarkers such as neutrophil count. Also of particular interest in this study are patient -
reported outcomes pertaining to health and quality of life. The EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -
CX24 instruments will be used to measure gastrointestinal toxicity as experienced by 
patients . 
Specifically, a composite of QLQ -C30 item Q17 and CX -24 item Q32, which deal with 
diarrhea and bowel control, will be considered. Responses to each item are numeric with 
integer values from one to four. Both the hematologic biomarkers and the quality of life 
instruments yield quantitative outcomes. The mean response between treatment groups 
will be tested using two -sided, two -sample t -tests. Table 16.3 below gives the power of the 
tests based on the sample size from the primary outcome, correcting for mul tiple testing.  
 
Table 16.3: Power for the secondary analyses. The table shows the power for the two -
sample, two-sided t -test based on a sample size of 102 patients per group. The 
calculations assume that two tests are performed; a Bonferroni correction is used to 
maintain a family -wise type -1 error rate of 0.05. Since some outcomes are patient -
reported and subject to missing -ness, the columns index the effective sample size in 

                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 35

 terms of the compliance rate. Rows index the effect size under the alternative

FLT/RSI Imaging Substudy Aims  
 
Patients treated on the FLT/RSI substudy must have access to FLT- PET and RSI (i.e., 
be treated at UCSD or participating institutions with access to this technology). The 
primary aim of the imaging substudy is to compare the rate of acute grade ≥ 3 
hematologic toxicity with FLT -PET-guided BMS -IMRT vs. the other 2 arms . Based on 
prior institutional and published data [12,74]  the probability of acute hematologic toxicity  
with multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy  (institutional standard) is  45% or more. If 
the relative risk (RR) of toxicity  for patients receiving  experimental therapy (FLT -PET-
guided BMS -IMRT) is 0.5, we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that RR=1  with 
80% power, with a 1 -sided  Type I error  of 15%, with 60 subjects (30 experimental, 30 
control).  Based on prior accrual at our institution this is a feasible accrual goal, and 
based on prior published data this effect size is plausible.  We will use an uncorrected 
chi-squared statistic to test th e null hypothesis.  At the conclusion of the trial, we will also 
compare hematologic toxicity for all patients treated with FLT- PET-guided BMS -IMRT 
vs. FDG -PET-guided BMS -IMRT vs. usual care.  
 
All 60 patients will undergo serial RSI imaging before (<4 week s before treatment), 
during (at 3 -4 weeks), immediately following (2 -4 weeks after), and 3 -4 months after 
chemoradiotherapy at the UCSD Multimodal Imaging Lab (MMIL). Regions of interest 
(ROIs) will be delineated on both MRI and PET/CT, and both cellularit y indices (z -
scores) and standardized uptake values (SUV) will be collected, respectively, for each 
subject before and after treatment. ROIs will be defined and z -scores and SUVs 
calculated using commercially available software. We will compare the changes  in mid -
treatment and post -treatment cellularity indices within the tumor on RSI to the change 
from baseline to 3 -4-months using PET/CT. We expect to see inter -patient  
variation in the degree of response measured by change in cellularity and change in 
SUV.  At the end of the study we will plot the distribution of observed changes in 
cellularity indices and the change in z -score vs. change in SUV for patients undergoing 
both FDG -PET/CT and FLT -PET/CT. Statistical tests will be performed using a rank 
correlati on test (z -score versus SUV).  
  
16.2.2  The study duration will be 5 years  (3 years for the imaging sub -study) . The 
accrual period will be 4- 5 years and the expected accrual rate is 3 -4 patients per month. 
Subjects will be followed for long- term outcomes and toxicity for up to three years.  
 

                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 36

 16.2. 3 Patients will be randomized at the time of registration. Randomization will be 
done at UCSD with stratification on age and stage  using randomized blocks of size 4.  
  
16.3 Plan for Data Analysis 
16.3. 1 Time to recurrence will be defined as the time from study enrollment to the time of 
recurrence of disease, determined by biopsy or imaging. If biopsy is not obtained to 
confirm diagnosis of recurrence, treatment failure will be determined to have occurred 
only if the patient undergoes a change in management on the basis of the imaging 
results (e.g., salvage or palliative therapy or hospice referral). Local recurrence will be 
defined as persistence or recurrence of tumor at the cervix or vaginal cuff. Regional 
recurrence will be defined as recurrence of tumor elsewhere in the pelvis or para- aortic 
nodal region (if treated). Distant recurrence will be defined as recurrence of tumor 
outside of the treatment field, including the para- aortic nodal region. Time to locoregional 
recurrence will be defined as the shortest time to local or regional recurrence, whichever 
occurs first. Time to recurrence will be defined as the shortest time to locoregional or 
distant recurrence, whichever occurs first. The cumulative probability of recurrence will 
be estimated using cumulative incidence functions, considering other first events (such 
as deaths) as competing events.  
 
16.3. 2 Disease -free survival will be defined as freedom from recurrence or death. 
Disease -specific survival will be defined as freedom from death due to cervical cancer. 
Overall survival will be defined as freedom from death due to any cause. These 
outcomes will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier survival curves with 95% confidence 
bands. Final outcomes wi ll be assessed at the conclusion of the study, three years after 
enrollment of the last patient.  
 
16.3. 3 Analysis of the phase III data will be according to intention to treat. If significant 
site-to-site variability is observed, we will plan to model this  in phase III using frailty or 
mixed -effects models.  
 
16.3. 4 Analysis of the phase III longitudinal QOL data will use linear random effects 
modeling, adjusting for important covariates such as the baseline QOL in addition to the 
treatment assignment. Nested random effects can also be used to model site- to-site 
variation. Non- informative missingness in the data is naturally accommodated by the 
random effects models. The QOL data at 1 month post treatment will be correlated with 
peak toxicities which occ ur during that month.  
 
16.3. 5 Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed according to several factors, 
as listed in the schema (section 1.0). Differences in proportions will be tested using the 
chi square or t test. Differences in time to events will be analyzed using the log ran k test 
or Gray’s test and/or inclusion as covariates in multi -variable Cox proportional hazards 
models. We will use Forest plots to analyze treatment effects within subgroups.  
 
16.3.6  Missing data  
Differences in baseline characteristics between those lost to follow -up and those 
completing the protocol will be assessed using chi -square or t -test. A worst -case 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess whether findings are robust to the 
missing data.  
 
16.3.7  Site effects  
                                                         This protocol is for research purposes only.  Page 37

 We will use logistic and proport ional hazards mixed- effects regression models to test for 
and, as necessary, model site effects on safety and efficacy outcomes [ 72-73].

1.0  Objectives  
 
Primary Objective:  
 
· To determine the safety and establish the optimal biologic dose of  CYT107.  
 
Secondary objectives:  
 
· To determine the rate of cytomegalovirus  (CMV),  Epstein- Barr virus  (EBV)  and BK viral 
infections in umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation ( CBT) and haploidentical 
stem cell transplantation (haplo- SCT)  patients who receive three doses of IL- 7 
following  engraftment.  
 
· To calculate the OS, PFS and, cumulative  incidence of GVHD and cumulative incidence of 
relapse 
 
· To evaluate the effects  of CYT107 on the recovery  of T, NK and B cell populations  and their 
functions in vitro; these data will be used to identify the optimal dose to move to a phase II 
trial. 
 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Haploidentical and Cord blood transplantation  
 
Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo- SCT) and umbilical cord blood stem cell 
transplantation (CBT) are being increasingly used as a source of hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells (HSPCs) for allogeneic stem cell transplant candidates lacking suitable matched donors. Although haplo -SCT and CB T  are successful in many patients, their  efficacy ha ve  been 
restricted by slow hematopoietic and immunologic reconstitution due to the quantitative and  
qualitative differences in the composition of  the stem cell grafts.
1-5  While the frequency of HSPCs 
is greater in CB units, CB grafts contain an average of 1- 2 logs fewer total cells compared to 
peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow  (BM)  allografts.  Moreover,  the vast majority  of T, B and 
dendritic cells in CB grafts are immature,6;7 which likely explains the low rates of  graft-versus -host 
disease (GVHD) seen after CBT given the degree of HLA- mismatches typically  used.8;9  The use 
of double unrelated CBT (DUCBT) represents an important advance by  allowing  larger  children  
and adult  patients  to be transplanted  with an acceptable cell dose.  In this setting, although two CB 
units are initially transplanted, only one provides prolonged engraftment and becomes the 
“dominant” engrafted unit. Yet, even following DUCBT, severe complications related to infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
15-20  Similarly, immune recovery after haplo -SCT 
also tends to be less roubust in comparison with matched grafts, and affects B cells, T cells and their subsets.

 6 2.2 Strategies to enhance T -cell reconstitution  
 
Interleukin- (IL-7) has a central role in T -cell development and survival; it enhances 
thymopoiesis, peripheral T- cell survival and expansion in murine models of allogeneic 
hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  (allo-HSCT).2-5   Initial  trials with recomb inant  human  IL-7 
(r-hIL-7) demonstrated an expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with solid tumors or 
HIV infection.21-25  A potential concern with IL- 7 in allo -HSCT patients is the stimulation of 
GVHD. In preclinical mouse models, short courses of IL -7 did not induce GVHD in T- cell 
depleted bone marrow transplant (TCD -BMT) nor did it aggravate the development of GVHD 
after adding donor T cells.3  However, IL- 7 when given longer and at higher dose to mice after 
TCD- BMT, did lower the threshold dose of T cells required to induce  lethal  GVHD.26 In a  
recent Phase I clinical study  of r-hIL-7 in recipients  of a T-cell depleted  allo-HSCT,  investigators  
at Memorial  Sloan Kettering treated 12 patients with escalating doses of IL -7 administered 
weekly for 3 w eeks after the patients  had engrafted. They reported that the study drug was well 
tolerated with only one patient developing acute skin GVHD. At baseline, patients  were 
profoundly lymphopenic. IL- 7 induced a doubling in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with no significant 
effect on CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells, NK, or B cells. Importantly, they also demonstrated an 
increase in functional T cell recovery, including viral -specific T cells that recognize CMV. 
Enhanced T- cell receptor  (TCR)  diversity  was also observed after treatment.  The authors  
concluded that IL-7 can enhance immune recovery after a T cell– depleted allo- HSCT without 
causing significant GVHD or other serious  toxicity. 
 
2.3 Preliminary Studies  
 
Predictors of Non- Relapse Mortality and Overall Survival after CBT. We analyzed the 
outcome of 108 patients who underwent a DUCBT at our center for predictors of 3- year 
non-relapse mortality (NRM) .28  In univariate analysis , the day 30 absolute lymphocyte counts 
(ALC30) were treated as dichotomous variables above or below 150 x 106 /L (upper limit of first 
quartile) and significantly affected NRM . The median (range) of ALC30 was 240 (10- 2420) x 
106/L. There was no significant impact of age, sex, disease stage at the time of DUCBT, CMV  
serostatus, the occurrence of grade II -IV acute GVHD before day 30, total nucleated cell dose 
(TNC) dose, total CD34 dose, preparative regimen or CB manipulation on NRM. In multivariate analysis, ALC30 (HR = 2.3, P = 0.01) emerged as an independent factor strongly associated 
with NRM. Figure 1 shows the impact of ALC30 on NRM and OS in all patients. For patients  
with ALC30 > 150 x 10
6/L, overall survival at 3 years was 37% (95% CI 25 -49) compared with  
25% (95%  CI 11-40) for those  with counts  ≤ 150 x 106/L (P = 0.02) . Similarly,  ALC30  > 150 x 106
 
/L was related to a lower risk of NRM, 42% (95% CI 31- 56%) vs 59% (95% CI 44- 78%) ( P = 
0.01) in patients with ALC30 £ 150 x 10 /L. The leading causes of NRM in both the groups 
(ALC30 £ 150 vs. ALC30 >150) included infections (50% vs. 52%, P =0.9) and GVHD (40% vs  
30%, P = 0.5 ). Further, there was no significant impact of ALC30 on the rate of grade II- IV 
aGVHD ( P = 0.4), disease progression ( P = 0.7) or progression- free survival ( P = 0.07) at 2 
years.

Figure 2. Prolonged T lymphopenia and relative expansion of NK cells and B cells following DUCBT. T 
(CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+), B (CD19+), and NK (CD56+) cells were prospectively measured by  
6 
multiparameter flow cytometry on fresh samples; ( A) frequencies; ( B) absolute numbers (x 10 /L) for each  
immune subset are presented. At baseline and after DUCBT, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were relatively reduced, 
whereas early B -cell and NK -cell recovery was evident. Surviving CB transplant recipients demonstrated 
rebound of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at later intervals after transplantation. Error bars represent interquartile 
range.  
 
Lymphocyte subset analysis. In 65 patients for whom peripheral blood (PB) samples had 
been collected at days +30, +100, +180 or 1 year post- DUCBT, we further characterized 
immune subset recovery by measuring the frequencies and absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, 
CD8+ T cells, CD56+CD3 - NK cells, and CD19+ B cells ( Figure 2 ). The absolute number of 
each cell subset was calculated by multiplying their frequencies as determined by flow 
cytometry by the absolute lymphocyte number (cells/μl) obtained from a diagnostic complete 
blood count performed on the same day. Lymphocyte reconstitution following DUCBT began 
with a rapid increase in both the absolute number and frequencies of NK cells over baseline 
norms, and remained increased at the different study intervals, though the percentage of NK cells declined as T- cell counts recovered. T cell reconstitution on the other hand was 
significantly delayed. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declined after conditioning and were significantly 

  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 6 of 25 
 reduced by day 30 post -DUCBT. The median absolute number of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells was 6 
x 106/L (range  0-170) at 30 days and 11 x 106/L (range  0-1900)  at 100 days  post-transplant.  The 
corresponding  numbers  of CD4+  helper  T cells were  4 x 106/L (range  0-100) and 22 x 106/L 
(range 0- 390), respectively. These results confirm that quantitative T cell recovery is delayed 
after DUCBT, with an inverted CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, and that this delay in T cell immunity is 
associated with a preferential rapid reconstitution of non -T lymphoid cells (e.g., NK cells and B 
cells). Patients who developed acute GVHD had a slower T and B cell recovery (data not 
shown)29, in keeping  with previous  reports  following  allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation.29
 
To assess the tempo of functional virus -specific T cell recovery after DUCBT, we stimulated 
PBMC from 46 transplant recipients with 15- mer overlapping peptides s panning T cell 
immunogenic antigens from a range of both latent (CMV, EBV, BKV) and community (AdV, Influenza and RSV) viruses as well as to SEB, which was used as a positive control. Prior to 
transplant the frequency of T cells reactive against SEB was  highest (mean 424.5 SFC/2 x 10
5 
PBMCs), followed by CMV (mean 258 SFC in 39 seropositive donors), EBV (mean 33 SFC), AdV (mean 17 SFC), BKV (mean 13 SFC), Influenza (mean 8 SFC), and RSV (mean 10 SFC) 
(Figure 3).

2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 7 of 25 
 As shown in Figure 3 , T cell activity against SEB, CMV, EBV, and AdV was delayed for at least 
8-9 months following DUCBT (mean 200, 89, 28 and 24 SFC/2 x 105, respectively). All patients 
developed viral infections/ reactivations post -DUCBT. The most common causes of viral  
infection included CMV (59%), BKV (20%) and AdV (11%). The majority of these infections  
occurred within the first 100 days post DUCBT and nearly 50% of patients had infections with 
multiple viruses.  
 Haplo- SCT 
Immune recovery following haplo- SCT also has been reported to be suboptimal for at least 1 year 
after stem cell transplantation in comparison with the immune recovery observed following fully 
matched transplants. 35-37  Furthermore, the absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were much 
lower after haplo- SCT in comparison with lymphocyte counts seen in normal individuls.35-37 
Sluggish recovery was reported for CD19+ B cells, which according to some studies remained 
under 100 cells/μL until 180 days after transplantation.37  Poor recovery was also reported in the T 
cell subsets.35-37  In one study, CD4+ helper T cells were shown to recover slowly after haplo- SCT 
and did not reach 400/μL  until 12 months after transplantation.37  Although CD8+ cytotoxic T cells 
recovered rapidly after haplo- SCT according to some studies, there was a significant inversion of 
the CD4:CD8 ratio, which was observed up to 12 months after transplantation.35-37   CD4–CD8– T 
cells recovered slowly and did not reach the normal value until 180 days after transplantation. 
Slow recovery was also demonstrated in regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+ ).37  Unlike conventional 
T and B cells, regulatory T cells never reached normal levels at 12 months following haplo- SCT.  
In addition to absolute numbers and frequencies, immune cell function may be altered following 
haplo- SCT.  For example, one study demonstrated lower numbers of CD28- expres sing T cells 1 
year following haplo- SCT.37  Moreover, a number of studies have shown that successful immune 
reconstitution after allo- HSCT significantly correlates with better post -transplant outcomes, 
including lower infection, relapse and less secondary malignancy rates.38,39 Moreover, r apid 
immune reconstitution specifically following haplo- SCT prognosticated for superior outcomes, 
suggesting that measures that could “normalize” immune recovery may improve  the outcomes for 
patients following haplo- SCT.40 
 
IL-7 and GVHD  
 
Previous studies with infusion of exogenous IL- 7 have shown variable effects on GVHD. 
Whereas Alpdogan et al, using an allogeneic murine model with full MHC class I and II disparity, 
reported  that IL-7 improves  immune  reconstitution  without  aggravating  GVH D,29  Sinha  et al 
reported  increased  GVHD  in a murine  parent  into an F1 model.31  More  recently,  a small  phase  I 
study, the administration of IL- 7 in the setting of T- depleted bone marrow allogeneic transplant 
appeared to be safe and associated with an increase in functional T cell recovery, including 
virus -specific  T cells that recognize  CMV.27   Thus,  we propose  that treatment  with IL-7 after CBT 
and haplo- SCTwill be safe and will not increase the risk of graft -versus- host disease (GVHD) for 
several  reasons: i) the number of infused T cells after CBT is one- log lower than that infused 
after a bone marrow transplant and two- logs lower than a peripheral blood stem cell transplant 
(akin to a T -depleted graft); ii) all patients will receive serotherapy with ATG as part of their CBT 
conditioning and will therefore undergo in vivo T cell depletion; iii) in our C BT population, the 
median time to acute GVHD grade I -IV is 34 days (manuscript submitted). Administration of 
CYT107 can be initiated between day 60- 180, and all patients with a prior history of aGVHD will 
be excluded from the study.

4.0  Treatment Plan and Study Design  
 
CYT107 will not be administered before Day 60 but could be started as late as Day 180 
post-CBT or haplo -SCT. 
 
The active treatment period will be from the first injection of CYT107 and for 30 days after the last injection. The follow -up period will be for three years after the last injection. 
 
Patients will be treated with CYT107 by intramuscular route (I.M.)* post CBT or haplo- SCT 
(from 60 to 180 days), with 1 of 3 doses below:  
 
· 5 mcg/kg/dose for 3 doses, one week  apart  
· 10 mcg/kg/dose for 3 doses, one week  apart  
· 20 mcg/kg/dose for 3 doses, one week  apart  
 
Enrollment of the first 3 participants will be staggered by 14 days. Accrual in between cohorts 
will be halted for 30 days after the last patient in each cohort has received the last dose of 
CYT107.  
* If the patient's platelet count is below 35,000, the product may be administered by 
subcutaneous route.  
 
All patients will receive f oscarnet for the management of CMV infection as per Stem Cell 
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Department's standard of care.  
 
Dose modifications  
 
Treatment will be permanently discontinued for patients developing grade 3 or 4 GVHD, 
secondary graft failure, disease relapse, PTLD, PML, grade 2- 4 skin rash, or grade 3 -4 
non-hematological toxicity attributable to CYT107.  
 
Patients who develop grade 2 non -hematological toxicity attributable to the CYT107 will have 
the next dose withheld until the toxicity resolves to grade 1. If the toxicity resolves within 2 
weeks the drug will be administered at the same dose, however if the toxicity takes more than 2 
weeks to resolve the drug will be administered at the next lower level, or permanently discontinued if the patient was already at the lowest level. If the toxicity takes more than 4 
weeks to improve to grade I, the CYT107 will be permanently discontinued 
 
For patients who at study entry have grade 0, 1 or 2 hematological toxicity and develop grade IV 
hematological toxicity attributable to the CYT107 will have the next dose withheld until the 
toxicity resolves to grade 2. If the toxicity resolves within 2 weeks the drug will be administer at 
the same dose, however if the toxicity takes more than 2 weeks  to resolve the drug will be 
administered at the next lower level, or permanently discontinued if the patient was already at the lowest level. If the toxicity takes more than 4 weeks to improve to grade 2, the CYT107 will be permanently discontinued 
 
There are no planned dose modifications for patients who already have grade 3- 4 hematological  
toxicity at study entry

5.0  Background Drug Information 
 
5.1 CYT107 (IL -7) 
 
Description  
 
CYT107 is a recombinant protein belonging to the class of growth factors and more specifically 
to the class of cytokines. CYT107 is a heavily glycosylated and sialylated form of recombinant 
human interleukin- 7 expressed from a CHO cell line, composed of 152 amino acids, with an 
average molecular mass as determined by mass spectrometry of 22 kDa and a mean pI of 7. The molecular formula of the peptidic sequence only (non glycosylated) is C762H1241N213O228S11. The protein contains 3 disulfide bridges (Cys2 - Cys 92, Cys 34 - Cys 
129, and Cys 47 - Cys 141) and 4 glycosylation sites (3N, 1O).  
 
Source 
 
CYT107 used in this clinical trial was manufactured under good manufacturing practice (GMP) criteria at a 600 L fermentation and purification scale by PATHEON (Princeton, NJ), for REVIMMUNE Inc. At clinical site, the product will be made available to the hospital pharmacy by 
CSM, Fargo, ND  58103.  
 
Formulation  
 
CYT107 is supplied in a 2 mL vial as 0.5 mL of CYT107 (1 mg) in 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM glutamic acid. The pH of the solution is 5 and the osmolality is 320 40 mOsm.  
The concentration of CYT107 in solution is 2 mg/ml.  
 
Stability  
 
Stability studies will continue throughout the clinical study. Updated stability information will be 
periodically communicated to the hospital pharmacy. 
 
Special Handling  
 
There are no specific guidelines for safe handling of CYT107. Institutional guidelines for safe handling of proteins in general should be followed.  
CYT107 Preparation  
 
Syringes containing the CYT107 dose will be prepared by the hospital pharmacy. The product should be defrosted at least 1 hour before administration. Defrosted product (and possibly put in syringe) should be kept refrigerated at +4°C/+8°C until use and for no more than 8 hours.  
 
CYT107 flip- top vials will only be used if the solution is clear (following visual inspection), the 
vial is undamaged and the use by (expiration) date (if marked on the vial) has not been passed. Based on patient’s body weight on day of study entry, the appropriate number of vials of CYT107 drug product will be prepared and administered.  (See Body Weight (BW) Calculation 
below.) CYT107 will be kept refrigerated until time of immediate administration to the patient.  
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 11 of 25 
 To minimize the chance for contamination, sterile or septic technique should be carefully 
observed during CYT107 solution preparation (filling of the syringe) and administration.  
 
A flip -top vial is restricted for use by a single patient. Take no more than 0.5 mL into the syringe. 
The dose to be injected will be divided as necessary into intramuscular injections so that each injection will not exceed 0.5 ml in volume. (Dosing guidelines for ideal body weight make the 
requirement for multiple injections highly unlikely).  
 
Body Weight (BW) Calculation  
 
If patient is </= 20% of ideal body weight (IBW), use actual weight.  
 
In obese patients, a corrected weight will be used to calculate the final dose the patient will 
receive.  The corrected dose will be calculated and used if  the patient’s actual weight give a 
Body Mass Index (BMI) at the upper limit of normal (i.e. BMI >30).    
BMI=weight (Kg)/[height(m)]^2   
 A BMI calculator is provided by www.cdc.gov:  
 
https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calcul
ator.html  
 If BMI >30 proceed with the following steps to determine the adjusted body weight for the dose 
calculation:  
• Determins Ideal weight (1 kg=2.2 lbs):  
o Males: 50 kg + (2.3kg/inch over 5 ft)  
o Females 45.5 kg + (2.3kg/inch over 5 ft)  
• Determine Adjusted Body weight:  
o Ideal Weight +  0.25 (actual weight  - ideal weight)= Adjusted Body Weight  
 
CYT107 Presentation and Packaging  
 
CYT107 is supplied as a sterile colorless liquid in 2 cc glass vials that are packed individually in 
cardboard box. Labels are stuck on vial and box. 
 
The labeling is following local and GMP rules. The detailed description of labeling is provided in 
the Pharmacy Manual.

The detailed procedures to be followed are provided in the Pharmacy Manual . 
Study Drug Administration  
 
Each dose of CYT107 will be administered by a registered nurse. CYT107 will be administered 
by intramuscular route at the dose of 5, 10 or 20 mcg/kg based on the patient’s body weight and 
the dose escalation cohort. (See Body Weight (BW) Calculation above.) 
 
The detailed procedures to be followed are provided in the Pharmacy  Manual including a table of 
volumes to be administered per patient total body weight.  
 
6.0 Evaluation During Study 
Every effort will be made to adhere to the schedule of events and all protocol requirements. Variations in protocol requirements that do not affect the rights and safety of the patient will not 
be considered as deviations. Such variations may include laboratory assessments completed 
outside of schedule and occasional missed required research samples. Missed samples for 
correlative studies will not constitute protocol deviations. 
For patients who have discharged to their home  clinics, and are not being followed weekly at 
MD Anderson, labs and assessments will be collected  as feasible in their home clinics or upon 
patient’s return to MDACC clinic.   Any missed time points will not be counted as protocol 
deviations.

 1. CMV  by PCR will be assayed in the blood weekly  from the start of IL-7 therapy  until day 180 
from the start of IL -7 therapy.  
2. EBV PCR will be assayed in the blood every  two weeks  from day 60 until day 100 and then 
monthly until day 180 from the start of IL -7 therapy.  
3. BKV PCR will be assayed in the urine  and blood if patients  become symptomatic,  as 
clinically  indicated.  
 
6.4 Correlative  Studies  
 
Circulating lymphocyte subsets will be measured, using immune reconstitution lab, prior to 
administration of each dose of CYT107 and approximately days 21 and 28, and 100 days 
after the first injection in the MD Anderson CLIA -approved clinical flow cytometry laboratory. 
The lymphocytes subsets analyzed will be CD4 and CD8 subsets including naïve and 
memory T -cells based on expression CD45RO, CD62L and CCR7. T -regulatory cells, B -
cells and NK cells will also be evaluated. This studies will be used to help identify the optimal IL- 7 dose for a subsequent phase- II trial .   
 Correlative study samples will be obtained via MD Anderson laboratory protocol LAB99- 062 
if patient consents.  
 
6.5 Plasma Samples  
 Plasma samples will be drawn to test for anti -CYT107 antibodies on approximately Days  0 (prior 
to IL-7 administration),  42, and 100 from the start of IL-7 therapy.  The samples  will be batched and 
sent to Revimmune for immunogenicity  assays. 
 
6.6     Outside Physician Participation During Treatment  
 
a)  MDACC Physician communication with the outside physician is required prior to 
the patient returning to the local physician. This will be documented in the patient 
record  
b)  A letter to the local physician outlining the patient's participation in a clinical trial 
will request local physician agreement to supervise the patient's care.    
c)  Protocol required evaluations outside MDACC will be documented by telephone, 
fax or e- mail.   Fax and/or e- mail will be dated and signed by the MDACC 
physician, indicating that they have reviewed it.  
d)  Changes in drug dose and/or schedule must be discussed with and approved by 
the MDACC physician investigator, or their representative prior to initiation, and will be documented in the patient record.  
e)  A copy of the informed consent, protocol abstract, treatment schema and 
evaluation during treatment will be provided to the local physician.  
f)   Documentat ion to be provided by the local physician will include drug 
administration records, progress notes, reports of protocol required laboratory and diagnostic studies and documentation of any hospitalizations.  
g)  The home physician would only be alerting the Principal Investigator to a subject’s 
life-threatening event (much as a family member would) and the Principal 
Investigator would be assessing the event per the protocol.  
h)  Patients will be evaluated either in person or remotely via telemedicine.

7.0 Statistical  Considerations  
 
7.1 Outcomes and Covariates  
 
7.1.1 Primary Outcomes 
 
Toxicity.   Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any of the following events: grade 3 or 4 GVHD, 
secondary graft failure, disease relapse, development of PTLD, development of PML, grade 2 organ 
failure or grade 2- 4 skin rash, fatigue, AST and ALT elevations, allergic anaphylaxis, or hemolytic 
anemia, attributable to CYT107,  or death, occurring within 42 days of the first CYT107 injection.  
 
Biological Responses . The absolute number and percentage of total White Blood Cells (WBCs)  
consisting of T- cells and of B-cells will be observed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.    
 
7.1.2 Secondary Outcomes 
 
Progression- free survival time, Overall survival time, Cytomegalovirus occurrence and severity , 
Epstein- Barr virus occurrence and severity, BK virus occurrence and severity  
 
All time -to-event outcomes will be measured from the time of CYT107 administration, with a maximum  
follow up of at least 12 months.  
 7.2 Baseline covariates  
 Baseline patient covariates to be recorded at enrollment will include the following variables:  
 
Conditioning regimen received 
GVHD prophylaxis  
Type of donor  
Type of graft  
Time to engraftment from cell infusion  
Donor age  
Acute (grades 2 – 4) GVHD  
Patient age  
Time to neutrophil engraftment  
Time to platelet engraftment  
Disease (AML or MDS)  
 
7.3 Trial Conduct  
 
7.3.1 Dose Assignments 
 
Three dose levels of CYT107 will be considered: 5, 10, and 15 mcg/kg, hereafter denoted as 
dose levels 1, 2, and 3.  
 
Randomization, rather than conventional sequentially adaptive dose selection, is based on the 
fact that neither Pr(DLT) nor any biological outcomes are necessarily monotone increasing in 
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 15 of 25 
 dose of the biological agent IL- 7, and also the scientific goal to obtain unbiased comparisons 
between doses.  
 
 A maximum of 21 patients will be randomized among the th ree IL- 7 3 doses,  with the 
randomization constrained to have exactly 7 patients per dose.    Since 2 patients previously have been enrolled and assigned to d=1, a randomization sequence will be provided for assigning doses to the remaining 19 patients, 3 – 21.   
  
7.3.2 Within -Dose Safety Monitoring  Rule  
  
For each dose d = 1, 2, 3, denote p(d) = Pr(DLT at dose d).   Assume that each p(d) follows a 
beta(.35, .65) prior.  Applying the method o f Thall et al.
41, enrollment to dose d will be stopped if    
 Pr[p(d) > .35 | data ]    >  .85.   This criterion will be applied continuously starting at n = 3, which 
implies that accrual to d  should be stopped if [number of DLTs] / [number of patients evaluated] is greater than or equal to 3/3 or 4/5.  To apply this safety rule for each dose to 2 cohorts of size 3 
each may or may not require suspension of accrual.   For each dose  (a)  once 1 or more pats in 
cohort 1 (pats #1,2,3) have “No toxicity” by day 42 of  followup , cohort 2 may begin enrollment, 
and (b) o nce 2 or more pats in cohorts 1 and 2 combined (pats #1,2,3,4,5,6) have “No toxicity” by 
day 42 of follow up , the last patient 7 may be enrolled. This rule has the following operating 
characteristics.    
 
Operating characteristics of the within- dose safety monitoring rule  
 
True p(DLT | d)  Pr(Stop accrual to d)  Sample Size  Quartiles  
.35 .163 7,   7,   7  
.55 .497 4,   7,   7  
.60 .601 4,   6,   7  
.65 .607 3,   4,   7  
  
7.4 Enrichment  
 
If enrollment to a dose d is stopped early at n(d) = 3 or 6 before 7 patients are treated, then the 
remaining 7–n(d) =  1 or 4 patients will be randomized between the remaining  two doses.   If 
enrollment  to 2 doses is stopped early, then all remaining patients, up to Nmax = 21, will be 
treated at the one remaining dose.  If enrollment to  all 3 doses is stopped early, then the trial will 
be stopped with no dose selected.  
 
7.5 Data Analysis  
 7.5.1 Tabulation  
 Each primary and secondary variable will be tabulated by dose using summary statistics, 
consisting of counts and percentages for categorical variables and the sample median and range for numerical valued variables.   Kaplan- Meier plots
34 will be u sed to estimate the PFS and OS 
distribution for each dose.  
7.5.2 Regression Modeling  
 
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 16 of 25 
 Bayesian longitudinal regression models42 will be fit to the final data on each of the four biological 
response variables, as defined in section 1, including in each model a parametric function of time 
and the baseline covariates patient age, type of graft, and disease (AML vs MDS).  Preliminary 
analyses will include a smoothed plot of each longitudinal outcome variable as a function of time.  
 7.5.3 Optimal Biological Dose Selection  
 
At the completion of the trial, when all patients have been followed up fully and all outcomes 
evaluated, the optimum biological dose (OBD) will be defined as the dose maximizing the sample 
mean percentage of WBCs that are T -cells, evaluated at one year of follow up.  
 
7.6 Trial Conduct  
 The Biostatistics Department Clinical Trial Conduct Website will be used to assign a dose to each 
patient at enrollment.   This will be set up and overseen by a Research Statistician in the Biostat 
Dept to be designated by Dr. Thall prior to re -starting the trial at patient number 3, using a 
randomization sequence provided by Dr. Thall.   The Principal Investigator and designated personnel in the SCT Dept will be responsible for recording all baseline covariates and outcome variables and implementing the within- dose st opping rule in terms of DLTs.  
 7.7 Summary Reports  
 
The investigator is responsible for completing a toxicity summary report and submitting it 
to the IND Office, Medical Affairs and Safety Group, for review and approval. This should be submitted after the first, the first three, and the first five evaluable patients per cohort, have completed 42 days post -first CYT107 injection.  
 A copy of the cohort summary should be placed in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder, under “Sponsor Correspondence”.  
 
8.0  Criteria for Removal from the Study  
 
Any patient can be removed from study for the following:  
- Patient withdrawal of the informed consent  
- Patient not being compliant  
- An increasing or unexpected pattern of toxicity  is observed deemed unacceptable by 
the study  chairman  
-  Grade  2-4 skin rash, grade 3 or 4 GVHD,  secondary  graft failure,  disease relapse,  
PTLD,  PML or grade 3- 4 non- hematological toxicity attributable to  CYT107  
- Disease  progression  
- Investigator judgment when the well -being and best interest of the patient is  compromised  
- Secondary Graft  Failure  
- 1 year after last  injection.  
 
 
9.0  Adverse Events and Reporting Requirements  
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 17 of 25 
 Adverse event definition:  
 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related 
to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values 
or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, or requi re therapy and otherwise meet the criteria for a 
reportable adverse event as defined above. They are to be captured under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
 
It is common for HCT recipients to experience multiple complications as part of the transplant itself that are unrelated to exposure to investigational agents. Symptoms of the original or 
targeted disease are not to be considered adverse events for this study except for 
hematological toxicities as defined below. From start of study treatment through 30 days from 
last dose of CYT107, symptoms related to the conditioning regimen will not be reported unless the event is both serious and considered by the investigator to also be possibly, probably, or definitely related to CYT107. After 30 days from the last dose of CYT107, adverse events 
should only be reported if they are both serious and probably or definitely related to CYT107. 
Events that are unlikely or unrelated to CYT107 are not required to be reported. Reporting of 
such events sh ould include the investigator’s assessment as to whether the event should be 
attributed to any of the HCT procedure itself, CYT107, GVHD, or exposure to 
immunosuppressive agents. An event may be attributable to all, some, or one of these 
categories.  
 
Assessment of the Adverse Events Severity:  
The severity of the adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria v4.0 (CTCAE). 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment period:  
Active treatment period (ATP) is defined from the first injection of CYT107 through 30 days from 

  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 18 of 25 
 the last injection.  
 
Time for Adverse Event (AE) Collection:  
Adverse events will be collected from the first injection of CYT107 through 30 days from the last 
injection. AEs that occur up to 30 days from the last injection of CYT107 will be followed until 
resolution.  
 
The collection of adverse events will reflect the onset and resolution date and maximum grade. 
If a patient is taken off study while an event is still ongoing, this will be followed until resolution 
or the event has stabilized. Pre -existing medical conditions will be recorded only if an 
exacerbation occurs during the active treatment period. Co- morbid events will not be scored 
separately.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting:  
The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse events, and assigning attribution for each event on all subjects 
enrolled on this study.  
 
Adverse events will be documented and entered into the electronic case report form 
(REDCap/CORe). All protocol specific data will be entered into REDCap/CORe.  
 
Events not to be considered adverse events in this study are those related to original disease or expected in the post -allogeneic transplant period. 
 
Isolated changes in laboratory parameters such as electrolyte, magnesium and metabolic imbalances, uric acid changes, elevations of GPT, GOT, LDH and alkaline phosphatase will not be captured.  
 
Concomitant medications  
Patients treated on this protocol will require supportive care treatment (concomitant  medications). 
These medications are considered standard of care and have no scientific contribution to the protocol; therefore no data will be captured on various medications needed or their side effects. All 
concomitant medications will be captured in the medical record.  
 
Causality Assessment.  
The principal investigator will be the final arbiter in determining the casualty assessment.  
 
List of most common expected adverse events : 
1. GVHD 
2. Secondary graft  failure  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) for MD Anderson -Sponsored IND Protocols  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
· Death 
· A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred.  It does  not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death.  
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 19 of 25 
 · Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
· A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  normal 
life functions.  
· A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
· Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse 
events.  Any important  medical  event  can and should be reported  as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by the Principal Investigator or the IND Sponsor, IND  Office.  
 
· All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must  be reported  to the IRB in accordance  with the timeframes  and procedures  outlined in 
“The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. 
Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported 
to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
· All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must 
have a written  report  submitted  within  24 hours  (next  working  day) of knowledge of the event 
to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.  
 
· Unless  otherwise noted,  the electronic  SAE application (eSAE)  will be utilized  for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB. 
 
· A copy  of the eSAE report  will also be sent to Michel  Morre  (michel.morre@revimmune.com) 
and to Revlimid (pv -revimmune@anticipsante.com), the supporter of  CTY-107. 
 
· Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first injection of CYT107 
through 30 days from the last injection. Serious adverse events must be followed until 
clinical recovery  is complete and laboratory  tests  have returned to baseline,  progression of 
the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable r esolution of the event.  
 
· Additionally,  any serious  adverse events  that occur  after the 30 day time period  that are 
related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND Office. This may include the development of a secondary  malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA  
 
· Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Sponsor (Safety  Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR  312.32.  
 
It is t
he responsibility of the PI and the research team  to ensure serious adverse events 
are reported according to the Code of Federal  Regulations,  Good Clinical  Practices,  the 
protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board  policy.  
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 20 of 25 
  
AEs Attribution Assessment  
 
Events assessed as to be caused by the administration of CYT107 and its direct consequences 
will be assessed as definite related.  
 
When the relationship of the adverse event cannot be ruled out between the CYT107 and the drugs used as part of the treatment plan, as well as for GVHD, infections and supportive 
treatment,  the event will be scored as probably or possible related. 
 
The principal investigator will be the final arbiter in determining the causality assessment.  
 
AEs Severity Assessment  
 
AEs will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0.  
 
Events not included in the CTCAE version 4.0 will be scored as follows: 
General grading:  
Grade 1: Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment required 
beyond prophylaxis.  
Grade 2: Moderate:  discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, require treatment. 
Grade 3: Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding to first line treatment.  
Grade 4: Life Threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death.  
AEs Data Collection  
Redcap/Core will be used as the electronic database/case report form (CRF) for this protocol.  
 
During the active treatment period, expected and unrelated adverse events considered unexpected and related to CYT107 will be collected in electronic medical record (EPIC). SAEs 
and AEs that require dose modifications will be captured in REDCap. The data will reflect the 
onset and resolution date and maximum grade. Intermittent events should be labeled as such 
and followed until resolution. If a patient is taken off study while an event still ongoing, this will 
be followed until resolution or the event has stabilized. Pre- existing medical conditions will be 
recorded only if an exacerbation occurs during the ATP. Co -morbid events will not be scored 
and collected separately.  
 
Medical events not considered adverse events will not be documented in the CRF. They will be captured in the medical record.  
 
· All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a  SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in 
“The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy 
for Investigators on Reporting Serious Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and 
Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported  to the IND Office,  regardless  of attribution (within  5 working  days  of knowledge 
of the event).  
  
2018-0674       Version 14.0, 09 September 2022  Page 21 of 25 
 · All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must 
have a written  report  submitted  within  24 hours  (next  working  day) of knowledge of the event 
to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.  
· Unless  otherwise noted,  the electronic  SAE application (eSAE)  will be utilized  for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB. 
A copy of the eSAE will also be sent to RevImmune, the supporter of CYT- 107. 
· Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until 30 days after the last dose of drug, unless the participant withdraws 
consent. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory  tests  have  returned to baseline,  progression of the event  has stabilized,  or there 
has been acceptable resolution of the  event.  
· Additionally,  any serious  adverse events  that occur  after the 30 day time period  that are 
related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
development of a secondary  malignancy.  
· Patients  who withdraw  consent  due to toxicities  will be evaluable and considered treatment 
failures.

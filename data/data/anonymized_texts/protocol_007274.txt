INTRODUCTION  
Diltiazem, a non -dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is often the medication of choice in the rate 
control management  of atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF) due to its proven superiority over other rate 
control agents such as amiodarone, digoxin, and metoprolol.i,ii,iii It has a rapid onset of action, high 
response rate, and minimal negative inotropic effect. In the ED, a  weight -based  loading dose (LD) of IV 
diltiazem is usually administered followed by PO immediate release tablet or IV continuous infusion. Both 
options a llow for dose titration in the short term before converting to the extended release PO formulation. 
The PO immediate release diltiazem tablet has a fast onset of action of 30 -60 minutes and is dosed every 
6 hours.iv Intravenous continuous infusion diltiazem  has a variable onset of action with a titration 
frequency of every 15 -30 minutes.  
The route of diltiazem after the initial IV LD can potentially influence the disposition of the patient from the 
ED, the level of care needed, and hospital length of stay (LOS). However, no studies exist comparing PO 
immediate release and IV continuous infusion diltiazem.  The objective of this study was to compare the 
incidence of patients who have a  HR <110 beats/min  or conversion to sinus rhythm  at 2 hours after 
medication administration  
 
METHODS  
Study Design:  
This was a p rospective, open  label , randomized non -inferiority trial to co mpare the effectiveness of PO 
immediate release  diltiazem to IV continuous infusion diltiazem in achieving rate control in adult patients 
with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AFF) . This single center study was conducted at Virginia 
Commonwealth University Medical Center in Richmond, VA between 2018  and 2020.   Approval of the 
study was obtained from the hospital’s institutional review board. All enrolled patients provided written 
informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization 
documentation. This stu dy is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number _____.  
 
Setting and Population:  
The study was conducted in a tertiary medical center ED that treats over 95,000 patients annually . 
Patients were evaluated for enrollment if they were  ≥ 18 years old , had a 12 -lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) showing AFF with a ventricular rate of >110 beats/min, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 90 
mmHg. Patients were excluded if they were < 18 years old, pregnant, a prisoner, history of Wolff -
Parkinson -White syndrome, receiv ed electrical therapy for cardioversion, or received other medications  
for acute HR control (besides adenosine) randomization , or had a history of allergic reaction to diltiazem.  
 
Interventions:  
Eligible patients gave written informed consent before entry into the study  and the following data was 
obtained: demographics, medical history, vital signs, ECG findings. At the discretion of the health care 
provider, IV adenosine was administered to facilitate identification of the underlying arrhythmia.  
 
Upon enrollment, patients received a diltiazem bolus of 0.25 mg/kg  over 2 minutes. If the patient’s HR did 
not decrease to <110 beats/min  or decrease by 20% from baseline ventricular rate  with the first diltiazem 
bolus  within 15 minutes , but was well tolerat ed, patients were given a second bolus of 0.35 mg/kg IVP  
over 2 minutes . If the patient’s HR did not decrease to <110 beats/min  or decrease by 20% from baseline 
ventricular rate  with the second diltiazem  bolus they were excluded. Responders to the diltiaze m bolus 
were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to receive diltiazem 60 mg PO immediate release  (or 30 mg PO 
immediate release if patient was <60 kg) or be started on a diltiazem drip at 5 mg/h to be titrated by the 
nurse  2.5 mg/h every 15 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hr or until a HR of <110 beats/min or 
conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) occurred . Randomization was performed using block 
randomization . 
 
Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Virginia 
Commonwealth Univeristy .5 Baseline demographic information recorded included the patie nt’s age, sex, 
race, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, oxygen saturation and oxygen requirement),  weight, history of AF F, 
hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF) , and prior medication therapy (calcium channel 
block ers, beta -blockers, digoxin, other anti -arrhythmics ). Diltiazem characteristics included initial IV 
diltiazem LD ; maintenance oral and continuous infusion dose s at 60 minutes, 2 hours, and 4 hours;  and 
the use of adjunctive therapy for HR control at 4 hours was also collected. Clinical outcomes collected 
include HR and blood pressure (BP) at baseline , 60 minutes, 2 hours , and 4 hours; ED disposition; and 
hospital LOS.   
 
Outcome Measures:  
The pri mary efficacy outcome measure s the incidence of patients who have a  HR <110 beats/min  or 
conversion to sinus rhythm  at 2 hours after  medication administration.  Two hours was selected to give 
time for the PO IR diltiazem to have an effect , time for the diltiazem drip to be titrated  and the ED 
physician to decide  on disposition . Failure  was defined as either a switch in therapy from PO immediate 
release diltiazem to IV continuous infusion diltiazem  (or vice versa) , the addition or switch of therapy to 
other rate control or antiarrhythmic agents  within 2  hours, or a HR of > 110 beats/min at 2 hours.  
 
Secondary outcomes included  rate of conversion to sinus rhythm and identifying patient characteristics  
associated with HR control at 2  hours such as  route of administration, age, weight, race, sex, initial heart 
rate and BP, and initial diltiazem LD.  S afety outcome measures were HR <60 beats/min and SBP <90 
mmHg  for 15 minutes . 
 
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis of efficacy used the intent to treat prin ciple that included all randomized patients. The null 
hypothesis is that there is no difference in the achievement of HR <110 beats/min, decrease in ventricular 
rate by at least 20%, or conversion to sinus rhythm  between the PO and IV diltiazem group at 2 hours.  
 
Power calculation:  A “Sealed Envelope Ltd” program was used to calculate sample size. The standard 
deviations used to calculate the sample size were based on  an internal retrospective study that looked at 
immediate release PO vs. continuous infus ion diltiazem for HR control in patients with atrial fibrillation . An 
estimate of 92 patients assigned in  a 1:1 ratio to receive immediate release PO and continuous infusion 
IV diltiazem would achieve 90% power to detect non -inferiority using a one -sided, two -sample t -test. 
Margin of equivalence 10%.  
 
Data were analyzed using Excel, R 3.2.2, and JMP 11.0.0 (Copyright 2013 SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Nominal variables were evaluated with Χ2 and continuous variables were compared using the Student’s t -
test.  Logistical regression modeling was used to identify patient characteristics associated with HR 
control at 2 hours. An a priori α level of ≤0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

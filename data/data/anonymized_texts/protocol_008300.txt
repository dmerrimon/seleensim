Version 6, 5/15 /18 Background and Significance:  35 
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),  a common,  heterogeneous , heritable  condition , is 36 
characterized by disordered reproductive and metabolic function that accounts for the myriad of 37 
clinical features including androgen excess, chronic anovulation, hyperinsulinemia, adiposity, 38 
and dyslipidemia.  Hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction and met abolic abnormalities - the 39 
main determinants of PCOS – all appear to be involved in a synergistic way in the 40 
pathophysiology of PCOS.  Women with PCOS are more likely to be obese although PCOS can 41 
also manifest in lean women.  Obesity, particularly abdomin al obesity, plays a central role in the 42 
development of PCOS, and exacerbates the reproductive and metabolic dysfunction.  Rather 43 
than absolute body weight, it is the distribution of fat that is important with central adiposity 44 
being a risk factor.  Compare d with weight -matched healthy women, those with PCOS have a 45 
similar amount of total and trunk fat, but a higher quantity of central (visceral) abdominal fat.  46 
Visceral adipose tissue is more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat and the amount of 47 
visceral fat correla tes with insulin resistance  and hyperinsulinemia.  Weight gain is also often an 48 
important pathogenic factor, with the PCOS condition becoming clinically manifest in women 49 
with a presumable genetic predisposition for PCOS who subsequently gain weight.   Therefore, 50 
environmental (particularly dietary) factors are important.  However, body mass  is also 51 
influenced by genetic factors such as fat mass and obesity -associated protein, and obesity itself 52 
is a highly heritable condition.  Therefore, the weight gain responsible for the manifestation of 53 
PCOS in many women with this condition is itself influenced by genetic factors.  Ethnicity, 54 
genetic background, personal and family history, degree of obesity must all be taken into 55 
account because they might aggravate or even trigger metabolic disturbances women with 56 
PCOS.  Moreover, the incidence of glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, gestational diabetes, and 57 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increased in women with PCOS at all weight levels and at a young age.  58 
Several studies have demonstrated that T2D occurs with increased frequency in women with 59 
PCOS so that recently the American Diabetes Association and the International Diabetes 60 
Federation have identified PCOS as a significant non -modifiable risk factor ass ociated with type 2 61 
diabetes.  PCOS may be a more important risk factor than ethnicity or race for glucose 62 
intolerance in young women.  The exact factors responsible for this excess risk in women with 63 
PCOS have not been identified; family history of T2D, o besity, insulin resistance , beta cell (ß-cell) 64 
secretory dysfunction, and hyperandrogenism are possible candidates.  With better 65 
understanding of its pathophysiology, the metabolic consequences of the syndrome are now 66 
evident.   67 
Obesity is considered one o f the most important features of PCOS and it exacerbates 68 
insulin resistance  and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in women with PCOS.  Its mean 69 
prevalence in diseased women varies between 61 and 76%.  The prevalence of obesity r eaches 70 
80% in the United Stat es and 50% outside which indicates that this figure depends on local 71 
environmental factors, ethnic backgrounds, and lifestyle, and not on the mere presence of PCOS 72 
 
3 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 itself.  The increased prevalence of obesity in PCOS is associated with an increased frequen cy of 73 
metabolic syndrome and T2D.  Obesity has been associated with a number of diseases and 74 
metabolic abnormalities that have high morbidity and mortality.  Obesity appears to exert an 75 
additive, synergistic eff ect on manifestations of PCOS and PCOS is mor e prevalent in obese than 76 
in lean women.  Moreover, obesity itself is a common pathogenic factor in insulin resistance, 77 
lipid dysfunction and metabolic syndrome and is usually accompanied by hypertension.  The 78 
degree of obesity is positively associated wit h an increase in the incidence  and degree of insulin 79 
resistance.  Obesity may play a pathogenic role in the development  of PCOS  in susceptible 80 
individuals  and weight loss has been found to improve many clinical features of PCOS.  Even a 81 
modest weight loss (5% of initial body weight) in overweight or obese women with PCOS 82 
improves ovulation frequency and conception, reduces miscarriage, hyperlipidemia, 83 
hypertension, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance .  The loss of intra -abdominal fat is 84 
specifically associated with resumption of ovulation.  Weight loss has beneficial effects on 85 
cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia and blood pressure.  Features of PCOS (e.g., 86 
hirsutism, testosterone levels, insulin resistance, menstrual cyclicity and ovulat ion) showed 87 
marked improvements, and PCOS frequently resolved after substantial weight loss induced by 88 
bariatric surgery.  Furthermore, studies show that women with PCOS  who achieve reductions in 89 
weight and waist circumference after a diagnosis of prediabe tes are twice more likely to regress 90 
to normal glycemia than those who maintained baseline weight or gained weight.  91 
While PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder among women in their reproductive 92 
years, many aspects of the condition are not fully unders tood.  The fundamental 93 
pathophysiological defect in PCOS is unknown, but women with PCOS often demonstrate insulin 94 
resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia.  Insulin resistance occurs in around 50% to 80% 95 
of women with PCOs, primarily in the more seve re NIH diagnosed PCO S and in those who are 96 
overweight.  Hyperinsulinemia may be directly responsible for the development of androgen 97 
excess, through its effects in reducing sex hormone -binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis and 98 
circulating concentrations, and i n stimulating ovarian androgen production rates.  Androgen 99 
excess, in turn, represents one of the major factors leading to altered ovarian physiology and 100 
associated ovulatory disturbances.  In addition to the association of hyperinsulinemia and insulin 101 
resistance  with the reproductive disorders that characterize PCOS, a number of metabolic 102 
abnormalities have also been associated with insulin resistance.  The insulin resistance 103 
syndrome has been characterized by glucose intolerance, hypertension and dyslipid emia.  104 
Hyperandrogenism (HA) comprises the biochemical hallmark of PCOS with elevated free 105 
testosterone levels accounting for the majority of the abnormal laboratory findings in women 106 
with oligomenorrhea.  Hyperandrogenism has also been linked with several components of 107 
metabolic syndrome.   Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of risk factors 108 
including hypertension, elevated triglycerides, low high -density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose 109 
intolerance, and obesity, which also identifies tho se at risk for cardiovascular disease.  Insulin 110 
 
4 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 resistance with subsequent hyperinsulinemia plays a major role in the development of MetS. 111 
The association of carbohydrate metabolism abnormalities with androgen excess disorders, 112 
particularly PCOS, is a well -defined entity.  In particular, androgen excess in PCOS may 113 
contribute to increased visceral fat, decreased lipolysis in subcutaneous fat, reduced insulin 114 
sensitivity in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, decreased high -density cholesterol (HDL-C) 115 
levels , and increased low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) levels.  Some studies have 116 
indicated a positive association between MetS and HA in women with PCOS.  Metabolic 117 
syndrome and its individual components are common in PCOS, particularly among women w ith 118 
the highest insulin levels and body mass index (BMI).  In women with PCOS, there is a n insulin  119 
post -binding defect in receptor signaling due to increased insulin receptor substrate -1 serine 120 
phosphorylation that selectively affects metabolic, but not mi togenic pathways in classic insulin 121 
target tissues and in the ovary.  Hyperandrogenism per se may have a role in the higher 122 
prevalence of glucose intolerance in these patients.  In the United States, 33 –47% of women 123 
with PCOS have MetS, a rate two to three  times higher than that of age -matched healthy 124 
women without PCOS.  An estimated 30 –40% of PCOS patients have IGT and 7.5 –10% have T2D.   125 
Studies suggest that the annual progression rate from normal glucose tolerance to IGT and from 126 
IGT to T2D in women is s ubstantially enhanced among women with PCOS, with the highest risk 127 
in women who are also obese and have a family history of type 2 diabetes.   128 
Excess body weight is associated with hyperandrogenism.  Sex hormone binding globulin , 129 
synthesized in the liver, not only provides transport for steroids in the blood, but also regulates 130 
hormone access to target tissues through varied degrees of binding affinity.  Furthermore, the 131 
hyperinsulinemia in obese women may directly increase free testosterone levels by lowering the 132 
SHBG  synthesis in the liver.  On the other hand, rodent models have shown that 133 
hyperandrogenism promotes insulin resistance , reduces energy expenditure , and  accordingly, 134 
increases the risk of abdominal obesity and metabo lic risk factors.   In a multiethnic sample of 135 
more than 2500 U.S. women between 42 and 52 years of age, oligomenorrhea was associated 136 
with the MetS only when coincident with HA.  Conversely, women with HA had a significantly 137 
increased risk of the MetS inde pendent of the menstrual frequency status.  Animal (rodent) 138 
studies indicate that androgens may produce IR by direct effects on skeletal muscle and adipose 139 
tissue, mediated by alterations in the insulin recept or–glycogen synthesis, by altering adipokine 140 
secretion, and by increasing visceral adiposity.  Moreover, a small study of 13 obese and 30 non - 141 
obese women showed that anti -androgen treatment partly reversed the peripheral insulin 142 
resistance ( IR) in non -obese women only, whereas central obesity may have a direct role in 143 
androgen hypersecretion.  Also, a recent study of young, overweight women suggested that the 144 
association between body fat and HA was predominantly mediated by insulin resistance.  The 145 
interrelationships between body fat, IR and HA contribu te to the complex pattern making it a 146 
difficult task to specify the role of each component.  147 
 
5 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 There is considerable heterogeneity in clinical studies among women with 148 
hyperandrogenism and there could be multiple clinical phenotypes, even in a single patient  at 149 
different ages.  Obesity significantly affects the circulating concentrations of total testosterone 150 
and SHBG.  Body fat excess, particularly visceral fat accumulation, is another common finding in 151 
these women regardless of weight and even at a young ag e.  Literature data consistently confirm 152 
that up to 8 0% of PCOS subjects are overweight or obese, with a typical central distribution of 153 
adipose tissue.  It has been hypothesized that body fat could have a direct role in determining 154 
insulin resistance and possibly androgen hypersecretion in these women, by mechanisms such 155 
as increased lipolysis, abnormal adipokine secretion, and altered steroid hormone metabolism.  156 
Body weight status was the major factor determining the risk of IGT and MetS  in women with 157 
PCOS.  However, the intricate interrelationships between body fat excess, insulin resistance, and 158 
hyperandrogenism make it difficult to assess the specific role of each of them.  Obesity -related 159 
insulin resistance and resulting hyperinsuline mia may cause a decreased SHBG  and an increased 160 
ovarian androgen production, both of which contribute to the hyperandrogenism.  However, this 161 
may form a vicious circle as hyperandrogenism may also contribute to the insulin resistance by 162 
increasing free fat ty acid flux to the liver and muscle through visceral lipolysis and, in addition, 163 
by altering muscle structure toward less insulin -sensitive muscle fibers.  Indeed, obese women 164 
with PCOS have more profound IR or T2D, gestational diabetes, dyslipidemia and risk of 165 
cardiovascular disease and greater level of androgens due to low levels of SHBG.  Ethnicity, 166 
genetic background, personal and family history, degree of obesity must all be taken into 167 
account because they might aggravate or even trigger metaboli c disturbances women with 168 
PCOS.   169 
Women suffering from PCOS are subjected to a range of symptoms associated with 170 
menstrual dysfunction, excess of androgen, which significantly influence the quality of life.  The 171 
sweet spot for intervention in PCOS occurs early in patients who don’t yet  desire pregnancy and 172 
who are experiencing the classic PCOS progressive weight gain.  This occurs at an early age, 173 
before or around the time of puberty .  Aggressive treatment at this stage will reduce the risk of a 174 
host of pot entia l health problems later.  I n addition to infertility issues, these include increased 175 
long -term risks of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, endometrial 176 
cancer, obstructive sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  Weight red uction is the 177 
most important treatment target when PCOS is linked to obesity.  Obese women referred for 178 
assistance with weight loss had a prevalence of PCOS of 28.3%.  Obesity is a great problem in 179 
women with PCOS and we do not have a conventional satisfac tory treatment for it.  Weight 180 
management by lifestyle intervention often remains unsatisfactory in obese women with PCOS.  181 
Lifestyle interventions remain essential to the management of women with PCOS; however, the 182 
majority of non -diabetic obese patients with PCOS do not reach their therapeutic goals with 183 
these interventions alone and require pharmacologic therapies.  184 
 
6 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 A great deal of attention has been given to the metabolic disturbances that accompany 185 
PCOS as well as these disturbances later in life.  The growing body of evidence linking PCOS to an 186 
inherited resistance to insulin action, aggravated by lifestyle problems such as obesity, poor diet 187 
and physical inactivity has led to trials of drug therapies in patients with PCOS.  Over the last 188 
years, conside ring the importance given to insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of the 189 
syndrome, clinical studies have focused on insulin sensitizing drugs for the treatment of women 190 
with PCOS, with metformin being the drug most extensively studied in this syndrome.  Although 191 
no antidiabetic agents have US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of 192 
PCOS, metformin was preferred due to the fact that it had the safest risk -benefit ratio, and could 193 
cause weight loss, while thiazolidinediones increased weig ht as  a result of fluid retention.  194 
Metformin acts by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and free fatty acid oxidation while 195 
increasing peripheral glucose uptake.  Early studies in PCOS suggested that metformin indirectly 196 
reduces insulin levels, dyslipidem ia and systemic inflammation; however, recent placebo - 197 
controlled trials failed to demonstrate significant metabolic benefit.  Considerable variability in 198 
the metabolic responses to metformin has been observed in women with PCOS, attributable to 199 
several pot ential factors such as different doses of the drug and genetic background.  While 200 
metformin is not a weight loss  drug it is possible that the weight loss that often accompanies 201 
protracted metformin therapy may account for some of the beneficial effects observed in many 202 
studies.   Weight loss has been claimed to be a beneficial secondary effect of extended release  203 
metformin but the effect is not very consistent.  Metformin has inconsistently demonstrated 204 
weight reduction.  In addition, metformin has been shown to have no clinically significant effect 205 
in reducing abdominal  adiposity .  Interestingly, most studies have not found any beneficial 206 
effects of metformin treatment in obese patients with PCOS.  Irrespective of treatment group 207 
(after adjustment for baseline BMI and age), only weight loss, but not the use of metformin, was 208 
associated with a significant improvement in metabo lic and reproductive function in obese 209 
women with PCOS.  Furthermore, a number of studies have substantiated the view that obesity 210 
may reduce the benefit of metformin treatment.  211 
 212 
Novelty of Study  213 
Polycystic ovary syndrome  is now recognized as one of the most common endocrine 214 
system disorders among women of reproductive age.   Earlier studies using National Institute of 215 
Health criteria estimated  PCOS affects between 5% and 10% of the female population  ages 18 to 216 
44.  The diagnostic criteria used to defin e PCOS are frequently being modified  with  the projected 217 
figure of affected women using the newer diagnostic criteria to be about one in every 10 to 15 218 
wome n.  .Most women are diagnosed during their twenties or th irties, but recent studies warn  219 
that PCOS may a ffect even prior to age of teens and as young as 11 years of age, much ahead of 220 
their puberty.  The economic burden of PCOS is significantly huge.  Around 4 billion dollars are 221 
spent annually in the United States to screen for the disease and treat its var ious morbidities, 222 
 
7 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 including hirsutism, infertility, obesity, and diabetes mellitus.   223 
The realization that hyperinsulinemia is a key component in the pathogenesis of PCOS 224 
provided a basis for advances in treatment strategies for women with the disorder. Lifestyle 225 
modification, including diet and exercise, is considered a cornerstone of the management of 226 
women with PCOS presenting with obesity, particularly the abdominal phenotype.  PCOS is 227 
characterized by a vicious cycle whereby androgen excess favors abdo minal fat deposition, 228 
which in turn aggravates insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinism, further 229 
enhancing ovarian androgen secretion.  Hence, therapeutic strategies ameliorating abdominal 230 
adiposity and weight excess may inhibit this vicious cyc le, improving not only the metabolic co - 231 
morbidities of PCOS but also androgen excess and reproductive aberrations  for overweight, 232 
anovulatory women with PCOS.  Modest weight loss ( 5-10%  of total body weight ) can improve 233 
ovulation, decrease serum androgen l evels and in some cases improve hirsutism .  While weight 234 
loss is the key in the treatments of obese patients with PCOS, current non -pharmacologic 235 
management of body weight is hard to achieve.  Thus, in the majority of patients with PCOS 236 
pharmaceutical intervention is an additional essential thera peutic aid to lifestyle changes.   237 
The genetic disruption of insulin signaling in the brain has indicated that this pathway is 238 
important for the ovulation and body weight regulation.  These insights have been directly 239 
translated into a novel  pharmacotherap y aiming to achieve weight loss for obese PCOS patients 240 
with  insulin -sensitizing drugs such as metformin and use of anti diabetes  medications .  The most 241 
widely used drug is metformin for women with PCOS and metabolic disturbances, but  the weight 242 
loss effect s of metformin are disputed .  Several studies have shown an increase in insulin 243 
sensitivity and pregnancy rate accompanied by decreased insulin and androgen levels in PCOS 244 
patients taking metformin but it has limited efficacy in obese women.  Other studies  with orlistat 245 
and metformin showed a significant reduction in body weight, androgen levels and metabolic 246 
cardiovascular risk factors in obese PCOS women.  Recently a number of anti diabetes drugs  have 247 
been approved which facilitate weight loss and improve the underlying insulin resistance.  248 
Incretin mimetics evolved as therapeutic options for the treatment of T2D primarily because of 249 
their effects on insulin and glucagon secretion, with weight loss as an additional benefit.  Early 250 
studies of human glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP-1) showed that continuous peripheral infusion 251 
was associated with decreased appetite and increased satiety .  Continuous infusion of GLP -1 252 
also was shown to improve insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and pancreatic beta cell function 253 
in individuals with T2D.  Weight loss ranging from 2 to 6 kg has been a consistent finding in 254 
studies designed to investigate the glycemic benefits of GLP -1 agonists in individuals with T2D.  255 
Additionally, this therapy has produced progressiv e weight loss in obese people without 256 
diabetes.  A recent meta -analysis concluded that GLP -1 receptor agonists not only had a 257 
significant effect on weight loss in overweight T2D patients but also in non -diabetic overweight 258 
persons, reducing subcutaneous fa t areas in particular.  The mechanisms of weight loss with 259 
GLP-1 agonists are not fully understood but may include changes in energy expenditure, changes 260 
 
8 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 in leptin sensitivity, or nausea resulting in decreased food intake.  Available clinical trials of GLP- 261 
1 receptor agonist therapy in the treatment of excess body weight in women with PCOS 262 
demonstrate that exenatide and liraglutide are effective in weight reduction either as 263 
monotherapy or in combination with metformin  (Elkind -Hirsch et al.2008 ; Jensterle e t al, 201 6).  264 
One small study has investigated the effect of liraglutide in  a subset of obese patients with PCOS 265 
and higher metabolic risk profile reporting a significantly greater weight loss with liraglutide in 266 
combination with metformin than metformin alone  (Jensterle et al, 2015 ).  Another preliminary 267 
report confirmed that liraglutide had an add -on effect on weight loss in obese women with PCOS 268 
who had lost <5% body weight during a 6 -month pre -treatment with metformin  (Jensterle et al, 269 
2014a ).  Similar  to native GLP -1, liraglutide causes glucose -dependent insulin secretion, 270 
promotes weight loss and may subsequently improve insulin resistance.  Short -term liraglutide 271 
treatment was associated with weight loss and significantly improved eating behavior in obese 272 
women with PCOS  (Jensterle et al, 2014b ).  These studies in women with PCOS also showed that 273 
androgens may be modestly decreased and menstrual frequency may be increased  (Nylan der et 274 
al, 2017 ).  Glucose parameters were  generally improved.  We reported  that treatment with 275 
exenatide for 24 weeks was superior to single agent metformin treatment in improving insulin 276 
action and reducing body weight and hyperandrogenism in obese women with PCOS  (Elkind - 277 
Hirsch et al .2008 ).  We further found  exenatide treatment in women with PCOS significantly 278 
improved first -phase insulin responses to oral glucose administration.  Since aberrant first -phase 279 
insulin secretion and impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production are major 280 
contributors to p ostprandial hyperglycemia and development of T2D, the effects of the GLP -1 281 
agonist, liraglutide, to target these defects, and normalize  glucose excursions are likely to be 282 
clinically significant in obese patients with PCOS.   283 
The drug, lirag lutide 3.0 mg was approved for chronic weight management in 284 
management in obese adults with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater or in overweight adults 285 
BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater  with at least one weight -related co -morbid condition  as an adjunct to 286 
a reduced -calorie d iet and increased physical activity .   Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP -1 287 
analog that binds to and activates the GLP -1 receptor .  It lowers body weight through decreased 288 
caloric intake while stimulating insulin secretion and reducing glucagon via  a glu cose -dependent 289 
mechanism.   For obesity management, patients may lose weight with GLP -1 receptor agonis ts 290 
due to other unique actions.   Glucagon -like peptide -1 receptor agonists (GLP -1RAs) can slow 291 
gastric  emptying and increase satiety.   While predictors of weight loss success for the general 292 
population are available (protein intake, weight loss medications), predictors of weight loss 293 
success may differ between normal and hyperandrogenic women.  Glucagon -like peptide 1 294 
agonists are linked with dose dependent weight lowering potential  in different obesity related 295 
populations.  The weight loss effects of GLP-1RAs  previously demonstrated in diabetic and obese 296 
non-diabetic patients, offer a unique opportunity to expand the medical options avail able to 297 
patients with PCOS .  Given this lack of information, the aim of the present study was to 298 
 
9 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 investigate the effects of liraglutide 3mg vs. placebo  on body composition as well as hormonal 299 
and metabolic features in non -diabetic obese women with PCOS.  300 
 301 
Study Rationale  302 
The non -diabetic obese female with PCOS offers a unique model to study the relationship 303 
between insulin resistance and adiposity.  We propose a double -blind, placebo -controlled 30 - 304 
week trial designed to directly examine  the therapeutic effe cts of liraglutide 3 mg (LIRA 3 mg) 305 
compared to placebo  on body weight, hormonal  and cardiometabolic  parameters in obese  non- 306 
diabetic women with PCOS.  All patients will receive diet and lifestyle counseling, including 307 
advice on exercise commencing during the lead -in period and continuing throughout the study.  308 
In this study, we will examine the efficacy of LIRA 3mg  on body weight and body composition, 309 
reproductive function metabolic parameters and cardiovascular risk factors  in a well -defined 310 
group of pre -menopausal obese non -diabetic women with hyperandrogenism , focusing on the 311 
relationship to obesity and insulin resistance.  Women with PCOS demonstrate abnormal body 312 
composition characterized by a greater percent body fat, body fat mass, and increased ratio of 313 
fat to lean mass (F/L ratio).  Studies using DEXA methodology report a higher degree of 314 
metabolic dysfunction in patients with PCOS which appears b e directly associated with their 315 
higher F/L ratio .  The use of DEXA technology that is simple, operator independent, safe, 316 
accurate and cost -effective will be used to assess fat quantity and distribution.  317 
There is a growing need to develop pharmacologic interventions to improve metabolic 318 
function in women with PCOS.  Given that PCOS is a frequent condition and weight loss is 319 
essential but difficult to achieve, it is important to study if the effect on body weight reported in 320 
other studies can be confirmed in a selected population of hyperandrogenic patients, especially 321 
with medications currently approved for weight reduction .  High dose liraglutide alone results 322 
in significant weight reduction in obese women  with out PCOS.   There is limited data on weight 323 
loss with high dose liraglutide in non -diabetic females with PCOS treated with this agent 324 
(Jensterle et al, 2016).  Studies  on the effect of anti -obesity medication combined with lifestyle 325 
changes on body wei ght and composition  and androgen excess  in obese women diagnosed with 326 
PCOS are lacking.  The investigators aim to elucidate the most efficacious weight reduction 327 
regime in obese PCOS women.  We hope to determine which treatment(s) addressing the 328 
multifacet ed disturbances of this disorder in  patients with PCOS and obesity  emerge s as the 329 
preferable therapy.  330 
Benefit/Risk and Ethical Assessment  331 
Glucagon -like pep tide-1 receptor agonists (GLP -1RA) are peptides that mimic native GLP - 332 
1, binding to its receptors to elicit the same effects, but at much higher pharmacological levels 333 
than the physiological profiles.  The most common treatment -related adverse effects of GLP- 334 
1RAs  are gastrointestinal in nat ure and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are usually 335 
 
10 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 mild and tend to subside over time.  The GLP-1RAs are usually  well-tolerated, with nausea being 336 
the most significant adverse side effect.  Other documented but infrequent concerns with GLP -1 337 
receptor agonists include mild injection site reactions.  When looking at the benefit –risk 338 
assessment, the GLP -1 receptor agonists demonstrate clinical advantages such as reduced risk 339 
for drug -related hypoglycemia and often favorable effects on body weigh t. 340 
Women with PCOS are more likely to be overweight or obese.  Research has increased 341 
the understanding of the persistent alterations in physiological and behavioral processes that 342 
contribute to weight gain and hamper weight loss.  Evidence suggests that p harmacotherapy for 343 
the management of obesity may modify these processes and thereby help individuals adhere to 344 
diet and exercise regimens, to lose more weight and to maintain weight loss.  Although no 345 
pharmacological agent is without some risk, LIRA  3mg  therapy appear s to have wide margins of 346 
safety when used appropriately.  The robust clinical benefits observed with th is pharmacologic 347 
agent  may confer a significant advantage to improve outcomes in patients at high risk of 348 
developing T2D and cardiovascul ar disease.   349 
 350 
Study Hypothesis  351 
Randomized, Parallel, Placebo -Controlled, Double -Blind  Prospective Study Trial  352 
This is a prospective double -blind  randomized outpatient drug efficacy study comparing 353 
the use of liraglutide (3 mg) to placebo  in nondiabetic obese women with polycystic ovary 354 
syndrome.  Seventy -two women will be allocated to treatment , in a 2:1 -subject distribution 355 
ratio, with a daily regimen liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo  (see Figure 1 -Flow of Patients through 356 
Trial)  for 28-30 w eeks of intervention .  We hypothesize that the use of the GLP -1 agonist 357 
liraglutide 3.0 mg ( LIRA 3mg) compared with placebo in obese women with PCOS will lead to a 358 
beneficial reduction  in biochemical hyperandrogenism  due to greater  reduction in body weight .   359 
The resulting weight loss will assist in decreasing insulin resistance leading to improved 360 
hormonal and cardio metabolic parameters in this patient population. , To investigate this, we 361 
will perform a randomized double -blind clinical trial (RCT) treating  obese women with PCOS with 362 
either liraglutide or placebo for 2 8-30 weeks.  363 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  364 
 365 
Primary objective  366 
The primary objective s of this study are to compare  the therapeutic impact of liraglutide 367 
3 mg  versus placebo  on reduction of body weight and biochemical hyperandrogenism (as 368 
determined by the free androgen index) in obese  non-diabetic women with PCOS. We will  1) 369 
determine the percentage of participants achievi ng ≥5% reduction in baseline body weight with 370 
each treatment  and 2) assess the inh ibition of biochemical hyperandrogenism (ovarian androgen 371 
production  and sex hormone binding capacity)  in response to each treatment . 372 
 
11 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 Secondary study objectives   373 
The secondary study objectives are to determine the effect of treatment with anti- 374 
obesity medication versus placebo  on anthropometric, clinical , hormonal and metabolic 375 
parameters  in non -diabetic obese women with hyperandrogenism.  376 
 377 
EFFICACY VARIABLES/M EASURES  378 
Primary endpoints  379 
The co -primary end points are to compare obese women with PCOS receiving liraglutide 3mg 380 
(LIRA 3 mg) with those receiving placebo on body weight and bioavailable ovarian androgen 381 
concentrations as determined by:  382

1b percentage of participants achieving ≥5% reduction in body weight from baseline 384 
to week 30  385 
2 reduction  of free androgen index [FAI=testosterone (T)/sex hormone binding 386 
globulin (SHBG) levels] from baseline to 30 weeks  387 
Secondary endpoints  388 
We will further e xamine the impact of the administration of these pharmacotherapies in obese 389 
non-diabetic PCOS women on: 390 
Anthropometric  and Clinical  Indices  391 
1. Change from baseline of body mass index [BMI], absolute body weight, waist 392 
circumference  (WC) , waist: hip ratio  (WHR) , waist -height ratio  (WHtR) , and whole -body 393 
dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry [DXA])  measures of body composition (trunk fat mass 394 
and truck fat/extremities fat ratio ) to determine the relative contribution of changes in 395 
fat mass (FM) vs. lean mass ( LM) to overall weight loss at week 30 396 
2. Compare women with hyperandrogenism for frequency of patients achieving a body 397 
weight reduction of at least 10% [Time Frame from baseline to 30 weeks]  398 
3. Change in menstruation frequency (normalized to the number of menst ruations per 399 
year)  from before and after 30 weeks of treatment  400 
Metabolic Parameters  401 
1. Change in glycemic values from baseline to 30weeks  402 
2. Fasting and 2 ho ur glucose levels after an OGTT  403 
3. Surrogate measures of insulin action derived from 75 gram OGTT [insulin s ensitivity index 404 
(HOMA -IR, Matsuda index), corrected early insulin secretory response (insulinogenic 405 
index/HOMA -IR), area under the curve (AUC) for insulin and glucose,  and oral disposition 406 
index (product of Matsuda index and insulinogenic index; SI OGTT x Δinsul in 30–0 min to 407 
glucose  30–0 min)]  408 
 
12 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 Cardiovascular Risk Factors ( change from baseline to 30 weeks ) 409 
1. Plasma lipid fraction s 410 
2. Blood pressure  411 
Other endocrine levels (change from baseline to 30 weeks)  412 
1. Adrenal androgen  concentration - dehydroepiandrosterone  sulfate ( DHEAS) levels  413 
The following will  be documented for each patient:  414 
1. Presence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) will be recorded using modified National 415 
Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria which are inclusive of presence of oligo -/amenorrhea 416 
(cycle  >35 days  or <8 cycles year ), and clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, 417 
after exclusion of related disorders.   Other causes to bleeding irregularities and androgen 418 
excess will be excluded.  419 
2. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) will also be documented and defin ed (2005 National 420 
Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III) as the presence of at least 421 
three of the following criteria: abdominal obesity (waist circumference >80 cm in 422 
women); serum triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/L; serum HDL <1.3 mmol/L; systol ic blood 423 
pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg; and fasting plasma 424 
glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L  425 
 426 
Safety variables/Measures  427 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by collating data on treatment -emergent adverse 428 
events (AE), laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs.  Prevention of pregnancy 429 
will be monitored monthly by both laboratory and home pregnancy testing.  All patients will be 430 
educated about not becoming pregnant and perform monthly urine home pregnancy tests 431 
during the m onths that they do not have laboratory evaluations.  Patients will be educated 432 
about the side effects and use of liraglutide 3.0 mg and the injection delivery system.  Liraglutide 433 
3.0 mg is a well -tolerated long -term weight loss agent.  The most common exp ected AEs 434 
(prevalence >5%) are nausea, dia rrhea, constipation, vomiting,  dyspepsia, fatigue, dizziness, and 435 
abdominal pain (see reference 77 - prescribing information) .  Patients will be asked about the 436 
most common adverse events related to liraglutide such as nausea, headache, diarrhea, 437 
constipation and vomiting if not volunteered.  This protocol and the associated Informed 438 
Consent as well as any addenda or amendments, must be reviewed and approved by the 439 
Woman’s Hospital Institutional Review Board (WHI RB) review committee prior to the start of the 440 
study.  All revisions to this Protocol are considered “protocol amendments; these must be 441 
approved in advance, in writing, by the WHIRB.  Every patient will have given her written 442 
informed consent prior to par ticipating in the study.  Prior to participation in this trial, each 443 
subject will have an opportunity to ask questions and will sign (and date) a written Informed 444 
Consent, which must be witnessed.  The signed consent forms will be filed with the 445 
 
13 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 investigat or's study charts for each subject.  Any subject may voluntarily withdraw from the 446 
study at any time without prejudicing treatment . 447 
 448 
STUDY PLANS AND PROCEDURES  449 
Subjects  450 
Up to 9 2 non-diabetic  women  with PCOS , aged 18 years to 4 5 years of age, meeting BMI 451 
criteria, will be invited to participate.  We will define hyperandrogenism using biochemical 452 
evidence (elevated testosterone and/or free androgen index with exclusion of androgen 453 
secreting tumors ).  Subjects will be recruited using flyers distr ibuted in the metabolic clinic, 454 
gynecology clinics and pathology laboratory associated with Woman’s Hospital.  All participants 455 
will be provided a written informed consent and be asked to sign a copy before being enrolled in 456 
the study.  The Woman’s Hospita l Institutional Review Board (WHIRB) will have approved both 457 
the protocol and consent.  All subjects will undergo a verbal screen, and if they are eligible and 458 
sign a medical release form, their medical records will be obtained to confirm their medical 459 
history. All subjects will provide a medical and gynecological history including assessment of  460 
regularity and length of the menstrual cycle , with recording of menses in the 12 -month period 461 
before the study.   Patients will be specifically asked about the numbe r of menses in previous 12 462 
months (menstrual frequency ).  To be eligible for the study, subjects will be required to have 463 
irregular periods (cycle length outside 24 –35 days or <8 cycles per year) .  All enrolled patients 464 
will then undergo baseline clinical and laboratory evaluations to exclude diabetes, thyroid 465 
disorder, significant hyperprolactinemia, elevated liver enzymes and/or severe 466 
hypertriglycidemia.  A negative serum pregnancy test is a prerequisite for c ommencing 467 
treatment.  Subjects will be instructed to use  an IUD or  double barrier methods of contraception 468 
(unless sterilized) during the study since hormonal methods are not permitted. Glycemic status 469 
will be measured at the beginning and end of each trea tment period by a standard 75 g oral 470 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT).  Obese women who meet study eligibility criteria (see inclusion 471 
and exclusion criteria) will be eligible to be randomized to treatment .  We anticipate that 72 472 
women will be randomized to t reatment (this allows for 20 women to fail screening).   Exclusion 473 
criteria include any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would place the subject at 474 
increased risk or otherwise make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.  475

STUDY PLANS  AND PROCEDURES  533 
Treatment Regimen  534 
Obese non -diabetic women with PCOS will be treated for 28-30 weeks with either 535 
liraglutide 3 mg ( LIRA 3mg) or placebo  (see Figure 1 -Flow of Patients through Trial).    536 
 537

Version 6, 5/15 /18 
 538 
Study Assessments  539 
Following written consent, all participants will undergo the following clinical, metabolic 540 
and laboratory evaluations before, during and after 30 weeks of treatment.  To ensure that 541 
 
17 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 patients remain unidentified, all study subjects will be assigned an indiv idual study identifier 542 
which includes the study acronym, patient initials, and unique number. All blood samples will be 543 
obtained and results identified and reported using this unique study identifier.  544 
A. Baseline (Pretreatment) assessment - A full physical examination will be performed and 545 
vital signs (blood pressure, respiration and temperature) determined.  Trained personnel using 546 
standardized protocols at the baseline and follow -up examination will obtain anthropometric 547 
measurements and blood specimens.  Absolute body weight, height, waist and hip 548 
circumference, body fat distribution (waist/hip {WHR}) and waist/height ratio ({WHtR}) and 549 
blood pressure (BP) will be determined.  Body weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg 550 
using a calibrated digital sc ale with participants in light clothing and no shoes.  Height will be 551 
measured to the nearest centimeter .  The total body adiposity (total fatness), defined as the 552 
accumulation of body fat without regard to regional distribution, will be expressed as BMI a nd 553 
calculated as weight (kg)/ height (m) 2.  The circumference measurements will be taken in the 554 
upright position using a 15 -mm width flexible metric tape held close to the body but not tight 555 
enough to indent the skin.  Waist circumference (WC) will be mea sured at the narrowest level 556 
midway between the lowest ribs and the iliac crest and hip circumference measured at the 557 
widest level over the buttocks while the subjects are standing and breathing normally.  The WHR 558 
and WHtR will be calculated for  measure of  body fat distribution.  559 
Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) with glucose (G) and insulin (I) measured at 0, 30, 60, 560 
and 120 after glucose load to assess diabetes, fasting (FBG) and mean blood glucose (MBG) 561 
concentrations, insulin resistance and pancreatic beta -cell function will be determined prior to 562 
randomization and at 30-32 weeks after full doses of study medications are reached.  Mean  563 
blood glucose  (MBG) concentrations  will be calculated by summing glucose values obtained at 564 
0,30,60 and 120 minutes during the  OGTT and dividing by 4.   At the initial lab evaluation , a 565 
complete metabolic profile (Chem 12) and calculated eGFR, TSH, prolactin, hemoglobin A1C , and  566 
beta -hCG levels will be d etermined for study inclusion .  A baseline blood sample will also be 567 
used to measure an androgen profile (total testosterone [T], dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 568 
[DHEAS], sex hormone -binding globulin [ SHBG]), and a lipid panel (total cholesterol, high -density 569 
lipoprotein [HDL -C], low -density lipoprotein [LDL -C], and triglycerides [TRG] . 570 
Body composition analyses will be performed using dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry 571 
(DXA) (Hologic Discovery A model, software version 12.5; Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) at the 572 
start and completion of the study trial.  For the scan, the participants will be asked to  change 573 
into a hospital gown and asked  to lie supine on on the table with hands by the side palms facing 574 
down away from the thighs and look at the ceiling to maintain head position .  DXA can esti mate 575 
3 body compartments consisting of fat mass, lean body mass, and bone mass.  The relative 576 
attenuation of two different x -ray energies by body tissues produces a three -component model 577 
comprising total fat mass (FM), total lean mass (LM including fluid a nd muscle), and  total body 578 
bone mineral content (BMC) and density.  DXA also has the ability to determine body 579 
 
18 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 composition in defined regions such as the arms, legs, and trunk.  D XA measurements are based 580 
in part on the assumption that the hydration of fat -free mass remains constant at 73%.  Total 581 
body fat mass [FM]) and fat content of head, trunk and extremities (arms+ legs) is provided by 582 
the software.  Default software readings provide lines positioned to divide the body into six 583 
compartments, i.e. head, trunk, arms and legs.  The trunk is defined by a horizontal line below 584 
the chin, vertical lines between trunk and arms and oblique lines passing through the colli 585 
femuri.  The re gion below this lower border of the trunk, including both legs and the hip region 586 
is called lower body region.  For each region of the whole body, fat and lean body mass and BMC 587 
are determined.  Standard software options are used to calculate the total fat-free mass ( FFM), 588 
fat mass (FM) vs. lean mass (LM) .   589 
For a better description of the sex specific fat distribution the fat distribution index (FDI) 590 
will be calculated as:  591 
FDI = Upper body fat mass in kg/Lower body fat mass in kg  592 
A fat distribution index below 0.9 indicates a gynoid fat distribution, i.e. the fat mass of the 593 
lower body surpassed the fat mass of the upper body.  A fat distribution index >1.1 defines an 594 
android fat distribution. In this case the amount of fat tissue of the abdominal region s urpassed 595 
the fat mass of the lower body.  An FDI between 0.9 and 1.1 is classified as an intermediate 596 
stage of fat distribution. We will use the FDI for further quantification of the fat distribution 597 
compared to the widely used waist to hip ratio.  The WHR  describes body shape and silhouette 598 
while the FDI provides the quantitative amount of fat distribution.  Nevertheless we have to be 599 
aware that the FDI describes not the ratio of abdominal fat to gluteal -femoral fat, but the ratio 600 
between upper body fat, i ncluding abdominal fat and breast fat mass, and lower body fat.  601 
Following baseline screening, eligible patients will be randomly assigned , in a 2:1 ratio, to 602 
receive once -daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide, starting at a dose of 0.6 mg with 603 
weekly 0.6 -mg increments to 3.0 mg, or placebo; both groups will also receive counseling on 604 
lifestyle modification .  All subjects will be allocated to one of these 2 groups based on computer - 605 
generated random numbers using a block randomization method .  The randomization list will be 606 
generated at the study site by the unblinded research assistant .  Liraglutide and placebo will be 607 
provided in pre-filled pens  (Novo Nordisk) .  The study drug (liraglutide and placebo) will 608 
delivered in identical prefilled pens, labeled with serial numbers and accompanied by a 609 
dispensing unit list .  Printed directions for use of the medication will be handed out to subjects 610 
before administration of trial drug .  All patients will receive the same instructions  on how to 611 
take  the medicine .  As investigators and participants are blinded  to drug assignment , an 612 
independent unblinded  research assistant will instruct  the investigators as to which serial 613 
numbers to supply each woman with.  The participants will be  randomized in a 2:1 ratio 614 
(liraglutide: placebo ), as we believe that this will facilitate the recruitment to the study.  615 
B. Treatment - all patients will be dispensed 5 months (18 weeks) of liraglutide 3 mg (LIRA  3 616 
mg) treatment or placebo and 4 home pregna ncy test kits.  617 
 
19 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 Patients on LIRA  -Start injection 0.6 mg SC QD 1week, step up to 1.2 mg SC QD 1  week, to 618 
1.8 mg SC QD 1 week, 2.4 mg SC QD 1week, to a max dose of 3.0 mg SQ daily .  619 
Patients on PL  -Start injection 0.6 mg SC QD 1week, step up to 1.2 mg SC QD 1 week, to 620 
1.8 mg SC QD 1 week, 2.4 mg SC QD 1week, to a max dose of 3.0 mg SQ daily . 621 
All patients will be called monthly to document the results of their home pregnancy tests 622 
and to assess compliance with the medication .  Patients  will receive the same counseling 623 
concerning the benefits of lifestyle modification through diet and exercise.  The patients will be 624 
also encouraged to increase daily exercise (such as walking, using stairs)  although this will not be 625 
formally assessed .  Th e participants will receive further encouragement to adhere to the regime 626 
by frequent contact using  follow -up phone calls.  Side effects of the treatment and reason for 627 
any withdrawals from the study will be recorded.  628 
C. Week 16 -18 assessment - Patients wi ll return to clinic for an 18 -week re -evaluation of 629 
clinical and anthropometric variables (height, weight, body mass index [BMI], waist and hip 630 
circumference and blood pressure) and a safety assessment.  A serum pregnancy test and 631 
complete metabolic profil e (Chem 12) and calculated eGFR will also be performed.  Side effects 632 
of the treatment and reason for any withdraws from the study will be recorded.  Another 18 633 
weeks of medication will be dispensed and  4 home pregnancy test kits following a  negative 634 
serum  pregnancy test.  635 
D. Final (week 30-32) assessment - After 28 weeks of treatment, patients will be 636 
scheduled for final evaluation.  They will be instructed to stop medications 1 week prior to their 637 
laboratory assessment visit.  All  laboratory tests (except prolactin, TSH and hemoglobin A1C ) will 638 
be repeated.  All anthropometric parameters and physi cal including vital signs and D XA will again 639 
be performed and calculations will be repeated for post -treatment effects.   640 
 641 
During the study period, cycle c ontrol will be assessed daily by the subjects using a 642 
menstrual diary.  Vaginal bleeding will be classified by the subject as either spotting (requiring at 643 
least one pad/tampon per day) or bleeding (two or more pads/ tampons per day).  The effects of 644 
treat ment intervention on menstrual abnormalities will be  evaluated by assess ing post - 645 
treatment changes in menstruation frequency over 30 weeks from the patient’s menstrual cycle 646 
diary and normalized to the number of menstruations per year (52 weeks).  647 
All side -effects will also be recorded and summarized for the 30 week -treatment period.  648 
During the whole study period, compliance to t he treatment will be documented.  C ompliance 649 
with treatment will be checked by questioning about the side -effects and a s ubjective evaluation 650 
of the tolerability of the administered drug; the patients will also asked about incidental missed 651 
administrations and whether they had correctly followed the scheduled treatment.  Questioning 652 
regarding the occurrence of adverse events  and use of concomitant medication will take place 653 
throughout the trial.  654 
 655

Destruction of Investigational Product - If the study drugs a re to be destroyed on site, it is 676 
the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal, and 677 
that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, 678 
guidelines, and institutional pr ocedures.  Appropriate records of the disposal will be maintained.  679 
 680 
Biological Sampling Procedures  681 
Laboratory Measures  682 
Hormonal and metabolic parameters will be measured at baseline and 30 weeks of 683 
treatment .  All participants will undergo  a standard 2 -h oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) after 684 
an overnight fast (10 –12 h) .  Blood samples for the determination of glucose and insulin levels  685 
will be obtained in the fasting state  (time 0) and collected at 1/2, 1, and 2 h after a standardized 686 
75 g oral glucose load  (OGTT with INS) .  Blood samples will be centrifuged, divided into aliquots, 687 
and assayed.  Plasma glucose levels will be determined with a glucose analyzer using the glucose 688 
oxidase method (Glucose Reagent Kit, Bayer Newbury, UK).  Serum insulin will b e determined in 689 
all samples in duplicate by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Abbott AxSYM System,  Abbott 690 
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL ).  Levels of total cholesterol, high -density  lipoprotein cholesterol 691 
(HDL -C) and triglycerides will be determined in the  initial basal sample using standard enzymatic 692 
colorimetric assays on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer whereas low -density lipoprotein 693 
 
21 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 cholesterol (LDL -C) will be calculated according to the Friedewald equation.  Electrolytes, serum 694 
creatinine, and  liver enzymes will be measured using standard automated kinetic enzymatic 695 
assay.  Circulating levels of TSH, prolactin, ß human chorionic gonadotropin (ßhCG), testosterone, 696 
sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and DHEAS will be measured using a two -site sa ndwich 697 
immunoassay with direct chemiluminometric technology (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA).  698 
The intra - and interassay coefficients of variation are less than 7 and 11%, respectively, over the 699 
sample concentration range.   700 
Assessment of Insulin Sen sitivity and S ecretion  701 
Indices  of insulin sensitivity and secretion using the serum glucose and insulin 702 
concentrations obtained in the fasting state and during the 2hr OGTT will be computed by 703 
several previously validated  measures .  Fasting and glucose -stimulated insulin sensitivity will be 704 
estimated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity (HOMA -IR) and by Matsuda's 705 
insulin sensitivity index (SI OGTT).  Early pancreatic beta ( β)-cell response will be estimated as the 706 
insulinogenic index (IGI) derived from the ratio of the increment of insulin to that of glucose 30 707 
minutes after a glucose load ( insulin 30 min − insulin 0 min/glucose 30 min − glucose 0 min ) 708 
corrected for by the relative level of insulin resistance (IGI/HOM A-IR).  The area  under the curve 709 
(AUC) for glucose and insulin will be calculated using the mathematical model developed by Tai 710 
using measures  obtained during the OGTT .  An estimation of β -cell compensatory function, the 711 
insulin secretion -sensitivity index  (IS-SI) will be derived by applying the concept of the 712 
disposition index to measurements obtained during the 2 -h OGTT .  The composite IS -SI is 713 
defined as the product of 1) insulin secretion as measur ed by insulinogenic index (IGI)  and 2) 714 
insulin sensitivi ty as measured by the Matsuda index ( ΔINS/Δ GLU 30 x Matsuda SI OGTT).  The IS -SI 715 
is a validated OGTT -derived measure of β -cell function analogous to the disposition index 716 
obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test .  Improving β-cell compensatory function 717 
(increasing insulin sensitivity and enhancing insulin release after an oral glucose load) is 718 
reflective of improvement and/or delays in declining glucose tolerance.  719 
The most frequent biochemical parameters of androgen excess include elevated total  720 
testosterone or free androgen index (FAI).  Baseline blood samples will be  collected for 721 
measurement of total testosterone  (T) and sex hormone -binding globulin (SHBG) 722 
concentrations. The free androgen index (FAI) is calculated from the total T concentration 723 
(nmol/l)/ concentration of SHBG (nM/L) x100.  While clinical markers of hyperandrogenism in 724 
females include cutaneous manifestations such as the presence of acne, hirsutism and/or m ale 725 
pattern alopecia, many of these will not be altered with 30 weeks of therapy.     726 
 727 
Collateral Research  728 
Several other endpoints will be assessed at each study visit.  Baseline blood samples will 729 
also be  collected for measurement of lipid profiles (chole sterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and 730 
 
22 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 triglycerides), adrenal androgens (DHEAS), and liver enzymes (AST/ALT).  Dyslipidemia is defined 731 
as the presence of at least one of the mentioned lipid parameters abnormalities.  732 
Safety assessments  733 
The safety and tolerability assessments will include incidence and intensity of adverse 734 
events, withdrawals because of adverse events, physical exams, vital sign measurements and 735 
clinical laboratory parameters.  Patients will be seen at 16-18 weeks and 30-32 weeks for 736 
laboratory evaluation for a  complete chemistry  profile  and to  confirm they are not pregnant . 737 
Patients will also  be required to perform monthly home pregnancy tests.  738 
STATISTICAL/ANALYTIC AL PLAN  739 
Statistical Methods  740 
Statistical analysis will be  performed using SPSS version  15.1  for Windows ( SPSS, Inc.; 741 
Chicago, IL ).  Continuous variables will be tested for normality of distribution using the 742 
Kolmogorov -Smirov test.  When necessary, non -normally distributed data will be subjected to 743 
logarithmic o r square -root transformation to obtain a normal distribution where necessary for 744 
subsequent analyses.  The primary endpoints are  comparison of percent change in body weight 745 
and therapeutic impact on biochemical hyperandrogenism (as determined by FAI) from baseline 746 
to week 30 of treatment .  The secondary endpoints  include changes in surrogate measures of 747 
insulin action (HOMA -IR, SIOGTT, IGI/HOMA -IR and IS-SI) and glycemic parameters (fasting blood 748 
glucose [FBG] and 2 hour post OGTT glucose) , glucose and insulin AUC,  and mean blood glucose 749 
(MBG), anthropometric parameters ( BMI, absolute weight , WC  and fat distribution by D XA), 750 
blood pressure, lipid profiles, and adrenal androgen levels (DHEAS ).  Direct and indirect 751 
estimates of insulin sensitivity and secr etion (HOMA, SI OGTT, IGI/HOMA, β-cell compensatory 752 
function , glycemic parameters (FBG, MBG, 2 hour post OGTT glucose level , AUC ) anthropometric 753 
measurements (body weight, BMI), fat distribution (WC, WHR and WHtR), BP, androgen and 754 
lipid profiles will be considered as dependent variables.   755 
For all analyses, in which the measures are continuous, data from evaluable subjects will 756 
be submitted to a repeated -measures general linear model (SS/ Drug treatments x repeated 757 
measures ANOVA) including the arm of drug treatment (liraglutide 3mg vs. placebo) as the 758 
between -subjects effect, and the visit (baseline and 30 wks ) as the within -subje cts effect.  To 759 
evaluate the differences in the response to each treatment over visits, the interaction effect will 760 
be calculated.  Baseline comparisons between groups will be made by one -way ANOVAs.  761 
Frequency of patients achieving a body weight reduction of at least 5% and 10%  before 762 
and after treatment will be compared with the McNemar test (complex chi square [χ2] for 763 
paired data), which formally tests for a change between the observed proportions of  k related 764 
samples.  Dysglycemia occurrence before and after different treatment will also be compared 765 
 
23 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 with the McNemar test .  The difference in frequency of menstruation before and after 766 
treatment will also be compared using  the McNemar test .  767 
Data will be analyzed on completed treatment parameters where relevant (evaluable 768 
population).   The evaluable population is defined as all randomized subjects who complete 769 
treatment through week 30-32 week.   Results will be reported as mean +/ - S.E.M for normally 770 
distributed data and as median (interquartile range) if the distribution is not normal. Categorical 771 
data will be presented as percentage.  P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.  772 
 773 
Sample Size and Justification  774 
A priori  sample size analysis was performed using the online calculator provided by the 775 
Massachusetts General Hospital Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center 776 
(http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/sa mple_size/size.html ).  To calculate sample size, we used the 777 
standard formula suggested for clinical trials by considering a type one error (α) of 0·05 and type 778 
two error (β) of 0·20 (power = 80%).   Sample size calculation revealed that 57 participants 779 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio ( liraglutide: placebo ) were needed .  Using a 3 0% drop -out rate, the 780 
study is designed to recruit 9 2 patients , enroll 48 liraglutide and 24 placebo  to ensure that the 781 
number of subjects completing the study ( 38 LIRA/19 PL ) as derived by the sample size 782 
calculation is met.  783 
 784 
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements  785 
This protocol and the associated Informed consent as well as any addenda or 786 
amendments, must be reviewed and approved by the Woman’s Hospital Foundation 787 
Institutional Review Board (WHIRB) review committee prior to the start of the study.  788 
Recruitment materials and advertising must be reviewed and approved by the WHIRB prior to 789 
use.  All revisions to this Protocol are considered “protocol amendments” these must be 790 
approved in advance , in writing, by the WHIRB.  Every patient will have given her written 791 
informed consent prior to participating in the study.  Prior to participation in this trial, each 792 
subject will have an opportunity to ask questions and will sign (and date) a written In formed 793 
Consent, which must be witnessed.  The signed consent forms will be filed with the 794 
investigator's study charts for each subject.  A copy of the informed consent will be provided to 795 
the subject.  Any subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study at  any time without 796 
prejudicing treatment.  797 
Good Clinical Practice - This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical 798 
Practice (GCP), as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and in 799 
accordance with the ethical principles underlying the United States Code of Federal Regulations, 800 
Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).  The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol.  All 801 
potential serious breaches must be reported to Novo Nordisk  (NOVO ) immediately.  A serious 802 
breach is a  breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the 803 
 
24 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental 804 
integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the study. Study personnel 805 
involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to 806 
perform their respective tasks.  This study will not use the services of study personnel where 807 
sanctions have been invoked or where there has been  scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of 808 
medical licensure; debarment).  809 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have assigned pregnancy  category 810 
X to Saxenda (3 mg  liraglutide ).  Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated there is 811 
positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or 812 
marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly 813 
outweigh potential benefits.   Safer alternatives exist.  If patients become pregnant during the 814 
study, all medications will be stopped and the patient will discontinue from the study.  815 
For safety, all subjects who enter the study are evaluable.  Subjects wil l be monitored for 816 
safety by assessment of adverse events, physical exams, vital signs and laboratory values.  817 
Continued patient safety assessment will be carried out and all adverse events documented and 818 
reported to the WHIRB.  On each visit, compliance w ith treatment will be checked with 819 
questions about the side -effects and a subjective evaluation of the tolerability of the 820 
administered drug; the patients will also asked about incidental missed administrations.  821 
Adverse events will be evaluated on a continuous basis while the patient is on study and 822 
until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  Patients should be followed until all treatment - 823 
related adverse events have recovered to baseline or are deemed irrev ersible by the principal 824 
investigator . 825 
 826 
Adverse Event Procedures     827 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening 828 
of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an 829 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 830 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an 831 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of  832 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  833 
An Adverse Reaction (AR)  is defined as a ny untoward and unintended responses to an 834 
investigational medicinal product related  to any dose administered  Thus, for an AR, a causal 835 
relationship must be at least suspected by the medical practitioner.  Unexpected Adverse 836 
Reaction (UAR)  is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 837 
applicable product information (e.g. investigator’s broch ure for an investigational product or 838 
summary of product characteristics for an authorized  product ). 839 
 
25 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to 840 
assess all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one  of the following:  841 
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and 842 
the AE.  843 
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug 844 
administration and the AE.  845 
The term "reasonable causal relati onship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 846 
relationship.  847 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 848 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not 849 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  850 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  or Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) or Suspected Unexpected 851 
Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)   852 
A serious adverse event  (experience)  or adverse  reaction  is any untoward medical 853 
occurrence that at any dose:  854 
 results in death  855 
 is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 856 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 857 
were more severe)  858 
 requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 859 
NOTE  below)  860 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  861 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  862 
 is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 863 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 864 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g., 865 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 866 
above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 867 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 868 
do no t result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered 869 
an important medical event.  870 
Serious adverse reaction (SAR): an adverse event fulfilling both the criteria for a Serious Adverse 871 
event (SAE) and the criteria for an  Adverse Reaction (ADR).  872 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction is known as a SUSAR .  Sometimes during a 873 
clinical trial , there may be serious adverse reactions in subjects given the drug, which  may or 874 
 
26 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 may not be dose related, but are unexpected, a s they are not consistent with current 875 
information  and regarded as possibly or probably related to the trial/study product by the 876 
investigator.  877 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 878 
drug is an SAE.  879 
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 880 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs.  881 
NOTE :   882 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:   883 
 a visit to the em ergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 884 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  885 
 elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  886 
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/s urgical procedure  887 
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 888 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy)  889 
 medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 890 
into the study. Appropriate documentati on is required in these cases  891 
 admission  encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 892 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic 893 
inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  894 
1A. Serious Adve rse Event Collection and Reporting  895 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 896 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated 897 
with protocol -specified procedures.  All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening 898 
period and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing.  The investigator should report any SAE 899 
that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol - 900 
specified procedure.  All SAEs, whether they are related or not related to study drug, and 901 
pregnancies must be reported to Novo Nordisk  (or designee) within 24 hours.  They will also be 902 
reported immediately to the Woman’s Hospital Foundation Institutional Re view Board at (225) 903 
231-5296 and Woman’s Health Research Department  at (225) 231 -5275.  SAEs must be recorded 904 
on an SAE Report Form or similar form (e.g. CIOMS, MedWatch); pregnancies on a Novo Nordisk  905 
approved Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  Reports are to be transmitted via email or confirmed 906 
facsimile (fax) transmission.  907 
Investigators and other site personnel must inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs 908 
form, of any serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting 909 
obligations of 21 CFR 312.32, and will concurrently forward all such reports to Novo Nordisk .  A 910 
copy of the MedWatch/AdEERs report must be be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile 911 
 
27 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 (fax) transmission  to Novo Nordisk  at the time the event is reported to the FDA.   It is the 912 
responsibility of the investigator to compile all necess ary information and ensure that the FDA 913 
receives a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines and to ensure that these 914 
reports are also submitted to Novo Nordisk  at the same time.  915 
When reporting to Novo Nordisk , a cover page  should accompany the 916 
MedWatch/AdEERs  form indicating the following:  917 
 Investigator Sponsored Study (ISS)  918 
 The investigator IND number assigned by the FDA  (if applicable)  919 
 The investigator’s name and address  920 
 The trial name/title and Novo Nordisk  ISS reference number  921 
  922 
Investigative site must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the 923 
causality  of events in relation to all study medications  and if the SAE is related to disease 924 
progression , as determined by the principal investigator.  An SAE r eport should be completed for 925 
any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.  If the investigator believes that an SAE 926 
is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as 927 
withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should 928 
be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  All SAE reports and accompanying 929 
cover page will be transmitted to Novo Nordisk via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 930 
transmission.  931 
Serious adverse events  that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA need to be 932 
reported to Novo Nordisk  preferably using the MedDRA coding language for serious adverse 933 
events.  In the case of blinded trials, the investigator will  provid e a copy of the randomization 934 
list or unblind those SAEs which require expedited reporting.  935 
All SAEs will be reported to Novo Nordisk , whether or not considered causally related to 936 
the investigational product.  All SAEs will be documented.  The investigator is responsible for 937 
informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  If an 938 
ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes 939 
available, a follow -up SAE repor t should be sent within 24 hours to Novo Nordisk  (or designee) 940 
using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  941 
In cases where the investigator learns of the SAE after its occurrence and resolution, the 942 
time and circumstances of the event will be recorded.  The reporting requirements will still be 943 
followed .  All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  944 
Nonserious Adverse Events  945 
A nonserious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  946 
2A. Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  947 
 
28 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. 948 
Nonserious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in period or 949 
other observational period intended to establish  a baseline status for the subjects.  950 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if 951 
they become serious.  Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or 952 
discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 953 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE 954 
page of the study record .  955 
Completion of supplemental study records  may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory 956 
abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.  957 
Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  958 
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE 959 
study rec ord page or SAE Report Form as appropriate : 960 
 Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  961 
 Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug 962 
discontinued or interrupted  963 
 Any lab oratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 964 
therapy.  965 
 966 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by 967 
the reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglob in value).  968 
 969 
Pregnancy  970 
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a 971 
study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product 972 
exposure, including during at least 6 half -lives after product administration, the investigational 973 
product w ill be permanently discontinued.  974 
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on 975 
the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x -ray studies). Oth er appropriate 976 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.  977 
The investigator must immediately notify Novo Nordisk  (or designee) Medical Monitor of this 978 
event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to Novo Nordisk  (or designee) 979 
within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 1A.   980 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 981 
neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information mus t be reported on the 982 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  983 
 
29 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 Overdose  984 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a 985 
product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose 986 
must be reported as an SAE (see Section 1A for reporting details.).  987 
1. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  988 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities 989 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. A ll occurrences of potential DILIs, 990 
meeting the defined criteria, must b e reported as SAEs (see Section 1A for reporting details).  991 
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  992 
AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  993 
AND  994 
Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 995 
alkaline phosphatase),  996 
AND  997 
No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 998 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing  chronic or acute liver disease, or 999 
the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  1000  
 1001  
2. Adverse Events of Special Interest  1002  
Certain serious adverse events are informative as single cases because they are uncommon 1003  
and are known to be strongly asso ciated with drug exposure ( in accordance with the reporting 1004  
obligations of 21 CFR 312.32) .  The occurrence of even one case of such adverse events would 1005  
meet the definition of suspected adverse reaction (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the 1006  
drug caused them).  1007  
In this study, the following adverse events are to be reported to Novo Nordisk , regardless of 1008  
whether these reports are classified as serious or unexpected:  1009  
1. liver test abnormalities a ccompanied by jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia  1010  
2. opportunistic infections  1011  
3. pancreatitis  1012  
4.  anaphylaxis  1013  
5. angioedema  1014  
6.  Steven -Johnson’s Syndrome  1015  
 1016  
When one of these events meets the criteria for a serious adverse event, report the event using 1017  
SAE reporting procedures. When one of these events does not meet the criteria for a serious 1018  
adverse event, report the event within 24 hours as a non -serious event.  1019  
 
30 
Version 6, 5/15 /18 3. Other Safety Considerations  1020  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical exa minations, 1021  
electrocardiogram, x -ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required 1022  
by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate . 1023  
 1024  
Discontinuations  1025  
The reason for a subject discontinuing from the  study will be recorded in the patient chart.  1026  
A discontinuation occurs when an enrolled subject ceases participation in the study, regardless 1027  
of the circumstances, prior to completion of the protocol.  The investigator must determine the 1028  
primary reason fo r discontinuation.  Withdrawal due to adverse event will be distinguished from 1029  
withdrawal due to insufficient response according to the definition of adverse event noted 1030  
earlier.  The final evaluation required by the protocol will be performed at the time of study 1031  
discontinuation.  The investigator will record the reason for study discontinuation, provide or 1032  
arrange for appropriate follow -up (if required) for such subjects, and document the course of 1033  
the subject’s condition.  They will also to be reported t o Woman’s Hospital Foundation 1034  
Institutional Review Board at (225) 231 -5296 and Woman’s Health Research  Department  at 1035  
(225) 231 -5275.  1036  
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product for any of the following reasons:  1037  
 Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason).  1038  
 Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness, which, in 1039  
the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is 1040  
not in the best interest of the subject.  1041  
 Pregnancy  1042  
o Instruct subjects to contact the investigator or study staff immediately if they 1043  
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any 1044  
time during study participation. Institutional policy and local regulations sh ould 1045  
determine the frequency of study pregnancy tests for subjects enrolled in the 1046  
study.  1047  
o The investigator must immediately notify Novo Nordisk  if a study subject 1048  
becomes pregnant.  1049  
 Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary 1050  
incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) 1051  
illness.  1052  
All subjects who discontinue should comply with protocol -specified follow -up procedure. 1053  
The only exception to this requirement is when a subject  withdraws consent for all study 1054  
procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated 1055  
for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).  1056

 agitation and aggression.  
Exploratory Objectives:  
To evaluate the persistence of the effects of pimavanserin treatment 
on: 
 Agitation and aggression  
 Caregiver burden  
 The clinician ’s global assessment of treatment benefit  
 Other neuropsychiatric symptoms  
 Cognition  
 Functional status  
 Sleep and daytime wakefulness   
Methodology  This protocol describes an open -label  extension study to determine the 
safety and tolerability of pimavanserin for the treatment of agitation 
and aggression in subjects with probable AD. This study will be 
conducted as a 52-week , open -label, flexible -dose extension of Study 
ACP -103-032. 
Subjects must  have  completed ACP -103-032 and must meet eligibility 
criteria  to qualify for enrollment . 
Study ACP -103-033 subjects  must  be consented prior to the final 
procedures being performed for Study ACP -103-032 at Week 12. 
Procedures from the Week 12 visit of Study ACP -103-032 will be 
carried over to the ACP -103-033 study  to be included as baseline 
information and this visit  will be considered the Baseline Visit 
(Visit  1) of the ACP -103-033 study.  
Treatment Period (Baseline  through Week  52) 
All subjects will receive once daily (QD) doses of pimavanserin 
(active study drug) over 52 weeks  of treatment , starting with 20  mg 
pimavanserin . After the first 2 weeks , the daily dose can be adjusted to 
either 34 mg or 20 mg pimavanserin, based on the Investigator ’s 
assessment of clinical respon se. Dose adjustments can be made at 
scheduled or unscheduled visits.  
During the Treatment Period, clinic visits will be conducted at 
Baseline  and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52, or upon early 
termination ( ET) from the study.  
Study drug will be d ispensed to the subject to take home  at the 
Baseline visit. The subject  and his/her study partner/caregiver will be 
provided instructions to take the first dose of study drug on the 
following day. It is recommended that the subject take the study drug Study: ACP-103-033

 at approximately the same time each day . 
All concomitant antidepressants, cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, 
and other permitted medications should remain at a stable dose 
throughout the study , if possible . 
A follow -up safety assessment will be conducted b y telephone call at 
approximately 30 days  after the last dose of study medication.  
Number of Subjects 
Planned  Up to approximately 111 male and female subjects with probable AD 
who have sympto ms of agitation and aggression, who have completed 
Study ACP -103-032, and meet eligibility criteria for ACP 103 -033 
will enroll in this study.  
Duration of 
Treatment  The total duration of participation for individual subjects will be up to 
approximately 56 weeks. Each  subject will participate in a 52-week 
treatment period followed by  an approximately 30-day follow -up 
period.  The end of the clinical trial will be when the last subject 
completes the last scheduled assessment  (i.e., 30-day follow -up).

Sample Size 
Calculations  Sample size for this study is not based on statistical power, but will 
depend on the number of subjects who complete Study ACP -103-032 
and who tra nsition into this open -label  extension  study . 
Statistical Methods  The purpose of this study  is to collect safety data from subjects after 
exposure to pimavanserin for a total duration of up to 52 week s. 
Exploratory  objectives include assessment of efficacy outcome 
measures over time. No formal  statistical testing will be performed for 
any of the safety or efficacy endpoints.  
All safety and efficacy measures will be summarized  for the overall 
safety population . Summa ries by treatment  group according to the 
original treatment  in Study  ACP -103-032 (placebo, pimavanserin 
20 mg, and pimavanserin 34 mg)  will also be provided.  
For each continuous measure  in safety and efficacy analyses , change 
from Bas eline results will be  presented in t hree ways:  
1. Using the Baseline from Study  ACP -103-033 and reporting the 
changes across Study  ACP -103-033 timepoints ; 
2. Using the Baseline from Study  ACP -103-032 and reporting the 
changes across the timepoints of both the double -blind Study 
ACP -103-032 and the open -label Study  ACP -103-033; 
3. Based on the Baseline before the first dose of pimavanserin in 
either Study ACP -103-032 or ACP -103-033; changes will be 
reported across the timepoints using the Baseline from the 
double -blind Study A CP-103-032 for subjects receiving 
pimavanserin in the double -blind study (up to 64 weeks), and 
using the Baseline from Study ACP -103-033 for subjects 
receiving placebo in the double -blind study (up to 52 weeks).  
Descriptive Statistics  
Continuous measuremen t results will be reported using the number of 
subjects with data values, mean, standard error of the mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. For each categorical Study: ACP-103-033

 outcome, the frequency and percentage of subjects in each category 
will be re ported.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety results will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics. Adverse events  will be classified into standard 
terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Adverse events  leading  to discontinuation, AEs related to 
study drug, AEs by maximum severity, SAEs, fatal AEs, and SAEs  
related to study drug will be reported.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG s, vital signs  and body weight , and 
clinical laboratory parameters, including changes f rom baseline, will 
be tabulated by treatment group and timepoint . Additionally, 
categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects 
with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in 
accordance with International Council for  Harmonisation  (ICH)  
guidelines.  
Subgroup Analyses  
Selected subgroup analyses will be  specified  in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP).

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) is a  progressive neurodege nerative disorder. Its clinical features  
include cognitive dysfunction, memory abnormalities, progressive impairment in activities o f 
daily living (ADL), and a host of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(Cummings  2004 ; Lyketsos et al. 2011 ). While the diagnostic criteria for AD focus mostly on 
the related cognitive deficits, it is the behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms that are  
most troublesome for caregivers and lead to poor quality of life for patients 
(Herrmann  and Lanct ot 2007 ). These symptoms include agitation, aggres sive behaviors, and 
psychosis. Agitation and aggression are a major cause of acute care inpatient hospitalizations 
(Soto et al. 2012 ) and pose a major challenge for AD patient care. Antipsychotics are 
frequ ently used, with limited efficacy and associated long -term safety risks. Considering the 
large number of AD patients, the increasing incidence, and the high prevalence of agitation  in 
later stages of the disease, this unmet need for safe and effective trea tments has a major 
public health impact ( Peters et al. 2015 ). 
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are now considered as core features of AD and may occur 
at any stage of the disease. Approximately 90% of AD patients develop NPS over the course 
of their disease  (Lyketsos et al. 2002 ; Di Iulio et al. 2010 ). Neuropsychiatric symptoms are 
frequently associated with increased morbidity and are a leading cause of nursing home 
placement ( Steele et al. 1990 ; Cohen -Mansfield et al. 1989 ). The prevalence of NPS 
increases  and symptom profile evolves with disease progression ( Lopez et al. 2003 ). 
Alzheimer ’s disease patients with mild dementia often present with depression, anxiety, 
apathy, and irritability ( Feldman et al. 2004 ), while patients in the advanced stages can 
exhibit agitation/aggression, delusions, hallucina tions, and disinhibition ( Lopez et al.  2003;  
Rockwood et al.  2015 ). 
Agitation is one of the most troublesome dementia symptoms, characterized by inappropriate 
verbal, vocal, or motor activity that can be independent of perceptible needs or confusion 
(Cohen -Mansfield and Billig  1986 ; Cummings et al. 2015 b). These verbal and physical 
behaviors can deviate from social norms and include irrelevant vocalizations, screaming, 
cursing, restlessness, wandering, str ange movements, and handling things inappropriately 
(Cohen -Mansfield et al. 1995 ). Such disruptive behaviors are a major source of stress for 
caregivers and loved ones and take a significant toll over time. Thus, the detection, 
management, and treatment of  NPS including agitation, is critical in AD patient care 
(Lyketsos et al. 2006 ). 
In North America, there are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of agitation and/or 
aggression in AD. In the European Union (EU), risperidone is indicated for the short -term 
treatment of persistent aggression with a limited indication ( Janssen -Cilag Ltd 2015 ). Since Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0

 NPS, especially agitation and aggression, are a major challenge in AD patient care, 
antipsychotics are frequently used off -label, despite their limited efficacy and associated 
long-term safety risks ( Salzman et al. 2008 ). Antidepressants are also frequently used in the 
management of NPS in AD, despite lack of convincing efficacy ( Finkel 2 004; Koppel et al. 
2014 ; Teri et al. 2000 ). Adverse effects related to antipsychotics can include sedation, 
parkinsonism, gait disturbances, peripheral edema, chest infections, pneumonia, 
thromboembolic events, stroke , and death. M eta-analyses have confirm ed this adverse events 
(AEs) pattern to be associated with atypical antipsychotics in people with dementia and 
suggested a marked increase in the risk of stroke and mortality ( Ballard and Howard  2006 ). 
In addition, a doubling in the expected rate of cognit ive deterioration was reported in a 2-year 
prospective, longitudinal study among patients treated with atypical antipsychotics 
(McShane  et al. 2006 ). Moreover, a retrospective cohort study reported that traditional 
antipsychotics are as likely as atypical antipsychotics to increase the risk of death in elderly 
patients ( Wang et al. 2005 ). 
Approved drugs for symptomatic treatment of A D have limited benefit on NPS. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors appear to have a small but measurable effect on depression, 
dysphoria , apathy/indifference, and anxiety but are probably not an effective short -term 
treatment for agitation or aggression ( Gauthier et al. 2002 ). Memantine has shown 
inconsistent benefits in the treatment of irritability, agitation/aggression, and psychosis in  AD 
patients ( Gauthier et al. 2008 ; McShane et al. 2006; Wilcock et al. 2008 ). However, 
well-controlled randomized trials in moderate to severe AD patients with clinically 
significant agitation did not demonstrate a reduction in agitation with memantine 
(Ballard  et al. 2015 ; Fox et al. 2012 ). Anticonvulsants, including valproic acid, have not 
shown positive results in recent studies ( Amann et al. 2009 ; Tariot et al. 2005 ; 
Tariot  et al. 2011 ). Citalopram has been shown to be effective in the treatment of agitation 
and aggression in AD, but can have significant safety concerns including QT prolongation 
and impaired cognition ( Porsteinsson et al. 2014 ). An early clinical trial of 
dextromethorphan/quinidine s howed improvement in agitation in patients with AD 
(Cummings et al. 2015 a), but there may be safety concerns with quinidine including drug 
interactions and QT prolongation.  
Therefore, there remains an urgent clinical priority for effective and safe treatments of NPS 
in AD, including treatment of agitation/aggression. Ongoing efforts for identifying novel 
pharmacological treatments for AD agitation and aggression include development of 
non-dopaminergic, non -cholinergic, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5 -HT 2A) receptor blocking 
compounds. Pimavanserin is one such compound that is a highly selective inverse agonist of 
the 5HT 2A receptor that has been evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials in Parkinson’s disease 
psychosis (PDP) and has been shown to improve psychos is, caregiver burden, and sleep Study: ACP-103-033

 without causing sedation or other significant safety effects, and without a detrimental impact 
on cognition ( Cummings et al. 2014 ). 
1.1 Investigational Drug  
Pimavanserin (pimavanserin tartrate, or ACP -103) is the tartrate salt o f the active moiety 
urea, N-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl] -N-(1-methyl -4-piperidinyl) -N’-[[4-(2-
methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl] -,(2R, 3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1) and is a novel  
small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic neurotransmission mediated by 
the 5-HT 2A receptor.  At higher doses pimavanserin may block 5HT 2C receptors 
(Vanover  et al. 2006 ). Polymorphisms of serotonin receptors and transporters have been 
implicated in AD agitation ( Cummings and Zhong  2006 ). 
Pimavanserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic receptors. Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of dose -
limiting side effects as sociated with existing antipsychotic drugs including cognitive dulling 
(Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004 ; Peretti et al. 1997 ) and an increased risk of mortality 
in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel receptor 
binding profile, pimavanserin  may be effective in treating AD agitation and aggression, and 
may have added benefits in regard to overall tolerability relative to other antipsychotic 
agents.  
1.2 Previous Clinical Experience  
Pimavanserin has been evaluated in 21 completed clinical studies and 4 additional studies are 
currently ongoing. As of 06 January 2016, an estimated total of 1237 subjects have been 
exposed to the investigational drug. These include 616 subjects with PDP. Across all 
populations and indications studied, a total of 764 subjects have received pimavanserin 
34 mg (i.e., 40 mg pimavanserin tartrate).  From controlled studies in PDP, 498 subjects 
continued in long -term extension studies, and more than 250 subjects  have received treatment 
for over a 1 year and more than 150 subjects for over 2 years. Total subject exposure in PDP 
exceeds 900  person -years. The longest reported continuous treatment with pimavanserin was 
for more than 10 years.  
Doses of up to 51 mg dai ly have been evaluated in PDP. Pimavanserin is considered to be 
generally safe and well tolerated. In single and multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers, 
the highest doses administered were 255 mg and 136 mg, respectively. Across all clinical 
studies o f pimavanserin, the most frequently reported treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) were 
in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal (GI), and psychiatric systems. Most 
events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common CNS events included dizzin ess 
(including postural), headache, and somnolence (drowsiness). Common GI disturbances Study: ACP-103-033

 included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, and vomiting; severe nausea and vomiting were 
dose limiting in a few cases. Reported psychiatric conditions included such even ts as 
agitation, insomnia, and confusional state. In controlled studies of pimavanserin in subjects 
with PDP, the most frequent TEAEs experienced by subjects in the pimavanserin 34 mg 
group compared with the placebo group were  urinary tract infection (UTI) (7.4% 
pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 6.9% placebo), nausea (6.9% pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 4.3% placebo), 
peripheral edema (6.9% pimavanserin 34 mg, 2.2% placebo), fall (6.4% pimavanserin 34 mg 
vs. 9.1% placebo), and confusional state (5 .9% pimavanserin 34 mg vs. 2.6% placebo). In the 
long-term open -label studies in subjects with PDP, the most frequent AEs include fall 
(29.3%), UTI (18.5%), hallucination (14.5%), decreased weight (12.4%), and confusional 
state (11.0%). It is difficult to interpret these incidence rates in the absence of a concurrent 
control group, but the overall incidence appears within what would be expected in subjects 
with the underlying neurodegenerative disease, psychosis, and advanced age.  
Clinical and non -clinical safety pharmacology studies of pimavanserin suggest a potential 
risk for QT prolongation. The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in a thorough  
QT study with doses of pimavanserin ranging from 17 to 68 mg and in the Phase 3 PDP 
program with a c linical dose of 34 mg. There was observed an average prolongation of 
approximately 5 -8 milliseconds ( ms). No clinically significant patterns have been observed in 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and there has been no evidence of pimavanserin -related 
laborato ry abnormalities. As of 30  October 2015, 67 subjects have died during study 
participation with the majority of deaths considered not related or unlikely related to study 
drug. Five of these deaths occurred in 6 -week double -blind studies (1  subject received  
placebo, 1 subject received 8.5 mg pimavanserin, and 3 subjects received 34 mg 
pimavanserin), and 62 deaths occurred in the multi -year, long -term open -label extension 
studies where the majority of subjects ha d been treated with pimavanserin for greater th an 
2 years.  
Additional information is provided in the Investigator ’s Brochure . 
1.3 Study Rationale  
Given the various adverse consequences of AD, an active therapeutic intervention is needed 
that could effectively manage symptoms of agitation and aggression wit hout increasing the 
risk for sedation, hematologic disorders, significant cardiovascular events, infections, or 
mortality in this older subject population.  
Atypical antipsychotics are often used off -label for the treatment of agitation and aggression 
in AD, despite the safety risks. The activity of pimavanserin as a selective 5 -HT 2A inverse 
agonist may be beneficial for the treatment of AD subjects with agitation and aggression 
without many of the  AEs associated with typical and atypical antipsychotics. A  variety of Study: ACP-103-033

 neurotransmitters and their receptors, including dopamine (e.g., D1, D2, D3), histamine (H1), 
acetylcholine (e.g., M1, M3, M4), epinephrine (e.g., α1A, α2B, α2C) and serotonin (e.g., 
5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C) are targeted by the typical and atypi cal antipsychotics, which may 
also contribute to their associated AEs. The selective activity of pimavanserin at the 5 -HT 2A 
receptor could avoid many of the off -target side effects while providing clinical efficacy.  
The parent study,  ACP -103-032, is design ed to evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of 
agitation and aggression in AD  and incorporates methods to facilitate an appropriate 
assessment ( Soto et al. 2015 ). The purpose of this study, ACP -103-033, is to collect long -
term safety and efficacy data from subjects after exposure to pimavanserin for a total dura tion 
of up to 52 week s (~64 weeks  total for subjects who received pimavanserin in Study 
ACP -103-032). The primary and safety measures will assess the safety  and tolerability of 
pimavanserin ; the exploratory efficacy measures will assess the  long-term efficacy of 
pimavanserin in treatment of agitation and aggression and the effect on caregiver burden.

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Study Design  
This study is an open -label extension study of the safety and tolerability of pimavanserin for 
the treatment of agitation and aggression in subjects with probable AD 
(McKhann  et al. 2011 ). This  study will be conducted as a 52-week , open -label, flexible -dose 
extension of Study ACP -103-032. Subjects in Study ACP -103-033 must have completed 
ACP -103-032 and must meet eligibility criteria.  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017

 Study ACP -103-033 s ubjects must  be consented prior to the final procedures being  
performed for Study ACP -103-032 at Week 12. Procedures from the Week 12 visit of 
Study ACP -103-032 will be carried over to the ACP -103-033 study to be include d as baseline 
information and this visit  will be considered the Baseline Visit (Visit 1)  of the ACP -103-033 
study.  
Study periods:  
 Open -label treatment  period  (Baseline  through 52 weeks  of treatment ) 
 Safety follow -up period (~ 30 days  after the last dose of study drug) 
Treatment Period  (Baseline through Week 52) 
All subjects will receive once daily (QD) doses of pimavanserin (active study drug) over 
52 week s of treatment, starting with 20  mg a day.  At the Week 2 visit, the  pimavanserin 
20 mg dose may be increased to 34 mg a day based on the Investigator ’s assessment  of 
clinical response. The Investigator may then adjust the dose from 20 mg to 34 mg or from 
34 mg to 20 mg at any visit based on clinical response. A dose change at a time other than at 
a scheduled clinic visit will require an unscheduled visit to dispense the a ppropriate dose of 
study drug. Unscheduled clinic visits may occur as needed.  
During the Treatment Period, clinic visits will be conducted at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52, or upon early termination (ET) from the s tudy.  
It is recommended that the study drug  be taken at approximately the same time each day.   
Doses of concomitant or over -the-counter medications s hould not exceed those  indicated for 
Permitted and Prohibited Concomitant Therapy and Rescue Medication  (see Section 5.6).  
Follow -up of Study  Completers  
A follow -up safety assessment will be conducted via telephone approximately 30 days  after 
the last dose of study drug for s ubjects  who complete the 52-week  treatment period  and for 
those who discontinue  prematurely from the study . 
3.1.1 Study Duration  
The duration of participation for individual subjects will be up to approximately 56 weeks : 
each subject will participate in a 52-week  treatment period  followed by an approximately 
30-day follow -up period.  The end of the clinical trial will be when the last subject completes 
the last scheduled assessment (i .e., 30-day follow -up). Study: ACP-103-033

 3.2 Dose Rationale  
In previous studies of pimavanserin in the PDP population, a dose of 34  mg of pimavanserin 
has demonstrated a consistent signal of efficacy across a number of measures, including the 
Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS ), Clinical Global Impression - 
Improvement (CGI-I), Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson 's disease -Sleep Scale  
(SCOPA -Sleep) nighttime sleep measure and caregiver burden scale. Additionally, long -term 
open -label studies of pimavanserin in PDP have demonstrated t hat pimavanserin is safe and 
tolerable at doses of 34 mg and 51 mg.  Parkinson ’s disease  and AD have similar 
neuropsychiatric symptoms that include psychosis, agitation , and other behavioral problems 
that can have a heterogeneous presentation . These symptom s can be responsive to treatment 
with antipsychotics ; pimavanserin has been approved for treatment in PDP in the United 
States  and could show benefit for the treatment of other symptoms. Thus, a dose of 34 mg 
pimavanserin that has been shown to be effectiv e in the treatment of PDP 
(Cummings  et al. 2014 ) is included as the high dose in this study.  A dose of 20 mg 
pimavanserin is included as a possible low dose for the treatment of agitation and aggression 
in patients with AD.  The dose of pimavan serin can be adjusted to 20 mg or 34 mg based on 
clinical judgment.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Up to approximately 111 male and female subjects with probable AD who have sympto ms of 
agitation and aggression  and who have completed Study ACP -103-032 and meet the 
eligibility cri teria for ACP 103 -033, as outlined in Section  4.1, will enroll in this study.

Pimavanserin  Tablet  34 mg 2×17 mg tablet s Oral 
 
5.2 Administration of Study Drug  
All subjects will receive once daily (QD) doses of pimavanserin (active study drug) over 
52 weeks of treatment, starting with 20  mg a day for the first 2 weeks. Dose adjustment will 
be allowed thereafter based on the Investigator ’s assessment of clinical r esponse (see 
Section  5.4). 
It is recommended that the subject take the study drug at approximately the same time  each 
day. Study drug can be taken with or without food consumption.  
5.3 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher t han 
specified in the protocol. It must be reported , irrespective of outcome even if toxic effects 
were not observed. An overdose is considered an AE only if there ar e symptoms associated 
with the event. All events of overdose need to be captured as protocol deviations . 
5.4 Dosage Adjustments  
Dose adjustments will be allowed for pimavanserin based on clinical response . At the Week  2 
visit (Visit 2) , the pimavanserin 20 mg starting dose may be increased to 34 mg a day based 
on the Investigator ’s assessment of clinical response.  The Investigator may adjust the dose  
from 20 mg to 34 mg or from 34 mg to 20 mg at any visit based on clinical response. A dose 
change at a time other than at a scheduled clinic visit will require an unscheduled visit to 
dispense the a ppropriate dose of study drug.  
5.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects  who have signed the ICF  and are  enrolled into the study  will be entered into  the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system . Subjects  will have the same  subject identification

 consist s of a 3 -digit site number followed by a unique 3 -digit number. Subject s will keep th is 
same subject identification number  throughout the study.  
5.6 Concomitant Medications  
All ongoing  concomitant medications will be captured from the preceding double -blind study 
(ACP -103-032) and will be recorded from  Baseline through  the EOS/ET visit . 
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator.  
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or disco ntinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs. The Sponsor and Investigator will confer to determine whether it is appropriate 
to continue such a subject in the trial if a prohibited medication is prescribed.  
Subjects who take prohibited concomitant  medications during the trial will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow 
the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor with medical input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented.  If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.  All follow -up safety assessments must be 
completed and documented as outlined in the protocol.  
5.6.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant antidepressants, cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and other permitted 
medications should remain at a stable dose throughout the study , if possible.  
5.6.2 Prohibited  and Restricted  Medications  
Restrictions for concomitant medications should be followed through  the EOS/ET visit as 
specified in Appendix B  and Appendix C . These appendices  do not constitute  an exhaustive 
list and any questions regarding prohibited and restricted medications should be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee.  
Use of medications that could interfere with study conduct  or any questions regarding 
prohibited and  restricted concomitant medications should be reviewed and/or discussed with 
the Medical Monitor  or appropriate designee.  
Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the 
Medical Monitor ) as specified in Appendix B . 
5.6.3 Rescue Medications  
At the discretion of the Investigator, lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) may be used as a rescue 
medication for the management of agitation and/or aggression. Any use or increase in dose of Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0

 lorazepam must be documented. At a maximum dose of up to 2 mg per 24 -hour period , 
lorazepam  will be allowed as rescue medication only on an  intermittent or PRN basis, and 
should not be taken within 24 hours prior to the next study visit. Lorazepam may not be used 
for more than 10  cumulative days in any 4 -week period. If lorazepam is not available , 
another intermediate -acting benzodiazepine ma y be used at doses equivalent to lorazepam 
doses .

Study drug will be dispensed to the subject to take home at the Baseline Visit. The subject  
and their study  partner/caregiver will be provided instructions to  take the first dose of study 
drug on the following day. It is recommended that the subject take the study drug at 
approximately the same time each day  as a single, oral dose . Study drug can be taken with or 
without food consumption.  
At the Week 2 visit (Visit 2) and thereafter , the dose of pimavanserin may be adjusted based 
on the Investigator ’s assessment of clinical response  (see Section 5.4). Dose adjustments 
must be re corded and include date of change, dose , and reason for change.  At each visit 
where drug is dispensed,  previous ly dispensed  unused drug  and any empty containers are to 
be returned to the Investigator.  
5.8.5.1  Treatment Period  
At Baseline, subjects will be provided  with s tudy drug to take home . The subject and their 
study partner/caregiver will be provided instructions to take the first dose of study drug on 
the following day. It is recommended that the subject take the study drug at approximately 
the same time each  day. 
Additional s tudy drug  will be provided according to the Schedule of Events and Assessments 
(Appendix A ) or at unscheduled study visits . Investigational drug supplies will be labeled in 
accordance with all applic able guidelines and/or regulations.  
5.8.6 Record of Dispensing  
Accurate recording of all investigational drug administration for individual subjects will be 
made in the appropriate section of the subject ’s eCRF  as well as in the site investigationa l 
drug dispens ing and reconciliation form. Drug accountability records  must be updated as 
subjects are enrolled  and throughout the conduct of the study . 
5.8.7 Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will keep current and accurate records of the investigational 
drug product dispensed, used, and returned for each subject to assure the health authority and 
Sponsor that the investigational drug is being handled appropriately. Subjects should be 
instructed to return all packaging , bottles , and unused medication  to the Investigator at 
scheduled  and unscheduled  clinic visits when drug is dispensed and at the EOS/ET visit.  
At appropriate intervals during the study, investigational drug reconciliation will be 
performed by the Sponsor representative who may return appropriate used and unused 
investigational drug and used and unused packaging to the Sponsor ’s designee for 
destruction.  Study: ACP-103-033

 At the conclusion of the study, final investigation al drug reconciliation will be conducted at 
the site. Final investigational drug accountability documentation will be maintained at bot h 
the site and at ACADIA. Any remaining unused investigational drug and all used and unused 
packaging will be sent back t o the Sponsor ’s designee for destruction. Documentation of 
investigational drug destruction will be recorded and maintained by both  ACADIA and the 
Sponsor ’s designee.  
6 EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
6.1 Efficacy Assessments  
The following efficacy endpoints wil l be assessed in this study using the measures described 
in this section: CMAI, ZBI, NPI-C, MMSE, mADCS -CGIC, KSS, and ADCS -ADL.  
Of the measures listed in the following sections, the CMAI  should be completed first, followed 
by completion of  the other instruments.  For each scale, the time period assessed will be from 
the time of the last scheduled assessment.  All Baseline assessments that are referred to in the 
following sections will be carried over from the Week 12 visit of Study ACP -103-032, where 
applicable.  
6.1.1 Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory  
The CMAI was developed to assess the frequency of manifestations of agitated behaviors in 
elderly persons ( Cohen -Mansfield 1989 ; see Appendix D). 
The CMAI is a 29 -item scale designed to systematically assess agitation, rated on a 7 point 
(1-7) scale of frequency. Subjects are rated by their primary caregiver regarding the 
frequency  with which they manifest physically aggressive, physically non -aggressive and 
verbally agitated behaviors. The CMAI may be self -administered (by a caregiver) or , as in 
this study,  it may be completed by interview. Ratings are inclusive of the 2 or 4 weeks  prior 
to the administration of the scale. Separate scores for agitation and aggression behaviors can 
be derived from the CMAI in addition to the total score.  
The CMAI will be performed at Baseline (Day 1)  and at all scheduled clinic visits . 
6.1.2 Zarit Burden I nterview  
The ZBI was designed to assess the stresses experienced by caregivers of patients with 
dementia ( Zarit et al.  1980 ; see Appendix E). The ZBI can be self -reported or , as in this 
study,  administered as an interview. Caregivers are ask ed to respond to a series of 
22 questions about the impact of the patient ’s disabilities on their life. For each item, 
caregivers are to indicate how often they felt that way (never, rarely, sometimes, quite 
frequently, or nearly always). The ZBI will be administered a t Baseline (Day 1) and at 
Weeks  2, 4, 8, 12 , 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52  (EOS/ET) .  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 37 of 117
 Note: Professional caregiver s do not complete this form .  
6.1.3 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  – Clinician Rating  Scale  
The NPI -C (de Medeiros et al. 2010 ) was developed to assess psychopathology in patients 
with dementia  (Appendix F). The NPI -C evaluates NPS across multiple behavioral domains, 
as in the NPI  (Cummings et al. 1994 ), as a standalone  measure for specific NPS domai ns 
(e.g., dysphoria, agitation),  or as a comb ination of both (presence of NPS across domains 
plus particular focus on one or more specific domains) . The score of each item, if present, is 
clinically evaluated based on the symptom frequency , severity /intensity, and distress of a 
behavior . Multiple behaviors within a category are rated and included in the score. The 
NPI-C version of the NPI  scale was designed to be administered by the clinician to the 
caregiver and can be administered to a professional caregiver or other involved person as 
long as they have detailed knowledge of the subject ’s behavior.  If a subject is not able to 
provide reliable information (e .g., due to cognitive impairment, or is uncooperative), the 
NPI-C should be rated by the clinician using all other available informati on incl uding 
behavioral observations.  
The complete NPI -C (i.e., all domains) will be performed at Baseline, Weeks 12, 28, and 
52 (i.e., Visits 1, 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET ]). The agitation and aggression domains of the NPI -C 
alone will be performed at Weeks 2,  4, and 8 (i.e., Visits 2, 3, and 4). 
6.1.4 Mini –Mental State Examination  
The MMSE is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975 ; see Appendix G). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems 
in a number of areas: the time and place of the test, repeating lists of words, arithmetic, 
language use and comprehension, and copying a d rawing. It can be used to screen for 
cognitive impairment, to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in 
time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, and to document 
an individual ’s response to treatmen t. The MMSE will be administered at Baseline  (Visit 1)  
and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 ( i.e., Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 [EOS/ET ]). 
6.1.5 Modified Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression -
Change  
The mADCS -CGIC  scale ( Schneider et al. 1997 ) will be used to allow the Investigator to 
determine the subjec t’s overall clinical condition as it relates to their symptoms of agitation 
and aggression, and to address the clinical significance of changes from Baseline in other 
psychometric measures  (Appendix H). The mADCS -CGIC interview will be performed by 
the Investigator or a medically qualified rater . After completion of the interview, the rater will 
be asked to rate the subject ’s symptoms of agitation and aggression relative to the Baseline Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 38 of 117
 interview  from the parent study (ACP -103-032), using a standardized 7 -point 
scale (1=marked improvement to 7 =marked worsening).  
The mADCS -CGIC will be administered at Baseline (Visit 1) and at all scheduled clinic 
visits . 
6.1.6 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory  
The ADCS -ADL  is an inventory to assess activities of daily living in subject s with AD 
(Galasko et al. 1997 ; see Appendix I). This is a caregiver -rated  questionnaire that includes 
23 items related to subject  ADLs. The instrument assesses functional capacity acr oss a large 
spectrum of dementia severity.  The A DCS -ADL will be administered at Base line (Visit  1) 
and at Weeks 12, 28, and 52 ( i.e., Visits 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET] ). 
6.1.7 Karolinska Sleepiness Scale  
The KSS is a self -reported subjective measure of a subject's level of  drowsiness  
(Akerstedt  and  Gillberg  2009 ; Johns  2009 ; see Appendix J). With the modified version 
(Geiger Brown et  al. 2014 ) respondents must choose which of 9 statements most accurately 
describes their level of sleepiness over a period of time, which for this  study will be “on 
average over the previous week” (see Appendix J ). The KSS will be administered at Baseline  
(Visit 1)  and at Weeks 12, 28 , and 52 (i.e., Visits 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET] ). 
6.2 Safety Assessments  
Standard clinical evaluations and objective measures will be employed to monitor and assess  
safety during the conduct of this trial. Results of safety assessments will be used to identify 
any investigational drug -related effects or trends after the trial i s completed. Furthermore, 
results of the safety assessments will be used during the conduct of the trial to monitor and 
protect the safety of enrolled subjects. Information regarding safety monitoring can be fou nd 
in the sections below.  
Safety and tolerabi lity assessments for all subjects will include: medical and medication 
history including AD history, physical examinations, vital signs, weight, ECGs , suicidal 
ideation and behavior,  and safety laboratory evaluations.  
All Baseline assessments that are refe rred to in the following sections will be carried over 
from the Week 12 visit of Study ACP -103-032, where applicable . 
6.2.1 Medical and Medication History  
Medical  and medication history will  be carried over from the preceding double -blind study 
(ACP -103-032).  Study: ACP-103-033

 6.2.2 Alzheimer’s Disease History  
A thorough subject history specific to their diagnosis of probable AD will be  carried over  
from the preceding double -blind study  (ACP -103-032). 
6.2.3 Physical Examinations  
Physical and neurological examinations will be conducted at Baseline (Visit 1) and Week s 12 
and 52 (i.e., Visits 5 and 10  [EOS/ET] ). The examinations may include a review of all body 
systems (urogenital exam ination  is required only if indicated) and should  include a 
neurological examination (e.g.,  level of consciousness, speech, cranial nerves [including 
pupil equality and reactivity], motor assessment, sensory assessment, coordination, gait, 
reflexes, and Romberg test ). 
6.2.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (sitting [at least 3 minutes] blood pressure, pulse , respiratory  rate, and 
temperature) will be performed at Baseline  (Visit 1)  and at all scheduled visits . 
6.2.5 Weight  
Weight will be measured at Baseline  (Visit 1)  and at all scheduled visits . 
6.2.6 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG (single recording ) will be performed at Baseline  (Visit 1)  and at Weeks 4, 12, 
28, and 52  (i.e., Visits 3, 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET] ). 
6.2.7 Safety Laboratory Evaluations  
Safety laboratory evaluations will be ana lyzed by a Central Laboratory. Blood and urine 
samples for safety laboratory evaluations will be colle cted at Baseline (Visit 1) and Weeks 4, 
12, 28, and 52 (i.e ., Visits 3, 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET]).  
Females of child bearing potential must agree to use a clinically acceptable method of 
contraception (e.g., oral, intrauterine device [IUD; diaphragm], injectab le, transdermal or 
implantable contraception) or abstinence during the study, and 1 month following the last 
dose of study medication. Abstinence as a method of contraception defined as  refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of r isk associated with the study treatments. 
This option is usually made for a specific moral, religious, legal, or health reason.  If 
heterosexual intercourse does occur , an appropriate method of birth control is required. For 
all female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at 
Baseline (Visit 1) and at Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 (i.e., Visit 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 
[EOS/ET]) . Pregnancy tests must be negative at Baseline for s tudy entry  and at the Weeks 4, 
12, 20, 28, 36, and 44 visits to continue in the study . Study: ACP-103-033

Additional safety testing may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator or designate.  
6.2.8 Clinically Significant Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant will be 
repeated as clinically appropriate . Abnormal laboratory test results that are considered to be 
clinically significant by the Investigator  must  be recorded as an AE . 
Further details on blood an d urine sample collection are specified in the laboratory manual.  
6.2.9 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  
The Global Clinician Assessment of Suicidality (GCAS) will be used to assess the occurrence 
of treatment -emergent suicidal ideation and behavior.  
The GCAS is a  clinician -rated, 5 -point scale that is designed to rate the subject’s suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clinician’s 
global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (Absent), 1 (Feels life is not worth l iving), 2  (Wishes 
he/she were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self), 3 (Suicidal ideas or gesture), or 
4 (Attempt at suicide). The Investigator will record a subject rating, a partner/caregiver 
rating, and a clinician rating. For a rating of 3 or  4 based on the clinician ’s assessment,  the 
date of event will be  recorded. At each visit, suicidality since the previous visit will be 
assessed.   
7 ADVERSE EVENTS/SERIO US ADVERSE EVENTS AN D REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring after the completion of procedures at the Week 12 visit in the 
double -blind Study ACP -103-032 will be recorded in the open -label Study ACP -103-033. 
Adverse events  during ACP -103-033 will be recorded through the follow -up safety 
assessment (conduc ted by telephone call) approximately 30 days after the last dose of  
open -label  study drug. All ongoing AEs from Study ACP -103-032 will be carried over and 
will be recorded from Baseline until resolution, or through the Week 52 ( EOS/ET ) visit. All Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 42 of 117
 AEs must be either resolved or stable at the Week 52 ( EOS /ET) visit . For those that are 
ongoing at the end of the study , the subject should be referred for appropriate treatment.  
7.2 Definition  of Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ” (CDER  2012 ). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all  
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event.  
Suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  
AEs do not include the following:  
 Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that a re 
present prior to baseline  and do not worsen during the study  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
baseline.  
 Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms unless the subject is hospitalized for observation  
 Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
 Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, and if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form.  
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms (e.g ., 
“cold” or “seasonal allergies ” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug , must be fully and completely docume nted 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject ’s notes. The description of each AE should use the 
following definition s: Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 43 of 117
 Severity  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a  3-point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the  eCRF : 
 Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
 Moderate : sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
 Severe : incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
Relationship to Investigational Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Inv estigator as “related ” or 
“not related. ” An event is considered related  if there is “a reasonable possibility ” that t he 
event may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, 
evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causati on). 
Consider the following when assessing causality:  
 Temporal associations between the agent and the event,  
 Response to c essation (de -chall enge) or re -challenge,  
 Compatibility with known class effect,  
 Known effects of concomitant medications,  
 Pre-existing  risk factors,  
 A plausible mechanism, and  
 Concurrent illnesses.  
Duration  
The duration of the AE should be recorded using the following criteria:  
 Start:  Date of the first episode of the AE or date of significant sustained worsening in 
severity  
 Stop:  Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions:  
 Single:  Experienced once, without recurrence  
 Recurrent:  More than one discrete episode with the sam e severity  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 44 of 117
 Action Taken with Investigational Drug  
 Dose not changed:  No change in study drug  
 Dose reduced:  Dose of study drug reduced  
 Dose increased:  Dose of study drug increased  
 Drug interrupted:  Investigational drug temporarily stopped  
 Drug withdrawn:  Investigational drug discontinued permanently  
Therapy  
 None:  No new treatment instituted  
 Medication:  New treatment initiated as a direct result of AE  
 Other:  Other action required  
Outcome  
 Recovered/resolved: Recovered or resolved  
 Recovered/resolved with seq uelae:  Recovered or resolved with sequelae  
 Not recovered/not resolved:  Not recovered or not resolved  
 Fatal:  Death related to AE 
 Unknown:  Unknown  
Seriousness  
 Not serious  
 Serious:  Refer to definition in Section  7.3 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject shoul d 
be followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or a new  
chronic  baseline has been established.  
The Investigator must re cord all observed AEs and all reported AEs. At  each visit, the 
Investigator should  ask the  subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit? ”) to assess  whether any AEs have been experienced s ince the  
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE eCRF and the concomitant medication  page.  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 45 of 117
 Adverse events will b e coded by data management  using the  most current version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator as described above.  
7.3 Serious Adverse Events and Unexpected Adverse Events  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “serious” 
or “not serious. ” The seriousness of  an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one o r 
more of the following:  
 Is fatal,  
 Is immediately life threatening,  
 Results  in disability or permanent damage,  
 Requires  hospitalization,  
 Prolongs  existing hospitalization,  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring),  or 
 Is medically significant.  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event p laces the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined by ACADIA as a full admission to the hospita l for diagnosis and 
treatment . This includes prolongation of an existing in -patient  hospitalization.  
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not meet the serious criteria for hospitalization 
include:  
 Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission)  
 Outpatient  surgery  
 Preplanned or elective procedures (see  Section  7.3.1 ) 
 Protocol procedures  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46 of 117
  Social hospitalization, defined as inadequate family s upport or care at the subject's 
primary residence that results in the subject being admitted to the hospital  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage  
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of  
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for aller gic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests  a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  
Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product informati on. 
7.3.1 Elective Procedures and Surgeries  
For the purposes of this p rotocol, the following conventions will apply for SAE reporting of 
elective procedures and surgeries:  
A prescheduled elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment is not to be considere d 
an SAE, even if the subject  is hospitalized, provided the sit e stipulates that:  
 The condition requiring the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress between the subject ’s 
consent to participate in the clinical trial and the time of the procedu re or treatment,  
 The prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for admission and intervention.  
An untoward medical event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or 
routinely scheduled treatment should be recorded as an AE or an SAE. Any concurrent 
medications should also be recorded on the eCRF.  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 47 of 117
 7.4 Other Reportable Information  
In addition, and for the purposes of monitoring, the following should be reported via the AE, 
SAE, and/or Pregnancy reporting forms , as appropriate:  
 Instances of overdose of study drug (where there are associated symptoms ) (see 
Section  5.3 for definition of overdose);  
 Any occurrence of pregnancy (with or without AEs).  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be withdrawn from the study and 
will be followed through  the first well -baby visit . Women of childbearing potential are 
permitted in this study. Women of non -childbearing potential are defined as those who have 
been postmenopausal for at least 12  months, who do not have a uterus, have bilateral tubal 
ligation, have undergone bilateral salpingectomy, and /or have both ovaries removed.  
7.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is a serious adverse reaction 
assessed as unexpected by the Sponsor and that is judged by either the reporting Investigator  
or the Sponsor to have a reasonable causal relationship to a medical product.  
7.5.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by ACADIA to the Regulatory Authorities is a regulatory requirement. 
Each Regula tory Authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs ba sed upon 
established criteria.  
Serious AEs and Other Reportable Information ( Sections  7.3 and 7.4) must be reported 
within 24 hours of discov ery to ACADIA or its designee. The SAE (initial and/or follow -up), 
pregnancy, new diagnosis of cancer, or overdose of study drug must be reported within 
24 hours by completing the AE, SAE, and/or Pregnancy forms, as appropriate (refer to the 
Study Reference Manual  for details).  
At a minimum, events identified by ACADIA to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and possibly related to study drug must be brought to the at tention of the 
responsible IRB/ EC. For EU member states, ACADIA or its designee will provide reports of 
SUSARs directly to the ECs, as required by local legislation. In all other countries, it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/ EC. It 
is also the Investigator’s responsibility  to notify the responsible IRB/ EC regard ing any new 
and significant safety information.  
For this study , sites will complete the paper  SAE, overdose, and/or pregnancy form (for 
initial and/or follow -up information), including available supporting documentation relevant Study: ACP-103-033

Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 48 of 117
 to the event and send (with in 24 hours of discovery) to the contact numbers and/or email 
designated on the SAE form provided to the sites.  
Subjects will be followed until EOS/ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with ACADIA, deems 
them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact the 
Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or designee as soon as is feasible 
following the report of the SAE.  
Serious AEs occurring after the study follow -up period should be reported if in the judgmen t 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable  possibility ” that the event may have been caused  by 
the product.  
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB /EC according to local regulations.  
7.6 Routine Safety Monitoring  
A Safety Management Team (SMT), internal to ACADIA, will regularly monitor all aspects 
of subject safety throughout this study. The SMT will be comprised of qualified 
representatives from Clinical Development, Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance, and 
Regulatory Affairs, as well as other ad hoc representatives as appropriate. The SMT will me et 
regularly to review all S AEs and will examine aggregate non-serious  AEs, clinical laboratory 
data, and other relevant safety data.  
7.7 Pregnancy  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and t he pregnancy must be reported on the pregnancy form. Any 
female subject who becomes pregnant during the study will be followed through the  first 
well-baby visit . 
Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious 
(Section  7.3) should also be reported via the SAE forms provided and according to the 
directions in  Section  7.6. 
7.8 Emergency Treatment  
During and following a s ubject ’s participation in the trial, the Investigator/institution should 
ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any AEs, including clinically 
significant laboratory values, related to the trial. The Investigator/institution should i nform a Study: ACP-103-033

which the Investigator becomes aware.  
8 DATA RECORDING, RETE NTION, AND MONITORIN G 
8.1 Case Report Forms and Data Verification  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded on eCRFs. The Investigator and 
his/her site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The Investigator is 
responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded o n the eCRFs. All 
information requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject identification 
date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will require explanation.  All 
information on eCRFs must be traceable to source docu mentation  at the site.  
The study monitor s will be responsible for reviewing and verifying the data recorded on the 
eCRFs, utilizing the source documentation, and will query discrepant findings. The 
Investigator and site personnel will be responsible for an swering all queries. The eCRFs will 
be submitted to ACADIA or its designee for quality assurance review and statistical analysi s 
via an electronic data capture system. A copy of the  final eCRFs will be retained by the 
Investigator, who must ensure that the  copy is stored in a secure place.  
8.2 Source Documentation  
All study specific medical information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the 
subject ’s record (source documentation) in real time as it is collected , and then entered into a 
validated e lectronic data capture clinical database  by trained site personnel . The source 
documentation will consist of source notes captured by site personnel as well as lab oratory  
reports, ECG reports, and electronic source data.  
8.3 Availability and Retention of Records  
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the International Council 
for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will be maintained by the 
Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for monitor ing and/or auditing by the 
Sponsor and regulatory agencies.  
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of ACADIA and/or 
designee (including monitors and auditors), the regulatory agency(s) (including inspectors) , 
and the IRB /EC direct access to source documents (such as original medical records). Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and 
reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study. The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the eCRF was 
derived.  Study: ACP-103-033

 Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per ICH -GCP. This 
includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and co mpleted  eCRF s, documentation 
of eCRF  corrections, signed ICFs, subject -related source documentation, and adequate 
records for the receipt and disposition of all investigational drug. Investigators should 
maintain all essential study documentation, for a pe riod of at least 2 years following the last 
approval of marketing application in an ICH region ( United States , Europe , and Japan), or 
until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, unless a longer 
period is required by appli cable law or regulation. Only ACADIA can notify an Investigator 
when any records may be discarded. Investigators should contact ACADIA before destroying 
any files.  
8.4 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
ACADIA and/or designee representatives and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible 
for contacting and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g.,  eCRF s and other pertinent data) 
provided that subject confi dentiality is respected.  
The ACADIA and/or designee monitor is responsible for inspecting the  eCRF s at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy,  
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local r egulations on the conduct of clinical 
research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the  eCRF s. 
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any pr oblems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and ACADIA ’s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites participating in this study will be audit ed. These audits may include a review of  site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories ) and review of study -related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with the protocol, 
ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
8.5 Subj ect Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject ’s anonymity is maintained as described below . 
On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to ACADIA and/or designee, subjects must be 
identified by a Subject Identification Number only. Docum ents that are not for submission to 
ACADIA and/or designee (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by the 
Investigator in compliance with Federal regulations or other applicable laws or ICH

9 STATISTICAL PLAN  
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan ( SAP) to be 
approved by ACADIA prior to  database lock.  
9.1 General Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables the fo llowing summary statistics will be provided: number of 
subjects, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 
median. For categorical variables, summaries will include the number and percentage of 
subjects in each category, u sing the number of subjects with non -missing values as the 
denominator for the percentages (unless otherwise specified).  
No hypothesis testing is planned. Descriptive summaries of all safety and efficacy endpoint s 
will be provided. All safety and efficacy measures will be summarized for the overall safety 
population. Summaries by treatment group according to the original treatment  in Study 
ACP -103-032 (placebo, pimavanserin 20 mg, and pimavanserin 34 mg) will also be 
provided. All references to treatment gr oup refer to the initial treatment group in Study 
ACP -103-032. 
For each continuous measure  in safety and efficacy analyses , change from Baseline results 
will be presented in three ways:  
1. Using the Baseline from Study ACP -103-033 and reporting the changes across Study 
ACP -103-033 timepoints;  
2. Using the Baseline from Study ACP -103-032 and reporting the changes across the 
timepoints of both the double -blind Study ACP -103-032 and the open -label  Study 
ACP -103-033; 
3. Based on the Baseline before the first dose of p imavanserin in either Study 
ACP -103-032 or ACP -103-033; changes will be reported across the timepoints using 
the Baseline from the double -blind Study ACP -103-032 for subjects receiving 
pimavanserin in the double -blind study (up to 64 weeks), and using the Baseline from 
Study ACP -103-033 for subjects receiving placebo in the double -blind study (up to 
52 weeks).  
All data summaries  will be performed using SAS® V9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina) or higher. Validation and quality control of the tab les, listings , and figures Study: ACP-103-033

 authorized representative [LAR] with subject’s assent)  prior to enrollment in the study . 
Additionally, written agreement must be obtained from the subject ’s study partner/caregiver 
prior to any protocol evaluations, indicating that they understand the study, including their  
role as the study partner/caregiver and agree to participate in the study. This agre ement is not 
a consent to become a study subject.  
The Informed Consent must , at a minimum , include the elements of consent described in the 
ICH guidance on GCP and the US CFR  21 part 50.25. Informed consent must be obtained 
from the subject ’s LAR  with the subject ’s assent if the subject is deemed not competent to 
provide informed consent. A copy of the ICF planned for use will be reviewed by the 
Sponsor (or designee) for acceptability and must be submitted by the Investigator, together  
with the protocol, to  the appropriate IRB /EC for review and approval prior to the start of the 
study  at that investigational site . Consent forms must be in a language fully comprehensible 
to the prospective subject  if the subject is signing or by the subject ’s LAR if the LAR i s 
signing . The Investigator must provide the Sponsor (or designee) with a copy of the IRB /EC 
letter approving the protocol and the ICF(s) before the study drug supplies will be shipped  
and the study can be initiated.

 accordance with local requirements and, if required, to the Regulatory Authority, as either an 
amendment or a notification. Appr oval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. No 
approval is r equired for notifications.  
10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations  
No prospective  entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed ; all subjects must  meet all 
eligibility criteria  in order to participate in the study . 
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sp onsor under any circumstances. 
If, during the course of a subject ’s participation in the trial , it is discovered that the subject  
did not meet all eligibility criteria, s/he will be discontinued, unless the discontinuation 
presents an unac ceptable medical risk. The justification to allow the subject to continue in the 
trial will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the Investi gator, and will be 
documented. If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protoc ol 
deviation and not a waiver. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and 
documented as outlined in the protocol . The Investigator must report any protocol deviation 
to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB /EC in accordance with local regula tions, within 
reasonable time.

 APPENDIX B PROHIBITED AND REST RICTED CONCOMITANT M EDICATIONS  
The following is an outline of the prohibitions and restrictions on concomitant 
medications.  Any questions regarding prohibited and restricted concomitant medications 
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee.  
Subjects who take prohibited concomitant medications during the trial will be discontinued,  
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justificatio n to allow 
the subject to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor with medical input from th e 
Investigator, and will be documented. If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.  
1. Antipsych otics:  
○ All antipsychotics are prohibited  and should be discontinue d as appropriate 
2 weeks or at least 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to Baseline.  
2. Serotonin antagonists:  
○ Serotonin antagonists are prohibited and must have been discontinued at lea st 
3 weeks  prior to Baseline. This includes, but is not limited to: mianserin, 
nefazodone, cyproheptadine, and fluvoxamine.  
○ Trazodone is prohibite d as a serotonin antagonist and also due to possible QT 
prolongation.  
3. Anticholinergic medications:  
○ Centrally acting anticholinergic medications are prohibited.  These include, but are 
not limited to, diphenhydramine, benztropine, biperiden, and trihexyphenidyl.  
○ Peripherally acting anticholinergic agents, such as tolterodine or oxybutynin, are 
allowed.  
4. Antidepressa nts: 
○ Use of antidepressant medications is restricted. The dose of these medications 
must be expected to remain unchanged until the subject’s final visit.  
○ Trazodone is prohibited as an antidepressant and also due to possible  QT 
prolongation . 
○ See also the re strictions on antidepressants that can prolong the QT interval in #6 
below. These antidepressants include citalopram, escitalopram, clomipramine, 
desipramine, imipramine, mirtazapine, and nortriptyline  Study: ACP-103-033

 5. Anxiolytics  and sedative medications : 
○ Use of anxiolyti c medications (including benzodiazepine) is restricted. The dose 
of these medications should be expected to remain unchanged until the subject's 
final visit.  
○ Exception: lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) may be used as a rescue medication for 
the management of agitation  and/or aggression per Section  5.6.3 . If lorazepam is 
not available, another intermediate -acting benzodiazepine may be used in the 
same way lorazepam may be used at doses equivalent to lorazepam doses.  
○ Use of sedative insomnia a ids is permitted PRN with restrictions  as noted in the 
list of prohibited and restricted medications . 
6. Medications that can prolong QT interval  
Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited or  restricted as outlined below. These 
include, but are not limited to the following:  
Prohibited for the duration of the study:  
○ Antiarrhythmic drugs including: dronedarone, quinidine, procainamide, 
disopyramide, ajmaline, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, sotalol, d -sotalol, 
bretylium, ibutilide, dofetilide,  amakalant, and semantilide

clarithromycin, and pentamidine  
○ Methadone and cocaine  
 Restricted Medications  
○ Use of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin is prohibited. However, use of th ese drugs 
during the course of the study to treat a bacterial infection (e.g., urinary tract 
infection, respiratory infection) may be permitted at the discretion of the PI.  
○ Use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is allowed. The dose of these 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should remain at a stable dose throughout the study 
if possible.  
○ Citalopram and escitalopram are restricted to a maximum dose of 20  mg a day.   
○ The medications listed are ONLY  allowed if:  
 the subject has a baseline ECG with a QTcF <425  ms OR  
 the subject has a QTcF <450  ms at Baseline AND  QRS duration ≥120  ms 
(e.g., subjects with right bundle branch block [RBBB] or left bundle branch 
block [LBBB], an intraventricular conduction disturbance [IVCD], or 
ventricular pacing)  Study: ACP-103-033

 APPENDIX C LIST OF PROHIBITED  CYP3A4  INDUCERS AND INHIBITO RS 
The information presented here is i ntended to provide guidance and does not constitute an 
exhaustive list of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Any questions should be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee .  
The metabolism of pimavanserin is affected by strong cytoc hrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme 
(CYP3A4) inhibitors, resulting in an increase in maximum plasma concentration (C max) and 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) of approximately 3 -fold. Strong 
inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 are to be stopped 1  week prior to the administration of 
study drug and are prohibited throughout the study. Moderate inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP3A4 are allowed but should be used with caution.

a  The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor ” when a certain 
preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor ” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength). (FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions

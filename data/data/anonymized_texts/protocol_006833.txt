PROTOCOL AMENDMENT I (4-11-16) 35 
 36 
Proposed Change #1  37 
Current Protocol  38 
• Enrollment visit:  Questionnaires and the symptom survey (if applicable) should be 39 
administered to the subject prior to other examination procedures.  40 
• Follow -up visits:  No specific mention regarding order of testing with respect to 41 
questionnaires and the symptom survey.  42 
 43 
Proposed Change  44 
• Enrollment visit:  Remove specific language regarding order of testing to al low 45 
questionnaires and the symptom survey (if applicable) to be completed  at any time during 46 
the enrollment visit .   47 
• Follow -up visits:  Add specific language regarding order of testing at  follow -up visits  to 48 
require  questionnaires and the symptom survey  (if applicable)  to be completed prior to 49 
testing .   50 
 51 
Rationale for Change  52 
At the time of enrollment, treatment has not yet been initiated, therefore having knowledge of 53 
clinical assessments prior to completion of the questionnaires and the symptom survey is not 54 
expected to introduce any bias.  In contrast, the questionnaires and symptom survey should be 55 
completed prior to clinical testing at any follow -up visit.  56 
 57 
Proposed Change #2  58 
Current Protocol  – For subjects enrolled with Divergence Insufficiency  59 
Distance esodeviation of 2 PD to 30 PD and at least 50% greater than at near by PACT  60 
 61 
Proposed Change  – For subjects enrolled with Divergence Insufficiency  62 
Distance esodeviation of 2 PD to 30 PD and distance deviation is at least 1.25 times (25%  larger 63 
than) near deviation  by PACT (i.e., maximum near deviation is  at least  20% smaller  than 64 
distance  deviation ). The distance deviation must exceed the near deviation by at least the 65 
amounts provided in the table below.  66

Rationale for Change  72 
The previous DI definition was developed by the SAS1 Planning Committee after literature 73 
review and chart reviews.   After the study started, the Strabismus Steering Committee has 74 
lowered the threshold based on feedback from SAS1 investigators.   75

SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 1-1 CHAPTER 1:  BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY  156 
 157 
This study is being conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) and is 158 
funded through a cooperative agreement fr om the National Eye Institute.  159 
 160 
1.1 Background  161 
Epidemiology and clinical characteristics : 162 
New onset adult strabismus has been estimated to affect 54.1/100,000 in a recent population - 163 
based study in the USA.1  In this study, the most common type s of new onset strabismus in 164 
adults, after paralytic strabismus, were convergence insufficiency (8.4/100,000), small angle 165 
hypertropia (7.5/100,000) and divergence insufficiency (6.0/100,000).  For each of these 166 
types the incidence increased with increasin g age.1 167 
 168 
Convergence insufficiency : 169 
Convergence insufficiency (CI) is characterized by an exodeviation greater at near than at 170 
distance and a remote near point of convergence and/or decreased posi tive fusional vergence.2  171 
It is typically associated with symptoms such as diplopia, eyestrain, asthenopia, frontal 172 
headaches or problems reading.2-4  Treatment consists of either exercises,3, 4prisms,3, 4 surgery,4-173 
6 or botulinum toxin  injection.7 174 
 175 
There is a paucity of evidence for the effectiveness of treatment for CI in adults, with most 176 
previous reports studying effects in children.  A rec ent Cochrane review2 identified two 177 
previous randomized clinical trials in adults.  Teitelbaum et al8 randomly assigned 29 178 
presbyopic patients with symptomatic CI to either progressive addition lenses wi th base -in 179 
prism or progressive addition lenses with no prism.  The authors concluded that base -in prism 180 
glasses were effective in reducing the symptoms of CI, although interestingly, symptoms also 181 
significantly improved with progressive addition lenses wi th no prism.8 Birnbaum et al9 182 
randomly assigned 60 male adult patients to receive office -based vision therapy/ort hoptics with 183 
supplemental home therapy, home vision therapy alone, or no treatment.  Office vision therapy 184 
with supplemental home therapy was reported to be most effective with a success rate of 62%.  185 
Despite the findings of these two randomized trials the re remains much uncertainty as to which 186 
treatments are most effective for a given adult patient with CI and what are realistic success 187 
rates.  188 
 189 
Divergence insufficiency : 190 
Divergence insufficiency (DI) esotropia is a comitant esodeviation worse at distance fi xation 191 
than at near, typically associated with symptoms of diplopia at distance.10  Treatment most often 192 
consists of either prism correction10-13 or strabismus surgery.14, 15  The established surgical 193 
procedure for DI esotropia is lateral rectus resection.16-18  Nevertheless, in recent years bilateral 194 
medial r ectus recession has been advocated.14, 15, 19  There are few studies comparing treatments 195 
for DI esotropia, and little data on treatment outcomes, especially over the long -term.  One recent 196 
study19 claimed medial rectus recession was equivalent to lateral rectus resection but it was 197 
retrospective, not randomized, and had small sample size (n=24) and therefore of insufficient 198 
power to make  such a determination.  199 
 200 
Hypertropia:  201 
New onset s mall angle hypertropia (HT) in adults presents as a comitant hyperdeviation, 202 
typically less than 10 prism diopters, in the absence of oblique muscle dysfunction .  The patient 203 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 1-2 typically experiences symptoms of  vertical diplopia.  There are a range of possible causes for 204 
such vertical misalignment including skew deviation, sagging eye syndrome,20 myotoxicity 205 
following cataract surgery,21, 22 presumed micro -vascular event, or even central peripheral rivalry 206 
(dragged fovea -diplopia syndrome).23-25  Treatment most often consists of prism correction of 207 
diplopia or st rabismus surgery, although partial occlusion may be used in cases of central 208 
peripheral rivalry.  Regarding surgical approaches for small angle HT, some surgeons perform 209 
superior rectus recession, while others have advocated mini -tenotomy (snip) procedures .26  There 210 
are, howev er, limited data on the effectiveness of these treatments for small angle HT and few 211 
studies, if any, comparing treatment outcomes.   212 
 213 
Prospective Observational Studies:  214 
A prospective observational study monitors different forms of treatment applied to patients with 215 
a certain condition.  Individuals are enrolled in a prospective observational study on the basis of 216 
either disease or exposure status .  The care provider, not a protocol, decides how a patient gets 217 
treated .  Through direct data collection fro m care providers, the results of the ongoing disease 218 
process and medical care can then be observed.  219 
 220 
Prospective observational studies have the advantage of applying inclusion/exclusion criteria and 221 
not dictating management .  The large patient sample often  enables better estimation of outcome 222 
rates.  Also, since data are collected within standard clinical practice, the results have high 223 
external validity.  Weaknesses of observational studies include difficulty in identifying and 224 
controlling all sources of b ias, and challenges with respect to data analys es.  There may also be 225 
variability in time intervals between visits and treatments , and the potential for confounding 226 
makes treatment group comparisons difficult to interpret .  Despite these weaknesses, f uture  227 
randomized controlled trials may be developed based on preliminary estimates of treatment  228 
effects  that an  observational study  provides  for the studied conditions.  229 
 230 
1.2 Rationale for the study  231 
Purpose of an adult CI -DI-HT strabismus prospective observational s tudy:  232 
A prospective adult strabismus observational study will provide data on the numbers, types and 233 
clinical characteristics of adult patients with CI, DI or HT who are seen by PEDIG investigators 234 
and are receiving certain types of treatments , and on the  outcomes of those treatments over one 235 
year.  These data will be used to generate hypotheses for possible future PEDIG studies, 236 
including randomized trials .  Data collected will include angle of deviation, diplopia severity, 237 
treatment type, and treatment o utcome.   238 
 239 
Public health importance:  240 
There are limited prospective, standardized data available on adults with convergence 241 
insufficiency, divergence insufficiency or small angle hypertropia, the commonest causes of non - 242 
paralytic adult strabismus .  This study will inform regarding the numbers and types of adults 243 
with these conditions seen by PEDIG investigators, enabling the generation of hypotheses for 244 
potential PEDIG studies and estimation of their recruitment feasibility.  245 
 246 
1.3 Considerations  247 
It is recogniz ed that estimates of treatment success may be biased by patient selection, but for 248 
some conditions / treatments , these data will be the best available for planning future PEDIG 249 
studies.  250 
 251 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 1-3 1.4 Study Objectives  252 
To describe clinical characteristics, treatments, an d one -year outcomes of adults with 253 
convergence insufficiency, divergence insufficiency, or small angle hypertropia.  Treatment 254 
comparisons within the studied conditions will also be done to help develop  future studies.  255

recorded.  For those treated with botulinum toxin injection, the muscle(s) injected and dose will 731 
be recorded.  The timing of surgical intervention after enrollment is at investigator discretion; 732 
however, the enrollment assessments must be redone if surgery is  not done within 60 days.  733 
 734 
Changing treatment within a modality (e.g. , frequency, strength, intensity ) has no impact on the 735 
subject’ s visit schedule.  Switching to a different treatment or adding a second treatment to the 736 
initial treatment has implications for the subject’s visit schedule ( see section 3.5 ). 737 
 738 
3.2 Visit Schedule  739 
Subjects enrolled will have visits at the following times : 740 
• 10 weeks ± 3 weeks foll owing intervention  741 
• 12 months ± 2 months following intervention  742 
 743 
Visits will be timed from the date of surgery or botulinum toxin injection (if applicable); or if 744 
prescribed prism or orthop tic exercises, will be timed from the day of enrollment.  If a new 745 
treatment is initiated, the visit schedule may restart or the subject’s study participation may end, 746 
according to the details in section 3.5 . 747 
 748 
3.3 Follow -up Visit Testing Procedures (10 -week and 12 -month visits)  749 
At each visit, data on treatments received, any c hange in the amount/intensity of treatment, or 750 
any major change in eye condition since the last visit will be collected.  In addition, the 751 
following will be performed / completed as done at the enrollment exam in the subject’s current 752 
correction, if requir ed, and without cycloplegia.  Questionnaires and the symptom survey (if 753 
applicable) should be administered to the subject prior to other examination procedures.  Any 754 
subjects wearing prism correction will be measured in trial frames without prism (unless 755 
otherwise noted below).   If new correction is prescribed on the day of testing, or if the subject 756 
forgot to bring his/her spectacles, then testing should be done in trial frames.      757 
 758

single vision either in current correction (if pre -study prism) or with prism correction 794 
in trial frames.   795 
6. Double Maddox Rod Testing  796 
 797 
3.4 Non-study Visits  798 
Additional no n-study visits and treatment are at investigator discretion.  Investigators must 799 
follow the procedures for initiating a new treatment during the study as outlined in section 3.5 .  800 
 801 
3.5 Initiating a New Treatment  802 
If any new treatment is initiated during the stu dy an early outcome exam as outlined in section 803 
3.3 will be completed.  Study participation will end if the new treatment is prism or exercises , 804 
unless initially enrolled in the surgery or botox injection group .  If the new treatment is a new 805 
surgical moda lity or botox injection  (not a re -operation or re -injection in the study), the 806 
examination will serve both as the outcome exam for the initial treatment and the baseline exam 807 
for the newly initiated surgery or botox injection , if the subject still meets el igibility criteria .  The 808 
subject will then be followed for an additional 12 -months in the study  in the new treatment , as if 809 
they had been newly enrolled.    810 
 811 
In the event that the study category for the newly initiated surgical modality is no longer 812 
recruit ing subjects, the subject will complete an early  outcome exam at the time the new surgery 813 
or botox injection  is prescribed  and study participation will end for this subject.  814 
 815 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 3-3 Subjects who have had surgery or botox injection as their initial treatment (or as a new treatment 816 
during the study) will continue to be followed until the 12 -month outcome exam whether or not 817 
an additional treatment is initiated .  The exception is if a re-operation or re -injection  is planned 818 
prior to th e 12-month outcome .  In this case, an early outcome exam will be completed at the 819 
time surgery is prescribed .  Study participation will end following the outcome examination.   820 
 821 
Subjects who have completed the study and are returning for additional treatmen t following an 822 
unspecified period of time beyond the outcome exam may be enrolled a second time provided 823 
they meet eligibility criteria and the study category for the newly initiated treatment is still 824 
recruiting subjects.  Subjects enrolling as a study su bject a second time must repeat the consent 825 
process.  826 
 827 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 4-1 CHAPTER 4:  MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATION S 828 
 829 
4.1 Contacts by the Jaeb Center for Health Research and Sites  830 
The Jaeb Center serves as the PEDIG Coordinating Center.  The Jaeb Center will be provided  831 
with the subject’s contact information.  The Jaeb Center will contact each subject one month 832 
before any 12 -month visit  (including a second 12 -month visit which could be required if the 833 
patient changed treatments during the study) .  Permission for such con tacts will be included in 834 
the Informed Consent Form.  The principal purpose of the contacts will be to help coordinate 835 
scheduling of the 12 -month outcome examination.   836 
 837 
4.2 Subject Withdrawals  838 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time.  This is expected to be a very infrequent 839 
occurrence in view of the study design’s similarity to routine clinical practice.  If the subject 840 
indicates they want to withdraw from the study, the investigator personally should attempt to 841 
speak with them to determine th e reason.  If their interest is in transferring their care to another 842 
eye care provider, every effort should be made to comply with this and at the same time try to 843 
keep the participant in the study under the new provider’s care.  844 
 845 
4.3 Management of Refractive Error  846 
Management of refractive error is at the discretion of the investigator.     847 
 848 
4.4 Risks  849 
There are no risks in this study that would not be part of usual care.  850 
 851 
4.4.1 Risks of Examination Procedures  852 
The procedures in this study are part of daily eye care practic e in the United States and pose no 853 
known risks.  854 
 855 
4.5 Reporting of Adverse Events  856 
No treatments are being prescribed that are not part of usual care.  Investigators will abide by 857 
local IRB reporting requirements.  858 
 859 
4.5.1 Risk Assessment  860 
It is the investigators’ opin ion that the protocol’s level of risk is research not involving greater 861 
than minimal risk.  862 
 863 
4.6 Discontinuation of Study  864 
The study may be discontinued by the Steering Committee (with approval of the Data and Safety 865 
Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanne d completion of enrollment and follow -up for all 866 
subjects.  867 
 868 
4.7 Travel Reimbursement  869 
Subject s will be compensated $ 25 for each 10-week visit and $50 for each 12-month visit (by  870 
money -card) up to a maximum of $ 150.  If there are extenuating circumstances, and t he subject 871 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 4-2 is unable to complete study visits without additional funds for travel costs, additional funds may 872 
be provided.  873 
 874 
4.8 Study Costs  875 
The study will pay for visits specific to the research study, but will not pay for usual care visits 876 
that would occur w hether or not the subject  was in the study.  The cost of usual care visits will be 877 
the responsibility  of the participant or his/her insurance company .  878 
 879 
Any costs associated with treatment will not be paid for by the study and will be the 880 
responsibility of the participant or his/her insurance company .  881 
 882 
4.9 General Considerations  883 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the net work policies 884 
document, with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 885 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice.  886 
 887 
Data will be directly collected in electronic case report form s, which will be considered the 888 
source data.   889 
 890 
There is no restriction on the number of participants to be enrolled by a site.  A risk -based 891 
monitoring approach will be followed, consistent with the FDA “Guidance for Industry 892 
Oversight of Clinical Investi gations — A Risk -Based Approach to Monitoring” (August 2013).  893 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 5-1 CHAPTER 5:  SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  894 
 895 
5.1 Assessment of Investigator Interest / Recruitment Potential  896 
At the February 2014 PEDIG Study Group meeting, 18 (44%) of 41  ophthalmologist 897 
investigators and 26 (65%) of 40 optometrists investigators indicated they would be willing to 898 
participate in this study .  In addition, 8 (20%) of 41 ophthalmologists and 8 (20%) of 40 899 
optometrists rated this protocol in the top 5 of 18 pr otocol  ideas reviewed with the group .  The 900 
study ranked 13th among the 18 protocol  ideas reviewed with the group for the 81 investigators 901 
overall.  902 
 903 
Table 1 shows a summary of the results from a February 2015 email survey of PEDIG 904 
investigators .  For each c ondition (CI, DI, and HT), investigators were asked whether they 905 
treated patients with the condition and how many they treated with various treatment modalities 906 
over the course of one year.   907 
 908

* Cases treated with more than one type of treatment are counted for each type of treatment.  910 
** Bilateral medial rectus resection (N=11), other (N=12)  911 
*** Bilateral medial rectus recession (N=51), bilateral lateral rectus resection (N=13), other (N=21)  912 
****Vertical rectus recession (N=37), other (N=2)  913 
 914 
5.2 Sample Size  915 
The maximum total sample size of 650 is based on a convenience sample of a maximum of 50 916 
subjects per treatment modality (prism, orthoptic exercises, surgery of a specific type) per 917 
condition (CI, DI, HT), with up to 100 subjects treated with surgery for CI an d for HT, and up to 918 
150 subjects treated with surgery for DI  (Table 2) . 919 
 920 
Table 2: Maximum Sample Size for Each Condition/ Treatment Modality  921 
 
Condition  Maximum Sample Size  
Prism  Orthoptic Exercises  Surgery  
CI 50 50 100*  
DI 50 50 150* 
HT 50 50 100* 
*Within this limit for the total number of surgeries for a given condition, no more than 50 surgeries of a specific 922 
type (e.g. bilateral medial rectus recessions, bilateral lateral rectus resection, botulinum toxin  injection, etc.)  may be 923 
enrolled.  924 
 925 
Based on the assessment of recruitment potential ( section 5.1 ), about half of the 926 
modality/condition groups would be expected to be filled to 50 subjects within one year  (see 927 
Table 1) .  The remaining modality/condition groups might have a smaller -than-desired sample 928 
size for analysis or might require recruitment for more than one year.   929 
 930 
931 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 5-2 Table 3 shows the expected half -widths for the 95% confidence interval for the success 932 
proportion estimate for each modality/condition group.   933 
 934

40%  30% 22% 18% 15% 14% 
50%  31% 22% 18% 15% 14% 
*Note : The grey boxes indicate that validity of confidence interval widths is questionable because the normal 937 
approximation might not be valid given these low probability of success and/or small sample sizes.   938 
 939 
After accounting for up to 5% loss to follow -up, a sample size of 50 patients per treatment 940 
modality (prism, orthoptic exercises, surgery of a specific type) per condition would contribute 941 
about 47 subjects to the point estimate for a dichotomous success/failure outcome at one year. 942 
With 47 subjects, t he maximum width of the resulting confidence intervals on each point 943 
estimate would be ± 14%.   944 
 945 
5.3 Primary Analysis – Symptom Success at One Year  946 
For each of the modality/condition groups, th e primary analysis will be an estimation of the 947 
proportion of patients of patients with treatment success based on improvement of symptoms at 948 
10 weeks post intervention and at one year, with 95% confidence intervals.  949 
 950 
Table 4 shows the criteria for symptom  success for each condition, which will be used to assess 951 
all treatment modalities.    952 
 953 
Table 4: One -Year Symptom Success Criteria for Each Condition  954 
Condition  One-Year Symptom Success Criteria  
CI improvement of CI Symptom Survey ( CISS ) score of at least 9 points AND a 
score of <21 points   
DI diplopia no more than rarely in the past week in the primary position (question 
#1.1 on the Diplopia questionnaire )  
HT  diplopia no more than rarely in the past week both in the primary position and 
for reading (questions #1.1 and #1.2 on the Diplopia questionnaire ) 
 955 
For patients who initiate a new treatment before completing one year of follow -up, the symptom 956 
success/failure status from the visit at which treatment w as changed (i.e. , the 10 -week interim 957 
visit or an early outcome visit) will be brought forwa rd as their one -year outcome.  958 
 959 
 
SAS1 Protocol v2.0 4 -11-16 5-3 Rubin’s multiple imputation21 will be used to impute outcome for patients who have not changed 960 
treatments  but who are who are lost to follow -up or withdraw from the study prior to one -year 961 
exam.   962 
 963 
5.4 Secondary Analysis  – Motor Success at One Year  964 
For each surgery type within a condition, a secondary objective will be to calculate the 965 
proportion of patients with motor success at one year and a 95% confidence interval.  Motor 966 
success will be defined as orthotropia by cove r/uncover at distance and near fixation in primary 967 
position at one ye ar.  Similar to the primary analysis of symptom success, for patients who 968 
change treatments before completing one year of follow -up, the motor success/failure status from 969 
the visit at which treatment was changed (i.e., the 10 -week interim visit or an early outcome 970 
visit) will be brought forward as the one -year outcome.  In addition, Rubin’s multiple 971 
imputation21 will be used to impute outcome for patients who have not changed treatments but 972 
who are who are lost to follow -up or withdraw from the study prior to one -year exam.  973 
 974 
5.5 Additional Analyses  975 
5.5.1 Secondary Outcomes at One Year  976 
Secondary outcomes at one year will be evaluated within each modality/condition.  Secondary 977 
outcomes to be assessed include motor alignment, near point of convergence (CI only), positive 978 
fusional vergence (CI only), negative fusional vergence (DI only), vertical fusional vergence (HT 979 
only), and the Adult Strabismus 20 (AS -20) questionnaire.   In addition, mean CI Symptom 980 
Survey ( CISS ) score will be evaluated for CI, and the AS -20 and Diplop ia Questionnaire will be 981 
evaluated as a continuous outcomes for all three conditions.  982 
 983 
5.5.2 Outcomes at 10 Weeks  984 
Outcomes at the 10 -week interim visit will be evaluated similarly to the primary and secondary 985 
analyses defined for one -year time points  (sections 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5.1 ).   986

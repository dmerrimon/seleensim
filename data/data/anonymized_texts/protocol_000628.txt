Page 5 of 801.0 Background
One in five children diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. lives in poverty;1 and poor children with 
cancer experience higher risks of relapse and decreased overall survival.2,3 We previously found 
that in the context of a clinical trial, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from high-poverty 
neighborhoods experienced lower 5-year overall survival (85% vs 92%; p=0.02) and higher rates of 
early relapse (92% vs 48%, p=0.008) which is more challenging to cure.4 Despite these disparities, 
poverty as a contributor to disease outcome has never been targeted in a systematic fashion in 
childhood cancer. We hypothesize that interventions targeting modifiable domains of poverty 
during cancer therapy will reduce disparities in childhood cancer outcomes. 
One barrier to the development of poverty-targeted interventions for the clinical setting is the 
perception of poverty as a non-modifiable variable. Household material hardship (HMH), a 
concrete measure of poverty defined as unmet basic needs including food, heat, housing or 
transportation, represents an ideal focus for poverty-targeted intervention. HMH is both associated 
with inferior child health outcomes and remediable with intervention.5-9 Notably, prior work by our 
group has identified HMH in 20% of pediatric cancer families at diagnosis and 30% after the initial 
six months of chemotherapy.10 Multiple trials in primary care have demonstrated that systematic 
screening for HMH and referral to existing governmental and community resources (e.g. food 
stamps or food bank) both reduce HMH and improve health outcomes—including vaccination rates 
in children, and hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in adults.9,11,12 While these data provide 
proof of principle that poverty-targeted interventions impact health outcomes, we hypothesize that 
the time-sensitive and life-threatening nature of a childhood cancer diagnosis requires more 
immediately impactful interventions that build upon systematic screening and referral. 
In preliminary qualitative work, we identified food and transportation insecurity as domains of 
HMH most challenging for pediatric families during cancer therapy. We subsequently developed 
the Pediatric Cancer Resource Equity (PediCARE) intervention, an HMH-intervention with novel, 
scalable components targeting food and transportation insecurity with the direct provision of these 
resources. We refined the PediCARE intervention by pretesting it in a small cohort of newly 
diagnosed pediatric cancer families with pre-existing HMH (DFCI Protocol 18-275) and gathering 
qualitative and quantitative parent-feedback on intervention design and conduct. We will now 
evaluate the feasibility of the refined PediCARE intervention in a pilot randomized trial at two-
centers. Data from this feasibility pilot will lay the groundwork for a subsequent multi-center study 
of PediCARE with a goal of reducing HMH and improving child outcomes.
2.0 Objectives
2.1 Overall Study Objectives:
The overarching goal of this study is to pilot a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Pediatric 
Cancer Resource Equity (PediCARE) intervention to determine feasibility of intervention 
administration in a childhood cancer population. Secondary goals include generation of effect size 
estimates for a primary endpoint of reduction in household material hardship (HMH) and a 
secondary endpoint of Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit utilization to support 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 6 of 80planning of a subsequent definitive multi-center RCT. PediCARE is a poverty-targeted intervention 
utilizing direct resource provision of groceries and transportation.
2.2 Specific Aims:
Pilot RCT to determine feasibility
To conduct a pilot RCT of the PediCARE intervention in 40 newly diagnosed pediatric cancer 
families with HMH at DFCI and UAB. Families in the intervention arm will receive PediCARE 
for 6-months. The control group will receive usual care. Data will be collected by  parent survey at 
baseline and 6-months. The primary outcome will be defined as feasibility. Secondary outcomes 
will include improvement in HMH scores (range 0-4) at 6-months compared to baseline and 
Emergency Department (ED) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. Analyses will focus on 
effect size estimates to plan a subsequent RCT.
H2a. Feasibility will be demonstrated by recruitment rate of 75% and follow-up survey data 
collection of 80% per arm.  
H2b: There will be a trend towards a reduction in HMH scores (primary endpoint) and lower 
proportion of patients experiencing an ED visit or ICU admission over 6-months in the PediCARE 
versus usual care group.
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Children diagnosed with cancer at DFCI and UAB will serve as the study cohort for PediCARE 
with parents/guardians as survey informants and intervention recipients.
3.1 Inclusion criteria: 
1) Child initiated chemotherapy in the last 2 months for newly diagnosed cancer; 
2) Planned receipt of at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy at DFCI or UAB;
3) Parent/guardian screened positive for HMH*;
4) Child is <18 years at time of enrollment
* In accordance with previous research15-17,21,42 families will be operationalized as having HMH for 
eligibility purposes if they report at least one of the below four concrete needs: (1) Food insecurity. 
47.39,48 (2) Housing Insecurity.16,17(3) Energy Insecurity.16,17 (4) Transportation Insecurity. Families 
are considered to have insecurity in a domain if they screen positive to at least one item. HMH 
screening is performed as standard of care by site-specific providers or will be conducted by a 
member of the research study team.
3.2 Exclusion criteria: 
1) Child with diagnosis of relapsed cancer;
2) Child planned to receive fewer than 4 cycles of chemotherapy
3) Child planned to receive observation, radiation or surgical resection only; 
4) Planned transfer of child to a non-DFCI or UAB facility for chemotherapy treatment;
5) Foreign national family receiving cancer care as an Embassy-pay patient; 
6) Child is enrolled on DFCI 16-001 (due to ongoing embedded descriptive HMH study) or 
NA if enrolling at UAB
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 7 of 807) Child is enrolled on ANBL1531 or AALL1731 (due to ongoing embedded descriptive HMH 
studies
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities:
This study focuses on children with a new diagnosis of cancer with their parents as survey 
informants and recipients of the PediCARE intervention. This study will enroll racial and ethnic 
minorities in a manner that is reflective of the proportion of racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed 
with childhood cancer at each participating site (DFCI and UAB). This study does not focus on any 
race, ethnicity, or gender. No potential research subjects will be excluded from enrollment based on 
race, ethnic origin, or gender; nor will any race, ethnicity or gender be preferentially enrolled. All 
children and their families receiving chemotherapy at DFCI or UAB who meet the primary 
inclusion criteria of screening positive for household material hardship (HMH) at the time of 
diagnosis will be considered equally eligible for participation. It is notable that this is a poverty-
targeted intervention, and thus based on the epidemiology of poverty in the United States racial and 
ethnic minorities may well be overrepresented in a cohort selected for pre-existing poverty at the 
time of diagnosis.
3.4 Inclusion of Children:
This study is a poverty-targeted intervention pilot for pediatric cancer families. Consequently, 
children diagnosed with cancer at DFCI and UAB will serve as the study cohort for PediCARE with 
parents/guardians as survey informants and intervention recipients. The rationale for the inclusion 
of children in this intervention pilot is that our overall research agenda is to improve childhood 
cancer outcomes utilizing poverty-targeted interventions during therapy.
Child involvement in this study will be limited to descriptive medical record abstraction of disease, 
treatment, and care utilization data. Children will not experience direct study contact or 
intervention, as such it will represent minimal risk.
4.0 Planned Enrollment 
This study aims to enroll a total of 40 participants as follows: 
Pilot RCT DFCI and UAB: The target sample size is 40 participants. At DFCI, a total of 28 
participants will be enrolled and randomized (thus 14 participants will receive PediCARE and 14 
participants will receive UC). At UAB a total of 12 participants will be enrolled and randomized 
(thus 6 participants will receive PediCARE and 6 participants will receive UC). 
Families will be recruited consecutively at each site over a 6-month time period. Patients will be 
randomized 1:1 to PediCARE versus Usual Care (UC) and randomization will be stratified by site. 
5.0 Study-Wide Recruitment Methods
5.1 Recruitment: 
New patients at each site (DFCI and UAB) are continuously identified by a local study teams 
(including clinical providers and trained clinical research assistants (CRAs)) and screened for 
eligibility to all open research protocols. Study teams will email the primary oncology team for all 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 8 of 80PediCARE-eligible patients requesting permission to approach in-line with the standard research 
practice in Pediatric Oncology. We will reduce gate-keeping effects by educating providers about 
high family satisfaction with participation in prior HMH studies by our group. The providers will be 
given the option to inform the study team of non-eligibility by email within 72 hours (see Appendix 
A). If the 72-hour period elapses with no response, the parent will be considered eligible. 
5.2 Consent Process:
Following provider permission, eligible parents/guardians will be approached consecutively by the 
study team while in clinic or inpatient and offered an opportunity to participate following written 
informed consent. The study team will offer discussion in a private setting (e.g. consult room) and 
explain details of the study including study procedures, study risks and benefits and study goals and 
methods. This will include a discussion of randomization to UC versus PediCARE. The voluntary 
nature of participation will be highlighted. If, after being introduced to the study and having had the 
opportunity to ask questions, parent/guardians are willing to participate, they will be asked to sign a 
written informed consent document. 
Dyadic children represent the cohort for analysis, child disease and treatment data will be abstracted 
from the medical record. Children will experience no direct research contact as a result of 
participation in the study. Consequently, child assent to participate (medical record abstraction 
only) will be waived. The justification for this is that parents frequently consider household 
income/material resource needs to be a sensitive and private topic which they do not wish to share 
or burden their children with. A requirement to assent children to medical record abstraction will 
require parental discussion of this topic with children. To this end, parent-participation may be 
limited were we to require child assent to participation. 
Should a child reach the age of majority while enrolled on study, study interventions will continue. 
Age of majority consent will be waived for these individuals given that patients will experience no 
direct research contact as a result of participation in the study. Parents/guardians will serve as the 
survey informants and intervention recipients on behalf of their children, and medical record 
abstraction does not require patient contact. The justification for this is that parents frequently 
consider household income/material resource needs to be a sensitive and private topic which they 
do not wish to share or burden their children with. A requirement to complete age of majority 
consent would require parental discussion of this topic with children and could limit parent-
participation were we to require age of majority consent. 
5.3 Registration Process:
All patients, including those enrolled at University of Alabama Birmingham Children’s of Alabama 
(UAB), will be registered in the protocol registration database and assigned a study ID number in 
the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) Oncore. 
Registration Process for DFCI:
A member of the study team will confirm eligibility criteria and complete the protocol-specific
eligibility checklist.
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 9 of 80DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101) must be followed.
Registration Process of UAB: 
Eligible patients will be registered on study centrally at the DFCI by the Study Coordinator in real 
time. Once registration is confirmed, the DFCI study staff facilitating the registration will notify the 
UAB study staff regarding confirmation of registration. To register a participant, the following 
documents should be sent to the DFCI Study Coordinator:
• Signed participant consent form
• HIPAA Authorization Form 
•Eligibility Checklist
All patients will be randomized to either the PediCARE intervention or Usual Care using the 
RedCap Database. Each site will be responsible for randomizing their own patients in RedCap. 
5.4 Strategies for retention: 
We will actively retain families in this study by utilizing ongoing face-to-face study team contact to 
maintain engagement as well as modest remuneration for ongoing participation. Participants will 
not be expected to experience any economic burden as part of this study. Enrolled families will 
receive small ($50 Amazon gift card) remuneration to off-set the cost of their time participating in 
baseline and follow-up surveys (total value $100 if complete both surveys). Prior non-interventional 
survey-based studies of HMH by our group have demonstrated excellent retention over time.
Due to the relatively low-participant burden, modest remuneration, and patient-centered nature of 
the intervention we do not anticipate problems with recruitment and retention.
6.0 Multi-Site Research
6.1 Study Team: 
DFCI will serve as the lead site for PediCARE and the single IRB of record for this small, pilot 
feasibility intervention study. The Study Team at each site will participate in monthly study phone 
calls to address (a) accrual rate, (b) study eligibility determination issues, (c) data completion rates 
including conformance with informed consent requirements, (d) intervention fidelity indicators, (e) 
adverse events, and (f) compliance with data management procedures.
6.2 Collaborating Sites and Role of Sites in Performing Proposed Research:
This study will be conducted at both DFCI and University of Alabama Birmingham Children’s of 
Alabama (UAB). Inclusion of UAB as a collaborating site in this pilot study will leverage patient 
catchment areas which include both New England and Southern states to recruit a more diverse 
patient population from the perspective of race, ethnicity, geography and culture—particularly 
meaningful in the context of poverty as a social determinant of health. Furthermore, pilot feasibility 
at diverse sites will inform subsequent scalability of our approach for a multi-center RCT 
intervention study to definitively evaluate the impact of PediCARE on childhood cancer outcomes.
Under the direction of the site PI Dr. Wolfson, UAB will recruit and enroll a total of 12 participants 
in study. Participants will be randomized to receipt of PediCARE or UC. UAB will maintain a local

administration of randomization and intervention components; administer baseline and follow-up 
parent surveys; and transmit required source documentation to DFCI for central data monitoring. 
7.0 Study Timelines
New patients at each site are continuously identified by study teams. Eligible parents will be 
approached sequentially by study teams and offered an opportunity to participate following written 
informed consent. Participants who choose to enroll will be on study for 6-months. 
8.0 Study Endpoints
8.1 Feasibility: The primary endpoint of this study is feasibility. Feasibility will be defined as at 
least 75% consent to randomization and at most 20% attrition per arm. We will assess process 
barriers to feasibility including recruitment, attrition by arm and parent report of PediCARE 
component utilization (i.e. food and transportation). 
8.2 HMH and Utilization: The secondary endpoints of this study will be used to generate effect size 
estimates to support planning of a subsequent RCT. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated 
comparing recipients of PediCARE versus Usual Care. Secondary outcomes include change in 
HMH utilizing an HMH score (range 0-4) at 6-months compared to baseline; and proportion of 
patients experiencing an Emergency Department (ED) visit or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission 
over 6-months. Study Timeline (Months)

9.1 Overall Study Design 
PediCARE is a poverty-targeted intervention utilizing direct resource provision of groceries and 
transportation. We will pilot PediCARE in a randomized fashion in 40 newly diagnosed families 
with HMH at DFCI (N=28) and UAB (N=12) to assess feasibility and preliminary change in HMH 
and care utilization. Human subject participation includes: 
1) Parent-completed baseline and post-intervention survey; 
2) Randomized receipt of PediCARE versus UC over 6-months; 
3) Medical record abstraction of child’s chart.
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 12 of 809.1.2 Study Processes:
Newly diagnosed families continuously screened for study eligibility; eligible families 
approached to offer consent consecutively (as detailed in section 5.1 Recruitment)
All parents will complete the baseline HMH survey with the study CRA at time of 
enrollment. For those parents for whom in-person survey administration is infeasible, 
baseline surveys will be conducted by telephone, by virtual/video platforms, or by a hard-
copy given to the parent to complete on their own and return to the study team.  
Post-survey completion, parents will be randomized to receipt of PediCARE or UC as 
detailed in Section 9.2. Parents randomized to PediCARE will be introduced to the food and 
transportation resource provisions by the site CRA (see section 9.3.2).
Parents will receive the PediCARE intervention or Usual Care (UC) for a total of 6-months.
Parents will complete a post-intervention survey at 6-months. All parents will be contacted 
by email or telephone (per family preference) in the weeks prior to the 6-month follow-up 
survey. Parents will then complete the 6-month follow-up survey with the study CRA. For 
those parents for whom in-person survey administration is infeasible, follow-up surveys will 
be conducted by telephone, by virtual/video platforms, or by a hard-copy given to the parent 
to complete on their own and return to the study team. 
Medical record abstraction performed at 6-months.
Enrolled parents will receive a total of $100 in Amazon gift cards over the 6-months of 
study participation ($50 gift card after baseline survey and $50 gift card after post-
intervention follow-up survey) to off-set the burden of their time. 
9.1.3 Study Measures
HMH Survey Administration: Parents will complete the baseline HMH survey  at time of 
enrollment; parents will complete the abbreviated follow-up HMH survey at intervention 
completion (6-months). The HMH survey constitutes an abbreviated version of the Oncology EIS 
survey which has been utilized in two prior studies with high willingness to participate and low 
participant burden.10,17 Survey domains include: 1) Sociodemographics; 2) HMH (housing, 
transportation, utilities, food); 3) Finances; 4) Current resources; 5) Social supports; 5) Resilience; 
and 6) Anxiety. Survey administration takes approximately 10-15 minutes and may be conducted 
with an interpreter. Surveys are preferentially administered face-to-face (questions read-aloud by 
CRA) to overcome health literacy barriers which are of particular pertinence in the target patient 
population for this study. Surveys may be administered either on an iPad or paper/pencil. For two-
parent households, while one parent consents to study participation and serves as the primary 
survey respondent (e.g. demographics) it is permissible for both parents to contribute information to 
questions on household material hardship and finances per family preference. All families will be 
contacted by email or telephone (per family preference) in the week prior to the 6-month follow-up 
survey to remind them of the upcoming survey time-point. Families will then complete the 6-month 
follow-up survey with the study CRA either in clinic or inpatient. For those families for whom in-
person survey administration is infeasible surveys may be conducted by telephone, virtual platform, 
or self-completed hardcopy as needed. 
 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 13 of 80Medical Record Abstraction: Child demographic and clinical data will be collected via systematic 
chart review by trained CRAs at the completion of study receipt (6-months) and entered into a 
REDCap database. Ten percent of records will be abstracted by a second CRA and discrepancies 
will be reviewed to clarify abstraction methods and adjudicated by the PI and site PI. Abstracted 
data elements will include but not be limited to age, diagnosis, cancer risk group or stage, treatment 
protocol, treatment elements (chemotherapy, surgery, radiation), hospital lengths of stay, 
emergency department visits and ICU stays during intervention. 
9.2 Procedures for Assignment to Study Group:
Enrolled participants will be randomized 1:1 by site to receive either the PediCARE intervention or 
UC for a duration of 6-months.
Participants will be randomly assigned to PediCARE or UC with a 1:1 allocation by site as per a 
computer-generated randomization sequence created by the study statistician. Sequences will be 
embedded in REDCap by informatics personnel. This approach to randomization will allow for 
real-time randomization of participants. Study personnel will not have access to the sequences. 
After randomization, participants and study team will be unblinded to group assignment as the 
intervention is not amenable to blinding.
9.3 Intervention Procedures: 
The PediCARE study will pilot direct resource provision (groceries and transportation) to 
households of children newly diagnosed with cancer with a goal of reducing a concrete measure of 
poverty, household material hardship (HMH). 
9.3.1 Usual Care (UC) Components (Control): UC psychosocial support in pediatric cancer is 
institution-specific but routinely includes (1) a psychosocial clinician available as part of the cancer 
care team; (2) social work screening for social and financial needs including such examples as 
insurance coverage and eligibility for Institutional, community or private cancer foundation 
supports; (3) social work assistance with applications on a case by case basis for insurance (i.e. 
Medicaid) and community/institutional/private financial supports; and (4) provision of parking 
vouchers and/or limited gift cards (e.g. cafeteria and hospital-retail food) when available.
9.3.2 PediCARE Intervention Components: PediCARE includes direct resource provision in two 
domains: Food and Transportation. Resource provision will be centrally administered by DFCI.
(1) Food: Families will receive a monthly pre-paid allocation of Instacart funds for grocery 
purchasing and delivery in a dollar amount adapted from the March 2018 U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s (USDA) Thrifty Food Plan (see Appendix B) for family size (e.g. family of 4 with 
two toddlers will receive $640; cost range based on family sizes of 2-7 people and capped at 7 
people). The Thrifty USDA Food Plan serves as the national standard for a nutritious diet at a 
minimal cost and is used as the basis for maximum SNAP benefit (e.g. food stamp) allotments, as 
such it represents a valid bench-mark for household food costs. 
At study entry, the site CRA will assist families randomized to PediCARE in creation of 
an Instacart account for online grocery purchasing and delivery. Account creation requires 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 14 of 80a name, email address, telephone number, home address for grocery delivery, and a credit 
card, debit card, or gift card 
Families will subsequently be provided a monthly pre-paid allocation of Instacart funds 
the beginning of each month of study participation. Families will choose and order 
groceries at their discretion over the course of the study. 
Other logistics: Instacart grocery ordering can be performed on any smartphone or 
computer with internet access. Any enrolled family without access to either a smartphone 
or computer will be provided with access to an iPad in clinic or while inpatient for 
ordering. Groceries can be ordered for same-day or future delivery.  Families who live in 
ZIP codes where Instacart delivery is not available (approximately 15% of the U.S.) will 
be provided with an equivalent dollar amount grocery gift card to their local grocery store.
 (2) Transportation: Families will be provided with the option of either 48 round-trip rides (96 legs) 
over the course of six months to use as needed each month  using RideHealth or (b) gas cards and 
parking passes to support an estimated 8 clinic/hospital visits per month. The flexibility of choosing 
which direct transportation support will best facilitate a family’s ability to bring their child to clinic 
or the hospital is based on qualitative parent feedback from the PediCARE pretest.
 (a) Transportation will be provided via RideHealth, a company which provides a HIPAA-
compliant digital platform to coordinate patient transportation utilizing Uber/Lyft and other 
commercial ride services, a web-based on-demand transportation platform. This platform allows for 
HIPAA-compliant account generation using PHI on the back-end, and then links to ride-scheduling 
with Uber/Lyft or other commercial drivers on the front-end without PHI. Built for healthcare, 
RideHealth allows ride-authorization for patients between specified sites (i.e. home and 
hospital/clinic). Rides are booked by the parent, and can be booked in advance (e.g. for a planned 
clinic visit or hospital stay) or on-demand 24-hours a day via their website or dedicated call center 
(e.g. for unplanned clinic or Emergency Department visits). RideHealth provides real-time analytics 
on utilization and performance including timeliness and cost. 
At study entry, the lead-site CRA will create a RideHealth account for families randomized 
to PediCARE within the central DFCI RideHealth account. Families can view only their 
own information to facilitate ride requests. Each account will include pre-authorization for 
48  round-trip rides (96 legs) over six months.
The local site CRA will educate families on utilization of the RideHealth patient-facing app 
to request rides (process is similar to Uber/Lyft app for ride scheduling) 
Ride data including utilization, cost, and time will be provided to the lead site linked to 
study ID by RideHealth 
(b) Families will be provided with gas cards in a dollar amount stratified by distance from 
hospital based on estimated average frequency of clinic visits/hospitalization and 2018 gas 
costs. Specifically, families who live <180 miles from the hospital will be provided with 
$200/month in gas cards; those who live >=180 miles from the hospital will be provided with 
$300/month in gas cards. Families will receive 8 parking passes per month at sites where 
families pay for parking. 
PediCARE will provide both groceries and transportation support to all intervention recipients for 
the duration of the study. Pilot families will be randomized 1:1 at each site to receive the

for children with leukemia and neuroblastoma and covers the duration of chemotherapy treatment 
for most solid tumor and lymphoma diagnoses. 
10.0 Data Management and Confidentiality
10.1 HIPAA Authorization and Waivers: The following protected health information (PHI) is 
needed to carry out the study: contact information (names, addresses, phone numbers, and email 
address) necessary to identify subjects, ask for consent, and ensure follow-up contact with subjects 
throughout the study; medical record numbers are needed to abstract medical information; child 
date of birth and diagnosis, necessary to calculate the child’s age and time passed since diagnosis; 
parent date of birth, necessary to calculate parent age. PHI data will be stored in a HIPAA 
compliant REDCap database accessible only to the study team, all of whom have HIPAA 
Certification and have completed the training mandated by the DFCI Institutional Review Board. 
A HIPAA Waiver of Authorization will be requested to enable thorough screening for eligibility. 
This process involves no more than a minimal risk to subjects’ privacy because identifiers will be 
collected in a secure way and destroyed after the study is closed. In addition, the protected health 
information collected will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity other than the 
research team, except as required by law. Because we aim to enroll participants as close to the time 
of cancer diagnosis as possible, we have a relatively narrow window in which to identify eligible 
participants. Without such a waiver, we would have to rely solely on provider-generated referrals or 
patient and parent self-referral, which would add an undue burden to oncology providers and 
potentially lead to such slow participant accrual that the research would be rendered infeasible. 
Alternatively, requesting consent from each potential study participant prior to review of 
preliminary eligibility would result in an unnecessary burden for families. 
10.2 Data Management: All information collected for research purposes will be de-identified prior 
to analysis. 
Identifying information will include data (names, addresses, phone numbers, emails) 
necessary to identify subjects initially to ask for consent as well as to contact for follow-up 
survey administration if necessary; child’s demographic and disease information. 
The data will be coded, databases secured with a password, and contact information and 
medical record numbers will be kept in a separate database accessible only to the Principal 
Investigator and local RA who have both undergone HIPAA Certification and the training 
mandated by the IRB. Study databases will not contain identifying information, and will be 
linked to identifying information by a unique study ID. 
A separate password-protected key file containing the link between identifying information 
and research data will be maintained by the PI behind the DF/HCC firewall. We have 
extensive experience in maintaining confidentiality utilizing these methods.
10.3 Use of Data for Intervention Administration for Parents receiving PediCARE:
Per the Business Agreement, parent contact information (specifically email address and 
home address) with study ID number will be utilized for creation of a RideHealth account 
which provides HIPAA compliant privacy protections.
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 16 of 80Parents will create their own Instacart account which will not be linked to study ID and to 
which research team will not have access. Parent email address will be utilized to send an 
Instacart gift card for each month of the intervention.
11.0 Statistical Considerations
Accrual: Annually, 420 new patients receive chemotherapy at DFCI and 120 at UAB. Based on 
prior institutional HMH data, we estimate 20% will be eligible to participate at DFCI (N=84) and 
30% will be eligible to participate at UAB (N=36). We estimate a 75% consent rate for a total 
possible annual sample size of N=90 patients (63 DFCI, 27 UAB). Forty patients will be accrued 
over 6-months at DFCI (n=28) and UAB (n=12). Patients will be randomized 1:1 by site to 
PediCARE versus UC. 
Analysis Plan: Sample demographic, disease, treatment and utilization variables from the survey 
instruments and medical chart will be described by summary statistics. 
The rate of consent to randomized intervention and the 6-month completion will be estimated along 
with a 90% confidence interval (CI). Feasibility will be established if the upper bound of the CI 
contains 75% and 80% for consent and follow-up respectively. With an estimated 60 eligible 
patients at 6 months, at least 39 (65%; 90% CI 53.6-75.2%) need to enroll for the upper bound of 
the 90% CI contain 75%. With an estimated 40 randomized patients, at least 28 (70%; 90% CI 56.0-
81.7%) need to have complete 6-month data to have the upper bound of the 90% CI contain 80%. 
The 6-month completion rate will also be estimated along with a 90% CI by randomized arm 
(PediCARE and UC). 
For each family, the difference between 6-month and baseline HMH scores will be categorized as 
improved (change score <0) or not improved (change score ≥0). For each arm, the proportion of 
families with improved HMH at the completion of the intervention (6-months) will be estimated 
along with a 90% exact CI. Based on prior data, we assume a 30% resolution in HMH in UC, thus 
the 90% CI will be within ±24.9%. For each arm, the per patient number of ED visits and ICU stays 
will be summarized (median, range). The proportion of patients with at least one ED and/or ICU 
visit will be estimated for each arm, as well as the difference between arms, along with a 90% 
confidence interval. Additionally, the rate of HMH at the completion of the intervention pilot (6-
months) along with a 90% exact confidence will be estimated for UC and PediCARE. For the 
PediCARE arm, the cost per patient, study team contact hours, and proportion with successful 
receipt of all intervention components will be described overall and by site.
12.0 Data Monitoring Provisions to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
See Appendix E, Section 4 for Data Safety Monitoring Plan.
13.0 Risks to Subjects
Potential Risks to Subjects: Risks for this pilot resource provision intervention are detailed below. 
Participants in this study include children (medical record abstraction only) with parent/guardians   
as survey informants and intervention recipients on their behalf. Children will have medical record 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 17 of 80abstraction only and experience no study contact. All risks of study involvement are expected to be 
minimal.
1. Physical risks: There are no physical risks to subjects in the proposed study.
2. Psychological risks: Parents/guardians will serve as survey informants and intervention 
recipients. Surveys deal with the sensitive matter of family finances and concrete resource 
needs. Family finances may be a source of stress for parents/guardians. The emotional risk 
of anxiety as a result of answering questions about financial hardship is expected to be 
minimal based on data from our prior research. Specifically, prior work on this topic has 
revealed that parents are eager to participate and do not report significant stress or anxiety as 
a result of participation; furthermore, parents participating in prior studies have identified an 
opportunity to speak about financial stresses as being beneficial to them. Participants may 
decide at any time and for any reason not to participate in the proposed study. Receipt of the 
intervention will include receipt of prepaid groceries and prepaid transportation between 
home and hospital. We expect minimal psychological risk as a result of receiving such 
resource provision.
3. Privacy risks: There is a risk of privacy violation or loss of confidentiality; however, this is 
anticipated to be minimal with appropriate protections in place (see Protection Against 
Risks below). 
4. Burden to families due to participation time: Burden is expected to be minimal. Children 
will have no direct study interaction and will not experience burden from participation. 
Parents will complete a baseline  survey (approximately 15 minutes) and a post-intervention  
survey (approximately 10 minutes). These surveys have been administered over 300 times 
in other HMH studies with minimal parent burden.
5. Risk resulting from randomization: As a result of randomization, participants may not 
receive the intervention that ends up being more efficacious. For example, receiving UC 
(control arm) with site social workers and psychosocial clinicians addressing resource needs 
may result in persistent or worsened HMH. However, it is expected if persistent HMH is 
identified in the course of UC such basic resource needs will be addressed by the 
psychosocial team as usual which includes a robust assortment of standard supports and 
interventions. Conversely, being exposed to the PediCARE intervention may result in 
receipt of an intervention that has no ultimate impact on HMH. The risks to receipt of pre-
paid groceries and transportation are expected to be minimal.
Alternatives: There are no alternatives to this study, subjects may choose not to enroll in the 
PediCARE pilot study and will receive usual psychosocial support care per institutional 
standard. Subjects will be counseled during the consent process that participation is entirely 
voluntary and that a decision not to participate will in no way affect the care their child 
receives. Participants will have the choice to exit the study at any time, should they desire to 
do so.
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 18 of 8014.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects
Potential benefits of the research to research participants and others.
Participants in this study have the potential for direct benefit in the form of poverty-reduction due to 
either increased awareness of UC resources created by study participation, or due to randomized 
receipt of PediCARE. The primary goal of the PediCARE intervention is to reduce household 
material hardship (HMH), a concrete measure of poverty which includes food and transportation 
insecurity. All participants enrolled in the PediCARE study will have screened positive for the 
presence of HMH at diagnosis. This screening process is part of UC at both DFCI and UAB, 
however follow-up beyond screening is not systematic and eligibility for existing community and 
governmental resources is not universal. Participants enrolled and randomized to receipt of the 
PediCARE intervention will be provided with pre-paid groceries and transportation for the duration 
of their study involvement. Participants in receipt of the PediCARE intervention may experience a 
reduction in HMH which we believe would be of benefit to the household. 
15.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects
The proposed pilot feasibility study will generate data on approximately 40 pediatric oncology 
families with newly diagnosed cancer treated at two major cancer centers in the United States. 
Aggregate analyses of de-identified data will be published in peer reviewed journals within 1 year 
of study completion. Published data will be free of any identifiers that would permit linkages to 
individual subjects. We will present our intervention refinement process, our qualitative family data 
and our pilot feasibility data at professional meetings/conferences such as ASCO and ASH within 1 
year of study completion. We will present our findings to patient advocacy organizations such as 
the Pediatric Parent and Family Council and the Family Reach Foundation, and disseminate to 
reputable patient resource sites (i.e. NIH/NCI resources for patients).

PediCARE Survey 
Baseline Survey (T0)
Nearly 1 in 3 families experience problems with money or financial stress during their 
child’s cancer treatment. This may include lost income from work, difficulty paying the rent 
or mortgage, keeping the electricity or heat on, or putting food on the table. Financial 
stresses or problems with money can affect both adults and children in many ways. One of 
our long-term goals is to find ways to decrease the financial impact of treatment on each 
family, and to make sure that financial stress does not impact a child’s experience during 
treatment. Information from families like yours will help us achieve this goal.
This survey has multiple-choice questions and will take about 15 minutes to complete. The 
survey is divided into sections that cover topics about you and your family, housing, 
utilities (heat/electricity), food, finances, home environment, stress and neighborhood. We 
understand that some of these questions may feel personal and difficult to answer. You 
may skip any questions and even stop completing the survey at any time. 
Survey responses will be kept confidential. Your answers will  not be shared with your 
treatment team. Survey data will not be placed in your child’s medical record. 
Before we analyze the survey data for research they will be de-identified, which means 
that no information that would permit identification of your family or child will be shared.

PediCARE Follow-up Survey 
Follow-up Survey (T1)
Earlier studies by our group have shown that many families experience financial stress 
during their child’s cancer treatment, regardless of their household income or 
socioeconomic status. Financial stress may include lost income from work, difficulty paying 
the rent or mortgage, keeping the electricity or heat on, or putting food on the table. One of 
our long-term goals is to find ways to decrease the financial impact of treatment on each 
family, and to make sure that financial stress does not impact a child’s experience during 
treatment. 
You previously completed a baseline survey on this topic. This follow-up survey is 
intended to help us understand how family financial circumstances change (or don’t 
change) over the course of therapy. Information from families like yours will help us 
achieve this goal.
This follow-up survey takes about 10 minutes to complete and includes questions about 
housing, utilities (heat/electricity), food and income. We understand that some of these 
questions may feel personal and difficult to answer. You may skip any questions and even 
stop completing the survey at any time. 
Survey responses will be kept confidential and not shared with your treatment team. No 
information will be presented in any way that would permit identification of your family or 
child.

Page 70 of 80INTRODUCTION
The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for conducting a DF/HCC Multi-Center research 
protocol. The DF/HCC DSMP serves as a reference for any sites external to DF/HCC that are 
participating in a DF/HCC clinical trial. 
Purpose
To establish standards that will ensure that a Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi-Center 
protocol will comply with Federal Regulations, Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and applicable DF/HCC Standard Operating 
Procedures.
Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Definitions
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol:  A research protocol in which one or more outside 
institutions are collaborating with Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center where a DF/HCC 
investigator is the sponsor. DF/HCC includes Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) 
Network Clinical Trial Affiliates. 
Lead Institution:  One of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center consortium members 
(Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital (BWH) responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and 
approval of a protocol as well as its subsequent amendments per the DFCI IRB and applicable 
regulatory guidelines (CTEP, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Biotechnology 
Activities (OBA) etc.).  The Lead Institution is typically the home of the DF/HCC Sponsor. 
The Lead Institution also typically serves as the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi-
Center Protocol.  
DF/HCC Sponsor:  The person sponsoring the submitted Multi-Center protocol who takes 
responsibility for initiation, management and conduct of the protocol at all research locations. 
In applicable protocols, the DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison with any 
regulatory agencies (i.e. CTEP Protocol and Information Office (PIO), FDA, OBA etc.). The 
DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protocol and is responsible for the conduct 
of the study at DF/HCC and all Participating Institutions. In most cases the DF/HCC Sponsor 
is the same person as the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator; however, both roles can be 
filled by two different people. For CTEP Protocols this person is called the Protocol Chair.
Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC consortium 
that is collaborating with DF/HCC on a protocol where the sponsor is a DF/HCC Investigator.  
The Participating Institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor as having the ultimate 
authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.   
Coordinating Center: The entity (i.e. Lead Institution, Medical Monitor, Contract Research 
Organization (CRO), etc) that provides administrative support to the DF/HCC Sponsor in order 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 71 of 80that he/she may fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the protocol document and DSMP, and 
as specified in applicable regulatory guidelines (i.e. CTEP Multi-Center Guidelines). In 
general, the Lead Institution is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol. 
DF/HCC Office of Data Quality (ODQ): A group within DF/HCC responsible ensuring high-
quality standards are used for data collection and the ongoing management of clinical trials, 
auditing, and data and safety monitoring. ODQ also coordinates quality assurance efforts 
related to multi-center clinical research.
DF/HCC Clinical Trials Research Informatics Office (CTRIO): A group within DF/HCC 
responsible for providing a comprehensive data management platform for managing clinical 
trial data.

DF/HCC REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTI-CENTER PROTOCOLS
The following section will clarify DF/HCC Requirements and further detail the expectations for 
participating in a DF/HCC Multi-Center protocol. 
Protocol Distribution
The Coordinating Center will distribute the final DFCI IRB approved protocol and any 
subsequent amended protocols to all Participating Institutions.   
Protocol Revisions and Closures
The Participating Institutions will receive notification of protocol revisions and closures from 
the Coordinating Center.  It is the individual Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify 
its IRB of these revisions.
Non life-threatening revisions: Participating Institutions will receive written 
notification of protocol revisions regarding non life-threatening events from the 
Coordinating Center. Non-life-threatening protocol revisions must be IRB approved 
and implemented within 90 days from receipt of the notification.
Revisions for life-threatening causes: Participating Institutions will receive 
immediate notification from the Coordinating Center concerning protocol revisions 
required to protect lives with follow-up by fax, mail, e-mail, etc.  Life-threatening 
protocol revisions will be implemented immediately followed by IRB request for 
approval.
Protocol closures and temporary holds: Participating Institutions will receive 
notification of protocol closures and temporary holds from the Coordinating Center. 
Closures and holds will be effective immediately.  In addition, the Coordinating Center, 
will update the Participating Institutions on an ongoing basis about protocol accrual 
data so that they will be aware of imminent protocol closures.
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 74 of 80Informed Consent Requirements
The DF/HCC approved informed consent document will serve as a template for the informed 
consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent form must follow 
the consent template as closely as possible and should adhere to specifications outlined in the 
DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language for Investigator-Sponsored Multi-
Center Trials.  This document will be provided separately to each Participating Institution upon 
request.
Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed consent document and 
HIPAA authorization, if a separate document, to the Coordinating Center for review and 
approval prior to submission to their local IRB. The approved consent form must also be 
submitted to the Coordinating Center after approval by the local IRB for all consent versions.
  
IRB Documentation
The DFCI IRB will act as the single IRB (sIRB) of record for this study (see protocol section 
6).
The following must be on file with the Coordinating Center:
Initial approval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB. 
Copy of the Informed Consent Form(s) approved by the Participating Institution’s IRB. 
Participating Institution’s IRB approval for all amendments.
Annual approval letters by the Participating Institution's IRB.
IRB Re-Approval
Verification of IRB re-approval from the Participating Institutions is required in order to 
continue research activities.  There is no grace period for continuing approvals.
The Coordinating Center will not register participants if a re-approval letter is not received 
from the Participating Institution on or before the anniversary of the previous approval date.  
Participant Confidentiality and Authorization Statement
In 1996, congress passed the first federal law covering the privacy of health information known 
as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). Any information, related 
to the physical or mental health of an individual is called Protected Health Information (PHI). 
HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be used or disclosed. 
In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the course 
of a study, the study participant must sign an authorization statement.  This authorization 
statement may or may not be separate from the informed consent document.  The Coordinating 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 75 of 80Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB, will provide a consent template, with 
information regarding authorization for the disclosure of protected health information. 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in its 
trials. However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must 
be collected. DF/HCC has chosen to use authorizations, signed by the participant in the trial, 
rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Confidentiality
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly 
confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant specific reports submitted to the 
Coordinating Center should be de-identified. It is recommended that the assigned protocol case 
number (as described below) be used for all participant specific documents. Participant initials 
may be included or retained for cross verification of identification. 
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Registration Policy
Participant Registration and Randomization 
Please see Section 5.3 of the protocol for instructions on the process to register and randomize 
patients. 
 Eligibility Exceptions
No exceptions to the eligibility requirements for a protocol without DFCI IRB approval will 
be permitted. All Participating Institutions are required to fully comply with this requirement. 
The process for requesting an eligibility exception is defined below.
DF/HCC Protocol Case Number/Study ID
At the time of registration, the following identifiers are required for all subjects: initials, date 
of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. Once eligibility has been established and the participant 
successfully registered, the participant is assigned a unique protocol case number/study ID. 
Participating Institutions should submit all de-identified subsequent communication and 
documents to the Coordinating Center, using this case number to identify the subject.  
Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations
Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to 
ensure that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB review and 
approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant. 
DF/HCC requires all departures from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB approved 
protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible for reporting to 
the DFCI IRB.
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 76 of 80For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” to 
describe departures from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutional policy 
for reporting to their local IRB.
Definitions
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB-approved 
protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its implementation.
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Protocol Violation: Any protocol departure that was not prospectively approved by the IRB 
prior to its initiation or implementation. 
 Reporting Procedures
DF/HCC Sponsor: is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions, deviations and 
violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol 
violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines. 
Participating Institutions: Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the DFCI 
IRB. The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating Center 
who will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the 
deviation is submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per institutional policy. A copy of 
the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the 
Coordinating Center within 10 business days after the original submission.  The deviation may 
not be implemented without all required approvals.
All protocol violations must be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner. The 
Coordinating Center will provide training for the requirements for the reporting of violations. 
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for review. 
Subsequently, the Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be submitted 
to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines. 
Safety Assessments 
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, rights 
and well-being of study participants. 
Version 1.6
May 24, 2021 
Page 77 of 80MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL
The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance and 
data accuracy. The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the DF/HCC Office of Data Quality, 
provides quality control oversight for the protocol.
Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance
This is a small pilot multisite clinical trial of a supportive care intervention that provides 
minimal risk to participants and the prospect of direct benefit. As such, data monitoring will 
be carried out by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) composed of investigators 
representing different disciplines and expertise. The team will be comprised of Co-
investigators: Drs. Bona and Wolfson; as well as three members who are not participating in 
the study (Dr. Joanne Wolfe; Dr. Anna Muriel; Dr. Abby Rosenberg) who will act as 
independent monitors. The committee will be convened at the beginning of the study via 
conference calls, to provide input and guidance on study conduct including quality assurance 
and safety issues as well as data management activities. All data reviewed by the DSMC will 
be blinded. DSMC virtual meetings will take place quarterly by videoconference calls.
The DSMC will be in charge of monitoring: 1) data quality for completeness, timeliness, and 
accuracy including conformance with informed consent requirements; 2) participants' accrual 
and retention; 3) adverse events; 4) participants' withdrawals, compliance issues or any 
complaints about the research; 5) intervention fidelity indicators; 6) compliance with
data management procedures; 7) reviewing any protocol modifications/deviations that may 
occur between DSMC review periods. 
Safety Monitoring:  As above, we will utilize a DSMC to ensure that the trial is conducted 
according to the approved protocol. There are no physical risks to this study. There is a minimal 
risk of psychological distress to parents from completing in-depth interviews and surveys on 
the sensitive topic of basic resource needs and finances. 
Data Management: Registration and patient tracking will be performed using DF/HCC ODQ 
OnCore system. This protocol will be registered with OnCore, allowing for centralized 
enrollment tracking in an ODQ-approved manner. The study team has been trained and has 
experience in using this system. All surveys and abstraction data will be stored in an 
institutionally-coordinated Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database, which 
offers a secure web application. An institution-specific tracking log will also be kept as an 
Excel spreadsheet. These spreadsheets will be located on HIPAA-compliant DF/HCC servers. 
Physical study documents (i.e. paper surveys) will be stored in locked cabinets, and will only 
be identified by study ID. 
Study data from all sites will be entered, stored, and managed in a password-protected REDCap 
database structured for this study on a secured server. REDCap is a research-focused electronic 
data capture system. Data will be verified both at point-of-entry and subsequently by a series 
of range checks, logical between-items checks, and outlier checks.

Page 78 of 80Quality Control Monitoring: The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification 
of protocol compliance and data accuracy. The Coordinating Center (DFCI), with the aid of 
the ODQ provides quality control oversight for the protocol. Accrual will be monitored for 
each participating institution by the DSMC. 
The Participating Institutions may be required to submit participant source documents to the 
Coordinating Center for monitoring. Participating Institution may also be subject to on-site 
monitoring conducted by the Coordinating Center. 
Participating institutions will be required to participate in monthly Coordinating Center 
initiated teleconferences. 
Remote Monitoring will be performed by central monitoring of REDCap survey completion 
(data are electronically entered and stored thus source verification is non-applicable unless 
paper/pencil survey administered due to technological challenges in which case these will be 
scanned and securely emailed to DFCI for central data entry and source documentation). 
Monitoring Reports
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all monitoring reports to ensure protocol compliance. The 
DF/HCC Sponsor may increase the monitoring activities at Participating Institutions that are 
unable to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor requirements or federal and local 
regulations. 
Accrual Monitoring
Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish accrual 
requirements for each participating institution. Accrual will be monitored for each 
participating institution by the DF/HCC Sponsor or designee. Sites that are not meeting their 
accrual expectations may be subject to termination.
Accrual expectations for University Alabama Birmingham are as follows: Enrollment of 12 
participants over 12 months.
AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance and involves the systematic and independent 
examination of all trial related activities and documents.  Audits determine if evaluated 
activities were appropriately conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and 
analyzed, and accurately reported per the protocol, applicable Policies, and the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR).

Page 79 of 80DF/HCC Internal Audits
 
All Participating Institutions are subject to audit by the DF/HCC Office of Data Quality 
(ODQ). Typically, approximately 3-4 participants would be audited at the site over a 2-day 
period. If violations which impact participant safety or the integrity of the study are found, 
more participant records may be audited. 
Audit Notifications
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify the Coordinating Center of all 
external audits or inspections (e.g., FDA, EMA, NCI) that involve this protocol. All institutions 
will forward a copy of final audit and/or re-audit reports and corrective action plans (if 
applicable) to the Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after the audit date. 
Audit Reports 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all final audit reports and corrective action plans, if 
applicable. The Coordinating Center, must forward any reports to the DF/HCC ODQ per 
DF/HCC policy for review by the DF/HCC Audit Committee. For unacceptable audits, the 
DF/HCC Audit Committee would forward the final audit report and corrective action plan to 
the DFCI IRB as applicable.
Participating Institution Performance
The DF/HCC Sponsor and the IRB of record are charged with considering the totality of an 
institution’s performance in considering institutional participation in the protocol.
Participating Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accrual, submission of 
timely and accurate data, adherence to protocol requirements, and compliance with state and 
federal regulations, may be recommended for a six-month probation period. Such institutions 
must respond with a corrective action plan and must demonstrate during the probation period 
that deficiencies have been corrected, as evidenced by the improved performance measures. 
Participating Institutions that fail to demonstrate significant improvement will be considered 
by the DF/HCC Sponsor for revocation of participation. A DF/HCC Sponsor and/or the DFCI 
IRB may terminate a site’s participation if it is determined that a site is not fulfilling its 
responsibilities as described above.

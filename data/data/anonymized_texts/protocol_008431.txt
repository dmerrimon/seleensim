Compound(s):   G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)  
Lilly Glucagon for Injection (rDNA origin)  
Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy (return to 
plasma glucose >70.0 mg/dL) of G -Pen 1 mg (test) to be non- inferior to Lilly 
Glucagon 1 mg (r eference), in T ype 1 diabetic (T1D ) subjects in a state of 
insulin -induced hypoglycemia. This will be assessed by the comparison of 
failure rates of plasma glucose to have a measured value > 70.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes of administration of glucagon.  
The secondary objectives of this study a re: 
1. To demonstrate the efficacy ( either return to plasma glucose >70.0 mg/dL 
or an increase in plasma glucose ≥ 20 mg/dL within 30 minutes post study 
drug injection) of G -Pen 1 mg (test) to be non- inferior to Lilly Glucagon 1 
mg (reference), in T1D subject s in a state of insulin -induced 
hypoglycemia.  
2. To demonstrate the efficacy (return to plasma glucose >70.0 mg/dL or  
alleviation of all neuroglycopenic symptoms at 30 minutes post study drug 
injection) of G -Pen 1 mg (test) to be non- inferior to Lilly Glucago n 1 mg 
(reference), in T1D subjects in a state of insulin- induced hypoglycemia. 
3. To compare the pharmacodynamic characteristics of G -Pen 1 mg (test) 
versus Lilly Glucagon 1 mg (reference) in T1D subjects who are in a state 
of insulin- induced hypoglycemia. 
4. To compare G -Pen (test) and Lilly Glucagon  (reference)  with  regards to 
hypoglycemia symptom relief.  
5. To compare  G-Pen (test)  and Lilly Glucagon  (reference)  with  regards to 
the preparation time required to inject to the abdomen from a decision to 
treat.

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 Study Methods : Subjects will complete the screening procedures up to 30 days before dosing  to 
determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment period. Subjects not 
meeting eligibility criteria can be rescreened after a 30- day wait.  
The evening prior to each inpatient study visit, subjects with confirmed blood 
glucose not greater than 350 mg/dL will be admitted for an overnight stay 
between 6 and 8 pm and a CGM will be placed at the discretion of the 
Investigator . At investigator discretion, the subject may visit the clinic up to 5 
days prior to the scheduled check -in for placement of the CGM. Subjects will 
be provided a standardized dinner and will continue their usual insuli n 
regimen. At Investigator  discretion, subjects may receive a standardized snack 
before midnight.  
Subjects will be instructed to fast after midnight . If site staffing allows for 
appropriate oversight, a n intravenous catheter will be placed, and maintenance 
fluids administered. If not, the subject’s own infusion pump will be used 
overnight  if applicable. The subject ’s blood glucose will be monitored 
overnight, and glucose (IV or oral tablets) or insulin (IV or SC) will be 
administered as necessary to maintai n blood glucose in  a target  range of 80-
150 mg/ dL. 
In the morning of the inpatient study visit, the subject ’s plasma glucose will be 
measured and verified to be not more than 270  mg/dL to be confirmed eligible 
for continuation into the insulin induction pr ocedure. As another confirmation 
of eligibility for the induction procedure, overnight glucose data will be 
checked , and it will be verified that the subject did not have blood glucose < 
60 or greater than 270 mg/dL overnight.  
The subjects will continue fasting the morning of the procedure and will have an intravenous catheter for blood sampling inserted in the arm. The hand  used 
for blood sampling will be kept warm by use of a heated- hand box to increase 
blood flow and achieve “arterialized” samples. The subject  will be kept supine 
and covered under a blanket  to maintain warmth . 
The subject will be eligible to begin the b aseline euglycemic steady state 
period when the plasma glucose is  confirmed to be within range of 70- 270 
mg/dL. IV insulin will be administered to maintain the plasma glucose within the range of 75- 115 mg/dL for 30 minutes. If the plasma glucose has been 
maintained within the range of 75- 115 mg/dL for at least 30 minute s, and the 
insulin infusion rate varies no more than +/ - 20%, the induction procedure may 
commence.  
Eligible participants will enter a state of insulin -induced hypoglycemia in a 
gradual and controlled fashion, through a monitored, standardized induction 
protocol. Adherence to the protocol insulin dose adjustment algorithm will be 
facilitated by real time data entry on a pair of laptop computers . One will be 
for entry of glucose values as the measurements become available from the 
YSI glucose analyzer. The o ther laptop  will display the induction procedure, 
glucose  results, insulin bolus and insulin infusion rate data, and will provide 
information on glucose trajectory.  
Plasma glucose measurements will be taken every 1 0 minutes while glucose is 
>80.0 mg/dL and at 5- minute intervals once plasma glucose is ≤ 80.0 mg/dL. 
Once the initial plasma glucose measurement < 50.0 mg/dL is achieved, the IV 
insulin infusion will be stopped. A confirmatory plasma glucose reading  will 
be taken  5 minutes later  to confirm that a hypoglycemic steady state  has been

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 reached, which is defined as two consecutive plasma glucose values between 
43.0 and 49.9 mg/dL and an  8-minute linearly extrapolated value for plasma 
glucose is ≥  42.0 mg/dL.  
When a state of stabilized insulin -induced hypoglycemia is verified, s ubjects 
will be administered the  randomly assigned dose of  either G -Pen™ glucagon 1 
mg subcutaneously or Lilly glucagon 1 mg , via the subcutaneous route to the 
abdomen, around the umbilicus at a  90º angle to the skin.  
Study drug will not be prepared ahead of time. Rather, preparation of the IP 
will begin once the confirmatory plasma glucose reading is obtained, i.e., upon 
a “decision to dose.”  
1. As an assessment of the preparation time, the time between the 
decision to dose and injection of the randomized study drug to the abdomen will be measured.  
2. Following dosing, the plasma glucose will be monitored every 5 minutes until 90, and afterwards every 30 minute s until 180 minutes 
post-dosing. 
3. The induc tion procedure itself may elicit symptoms of hypoglycemia . 
Thus, s ubjects will complete a questionnaire regarding hypoglycemia 
symptoms at the start of the hypoglycemia induction period and periodically until either all symptoms abate or 180 minutes post -
dosing with glucagon.   
4 After 180 minutes, the subject will resume insulin pump therapy, if 
applicable, and will be given a meal. The subject may be discharged 
after 180 mins with blood glucose > 100 mg/dL and if medically 
stable. At the Investigator ’s discretion,  the subject’s prescribed  insulin  
regimen  can be restarted,  or the meal can be given sooner, but not 
earlier than 90 minutes post -glucagon, to prevent hyperglycemia or 
rebound hypoglycemia . 
After a wash -out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects will return to the clinic and 
the study procedures will be repeated with each subject crossed over to the 
other treatment. After study -related procedures are performed on each of the 
treatment days, subjects will be discharged.  A follow -up visit will be 
conducted 2-7 days following administration of the final dose as a safety 
check.  
Tolerability will be assessed by comparing adverse event reports between the 
G-pen and Lilly Glucagon groups. In addition, at the end of each treatment 
period the  subjects will complet e questionnaires concerning injection site 
discomfort, and an Investigator  will use modified Draize scales to evaluate the 
injection sites following each administration.  
Data management 
and statistical 
analysis:  Data will be entered into an electronic Case Report Form by site personnel. 
Data will be monitored at on -site visits by Xeris personnel or by a CRO acting 
as Xeris’ agent.  The primary endpoint  will be assessed in both the per protocol 
(PP) and intent -to-treat (ITT) populations . The evaluable set for the PP 
population will be defined as all randomized patients who, during both study 
periods, successfully complete the insulin induction procedure, a nd fulfill the 
criteria for having achieved  a hypoglycemic  steady state,  and successfully 
receive a dose of both study drugs ( G-Pen followed Lilly Glucagon , or Lilly

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 Glucagon  followed by G -Pen). PP and ITT analysis will also be applied to all 
secondary endpoints of the study .  
Sample Size 
Determination:  For the primary analysis, a  failure is recorded if the subject’s plasma glucose 
fails to rise above 70.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes of the administration of the 
dose of glucagon. Using this criterion, a sample size of 85 randomized subjects 
yields probabilities of G -Pen acceptance of 87.7% if the population failure 
rates of G -Pen and control are not more than 2%.  
Subjects  will be recruited at approximately 6 clinical sites with a goal of no 
single center accounting for > 20% of the total sample.

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 6. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
6.1. Indication  
The proposed indication is for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  
6.1.1. Background  
The investigational product is glucagon. Glucagon is a 29 amino- acid polypeptide with a 
molecular weight of 3485 Daltons.  The peptide is secreted by the alpha cells of the islets of 
Langerhan’s in the pancreas, and functions as an anti -hypoglycemic agent and a gastrointestina l 
motility inhibitor. A single glucagon gene encodes a larger proglucagon biosynthetic precursor in 
mammals. Tissue -specific processing of proglucagon gives rise to glucagon, and to glicentin, 
oxyntomodulin, GLP -1, and GLP -2.  As a natural (non- steroid) hormone synthesized in the 
pancreatic islet cells, it binds to glucagon receptors in the liver, causing liver cells to convert glycogen polymers into glucose molecules.  The cloned glucagon receptor encodes a 485 amino 
acid protein with a predicted molecular  weight of 54,962 Daltons [ Jelinek ], which signals 
through both adenylate cyclase and intracellular calcium with an EC50 of ~ 1 nM [ Wakelam ].    
Historically glucagon is being used as rescue therapy for severe hypoglycemia. One of the main complications of diabetes treatment  with insulin is the emergence of hypoglycemia, and the 
absolute or relative excess of therapeutic insulin is the determinant of risk.  Hypoglycemia in 
diabetes is defined as “all episodes of abnormally low plasma glucose concentration that expose 
the indi vidual to potential harm” [ ADA], and present s as diaphoresis, pallor, nausea, palpitations, 
tremors , and anxiety .  If hypoglycemia becomes severe, symptoms may  then include  confusion, 
abnormal behavior, blurred vision, psychomotor abnormalities, loss of consciousness, seizures , 
and coma.  [DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group].  Recent reports have found that from 6% to 
10% of deaths of patients with type 1 diabetes are attributable to hypoglycemia 
[Skrivarhaug , U.K. Hypoglycaemia Study Group].  The American Diabetes Association 
Workgroup recommends that patients with drug -treated diabetes (insulin secretagogue or insulin) 
become concerned about d eveloping hypoglycemia at a plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 
mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) [ ADA].  
Therapy with insulin causes hypoglycemia during the course of established type 1 diabetes, and 
progressively more frequently over time in type 2 diabetes.  The U.K. Hypoglycemia Study 
Group reported an incidence of 110 severe hypoglycemic episodes per 100 patient -years in 
patients with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin for <5 years, and an incidence of 320 episodes 
per 100 patient -years in those with type 1 diabetes treated for >15 years [ U.K. Hypoglycaemia 
Study Group].  Type 1 diabetics suffer an average of two symptomatic hypoglycemic events per week – and a severe, temporarily disabling event approximately once a year [ McLe od].  Insulin-
using type 2 diabetics typically have several hypoglycemic episodes in a given year, 1 -2 of these 
being severe episodes.  There are currently approximately 1.4 million type 1 and 3.8 million insulin -using type 2 diabetics in the US alone [ CDC ].  On average, the total insulin- using patient  
population experiences about 3 million severe hypoglycemic eve nts per year.   
The American Diabetes Association [ ADA], recommends that all insulin - and sulfonylurea -using 
diabetics carry glucagon emergency kits (GEKs) and use glucagon  as first line therapy in the 
event of a severe hypoglycemic event.  However , a recent survey indicates only about 30% of the 
insulin -using diabetics carry GEKs [ Close Concerns ].  The current standard of care for severe 
XSGP -303 Clinical Pr otocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 22  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 hypoglycemia is an injection of glucagon.  Administration of glucagon with current products (i.e. 
Lilly Glucagon for Injection, and Novo GlucaGen®) is a 9- step process including assembly of 
the kit, aqueous reconstitution of the powdered glucagon, and manual administration of the dose 
[Glucagon , Glucagen ].    
6.1.2. Rationale  
Patients with diabetes frequently develop defective regulatory responses to hypoglycemia associated with reduced or absent glucagon responses.  This is an important clinical problem, as current diabetes management with intensive insulin regimens usually increases the risk and frequency of severe hypoglycemic events  that may require therapeutic intervention . 
In response to the unmet medical need for a simple and ready -to-use glucagon for episodes of 
severe hypoglycemia, Xeris Pharmaceuticals is developing a glucagon rescue pen called the 
G-Pen™ , which utilize s Xeris’ biocompatible, non- aqueous peptide/protein reformulation 
technology.  This technology has enabled Xeris to create a concentrated, low volume, stable 
glucagon formulation, pre -mixed and pre -loaded into a prefilled syringe and auto -injector pen. 
This creates a product with a number of advantageous features, including:  a ready -to-use 
treatment with no reconstitution required, precise and rapid dosing, a hidden needle, and 
enhanced portability and availability due to room -temperature stability, to provide a superior 
alternative to currently marketed treatments.  
6.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Experience with 
Glucagon  
Native glucagon for injection (bovine, porcine origin) was approved for use in humans in 1960 [FDA CDER #1 ].  The 29- amino  acid sequence of pancreatic glucagon is identical in humans, 
cows, pigs, dogs, and rats, and is also conserved in biosynthe tic versions of glucagon [ Eistrup ].  
Glucagon for i njection (rDNA origin) was approved in 1998, and is currently the drug substance 
identified in two approved NDAs ([NDA 20 -928] and [NDA 20- 918]).  Complete NDA -required 
pharmacology and toxicology data have been reviewed and accepted by the FDA,  as describ ed in 
Lilly Glucagon [rDNA origin] for injection  and Novo Gluca Gen® (glucagon [rDNA origin] for 
injection) labeling  [Glucagon, Glucagen ].  As Xeris’ drug product is produced by solid- phase 
peptide synthesis (SPPS) , which also conserves the glucagon peptide sequence, the rDNA 
glucagon information is pertinent to the development of G -Pen for the treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia.  A summary of this information can be found in Xeris’ current Investigator’s 
Brochure, which will be provided to each Investigator  participating in this study.

6.3. Description and Composition of Drug Product  
Synthetic glucagon is the drug substance in G -Pen.  Glucagon cGMP grade is manufactured, 
packaged and released by Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland), conforms with USP standards and has a Typ e II DMF filed with the FDA.  G -Pen is a sterile subcutaneous injectable non -

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 aqueous formulation for treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  G -Pen delivers 1 mg of glucagon, 
with trehalose and DMSO as excipients.  The drug product is stored at controlled room 
temperature (20 -25°C) prior to use.   
G-Pen is supplied in 1.0 mL long Crystal Zenith® pre -filled cyclic olefin polymer syringe with 
Flurotec® coated plunger .  The pre -filled syringe is loaded into a Molly ® single -use, disposable 
auto-injector from SHL Group, and is packaged in a sealed poly/ foil pouch. 
6.4. Clinical Experience with Glucagon  
Glucagon has a long history of medical use in the US, and is currently marketed by Eli Lilly & 
Co. as Glucagon (Glucagon Injection [rDNA origin]), and Novo Nordisk as GlucaGe n® 
HypoKit®, both reference listed drugs ( RLD ) for treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  Glucagon 
has a rapid onset of action and an extremely short half -life, and its safety, efficacy , and clinical 
pharmacology have been well established [ FDA CDER #2 ].  The FDA first approved glucagon 
for use in humans in 1960. 
On September 25, 2013, Xeris IND 115091 went into effect and Study No. XSGP -201 was 
completed in January 2014. This study examined safety, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and efficacy of 
rescue doses (0.5 and 1.0 mg) of G-Pen as compared to Lilly Glucagon (1.0 mg) in healthy 
volunteers. Phase 3 studies  in adult (XSGP -301) and pediatric (XSGP -302) subjects  with type 1 
diabetes were completed in August and June  2017, respectively. The results of th ese studies  as 
well as a summary of clinical pharmacology, published studies, post -market surveillance data , 
and immunogenicity of Lilly Glucagon are p rovided in Xeris’ current Investigator’s Brochure.

7.1. Study Overview  
This is a non- inferiority, multi- centered, randomized, controlled, single -blind, two -way crossover 
efficacy  and safety in -patient  study in subjects  with Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D).  The study 
involves t wo daytime clinical research center ( CRC)  visits 7 -28 days apart, with random 
assignment to receive G -Pen™ glucagon 1 mg during one period and Lilly Glucagon 1 mg 
during the other .  Each daytime visit will be p receded by an overnight stay in the CRC.  Subjects  
will complete the screening procedures up to 30 days before Randomization to determine 
eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase.  Subjects not meeting eligibility criteria may be rescreened after a 30 -day wait.  
The evening prior to each in- patient  study visit, subjects will be admitted for an overnight stay 
between 6 and 8 pm and at Investigator discretion a continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) 
(Dexcom® G 4 to be provided by Xeris) will  be placed. At investigator discretion, the subject 
may visit the clinic up to 5 days prior to the scheduled check -in for placement of the CGM. 
Instead of placing a CGM, at Investigator discretion, blood glucose will be assessed  periodically 
during the ove rnight stay via YSI model 2300 or 2900 or an FDA/Health Canada cleared blood 
glucose meter  (hereafter, simply “glucose meter”) .   Subjects will be asked to refrain from 
consuming alcohol during the day prior to the overnight stay. Upon arrival  in the eveni ng, 
plasma glucose will be measured by blood glucose meter and confirmed to be ≤  350 mg/dL, or 
the visit will be rescheduled . 
In clinic, subjects will receive a standardized dinner meal as per the usual  practices of the clinical 
site. Subject s should compl ete dinner before 9 pm . Subjects should follow their usual , prescribed  
insulin regime n at dinner time under the supervision of a study nurse, and will continue their 
usual , prescribed insulin regimen  until midnight. 
Subjects will be instructed to  fast starting at midnight , at which point a n intravenous catheter will 
be placed, and maintenance fluids administered. Blood glucose will be confirmed by glucose  
meter  as necessary  to calibrate the CGM, and blood glucose will be monitored overnight by 
CGM .  At Investigator  discretion, CGM glucose values may be confirmed by glucose meter or 
Yellow Springs Instrument ( YSI) glucose analyzer .  
After midnight, the Investigator  should optimize blood glucose within a target range of 80.0-
150.0 mg/dL through the administration of IV insulin and glucose.  If operational considerations 
at a site  preclude IV administration of insulin  overnight, no catheter will be placed, and o ral 
glucose tablets and the subject’s own insulin infusion pump or subcutaneous insulin will be used  
to optimize blood glucos e with in a target  range of 80 .0-150.0 mg/ dL.  This range is considered a 
target only, and values outside of this range will not be considered protocol deviations.   
In the morning of the inpatient study visit, the subje ct’s plasma glucose will be measured and 
verified to be not more than 270 mg/dL to be confirmed eligible for continuation into the insulin 
induction procedure. As another confirmation of eligibility for the induction procedure, CGM 
data will be checked and  it will be verified that the subject did not have blood glucose < 60 or 
greater than 270 mg/dL overnight. If either of these criteria is not met,  the visit will be 
rescheduled after a minimum 7 -day wait .

G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 25  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 The subject will continue fasting the morning of th e procedure, and will have another 
intravenous catheter for blood sampling inserted in the contralateral  arm.  Ideally , the sampling 
IV catheter should be placed in a vein within  the antecubital fossa .  The hand used for blood 
sampling will be kept warm by  use of a heated -hand box to increase blood flow to achieve 
“arterialized” samples.  The subject  will be kept supine and the abdomen and torso covered 
under a blanket  to maintain warmth .  
Baseline euglycemic steady state period will begin when the plasma g lucose is confirmed to be 
within range of 70- 270 mg/dL. IV insulin will be administered to maintain the plasma glucose 
within  the range of 75- 115 mg/dL  for 30 minutes . If the plasma  glucose  has been maintained 
within the range of  75-115 mg/dL for at least 30 minutes  and the  insulin infusion rate var ies no 
more than +/ - 20% , the induction procedure may commence.  
During the induction procedure, the subject  will enter a state of hypoglycemia through the 
administration of regular insulin di luted in normal saline (see Section 7.2), within a controlled 
and monitored setting. A dherence to the  insulin dose adjustment algorithm will be facilitated by 
real time data capture on a pair of laptop computer s.  One laptop will be used for entry of glucose 
values as the measurements become available from the YSI glucose analyzer.   The other laptop 
will display the induction procedure, glucose  values , insulin bolus doses , and insulin infusion 
rate data, and will provide guidance on appropriate insulin dosing changes based on the subject’s 
glucose trajectory.  The application will in clude a data entry form for the Investigator  to either 
document concurrence or to provide reasoning for any deviations from the protocol algorithm.  
Both laptops will be connected via either wireless or hard- wired secure internet connection to 
each other as well as a central database, allowing Sponsor personnel to monitor the induction 
procedures virtually in real time.  
The combination of one or more IV bolus doses of insulin along with continuous  IV infusion of 
insulin will be used to gradually decrease a subject’s plasma glucose to a target <50 .0 mg/dL.  
As per Section 11.2, all plasma glucose levels will be based on the average of two readings taken via YSI glucose analyzer at each time point.   Plasma glucose measurements will be taken every 
10±5  minutes while glucose is > 80.0 mg/dL and every 5±2 minute s once plasma glucose i s 
≤ 80.0 mg/dL.  
The IV insulin infusion may be stopped when the plasma glucose first reaches <50 mg/dL, or , as 
guided per  the insulin dosing algorithm , when plasma glucose is > 50 mg/dL. Five minutes after 
this first plasma glucose <50 mg/dL, a  confirmator y plasma glucose reading (plasma glucose 
<50.0 mg/dL) will be verified.  The Investigator  will determine whether a hypoglycemic steady 
state has been achieved, which is defined as two consecutive plasma glucose values between 43.0 and 49.9 mg/dL, and a lin early extrapolated 8 -minute later glucose value ≥  42.0 mg/d L. 
If plasma glucose is not in a steady state , the subject ’s plasma glucose should be rechecked at a 
subsequent 5- minute interval .  If this second confirmatory  glucose is >  42.0  mg/dL and a linearly 
extrapolated 8 -minute later glucose value ≥ 42.0 mg/dL is obtained, the subject  will be deemed 
to be within a hypoglycemic steady state.  
If the second confirmatory plasma glucose measurement is <  42.0 mg /dL, the subject  should not 
be administered study glucagon, should be treated instead with IV glucose  or oral carbohydrates 
at the Investigator ’s discretion , verified to be euglycemic,  and their  visit rescheduled after a 
minimum 7 -day wait .

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 After a hypoglycemic  state is verified , the subject will be eligible to receive either G -Pen or Lilly 
Glucagon in one of the randomized treatment sequences shown in Table 3 .  The time of this 
“decision to dose” on the part of the Investigator  will be documented.

Plasma  glucose levels will be monitored for 180 minutes post -dosing.  It is believed that blood 
glucose <50 mg/dL will be low enough to generate neuroglycopenic and autonomic symptoms in 
most subjects, yet high enough (i.e., > 40 mg/dL) to avoid the  impairment o f consciousness.  
Consequently, subjects will complete a questionnaire about symptoms of hypoglycemia 
[Nermoen ] during the hypoglycemia induction phase, and for 180 minutes after treatment with 
glucagon.  
After a wash -out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects will return to the clinic and the procedure will 
be repeated with each subject crossed over to the other treatment.  
After study -related procedures are performed on each of the treatment days, subjects will be 
discharged after receiving a meal  as per each site’s usual practice.  A follow -up visit as a safety 
check will be conducted 2-7 days following administration of the final dose  of study drug .   
7.2. Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure and Justification  
The most commonly used hypoglycemia insulin induction method cited in the literature 
[Nermoen ] involves constant insulin infusion rates many -fold above normal basal infusion rates.  
As hepatic glucose production is determined by the glucagon to insulin ratio, this procedure may not create r ealistic circumstances for evaluating the effectiveness of glucagon in raising blood 
glucose.  The predecessor study  (XSGP -301), therefore, utilized a comparatively lower rate of 
insulin infusion at 1 to 2 times the normal basal rate, combined with intrave nous push of a bolus 
dose of insulin derived from the subject’s own self -reported glucose correction factor.  About 
30% of the procedures performed in XSGP -301 study resulted in plasma glucose ( PG) <40 
mg/d L. To achieve more precision in achieving a steady  state of PG below 50 mg/d L, individual 
procedure data from the XSGP -301 study were fitted to a model of insulin action allowing 
identification of opportunities for algorithm enhancements.  The algorithm was modified 
accordingly and tested in the model of the procedures representing a broad spectrum of subjects , 
including the two extremes of insulin sensitivity that were associated with low PG in XSGP -303. 
Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure  
Subjects will be admitted the evening prior, provided a standardized meal, use their regularly 
prescribed evening insulin regimen, and fast overnight . During the fast, subjects will be provided 
maintenance IV fluids and their glucose optimized , if site staffing permits .  In morning of the 
procedure  (prior to the baseline euglycemia steady state period ), the subject’s plasma glucose 
will be verified to be not more  than 270 mg/dL . CGM will be used to verify that subjects did not 
experience hypo - or hyperglycemia overnight  (i.e., blood glucose < 60 mg/ dl or > 270 mg/dl) . 
During the baseline euglycemia steady state and hypoglycemia induction, subjects should be

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 hydrated using IV fluids. Once glucagon dosing has taken place, IV fluids may be discontinued 
at investigator discretion and replaced by oral int ake of water.  
After the overnight stay, s ubjects will have a second catheter placed for blood sampling, ideally 
located in a vein within the antecubital fossa. The hand used for blood sampling will be kept 
warm by use of a heated -hand box to increase blood flow and achieve “arterialized” samples. 
Use of the heated -hand box will follow the manufacturer’s printed instruction sheet.   
Baseline Euglycemic Steady State  
Prior to starting the hypoglycemia induction procedure, the subject must have PG stable for at  
least 30 minutes  at 95 +/ - 20 mg/d L (75-115 mg/dL) and a stable IV insulin infusion rate varying 
no more than +/ - 20% during which PG must be measured at least every 15 minutes.  
Induction Start   
For the induction, the starting plasma glucose level will be determined as the average of three 
YSI measurements taken over the final 30 minutes of the baseline steady state period.  The following procedures will then be undertaken:  
1. Subjects will continue the IV insulin infusion at the final rate of the  baseline euglycemic 
steady state.   
2. Subjects then will be  given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin diluted in 
saline:  
a. The d ose will be  calculated  as 75% of the dose estimated  to reduce plasma glucose 
from the subject’s starting plasma glucose level to 50 mg/dL based on the subject’s 
self-reported glucose correction factor.   This dose will be referred to as “1 bolus  (full 
bolus dose) ” subsequently.   The Investigator  may use discretion to decrease the 
amount of the calculated bolus dose based upon the subject’s insulin sensitivity factor  
However, the Investigator  is not allowed to increase the amount of the bolus dose . 
b. PG will be measured every 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the current PG value (see Table 4) . 
c. The first insulin adjustment will be made no earlier than 20 minutes after the initial bolus, but will otherwise follow the directions for insulin adjustments shown in Table 4.  
The Investigator  may at discretion override the insulin dosing algorithm, but must document the 
reason for this decision.

28. Any reason the Investigator  deems exclusionary.  
8.3. Randomization  
Randomization will be carried out via the Vision™ electronic data capture ( EDC ) system , 
version 9.3. The just -in-time rand omization algorithm is programmed as a calculation within the 
Vision  software system. The calculation is triggered when 1) site staff  complete the E ligibility 
form and the subject is found to be eligible based on the inclusion/exclusion answers, and 2) the  
user checks a box on the Randomization form indicating a decision to randomize. This triggers 
the randomization calculation that sets the treatment group on the Dose Administration form. 
When the calculation is triggered, V ision generates a treatment based on the remaining 
treatments left within the block. This randomization calculation uses the java cryptographically 
strong SecureRandom random number generator in the case that the treatment group is not 
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 33  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 already determined by the previous assignments. The SecureRandom algorithm computes the 
SHA- 1 hash over a true -random seed value concatenated with a 64- bit counter, which is 
incremented by 1 for each operation. From the 160- bit SHA -1 output, only 64 bits are used. As a 
result, there is no known computer ana lysis that is able to predict the next "toss" better than a 
random guess.  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria and the following additional requirements  will be 
randomized 1:1 by site in simple blocks to receive G -Pen™ glucagon or Lilly glucagon injec tion 
at the first treatment visit.  Randomization at the first treatment visit (i.e., Day 0 ) should happen 
following the overnight stay  and after the baseline euglycemia steady state has been achieved 
and the Investigator  deems it is appropriate to begin the induction procedure  (see Section 10.2).  
A member of the study staff who has verified the above criteria have been met will randomize 
the subject using the Vision EDC system. Once a subject has been randomized, information regarding the glucagon (G -Pen or Lilly) to be administered to the subject at each of the treatment 
visits will be viewable by study staff in the Dose Administr ation form in the EDC system.   
8.4. Subject Numbers  
As each subject is added to the EDC system, they will be assigned a unique Screening number, which will consist of a unique 2- digit site code (starting with 01) and a 2 -digit number (starting 
with 01 at each  site) indicating the sequence at which the subject was screened for eligibility.  
Upon randomization on Treatment Day 0 (see 10.2.1), eligible subj ects will be assigned a unique 
Subject ID number that will consist of the project number “XSGP -303,” the Screening number 
and a 3 -digit number (starting with 001 at each site) indicating the sequence at which the subject 
was randomized for treatment.  For example, XSGP -303-05-10-007 would be the Subject ID 
assigned to the 10
th subject screened and the 7th subject randomized at site number 5.

9.1. Allocation to Treatment  
Subjects will be randomized to one of the two  treatment groups to receive the appropriate 
sequence of blinded study medication (see  Table 3 ).  A total of  85 subjects  will be randomized , 
with a goal of an approximately equal number of subjects being randomized to each treatment at 
both visits.  If there are s ubjects who are randomized but fail to receive either study drug , 
compensatory enrollment  may  be utilized  to achieve at least 85 subjects  who receive at least one 
of the treatments .  Each subject will receive a single subcutaneous injection  to the abdomen on 
each of the two (2) treatment days, with a period of 7- 28 days between doses.   
9.2. Blinding  
For t his study , the subject but not the Investigator  will b e blinded (single -blind design) .   The 1 
mg G -Pen™ device makes a series of two audible clicks when the dose is administered.  To help 
ensure blinding, the subject will wear headphones that play music to mask sound during dosing 
procedures.  The subject’s ability to see the injection equipment and procedure will be obstructed 
by use of a blindfold placed prior to dosing. T he subject will be instructed not to talk with the 
study staff about their impression of which product he/she received at a visit .  
Subjects for whom the treatment has been unblinded inadvertently will be noted, and allowed to 
continue  further study treatments , as per protocol. The statistical analysis plan for the study will 
outline a  separate subgroup analysis  for these subjects .  
9.3. Drug Supplies  
9.3.1. Drug Product Formulation and Packaging  
G-Pen from Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a non -aqueous, injectable liqui d formulation of 
glucagon.  The G -Pen™ drug product consists of 1 mg synthetic glucagon peptide dissolved in a 
primary DMSO solvent, with trehalose added as a stabilizing excipient.  G -Pen drug product is 
filled into West Pharmaceutical’s 1 mL long Crystal Zenith® cyclic olefin polymer (plastic) pre -
filled syringe with a Flurotec® coated plunger.  The pre -filled syringe is loaded into a n SHL 
Molly ® single -use, disposable auto- injector, and packaged in a sealed poly /foil pouch.  The drug 
product is stored at  controlled room temperature (20- 25°C) prior to use.  
The G -Pen drug product is manufactured under cGMP by Pyramid Laboratories, Inc. (Costa 
Mesa, CA), and packaged under cGMP by SHL Group (Deer field Beach, FL), both Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals’ contract manufact urers.  
9.3.2. Lilly Glucagon for Injection  
Lilly Glucagon will be purchased commercially  and provided by Xeris .  The glucagon will be 
stored at the research pharmacy according to labeled storage conditions. 
9.3.3. Preparation, Dispensing and Administration  
• G-Pen will be supplied as 0.2 mL of non- aqueous solution in a plastic Crystal Zenith 
(CZ) 1 mL long syringe loaded into a Molly™ disposable auto- injector.  
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 35  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 Subcutaneous administration will be performed by a qualified site staff member who 
has read the written Instructions for Use  provided by Xeris .  
• In the case of Lilly Glucagon, a new vial of lyophilized g lucagon will be fully 
reconstituted  immediately prior to abdominal administration  using 1 ml of sterile 
diluent provided in the commercial kit as per the label [ Glucagon].  
Study medications will be administered according to the randomization schedule accessed in the 
EDC system  (see 8.3). R andomization will occur at the start of the induction procedure, or about 
2-3 hours prior to glucagon dosing. When the investigator believes  the induction procedure is 
approximately 1 hour  from completion, a member of the study team will deliver the correct IP 
for the visit to the clinic area, making sure to maintain blinding of the subject.  
The s tudy drug s will not be prepared ahead of time.  Instead , preparation of the investigational 
product ( IP) (i.e., re -constitution of Lilly Glucagon) will begin after  the confirmatory plasma 
glucose reading is obtained that indicates that a  hypoglycemic  steady state has been achieved , 
i.e., upon a “decisi on to dose.”  
G-Pen™ is being developed for subcutaneous ( SC) injection.  The marketed comparator is 
labeled for both SC  and intramuscular (IM) injection.  Both products will be administered via the 
subcutaneous route to the abdomen, around the umbilicus. 
The G -Pen auto -injector is made to be pressed against the skin perpendicularly (i.e., at a 90-
degree angle) to the injection site.  The injection technique for G -Pen will follow printed 
instructions for use (IFU) provided by Xeris.  
For Lilly Glu cagon , the skin should be pinched to avoid an IM injection.  The needle will be 
inserted into the loose tissue under the injection site at a 90° angle and the product injected 
smoothly over 1- 3 seconds.  Following injection, light pressure should be applie d to the injection 
site, as the needle is withdrawn.  
Prior to administration  of the study drugs , the intended injection site should be sterilized with an 
alcohol wipe and examined to ensure it has a normal appearance and is free from signs of 
inflammation or injury.  The site staff will document the administration act (i.e.  location, study 
product /dose) in the Vision EDC  system . 
9.3.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
Unless notified otherwise by the Sponsor, all supplied G -Pen auto -injectors and Lilly Glucagon 
kits are to be stored at controlled room temperature between 20°C to 25°C (68° to 77°F), and drug solution should be clear and of a water -like consistency at time of use.  
The Investigator  or an approved study staff will ensure that the study medications are stored in a 
secure area under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
The site will maintain appropriate documentation of continuous storage conditions and these 
records will be monitored in an on- going  basis by the monitor.  Any deviations in the storage 
conditions must be documented (including minimum and maximum temperature excursion as well as estimate of total duration of storage outside the recommended storage conditions).  Such 
deviations must be communicated to the Sponsor as soon as identified by the site with 
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 36  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 appropriate course of action taken regarding the future use of the study medications upon 
consultation with Xeris Pharmaceuticals.  
After administration, used vials of Lilly Glucagon should be returned to the kit and stored for accountability, while the syringe is disposed as per each site’s standard practice.  Used G -Pens 
should be returned to the foil pouch, which will be sealed with tape, and stored for accountability.  Any devices that fail to function should be handled similarly, but be identified on the pouch label as a failure.  Disposal of the study products should occur away from the subject in 
a manner that ensures blinding.  
The Investigator  must maintain adequate records documenting  the receipt, use, loss or other 
disposition of the investigational drug products and supplies .  Unused G -Pens and Lilly kits  will 
be returned to Xeris.  Used G -Pen auto -injectors will be returned to Xeris after accountability is 
performed during site close -out.  Used Lilly kits and other u sed supplies , will be destroy ed 
according to local regulation and applicable Xeris Pharmaceuticals SOPs, following accountability by Xeris Pharmaceuticals  or its designee . 
9.4. Concomitant Medications  
All subjects must be questioned about concomitant medications at each visit.  Medications taken within 4 weeks before Day 0 will be documented in the case report form ( CRF ).  Any changes to 
a subject’s concomitant medication regimen after the first t reatment on Day 0 will also be 
documented in the CRF.  
Except for  those medications (e.g., warfarin) listed under the exclusion criteria (see Section 8.2) 
and other currently investigational agents which are absolutely proscribed, there are no medications that are specifically prohibited during participation in the study.  Subjects should be on a stable dose of all concomitant medications for at least 30 days prior to Screening, and they 
will be encouraged to avoid making changes to their concomitant medication regimen during participation in the study.   In addition, Investigator s are encouraged to avoid adding to or 
changing a participant’s medications during study participation unless deemed medically necessary.

A schedule of assessments for this study is provided below in Table 5 .  
10.1. Visit 1 - Screening (Day - 30 to - 3) 
Subjects will be screened to confirm they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.  
Prior to completing any screening activities, the Investigator  or study team member will obtain 
informed consent from each subject in accordance with the procedures described in Section 16.3 
- Subject Information and Consent .  A copy of the con sent/authorization form will be given to 
the subject. The original will be kept by the site for the source document.  
Subjects will be instructed to complete a screening visit at least 3 days (to allow for receipt of blood t est results), and no more than 30 days prior to the anticipated date of the first treatment 
visit (Day 0).  The following evaluations will be completed during the S creening visit to confirm 
subjects meet eligibility criteria for this study:  
1. Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by a study investigator, including a review of 
the subject’s medical history and medications . 
2. Recording of the subject’s insulin correction factor (i.e., the reduction in blood glucose in mg/d L per 1 unit of insulin taken).  
3. Measurement of height and weight  (no shoes, lightly clothed) . 
4. Physical examination, excluding breast , pelvic , and genitourinary exams.  
5. Performance of a 12 -lead ECG after subject has completed a 10 -minute supine rest.  
6. Assessment of v ital signs, including measurement of BP, after a 5 -minute seated rest.  
7. Urine drug screen.  Note: At Investigator  discretion, subjects with a positive result for 
drugs other than THC will be allowed to participate if the subject reports use of a 
concomitant medication that explains the result (e.g., positiv e urine test for opiates in a 
subject reporting use of cough syrup containing Dextromethorphan) .  
8. Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential  and discussion about study 
requirements regarding contraception.  
9. If applicable, a discussion about st udy requirements regarding breast feeding.  
10. Collection of venous blood for the following tests  as outlined in the Schedule of 
Activities : hemoglobin A1C, c -peptide, complete blood count (without differential), 
metabolic set (including creatinine, liver set,  and electrolytes) , and screening for HIV, 
HBV and HCV ( Table 7 ).  
11. Gold scale for hypoglycemia unawareness  (Appendix  4). Note: this is being collected for 
informational purposes only; no scores are considered exclusionary.  
Once laboratory results are obtained and a final determination of eligibility is made, subjects will be contacted to schedule the first treatment visit.  While immediate r e-testing of laboratory 
results is not allowed, subjects failing to meet laboratory -based eligibility criteria may be 
rescreened after a 30- day wait.

Subjects will be instructed to eat normal meals during the  day but to refrain from alcohol, and to 
follow their usual insulin regimen prior to their evening clinic arrival.  Subjects will be instructed 
to arrive at the clinic between 6 and 8 pm, having not had dinner.  
10.2.1. Visit 2 -  Treatment 1 (Day 0)  
The following procedures will be carried out at this visit.  
Clinic Arrival 
1. Blood glucose (via glucose meter ) will be assessed . If the result is > 350.0 mg/dL, no 
further procedures should be performed, and the visit should be rescheduled after a minimum 24 -hour wait. 
2. The subject will be questioned, any changes in concomitant medications  will be 
documented in the CRF , and it will be confirmed that the subject is not receiving a 
medication that is exclusionary . 
3. Women of childbearing potential will receive a urine pregnancy test , which must be 
negative before further participation is allowed.  
4. If it has been more than 30 days since Visit 1 (i.e., the visit is occurring out of window) , 
venous blood will be collected for a repeat of baseline hematology and serum chemis try 
assessments.  However, the visit may continue based on qualification at the Screening visit.  
5. Full v ital signs  will be assessed after a 5 -minute seated rest. It will be confirmed that the 
subject continues to meet eligibility requirements for SBP and D BP. Other assessments 
of vital signs will be made during the visit as specified in the footnote to Table 5. 
6. A continuous glucose monitor should be pla ced and allowed to calibrate according to site 
procedures , which will include the use of a glucose meter . At investigator discretion, the 
subject may visit the clinic up to 5 days prior to the scheduled check -in for placement of 
the CGM.  
Evening Meal in Clinic  
1. A standardized healthy meal will be provided to the subject (see Section 7.1) with a goal of completion by 9 pm. The composition of the meal  should be described in the source 
documents , and the approximate percentage of the meal consumed should be recorded in 
10% increments , etc.) . 
2. The subject should follow their normal prescribed regimen for insulin, including meal -
time correction, until midn ight. 
Overnight Monitoring  (starting at approximately midnight)  
1. Subjects will be instructed to fast, taking nothing but water  and oral glucose tablets  if 
necessary, starting at approximately  midnight  and will be monitored for compliance by 
site staff.

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 2. An intravenous catheter will be placed  in one arm , maintenance fluids started , and the 
subject’s insulin pump will be discontinued, if applicable .  If use of an overnight IV  is not 
possible due to site s taffing considerations, use of the subject’s own insulin infusion 
pump or subcutaneous insulin will be used overnight.  
3. Blood glucose will be monitored overnight by CGM , YSI or glucose meter . At 
Investigator  discretion, CGM values may be confirmed by glucose meter  or YSI . IV 
glucose or oral glucose tablets  will be given and/ or insulin will be administered by IV or 
infusion pump as necessary to optimize the blood glucose within a target range of 80- 150 
mg/dL.  
4. Ideally, about 1 hour prior to the start of the Morning Procedures outlined below, subjects 
will be transitioned from SC to IV administration of insulin, and any use of IV glucose 
will be discontinued. 
5. Overnight, if a blood glucose of < 60 or > 270 mg/dL is confirmed , the visit will be 
rescheduled after a minimum 7 -day wait.  Otherwise, the subject will be eligible to begin 
the Morning Procedures.  
Note: After the overnight stay, data from the Sponsor -supplied CGM will be uploaded to the 
IMD EDC system, if applicable. Otherwise, the site’s source docum ent for overnight YSI or 
BGM values will be scanned and uploaded to the Vision EDC system.  
Morning Procedures (starting at approximately 6 am)  
1. In the morning, plasma glucose (via YSI) will be assessed, and if > 270.0 mg/ dL, the visit  
will be rescheduled after a minimum 7 -day wait .  Otherwise, the subject will be 
administered IV insulin to induce a baseline euglycemic steady state.  
2. If applicable, t he CGM will be discontinued at this point and all further glucose 
measurement will be assessed via YSI.  
3. If not already placed, an IV catheter will be placed for administration of insulin and maintenance fluids.  
4. A second IV catheter  will be placed  for blood sampling , ideally located in a vein within 
the antecubital fossa.  
The hand used for blood sampling will be kept warm by use of a heated -hand box to increase 
blood flow and achieve “arterialized” samples . Note: The subjects will remain non -caloric 
fasting the morning of the procedure.  
Baseline Euglycemic Steady State (early morning)  
Prior to starting the hypoglycemia induction procedure, the subject must have PG stable for at least 30 minutes  at 95 +/ - 20 mg/dL  (75-115 mg/dl)  at a stable IV insulin infusion rate varying 
no more than +/ - 20% during which PG must have be measured at least every 15 minutes  (i.e., at 
least 3 consecutive values in the target range at 0, 15 and 30 minutes) .

 40  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure (following baseline euglycemic steady state)  
Induction Start   
For the induction, the starting plasma glucose level will be determined as the average of 3 
measurements taken over the final 30 minutes of the baseline euglycemic steady state period. The following procedures will then be undertaken:  
1. Subjects will continu e the IV insulin infusion at the final rate of the euglycemic steady 
state.  
2. Subjects will be  given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin diluted in saline:  
a. The d ose will be  calculated  as 75% of the dose estimated  to reduce plasma glucose 
from th e subject’s starting plasma glucose level to 50 mg/dL based on the subject’s 
self-reported glucose correction factor.  This dose will be referred to as “1 bolus  (full 
bolus dose) ” subsequently.  
b. PG will be measured no less frequent ly than every 10 minutes. 
The first insulin adjustment will be no earlier than 20 minutes after the initial bolus, but will 
otherwise follow the directions for insulin adjustments shown in Section 7.2 (see also  Table 4).  
Insulin D ose Adjustments    
Insulin dose adjustments will be performed as outlined in Section 7.2 (see also Table 4).  
Randomization  
Randomization will be performed after the baseline stabilization  period has been successfully 
completed and the Investigator  deems it is appropriate to begin the induction procedure.  At this 
time, the  subject will be randomized to receive either G -Pen or Lilly Glucagon in one of the 
treatment sequences shown  in Table 3 .  
Confirmation of Hypoglycemic  Steady State .  
1. Once an initial plasma glucose measurement < 50.0 mg/dL is achieved, the IV insulin 
infusion will be stopped.  Note: The requirement is that the average of the readings from the two  YSI leads be < 50.0 mg/dL, but it is not required that both readings be 
< 50.0 mg/dL.  
2. After a minimum of 5 minutes, a confirmatory plasma glucose measurement will be performed.  
a. If the c onfirmatory plasma glucose measurement is 43.0- 49.9 mg/dL , the 
Investigator  must confirm that a hypoglycemic steady state has been achieved as 
follows . A hypoglycemic  steady state is defined as two consecutive plasma 
glucose values between 43.0 and 49.9 mg/dL, and the 8- minute linearly 
extrapolated future PG v alue is ≥  42.0 mg/dL . 
i. If the extrapolated 8 -minute PG value is ≥  42.0 mg/dL, the subject is eligible 
for dosing with glucagon  (see Decision to Dose, below).  
ii. If the extrapolated 8 -minute  PG value is < 42.0 mg/dL, re -check PG after 5 
minutes. If this subsequent PG measurement is ≥ 42.0 mg/ dL and the 
extrapolated 8 -minute PG value is ≥ 42.0 mg/dL,  the subject is eligible for 
glucagon dosing  (see Decision to Dose, below); otherwise, the treatment visit 
will be terminated (see item d, below) .   
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 41  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 b. If the confirmatory plasma glucose measurement is > 50.0 mg/dL, then the IV 
insulin infusion will be re -started, and insulin adjustments made as per the 
induction procedure described above  (Table 4 ), and the sequence will be repeated 
until there are two consecutive plasma glucose readings between 43.0 -49.9 
mg/dL. These two consecutive measurements should occur within 60 minutes of the initial plasma glucose measurement < 50.0 mg/dL.  
c. If the confirmatory plasma glucose measurement is < 43.0 mg/dL , then the 
subject ’s plasma glucose should be rechecked after 5 minutes. If the  subsequent 
PG is ≥ 42.0 mg/ dL, then the subject  may be deemed to be within a hypoglycemic 
steady state.  
d. If the subsequent plasma glucose reading is < 42.0  mg/dL, the treatment visit will 
be terminated. In this case:  
i. Study drug should NOT be given.  
ii. If appropriate, medical intervention to achieve euglycemia can be implemented at the Investigator’s discretion. The subject can leave the clinic 
after glucose is confirmed to be above 100 mg/dL and the subject is deemed medically stable by the Investigator .  
iii. The visit should be rescheduled after a 7- day minimum wash -out period.  
Decision to Dose   
If the subject is deemed to be within a hypoglycemic  steady state, then the subject is ready to be 
dosed (decision to dose)  with study drug .  At this time, the su bject will be eligible to receive the 
randomized study drug.  
Preparation  and Administration of Study Drug  
1. Once the induct ion procedure has begun and glucos e < 50 mg/dL is predicted to occur 
within approximately 1 hour, t he study staff member who will be performing the study 
drug injection should be notified that the  induction procedure is reaching conclusion. At 
this time the  staff member will bring the appropriate unopened test article (pouched G -
Pen or Lilly Glucagon kit) to the bedside , as assigned by the EDC system.   
2. Once the  hypoglycemic steady state is confirmed, the Investigator  will confirm that it is 
appropriate to administer study drug to the subject . The clock time of this “ Decision to 
Dose” will be captured in the source documents. 
3. At this point, t he subject will receive the blindfold and headphones with music playing in 
order to maintain the blind. 
4. A stop watch will be started,  and the treatment administrator will then open the study 
drug container (kit or pouch) and begin preparati on of the glucagon for administration 
following the applicable IFU. An Investigator  should verify that the contents of the vial 
of lyophilized Lilly Glucagon have  been fully reconstituted prior to administration. 
5. Subcutaneous administration of the study dr ug will be made to the abdomen as per 
Section 9.3.3. Upon completion of the administration, the stop watch will be stopped and 
the elapsed time in minutes and seco nds will be recorded in the source documents. After 
the study drug injection , the study product will be disposed in a location away from the 
patient in a manner that maintains the blind. After disposal, the blindfold and headphones 
will be  removed from the  subj ect.  
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 42  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 6. Following study drug administration , plasma glucose will be measured every 5 ±2 
minutes until 90 minutes, and every 30±2 minutes  thereafter until 180 minutes post -
dosing.  
7. At 180 minutes post -dosing , the subject will resume insulin therapy and be given a meal  
as per the standard practice at each site. The subject can be discharged from  the clinic if 
glucose  >100 mg/dL  and the subject is deemed medically stable.  
8. After study drug administration  and before 180 minutes  post -dosing, if rising glucose  
levels  are observed and if deemed medically necessary , insulin  therapy or other medical  
intervention may  be initiated by the Investigator .  
a. Such intervention is not recommended to occur before 90 minutes post -dosing of 
study drug .  
b. Plasma glucose data and  assessments of neuroglycopenic symptoms will be censored 
after the time of intervention, per the statistical analysis plan.   
c. These interventions  (such as  insulin, carbohydrates, or a meal ) prior to 180 minutes 
post study drug administration  should be captured  in the source documents , and 
further glucose measurements may be  performed  at the discretion of the Investigator . 
Hypoglycemia Symptom Assessments  
Subjects will complete a questionnair e regarding severity of hypoglycemia symptoms 
(Appendix  1) at the following time points : 
1. Just before the IV bolus push dose  of insulin is given a t the start of the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure  (baseline) , 
2. Every time blood is drawn for evaluation of plasma glucose concentration during the 
induction procedure , 
3. Just before study drug is administered ,  
4. Every 5 ±2 minutes after glucagon  is administered until all symptoms have abated (i.e., all 
symptoms have score = 1) or 90 minutes post -dosing, whichever occurs first , and 
5. Every 30 minutes (coinciding with plasma glucose measurements) between 90- 180 
minutes post study drug dosing , or unti l all symptoms have abated (i.e., all symptoms 
have score = 1).   
Local Tolerability  and Adverse Events  
Local tolerability and adverse events will be assessed as follows:  
1. Subjects will complete a Visual Analog (VAS) questionnaire regarding injection site 
discomfort (Appendix  2) at 10 ±5 and 30±5  minutes post -dosing, and again at 180±5  
minutes post -dosing if VAS score reported at 30 minutes is > 0 mm.  
2. Subjects will complete an Injection Site Discomfort Description and Duration 
Questionnaire  at 10±5 minutes post -dosing. If discomfort is ongoing at 10 minutes post -
dosing, the questionnaire will be updated before the subject leaves the clinic to document 
the final duration.  
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 43  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 3. The I nvestigator will use the modified Draize scales ( Appendix  3) to assess erythema and 
edema formation at the injection site at 10±5  and 30±5  minutes following administration.  
Any injection site with a score > 0 for either erythema or edema at 30 minutes post-
dosing will be re -evaluated for both at 180±5  minutes post -dosing. If any scores remain > 
1 at the 180- minute evaluation, the subject may leave the clinic but will be instructed to 
contact study staff if the condition fails to resolve.  
Note: Ideally, the same investigator will assess  the injection sites on the  subject , during  
both treatment visits.  
4. Adverse events reported by the subject or observed by an Investigator  during the visit 
will be recorded in the CRF.  
10.2.2. Visit 3 -  Treatment 2 (Day 7- 28) 
The subject will return 7 to 28 days following the first treatment visit.  The procedures to be 
repeated at this visit are as listed in Section  10.2.1.  If it has been more than 28 days since Visit 2 
(i.e., the visit is occurring out of window) , venous blood will be collected for a repeat of 
hematology and serum chemistry assessments. However, the visit may continue based on qualification at the Screening visit.  At V isit 3, the  other study drug will be administered at the 
time of Decision to Dose , so that between the two dosing visits, each subject will have received 
both G -Pen once , and Lilly Glucagon once .   
10.2.3. Visit 4 -  Follow -Up (Day 9- 35) 
The subject will attend a follow -up visit within 2- 7 days of completing the final dosing visit or 
premature discontinuation. This visit will include  the following assessments : 
1. Review of changes in concomitant medications . 
2. Physical examination, excluding breast , pelvic and genitourinary exams . To include 
review of injection sites to document any residual inflamma tion, pain or induration. 
3. Body weight  (no shoes, lightly clothed) . 
4. 12-lead ECG after 10 -minute supine rest . 
5. Vital signs after 5 -minute seated rest . 
6. Urine pregnancy test (females of child -bearing potential) . 
7. Blood draws for complete metabolic count and complete blood count .  
8. Adverse event questioning  by asking the subjects to respond to a non- leading question 
such as “how do you feel?”  
In case of any premature discontinuation of  a subject from the study, the subject will, if possible, 
be scheduled  for a fina l follow -up visit.  
10.3. Subject Withdrawa l 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral , or 
administrative reasons.

G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 44  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the scheduled visit, and to 
reschedule the missed visit.  This includes contacting subjects via email and telephone, including 
family me mbers or emergency contacts. If such efforts fail, a certified letter should be sent to the 
subject’s last known address requesting they contact study staff.  
In all circumstances , every effort should be made to document subject outcome , per the follow -
up.  Information regarding the reason for not completing the study will be recorded in the CRF.  
The Investigator  should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return 
for a final visit, and follow -up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.  It will be 
documented whether or not each subject completed the study. Any subject who receives at least one treatment dose of study medication will be included in the safety analysis.  
If a decision by the Investigator or S ponsor is made to withdraw a subject, a final visit should be 
scheduled soon after the decision to withdraw is made.  The subject will be asked to return to site 
for the assessments listed in Section  10.2.3.  
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data co llected before such withdrawal of consent.

Every effort should be made to ensure that the required tests and procedures are completed as 
described.  However, it is anticipated that t here may be circumstances outside the control of the 
Investigator , who will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject. 
When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the Investigator  will document the reason(s) 
and any  corrective and preventive actions taken to ensure that study processes are adhered to as 
soon as possible.  The study team and the Sponsor  will be informed of these incidents in a timely 
fashion. 
For all blood and urine collections , an effort should be made to obtain these samples at roughly 
the same time of day (i.e., morning or afternoon) across all visits  as well  as at the  time periods 
specified in the Schedule of Activities.  In addition, visits to the site must occur within the pre -
defined windows out lined in this protocol , otherwise they will be considered as protocol 
deviations .  
11.1. Blood Volume  
There will be approximately 40 PD samples of about 2 cc each  drawn at each treatment visit for 
a total of about 80 cc of blood per visit. These two treatment visits  will be 7 to 28 days  apart.  
There will be a 10.5 cc sample at Screening and at the Follow -up Visit for a clinical chemistry 
panel and hematology, with an additional 10.5 cc sample at Screening for eligibility 
determination . A total of about  200 cc of blood will be drawn over the total study ( Table 6 ).

a Female participants of childbearing potential require a negative pregnancy test at Screening and prior to dosing for 
each of the 2 Treatment Visits. Pregnancy testing will be repeated as the Follow -up visit for safety reasons.  
b Drug screening performed a t Screening will include: cocaine, THC, opiates, amphetamines , methamphetamine, 
and phencyclidine . Analytes other than those listed above may be included in the test kits provided to the sites. 
Investigator will exercise discretion in allowing of excluding  a subject from study participation based on a positive 
test for one of these additional analytes. Except as noted below, continuation in the study requires all tests to be 
negative with the exception of THC, which will be noted, but will not be considered  exclusionary.   
A central laboratory will be utilized for analysis of all blood variables with the exception of rapid 
plasma glucose measurements made during treatment visits. A procedures manual will be 
provided to each site by the central laboratory. Thi s manual will cover procedures for the 
collection, processing and shipping of blood samples, along with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certification  and normal ranges for the central laboratory.  
The central laboratory will provide sites wi th all supplies needed for collection, processing and 
shipping of all blood samples, as well as point -of-care urine pregnancy tests  and rapid urine drug 
screen kits . 
If a subject tests positive for drugs other than THC, the subject will normally be exclude d from 
further study participation. However, if a subject reports use of a concomitant medication 
(prescription or OTC) that provides a reasonable explanation for a positive result other than 
THC, the subject may be allowed to participate in the study at the Investigator ’s discretion. If the 
subject is not able to provide a reasonable explanation but still refutes a positive finding, a urine 
sample will be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation. The result of this confirmatory test 
will be consider ed definitive.  The remainder of the screening visit should still be completed in 
this case.  
During treatment visits, PG  levels will be measured using a bedside YSI rapid glucose analyzer  
model 2300 or 2900. At each time point specified in Section 10, the result s of both the black and 
white leads to one decimal place will be record ed in the source documents, with the  average of 
the two v alues rounded up to the nearest one decimal place accepted as the plasma glucose level 
for the time point as per the following examples. 
Example #1: black lead = 50.1 and white lead = 49.8  Calculation: 50.1 + 49.8 = 99.9/2 = 49.95 = 50.0 mg/dL recorded re sult

Before each subject visit , performance checks will be made as per the standard practice at each 
site, and sites will maintain a log of these results.  
The EDC system  implemented for this study will allow entry of plasma glucose values in either 
mg/dL or mmol/L. For reference, both uni ts are provided in the written description and summary 
(Table 4) of the insulin dose adjustment algorithm. In the rest of the protocol, plasma glucose 
values are provided in mg/dL. For reference, Table 8  provides a conversion chart  for key values

12.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include:  
• Abnormal test findings . 
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs . 
• Changes in physical examination findings which are untoward and deemed clinically significant by the Investigator . 
• Allergy/hypersensitivity . 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding may be reported as an AE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms . 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/s urgical intervention . 
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study . 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other treatment. 
• Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator  or Sponsor.  
Repeat of a t est based on an abnormal result in the absence of the above conditions does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study 
treatment or was present prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of study treatment.  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs.  Informal descriptions should be avoided.  
12.2. Reporting Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the study treatment will be reported with two exceptions.  Since it is being experimentally 
induced in this study, hypoglycemia wil l not be considered an AE in this study unless the event 
meets one of the definitions of an SAE (see Section  12.4). Injection site reactions will not be 
considered an AE unless a skin reaction or pain requires medical intervention.   
For all AEs, the Investigator  must pursue and attempt to obtain information adequate to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the FDA criteria for  
classification as an SAE, requiring immediate notification to Xeris Pharmaceuticals.   
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 52  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 For all AEs, follow -up by the Investigator  is required until the event resolves or stabilizes at a 
level acceptable to the Investigator  to consider it resolved . For  unresolved AEs to be considered 
stable , the Xeris Medical Monitor  must  concur with that assessment.  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non- serious adverse event that 
is determined to be serious (according to the FDA definitions of  an SAE) will be reported by the 
Sponsor as a n SAE.  To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may 
be requested from the Investigator  to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the 
context of the clinical study.  
12.3. Repo rting Period  
For all AEs, the reporting period to Xeris Pharmaceuticals begins from the  subject providing 
informed consent , through the Follow -up Visit. All adverse events will be followed until 
resolution or the subject is medically stable.  
12.4. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose which:  
• Results in death , 
• Is life -threatening , 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization , 
• Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in determining whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should 
also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are inten sive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions which 
do not result in hospitalization. 
12.5. Severity Assessment  
On the AE case report forms (CRF), the Investigator  will use the adjectives “mild,” “mod erate,” 
or “severe” to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  These intensity grades are defined as follows in Table 9  below. 
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 53  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 Table 9:  AE Severity Assessment  
Mild Does not interfere with subject’s usual function . 
Moderate  Interferes to some extent (<50%) with subject’s usual 
function . 
Severe  Interferes significantly (≥50%) with subject’s usual 
function . 
The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event.  The event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance.  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria.  Accordingly, a severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  
12.6. Causality Assessment  
The Investigator  will use the following question when assessing causality between  an adverse 
event to the study drug, w here an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse 
reaction: “ Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event? ” A ‘‘r easonable 
possibility’’ means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug  and 
the adverse event.  The Investigator ’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs.  The 
Investigator  must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable  
(Section  12.9) .   
12.7. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response, and 
recorded on the appropriate CRF.  When a subject withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements (see Section  12.9).  
12.8. Eliciting Adverse Event Information and Reporting  
The Investigator  is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
study subject.  Each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  Each AE is to be assessed to 
determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, expedited repor ting will follow the 
provisions of Section 12.9. 
12.9. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE occurs, Xeris Pharmaceuticals is to be noti fied within 24 hours  of awareness of the 
event by the Investigator .  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE 
information.  This time frame also applies to follow -up on previously forwarded SAE reports.  
In the rare event that the Investigator  does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (e.g., a study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator  is to 
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 54  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 report the event within 24 hours  after learning of the event and document the time of first 
awareness of the AE.   
A death occurring during the study, during the per -protocol follow -up period, or within 30 days 
after stopping treatment with test drug must b e reported to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its 
designee(s) immediately, whether or not it is considered treatment -related.  Initial SAE reports 
must be followed by detailed descriptions.  These should include copies of hospital case records 
and other documents  when requested.  Telephone and e -mail reports must be confirmed promptly 
either by facsimile or by overnight courier or mail.  
Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee(s) is required to notify FDA and all participating Investigator s in an IND safety report (i.e., 7-  or 15 -day expedited report) of 
potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other sour ce as soon as possible, but no later 
than 15 calendar days after the safety information is received and a determination is made that the information qualifies for reporting . 
12.10.  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the A E page(s) of the CRF.  AEs should be reported using concise 
medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of the SAE information. 
12.11.  AE Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
AE reporting  by the Sponsor , including suspected s erious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable regulations. 
The Investigator  must notify the IRB /Ethics Committee  of the occurrence of any  SAE, in 
writing, as soon as is practicable and in accordance with local regul ations.  A copy of this 
notification must be provided to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for expedited reporting, an SAE report will be 
prepared for submission to the FDA and any other applicable author ities by Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals or its designee . 
12.12.  Pregnancy  
The active pharmaceutical product in Xeris Pharmaceuticals’ G-Pen is Glucagon, which is in 
Pregnancy Category B.  Female subjects able to become pregnant will be tested (rapid, urine) for 
pregnancy at the S creening visit. Any subject found to be pregnant at the S creening visit (Visit 1) 
will not be randomized to treatment. At both treatment visits and at the follow -up visit  (i.e., 
Visits 2, 3 and 4) , pregnancy test ing will be repeated .  Any subject w ho is found to be pregnant 
at one of the treatment visits will be withdrawn from the study immediately  and no further study 
treatment s will be given . Pregnancy at the follow -up visit will be noted, but the visit will be 
completed. Any pregnancy in a subject who received at least one dose of study drug will be followed until resolution (i.e., birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the pregnancy ).  
Any pregnancy outcome that meets the criteria for an SAE will be reported as an SAE.

 55  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 12.13.  Subject Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs throughout the study by the study unit staff.  The principal 
Investigator  or designated sub- Investigator  will be on site for drug administration and until 3 
hours after administration of study drug to the last subject.  The principal Investigator  or 
designated sub- Investigator  will also be on call for the remainder of the treatment visit.  If 
necessary, a physician, either at the study site or in a nearby hospital, will administer treatment 
for any AEs.  
Safety parameters, including laboratory results and ECGs, will be assessed by the principal Investigator  or his delegate using the site’s criteria for clinical laboratory and ECG acceptance 
ranges as suggested guidelines in making the medical assessment.  
Scheduled safety measurements will be repeated according to appropriate SOPs or upon request from a physician.  Any abnormal repeated measurement will be evaluated by a physician and 
repeated if judged necessary.  Further action may be taken on the physician’s request.  
Subjects will be advised to notify their health care professionals (e.g., physician, dentist, and/or 
pharmacist) that they are participating in a clinical research study of a drug called synthetic 
Glucagon Injection before taking any medicines or undergoing any medical procedure.

Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 13. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL METHODS  
13.1. General Approach  
Detailed methodology for descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data collected in 
the XSGP -303 study will be documented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  The SAP will be 
prepared by the Sponsor’s contract research organization (CRO) and agreed upon by the Sponsor.  The SAP will be finalized and approved b y signature and dates prior to locking the 
database. In addition to the SAP, other graphical representations of the results may be produced 
after review of the data (post hoc).  Any major modifications of the definition of the Primary 
Endpoint  or analysis will be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
13.2. Efficacy  
This is a non- inferiority study in which t he primary objective is to test whether the G -Pen is not 
unacceptably less efficacious in terms of hypoglycemia relief than the Lilly Glucagon for injection . The primary  endpoint  comparison will be performed using both the Intention to Treat 
(ITT) and the per -protocol (PP) populations . The evaluable set for the PP population will be 
defined as all randomized patients who, during both study periods, successfully com plete the 
insulin induction procedure, fulfill the criteria for having achieved a hypoglycemic steady state, and successfully receive a dose of both study drugs (G -Pen followed by Lilly Glucagon, or Lilly 
Glucagon followed by G -Pen).  
For analysis of the  primary endpoint, a failure for the study treatment (G -Pen or Lilly Glucagon) 
will be recorded if plasma glucose remains ≤ 70.0 mg/d L throughout the 0- 30-minute  period 
from a drug administration , while a  success is defined as a return to plasma glucose >70.0 mg/dL 
in subjects from a state of insulin -induced hypoglycemia  within the 0 -30-minute period from 
drug administration .  
The following scoring system for the primary endpoint will be applied to all sub jects in the PP 
cohort.  If a G -Pen failure is observed, then the treatment failure score = 1 ; similarly,  the Lilly 
Glucagon failure score = 1 if a control failure is observed.  An observed plasma glucose rising 
above 70.0 mg/d L within 30 minutes study drug  administration yields a failure score = 0, for 
either treatment. 
For the ITT cohort, the following scoring system will be applied for analysis of the primary 
endpoint: If a G -Pen failure is observed, then the treatment failure score = 1 ; similarly,  the Lilly 
Glucagon failure score = 1 if a control failure is observed.  If the G -Pen treatment outcome is 
missing,  then the treatment failure score = 0.2.  A missing control outcome yields a control 
failure score = 0.1.  An observed plasma glucose rising above 70.0 mg/d L within 30 minutes 
study drug administration yields a failure score = 0, for either treatment  [Koch ].   
Secondarily, analysis of the pri mary endpoint will be repeated with success/failure evaluated at a 
time point of 30 minutes from a decision to dose (see Section 10.2.1). For this analysis, the 30-
minute value will be determined by linear interpolation between the two adjacent time points.   
13.2.1. Primary Endpoint:  
The G -pen acceptance criterion will be based on the sample mean of the failure scores  derived 
from each subject (treatment -control). If Dht is designated as the sample mean of the G -Pen 
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 57  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 minus control failure difference, and SE is the estimated standard error of Dht (square root of the 
estimated G -Pen minus control variance divided by the sample size), then the G -Pen will be 
accepted provided:   
 Dht + 2.8 SE ≤ 0.1.   
This criterion, including  the value 2.8, came from Monte -Carlo simulations from selected 
scenarios where the population G -Pen failure rate exceeded the control rate by 0.1. Under these 
circumstances the rate of G -Pen acceptance was found to be within 0.025 using this criterion, 
with missing data rates within 15%.  This bound of 0.025 on the ty pe 1 error rate was observed 
for control failure rates up to 5%.    Monte Carlo simulation rather than asymptotic normality is 
necessary because an observed failure from either G -Pen or control is expected to be low, less 
than 5%.  
13.2.2. Sample Size Calculation:  
Using the above criterion  for the primary endpoint assumptions  under scoring described above 
(Koch) , a sample size of 85 randomized subjects yields probabilities of G -Pen acceptance of 
88% if the population failure rate  differences of G -Pen and control are  within 2% , and the rate of 
missing observations is within 5%.   
The power and type 1 error bounds were obtained from a simulation model using a 3x3 table of 
outcomes for G -Pen and control.  The three outcomes for each were Success, Failure, and 
Missing .  Probabilities were assigned to each of the 9 cells  for determining the probability of G -
Pen acceptance, either the type 1 error probability or power depending on the scenario being simulated , with the missing outcome being  stochastically independent of the  Success  and Failure 
outcome combinations.  Also,  the failure score difference, G -Pen minus control, was assigned to 
each of the nine cells.  To simulate o ne replicate of the study, 85 independent draws were made 
from the  multinomial distribution determined by the probabilities from the 9 cells, and the 
sample mean  with its  estimated standard error were computed.  The G -pen acceptance criterion 
was applied and either a 0 ( G-pen failed) or 1 ( G-pen accepted) was recorded.  This was repeated 
10,000 times to obtain the estimated probability of G -pen acceptan ce under the conditions 
defined by the cell probabilities.  The simulations were performed using R version 3.1.2 (2014-
10-31). 
It is expected that randomization of 85 subjects will achieve at least 75 evaluable subjects  for PP 
analysis at approximately 6 cl inical sites with a goal of no single center accounting for > 20% of 
the total randomization. Screening and enrollment will continue until at least 85 randomized 
subjects have received at least one dose of study drug  (see Section 9.1).  
13.3. Secondary Endpoints  
All secondary endpoints will be assessed in both the ITT and PP analysis populations. 
13.3.1. Binary Responses  
The following secondary response endpoints will be assessed. For each endpoint, scoring will 
follow the methods  described for the primary endpoint in Section 13.2.  
1. Return of plasma g lucose to > 70 mg/dL or neuroglycopenic symptomatic relief  within 
30 minutes after receiving glucagon.  
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 58  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 2. Return of plasma glucose to > 70 mg/dL or an increase in plasma glucose by ≥20 mg/dL 
within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon.  
3. Increase in plasma glucose by ≥ 20.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon.  
4. Neuroglycopenic symptom atic relief within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon.  
Secondarily, analysis of these secondary  endpoint s will be repeated with success/failure 
evaluated at a time point of 30 minutes from a decision to dose (see Section  10.2.1 ). For this 
analysis, the 30 -minute value will be determined by linear interpolation between the two adjacent 
time points.  
13.3.2. Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The pharmacodynamic endpoints will be derived from the individual glucose profiles.  
Time for plasma glucose to increase by at least 20 mg/ dL, time for plasma glucose to reach 
>70.0 mg/d L, AUC, C max and T max will be compared between the treatment groups using a mixed 
model with  treatment, period and sequence as terms.  
13.3.3. Hypoglycemia Symptoms : 
Symptom relief will be analyzed as aggregate scores for the four autonomic, four neuroglycopenic symptoms a nd 8 total symptoms (see Appendix  1).  
For analysis , “relief” will be defined as a return to a score no more than one unit above baseline 
symptoms during the euglycemic baseline period.  
The time to the minimal score post baseline will be described and compared between the treatment groups using a mixed mode l with  treatment, period and sequence as terms. Similarly, 
the time to first reporting of “no” for the global hypoglycemia question will be described and compared between the groups.  
13.3.4. Glucagon Preparation Time:  
The time between “decision to dose” and time of study drug administration to the abdomen will be measured and be called glucagon preparation time. This time measurement will be used for 
analysis of study end points. The total preparation time required to i nject to the abdomen from a 
decision to treat will be compared between the treatment groups, as measured between the time 
of “decision to dose” and time of injection. 
13.4. Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, namely  those subjects 
receiving at least one dose of the study treatment . 
The following variables will be compared between the treatments for safety purposes:  
• Adverse events and serious adverse events  
• Laboratory safety variables (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Physic al examination (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Vital signs  
XSGP -303 Clinical Protocol   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 59  
Protocol XSGP -303 v1. 2  Confidential  29 Jan 2018 • Body weight (Screening to Final Visit)  
• ECG (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Local tolerability, including:  
o Subjective injection site discomfort as reported by subjects using a 100 -mm VAS 
and ordinal pain scal es (Appendix  2). 
o Erythema and or edema formation at site of injection  assessed using the Draize 
scale ( Appe ndix 3). 
13.4.1. Adverse E vents  
All verbatim adverse event terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class , preferred term, and study drug. 
AE collection will begin from the time of consent. Listings of all AEs (including non- TEAEs), 
serious TEAEs (SAEs), and TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be  provided by 
treatment group, site, subject, verbat im term, MedDRA SOC and Preferred Term, start and end 
dates, seriousness flag, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study treatment, 
frequency, and outcome . 
AEs will be summarized overall by the number and percentage of subjects who expe rienced at 
least 1 AE of the following categories in each treatment group: any AE, any TEAE, any drug related TEAE (defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug), any severe or 
life-threatening TEAE, any serious TEAEs, any drug- related SAE, any SAE leading to death, 
any TEAE leading to premature discontinuation of study drug, and any SAE leading to 
premature study drug discontinuation.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting a TEAE in each treatment group will be 
tabulated by SOC and Preferred Term; by SOC, Preferred Term, and severity (mild, moderate, and severe/life- threatening/death); and by SOC, Preferred Term, and relationship (unrelated 
[defined as unrelated or unlikely related to study drug] or related [defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related] to study drug).  
For all analyses of TEAEs, if the same AE (based on Preferred Term) was reported for the same 
subject more than once, then the AE was counted only once for that Preferred Term and at the 
highest severit y and strongest relationship to study drug.  
The numbers and percentages of subjects reporting an SAE or reporting a TEAE leading to 
premature discontinuation of study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by SOC 
and Preferred Term . 
Subjects will be analyzed for safety according to the study treatment received.  
13.4.2. Laboratory S afety A ssessments 
Laboratory values (biochemistry and hematology) will be flagged if outside the normal range. A listing of clinically significant abnormal values will be presen ted. The individual values will be 
listed indicating values outside normal range. Laboratory assessments will be summarized at 
Screening and at end of trial.  Significant deviations/changes from the Screening Visit to the Final 
Visit will be documented as A Es if the Investigator judges these as being clinically significant.

Subjects with any findings in the physical examination evaluation at S creening will be listed. 
Changes to physical examination from S creening to end of trial will be recorded as AEs if the 
Investigator judges these as being clinically significant.  
13.4.4. Vital signs and body weight  
Vital signs will be summarized by descriptive stat istics.  Significant changes from pre - to post -
dosing at treatment visits or from the Screening Visit to the Final Visit will be documented as 
AEs if the Investigator judges these as being clinically significant.   
13.4.5. ECG  
Any clinically significant ECG changes will be recorded and followed as appropriate. The 
Investigator’s evaluations will be summarized in a  data listing.  
Significant deviations/changes from the Screening Visit to the Final Visit will be documented as 
AEs if the Investigator judges these as bein g clinically significant.  
13.4.6. Local Tolerability  
The incidence of any injection site discomfort (score >0 on the ordinal rating scale) will be analyzed descriptively. The incidences of erythema and edema will be analyzed in a similar manner. Descriptive statis tics (only) will be provided for time of onset and duration (of 
discomfort) and discomfort description (i.e., pain, irritation, itching, etc.). Mean VAS scores will 
be compared between the treatments . 
13.5. Subgroup Analysis  
Safety and efficacy by gender (male, female), age (18 -64 years, 65 years and above), and 
race/ethnicity  (i.e. Whites, Hispanics, and African -Americans ) will be analyzed descriptively.  
More specific details regarding the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
13.6. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic s and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects overall and by 
treatment arm.  Summary statistics (e .g., number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation 
and range) will be generat ed for continuous variables ( .g,, age and weight) and the number and 
percentage of subjects within each category will be presented for categorical variables (e. g,, 
gender, ethnicity, and race).

During study conduct, Xe ris Pharmaceuticals or its agent will conduct periodic visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices are being followed.  The monitor may review 
source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The Investigator  and 
institution will allow Xeris Pharmaceuticals’ monitor  or its designee , and appropriate regulatory 
authorities, direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
The study site may be subjected to review by the Institutional Review Board and/o r to quality 
assurance audits performed by Xeris Pharmaceuticals  or its designee , and/or to inspection by 
appropriate regulatory authorities.  It is important that the Investigator  and study staff are 
available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

AUDITS  
15.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff under the supervision of the 
Investigator.  During the study, the Investigator will maintain complete and accurate documentation for the study.  
As defined in the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (E6(R2)), Section 1.52, source documents may include:  original documents, da ta, and records (e .g,, hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, participant’s diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, participant files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical study).  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF is  understood to refer to  an electronic data record, i.e., an 
eCRF .  An eCRF is required and should be completed for each individual subject.  The 
completed original e CRFs are the property of Xeris Pharmaceut icals and should not be made 
available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Xeris Pharmaceuticals or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals.   
Completion of eCRFs will be a ccomplished using two independent 21 CFR Part 11 compliant 
web-based EDC system s. As described in Section 7.1, one system will be used to enter glucose 
and insulin data during treatment visits via  laptop computers provided to the sites by Xeris. Sites 
will use existing computers other than the Xeris -provided laptops to enter all other study -related 
data into a se cond EDC system.  
The Investigator  has the responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms ( source documents) and 
ensuring that these are accurate, authentic, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, contemporaneous, enduring and available when required.  The CRFs must be signed by the Investigator  or by an authorized staff member to attest t hat the data contained in the CRFs is true.  
Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs  or source documents must be dated, initialed and 
explained (if necessary) , and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi tal’s or physician’s subject chart.  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at the Investigator ’s site as well as at Xeris Pharmaceuticals and clearly identify those 
data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will  stand as the source document . 
Queries generated by Data Management will be sent to the study site for resoluti on. The 
Investigator  is responsible for the review and approval of all responses to eCRF queries.

To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Xeris Pharmaceuticals, the 
Investigator  agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records ), all original signed informed 
consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., 
letters, meeting minutes, telephone  calls reports).  The records should be retained by the 
Investigator  according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), local 
regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  The Investigator  must obtain Xe ris Pharmaceuticals’ written permission before disposing of any 
records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
15.3. Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Xeris Pharmaceuticals and/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compli ance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines. 
The Xeris Pharmaceuticals’ designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact the Investigator  and conduct regular visits to the clinical site.  The monitor will be expected and 
allowed to verify t he Investigator ’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect 
study records, including proof of IRB /Ethics Committee  review, with the stipulation that subject 
confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with local and federal r egulations, including 
HIPAA requirements.  The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for 
consistency with source documents, including laboratory test reports and other subject records.  Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator .  
The monitor/auditor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory requirements.  Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed.  The monitor will maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications with the study site by e -
mail, telephone, facsimile, and mail.  The Investigator  and all other site personnel agree to 
cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve all questions raised,  and difficulties detected by the monitor. 
15.4. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator  understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB /Ethics Committee , and/or Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals or their designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation for on- site audit o r inspection and will retain this right from the start 
of the study to at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after clinical development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  The Investigator  is required to guarantee access to these documents and to 
cooperate with and support such audits and inspections.

TERMINATING THE STUD Y 
18.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The principal Investigator  must sign this protocol and its amendments (if any) before initiating 
the study at a particular site.  The Investigator  will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the 
written protocol.  Protocol modifications to ongoing studies that affect the safety of subjects or 
that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, dosing, study assessments, the number of subjects exposed to test drug, or subject 
selection criteria must be  made only after consultation between Xeris Pharmaceuticals and the 
Investigator .  All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the IRB /Ethics 
Committee  before the revised protocol can be implemented.  Emergency revisions that eliminate 
an apparent hazard to subjects do not require preapproval by the IRB /Ethics Committee .  
However, the IRB /Ethics Committee  must be notified in writing as soon as possible after the 
modification has been made.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to X eris 
Pharmaceuticals.  All departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source 
documents and the CRFs of the subjects involved.  Protocol deviations will be tracked in an 
electronic system implemented by the Sponsor or designated representat ive. 
18.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB /Ethics Committee , safety problems  resulting in subject  deaths , or at 
the discretion of Xeris Pharmaceuticals  or the principal Investigator .   
Circumstances that may warrant premature study termination include, but are not limited, to the 
following:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects,  
• Failure to enter subjects at an acceptable rate,  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol,  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data, or  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Xeris Pharmaceuticals will promptly 
notify the Investigator s and document the reason for study termination. S pecific procedures for 
termination will be arranged by the Sponsor  in coordination with the Investigator s.  After 
notification, the Investigator s must contact all participating subjects within 7 days.  All study 
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible, and all study 
materials must be returned to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee within an additional 28 d ays.

APPENDIX 1. HYPOGLYCEMIA SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRE  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the Hypoglycemia Symptom 
Questionnaire at the following time points: 
• Just before the IV bolus push dose of insulin is given at the start of the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure.  
• Every time blood is drawn for evaluation of plasma glucose concentration during the 
induction procedure.  
•  Just before study drug is administered.  
• Every 5 ±2 minutes af ter glucagon is administered  until all symptoms have abated 
(i.e., all symptoms have score = 1) or 90 minutes post -dosing, whichever occurs first.  
• Every 30±5  minutes (coinciding with plasma glucose measurements) between 90- 180 
minutes post study drug dosing, or until all symptoms have abated (i.e., all symptoms 
have score = 1).  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will provide verbal responses, which will be recorded  on the questionnaire by study staff. Documen tation will 
be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who completed the form. 
Subject I nstructions:  Please rate the current intensity (severity)  of each of the following 
symptoms  on a scale of 1 -6, with a minimum score of “1” meaning the symptom wa s absent and 
a maximum score of “6” meaning the symptom was severe. For the final question, please answer 
“yes” or “no.”

Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Injection Site Discomfort  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the 100- mm Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS)  for Injection Site Discomfort at both 10±5 minutes and 30±5 min utes following  the 
injection of study drug, and again before the end of the clinic visit (i.e., at 180± 5 minutes post -
dosing) if the VAS score at 30±5 minutes is > 0 mm. The subject completes the VAS by drawing 
a single vertical line through the scale corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of discomfort accordi ng to the instructions below. The goal is for the subject to report the amount 
of discomfort, if any, remaining at each time point, as opposed to reporting the transient pain associated with needle insertion.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will indicate the 
point on the VAS corresponding to their level of discomfort, and study staff will enter a vertical 
line at that point. Documentation will be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who completed the form.  
Please verify the length of the VAS line to be 100 -mm before providing it to the subject.  
Subject I nstructions:  Ignoring any pain from insertion of the needle, please draw a single vertical 
line through the scale below that corresponds to the intensity (severity) of any discomfort you are feeling right now  at the study drug injection site.  
Discomfort could include stinging, burning, tingling, throbbing or pain. The further to the right you make your vertical mark, indicates the more intense discomfort you are feeling.  
You should normally draw a straight line across the scale to indicate your current level of discomf ort. However , if you are currently feeling no discomfort, you should circle the vertical 
line on the left end of scale (above the word “no”). If you are currently feeling the worst 
discomfort possible, you should circle the vertical line on the right end o f the scale.

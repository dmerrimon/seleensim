1. Visit 1 and Visit 2 mayoccur on the same date if the period between Visit 9 (End of Treatment) of the p revious trial (1199.32 or 1199.34) and the first visit for 
1199.33 is ≤ 6 weeks. This rule does not apply to patients requiring washout of bronchodilators, as they will need to sign informed consent at Visit 1 in order to be 
asked to perform wash out for PF T at Visit 2.
2. Visit 1 should occur at least one day after the Follow-up Visit of the parent trial and Visit 2 within 12 weeks of Visit 9 (End of Treatment) of the parent trial (1199.32 
or 1199.34).
3. The patient is required to sign informed consent prior to any study related activities.
4. For patients performing Visit 1 and Visit 2 on the same day, eligibility assessment will be based on laboratory data from Visit 9 of the parent trial. Laboratory tests, 
physical examination and vital signs will be performed only once on that day and will be recorded under Visit 2 in the eCRF.
5. Urine dipstick pregnancy tests will be provided by central lab and should be performed in all women of childbearing potential. If urine test is not acceptable to local 
authorities, a blood test can be done at a local laboratory.
6. An additional visit must be performed in case of dose reduction or increase. Please refer to Section 6.2.4 for visit procedures.
7. Only medical conditions that are occurring conco mitantly at the time of screening will be recorded as baseline conditions on the 1199.33 Remote Data Capture (RDC) 
system .This also applies to ongoing AEs from the parent trial at the time of screening. See ISF for further instructions.
8. Laboratory test only for liver function monitoring: AST, ALT and bilirubin. Blood maybe collected at the investigational site, primary physician (GP or 
Pulmonologist) or external laboratory with specific study kits and sent to the central lab oratory for analysis .Informa tion, agreement and training of the primary 
physician or local laboratory will be ensured on an individual site basis.
9. Same scheme should be repeated as often as needed: one complete visit every 16 weeks and one intermediate visit for liver function monit oring.
10. End of Treatment Visit to be performed if a reason for withdrawal is met. Please refer to S ection 3.3.4 .
11. A Follow -up (FU) Visit should be planned for 28 days after last drug intake (+7 days window).

AFTER THE DATABASE LOCK FOR TH E FINAL ANALYSIS1
1. Patients who require continuation of treatment within this trial after the database lock for the final analy ses will 
have reduced number of trial visits and reduced trial related procedures as described in this flow chart. The 
objective of these visits will be to dispense new study drug and collect information regarding adverse events and 
concomitant medication.
2. Patients continuing treatment after the final analysis (patients who don’t have access to nintedanib outside the 
clinical trial) are required to sign an informed consent explaining the objective and study related procedures of the 
trial after the final a nalysis. This should happen prior to any study related activities of this new trial period .

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Idiopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis (I PF) is a chronic disease of unknown aetiology  that is 
characterized by progressive fibrotic destruction of the lung, resulting in disabling dyspnoea
and poor gas exchange. The average life expectancy  in IPF patients is 2- 3 years. 
The only  drug that has been registered in a number of countries for the treatment of I PF is
pirfenidone. It was launched in Japan in 2008 under the brand name Pirespa®and was 
approved for the treatme nt of mild -to-moderate IPF in Europe and Canada in 2011 (under the 
brand name Esbriet®). Following the successful completion of a third Phase III tr ial (PIPF -
016, ASCEND) pirfenidone was recentl y approved by the US FDA for the treatment of IPF. 
Other pharmacologic options include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cy clophosphamide, and 
N-acety l cysteine, albeit none of these has been proven efficacious in clinical trials compared 
with placebo, and none is indicated for the treatment of I PF. Thus, despite the availability  of 
pirfenidone and the possibility  of lung transplantation, the medical need for efficacious and 
safe treatment of IPF remains high.
Nintedanib has been developed for the treatment of I PF and for several cancer t ypes in two 
separate clinical development programmes. 
In IPF the clinical proof of concept for nintedanib was established in the 52 -week phase II 
trial 1199.30 ( P11-11216) . Based on this trial, it was considered that nintedanib may  confer 
clinical benefit to patients with I PF with acceptable safet y.
Two phase III international, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials of identical study  design 
1199.32 and 1199.34 confirmed the efficacy  and safet y of nintedanib 150 mg bid versus 
placebo in patients with IPF (P14-
07514) (refer to Section 1.2). Based on the overall 
evidence, nintedanib was approved b y the US FDA for the treatment of IPF in October 2014. 
The current study 1199.33 is a long -term extension study  of the Phase III trials and such it is 
conducted to evaluate the long- term safet y and tolerability  of nintedanib in IPF.  
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Nintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the Platelet Derived Growth 
Factor Receptor (PDGFR) α and β, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) 1 -3, and 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR). Nintedanib binds competitively  to 
the ATP binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signalling which is 
crucial for the proliferation, migration, and transformation of fibroblasts, representing 
essential mechanisms of the I PF pathology . In addition, nintedanib inhibits Flt -3, Lck, Ly n, 
and Src kinases ( U07-1248 ).
Nintedanib is currentl y in clinical development for several ty pes of cancer. In line with the 
pre-clinical findings, the clinical development programme has provided data suggesting that

kidney , liver, and colorectal cancer. 
Inhibition of FGFR -1 and PDGFR has been proposed as effective principle for the treatment 
of IPF(P07-00109) . Furthermore, V EGF Rinhibition may  also have favourable effects, 
although the precise role of down -regulation of VEGF -mediated actions in I PF has not y et 
been full y elucidated (R07-0002) . Oral administration of nintedanib to rats with bleomy cin-
induced lung fibrosis resulted in nearl y complete attenuation of fibrosis histologicall y not 
only when started at day  1 after bleom ycin administration, but also when administered only 
from day  10 to 21. In this model, nintedanib thus may  be acting directl y against the fibrotic 
processes, rather than solely  through inhibition of inflammation.
A soft gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in humans. After oral administration, 
nintedanib was absorbed moderatel y fast. Maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax) occurred 1 
to 4 hours after administration. Steady  state was reached within 9 day s of treatment at the 
latest. The gMean terminal half -life (t 1/2) was 18 hours after intravenous administration. The 
major route of elimination of total [14C] radioactivity  was via the faeces / biliary  excretion, 
while the contribution of renal excretion was low (0.7% of an orally  administered radioactive 
dose). An absolute bioavailability  of slightl y below 5% was observed b y an intra -individual 
comparison of dose normali zed AUC of 100 mg nintedanib administered orally  and 6 mg 
nintedanib administered intravenousl y. The total percentage absorbed was estimated to be at 
least 23% compared to an absolute bioavailability of the parent alone of about 5%, thereb y 
confirming the large amount of metabolite formed during intestinal and/or hepatic first pass 
metabolism. 
The by  far most frequent metabolites were BIBF 1202 formed by  ester cleavage and the 
subsequently  glucuronidation formed BIBF 1202- glucuronide. The glucuronidation o f 
BIBF 1202 was mainl y through UGT1A1 (liver and intestine) and UGT1A7, UGT1A8 and 
UGT1A10 (intestine). Drug -drug interactions based on cy tochrome P450 dependent 
pathway s are not expected for 
nintedanib .
In vitro transporter profiling of BIBF 1120 and BIBF 1202 showed that BIBF 1120 - but not 
BIBF 1202 -is a P -gp substrate. The effect of xenobiotics interacting with P- gp is currentl y 
not known.
In the IPF phase II proof -of-concept trial 1199.30, 432 patients with consistent I PF were 
randomized, with baseline characteristics comparable across groups. The results of the 
primary  endpoint analyses, annual rate of FVC decline, were: 0.19 L (placebo); 0.17 L  (50 
mg qd); 0.21 L (50 mg bid); 0.16 L  (100 mg bid); and 0.06 L (150 mg bid: -68% reduction in 
rate of dec line vs. placebo, p=0.0136; closed -testing multiplicity  corrected: p=0.0639). At 
end of study , FVC% pred was better preserved in the 100 mg bid (p=0.0314) and 150 mg bid 
(p=0.0002) groups when compared to placebo. FVC signal robustness was supported b y 
results of body  plethy smography  and ox ygen saturation. Compared to placebo, fewer patients 
had acute exacerbations in the 150 mg bid group (p=0.0150), and there were a greater number 
of SGRQ 4-point scale responders in the 100 mg bid (p=0.0069) and 150 mg bid (p=0.0341) 
groups.  No effect was observed on DL COand 6 -MWT. The number of deaths was not

more frequent with 150 mg bid (37.6%; 31.8%), but less with 100 mg bid (16.3% ; 15.1%), 
compared to placebo (28.2%; 24.7%).
The adverse events most frequentl y leading to discontinuation were diarrhoea, nausea, and 
vomiting (in the group receiving 150 mg twice a day as compared with those receiving 
placebo, the respective rates were 11.8% vs. 0%, 4.7% vs. 0%, and 2.4% vs. 1.2%). Among 
the 85 patients in the group receiving 150 mg of the study  drug twice a day , 4 (4.7%) had 
serious gastrointestinal events and 5 (5.9%) had severe gastrointestinal events, especiall y 
diarrhoea, as compare d with no patients in the placebo group.
Clinically  significant elevations in liver enzy mes levels (at least three times the upper limit of 
the normal range for ALT or AST at an y time after baseline) were observed in 6 patients in 
the group receiving 150 m g of nintedanib twice a day  (7.1%), 1 in the group receiving 100 
mg twice a day  and none in the placebo group. All aminotransferase levels normalized or 
decreased from elevated levels with continued treatment (in 3 patients receiving 150 mg 
twice a day  and 1 patient receiving 100 mg twice a day ), with a dose reduction (from 150 mg 
twice a day  to 100 mg twice a day  in 1 patient), or with withdrawal of the drug (in 2 patients 
receiving 150 mg twice a day ). 
For patients of the Phase II study  participation in the open label rollover trial 1199.35 was 
offered. This study  is currently  ongoing. 
Overall, it was considered that nintedanib may  confer clinical benefit to patients with I PF 
with an acceptable safet y profile. The benefit/risk assessment of the Phase II trial results 
justified initiation of 2 large Ph ase III trials. Trials 1199.32 ( U13-2381-01) and 1199.34 
(U13-2382 -01), which are the parent trials of the current 1199.33 trial, evaluated the safet y 
andefficacy  of the 150 mgbid dose versus placebo when given over 52 weeks. 
In total 515 patients were randomised in study  1199.32 and 551 patients in study  1199.34. 
The primary  endpoint of the annual rate of decline in FVC was met in both studies. I n stud y 
1199.32 the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was - 239.91 mL /year in the placebo 
group and - 114.65 mL/ year in the nintedanib group. The difference between treatment groups 
was 125.26 mL /year (95% CI : 77.68, 172.84) and was statistically significant (p<0.0001). In 
study  1199.34 the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was -207.32 mL/y ear in the placebo 
group and - 113.59 mL/ year in the nintedanib group. The difference between the treatment 
groups was 93.73 mL /year (95% CI: 44.78, 142.68) and was stat isticall y significant 
(p=0.0002). 
Change from baseline in SGRQ total score at 52 weeks was a key  secondary  endpoint in the 
studies. I n study  1199.32 there was a small difference between the treatment groups in favo ur 
of nintedanib: -0.05 (95% CI : - 2.40, 2.50), which was not statistically  significant (p=0.966). 
In stud y 1199.34 the difference between the treatment groups was -2.69 (95% CI :-4.95, -
0.43) in favour of nintedanib and was statisticall y significant (p=0.0197).

studies. I n study  1199.32 there was no difference between the treatment groups and the 
hazard ratio (HR) was 1.15 (95% CI : 0.54, 2.42; p=0.673). In study  1199.34 the risk of  
having a first acute IPF exacerbation was significantly  lower in the nintedanib group than in 
the placebo group, with a HR of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.77; p=0.005).
In both studies, survival endpoints showed a consistent numerical difference in favour of 
nintedanib. The HR for time to de ath over 52 weeks in a pre -specified pooled anal ysis of both 
studies was 0.70 (95% CI 0.43, 1.12; p = 0.1399).
As expected, the most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal disorders. Diarrhoea was reported 
in 61.5% of the patients in the nintedanib group in st udy 1199.32 and in 63.2% of the patients 
in study  1199.34 compared to 18.6% and 18.3% in the placebo group, respectivel y. Liver 
enzy me elevations were more frequent in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group in 
both studies: aspartate aminotransfera se [AST] and/or alanine aminotransferase [AL T] 
≥3xUL N was observed in 4.9% of the patients in the nintedanib group versus 0.5% of the 
patients in the placebo group in study  1199.32 and in 5.2% of the patients in the nintedanib 
group versus 0.9% of the pati ents in the placebo group in study  1199.34. There was no Hy ’s 
law case in the nintedanib group.

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE T RIAL
The aim of this extension trial is to provide nintedanib treatment for all patients who have 
completed one year treatment and the follow up peri od in the double -blind phase III placebo 
controlled parent trial s (1199.32 and 1199.34), who may have experienced benefit from the 
study  medication and wish to 
receive treatment .
Moreover it is designed to determine the tolerability  and safet y of nintedanib and to follow up 
on survival in I PF patients treated for a long period.
Throughout this protocol, each time “parent trial” is quoted it refers to the 1199.32 and 
1199.34 trials (EudraCT no. 2010
-024251- 87 and no. 2010 -024252- 29).
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The primar y objective is to assess long term safet y of treatment with oral nintedanib in 
patients with I diopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis (I PF).
Please refer to Section 5 for a detailed description of the trial endpoints.
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSE SSMENT
Nintedanib has shown robust, reproducible, statistically  significant, and clinically  meaningful 
effects on the decline in lung function a s measured by  FVC. In two large, international, 
placebo
-controlled phase III trials of identical design, ninteda nib 150 mg bid statistically  and 
clinically  significantl y reduced the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks compared 
with placebo indicating a relative difference of approximately  50% between nintedanib and 
placebo. T his effect of nintedanib is consi dered c onsistent with slowing disease progression 
as measured b y FVC.
The risks of treatment with nintedanib are primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and to increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, 
ALK P, gamma -GT) and bilirubin. Also weight decrease and decreased appetite have 
frequentl y been reported in studies with nintedanib. Moreover, based on experience with 
other ty rosine kinase inhibitors, impairment of immune and of kidney function, intestinal 
perforations, increases in blood pressure as well as potential bleeding and thrombotic events
should be carefully  monitored and evaluated in clinical trials. In patients who develop severe
symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity  not amenable to sy mptomatic tr
eatment with standard
measures, severe liver enzy me elevations, severe drug -related infections, or uncontrolled
hypertension, treatment with nintedanib must be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic
measures taken (refer to Section 4.2.1.1) . Liver enzy mes must be followed closely  during 
treatment with nintedanib.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.The dose of nintedanib must be reduced to 100mg bid, or nintedanib must be discontinued in 
the event of hepatic toxicity  and further treatment withheld until recove ry of the abnormal 
laboratory  parameters (refer to Section 4.2.1.2 ).
Patients with I PF may  benefit from lesser decline in lung function and hence slower disease
progression as a result of treatment with nintedanib. I n additio n, nintedanib may  reduce the 
risk of acute IPF exacerbations and worsening of patient ’s quality  of life. Finally , nintedanib
may ultimatel y be found to reduce mortality . Overall, the benefit/risk profile of nintedanib, as 
established during the phase II and III trials is interpreted as favourable for the treatment o f 
IPF
.
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by  
sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study  requires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations of selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients’ 
safet y.
Patients who are offered to enter this open label extension trial mus t have participated in a 
phase III parent trial (1199.32 or 1199.34) for one y ear. All pat ients will be treated with 
active drug. Patients who have not tolerated the blinded study  drug or discontinued for any  
reason are not eligibl e for the extension trial. P atients who were randomized to placebo in the 
parent trial will be receiving the active drug for the first time. Similar safety monitoring
procedures as in the phase III trials will be applied .
The routine safet y monitoring established in the parent study  is considered appropriate for the 
long term 
follow -up of the patients. It consists of regular visits to the investigational site, 
blood analy ses and specific monitoring procedures to follow -up potential hepatic enz yme 
elevation. In case it is considered adequate b y the i nvestigator, the dose of nintedanib may be 
reduced to 100 mg bid or dosing may  be interrupted.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a multi -centre, multi -national, prospective, open label extension clinical trial . It is 
planned to include approximately  750 patients with I PFwho have completed 52 weeks of 
treatment and the follow up period of the phase III parent trials. Onl y patients enrolled in the 
parent trials (1199.32 and 1199.34) will be eligible.
After signing Informed Consent and if al l eligibility criteria are met ,patients will initiate 
treatment with nintedanib (Visit 2). Please refer to Section 4.1.2 for the method of assigning 
patients to treatment groups.
Overall, t he trial is estimated to last a total of approximately  6 ½ y ears. Treatme nt will be 
stopped if a reason for withdrawal is met (refer to Section 3.3.4). 
Patients’ participation starts once they  have signed the I nformed Consent form and it is 
concluded when they  have undergone the Follow- up Visit (un less the patient is lost to follow 
up or informed consent is withdrawn). Adverse events are collected during all the trial period 
and are considered under treatment until 28 day s after drug discontinuation.
3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
The trial is sponsored b y Boehringer Ingelheim (BI).
BI has appoint eda Trial Clinical Monitor (TCM), responsible for coordinating the activities 
required in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal 
standard operating pr ocedures (SOPs), directing the clinical trial team in the preparation, 
conduct, and reporting of the trial, order ingthe materials as needed for the tr ial, ensuring 
appropriate training and information of Clinical Monitors L ocal (CML), Clinical Research 
Associates (CRAs), and investigators of participating countries.
Data Management and Statistical evaluation will be performed b y BI according to BI SOPs. 
For these activities, a Trial Data Manager and a Trial Statistician have been appointed.
Tasks and funct ions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial will be
defined according to BI SOPs. A list of responsible persons will be given in the Clinical Trial 
Master File (CTMF) document.
The organisation of the trial in the participating count ries will be done b y the respective local 
BI organisation (Operating Unit (OPU)) or by  a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) with 
which the responsibilities and tasks will have been agreed and a written contract filed before 
initiation of the clinical trial. I n each OPU participating in this study , a CML wasappointed 
responsible for coordinating the activities required in order to manage the trial in accordance 
with applicable regulations and internal SOPs in the countries covered b y the respective BI 
OPU .

participating in this multicentre trial.  will review the trial protocol, an y subsequent 
amendments to the protocol and the (draft) Clinical Trial Report (CTR).  will provide  
signature on the final protocol signature page and amendments and will provide  signature 
on the (draft) Clinical Trial Report (CTR) indicating that, to the best of Co -ordinator’s 
knowledge, the final CTR accuratel y describes the conduct and results of the Trial.
Trial sites consist of specialised referral centres experienced in the management of I PF. 
Documents on participating (Principal) investigators and other important participants, 
especiall y their curricula vitae, will be filed i n the CTMF.
Details of the trial supplies including responsible institutions are given in Section 4 of this 
protocol.
Central laboratory facilities will handle all laboratory  anal yses of the trial. In addition liver 
enzy mes interme diate measurements may  be performed in a local lab oratory or at a local 
doctor ’s office using specific lab oratory kits supplied for the study  that will be anal ysed 
centrall y.
To assure the standardisation of PFTs, the lung function equipment for spirometry will be 
provided b y the sponsor (refer to Section 5.2). 
The I SF will be maintained at the sites as requ ired by  local regulation and BI SOP. A cop y of 
the ISF documents will be kept as an electronic CTMF document according to BI S OPs.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
The trial will be conducted as a prospective, open -label design with the objective to collect 
long term safet y data on nintedanib in patients with I PF. The observation period will extend 
until either every  patient is discontinued or a reason for stopping thetrial is met ( refer to 
Section 3.3.4). Patients who have completed one year treatment plus follow -up period in a 
parent trial are eligible for parti cipation .
The purpose of this trial is to offer the option to all patients who completed the randomized 
phase III trial1199.32 or 1199.34 toreceive nintedanib treatment if they  perceive an 
individual benefit . The decision to continue treatment will be made by the patient following a 
discussion with the investigator. The aim of the study  is to allow treatment continuation to 
individual patients; therefore, randomization, blinding and use of placebo would not be 
appropriate. 
To obtain information on the lo ng term safet y and tolerability of 
nintedanib , adverse events
and acute IPFexacerbations will be reported ,andclinical labor atory  tests, electrocardiograms
and lung function tests will be performed. FVC derived endpoints will be assessed and data
on disc ontinuations and death will be recorded.

3.3.4 Remov al of patients from therapy or assessments
3.3.4.1 Removal of individual patients
The treatment with nintedanib has to be permanently  discontinued in the following 
circumstances:
Liver function impairment ( refer to Section 10.1):
ALT or AST ≥ 8 fold ULN.
ALT or AST ≥ 3 fold ULN for more than 2 weeks despite dose 
reduction.
ALT or AST ≥ 3 fold ULN and total bilirubin > 1.5 fold ULN .
ALT or AST ≥ 3 fold ULN and INR > 1.5.
ALT or AST 
≥ 3foldULN with the appearance of fatigue, naus ea, 
vomiting, right upper abdominal quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, 
rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).
Diarrh oea: reoccurrence of diarrhoea (> 4 stools/day ) for 8 or more consecutive

Pregnancy (refer to Section 5.3.7).
Planned usage of a specific investigational drug (refer to Section 4.2.2.1).
Treatment interruption. Treatment interr uption is acceptable in certain cases and 
for a defined period which are described in Section 4.2.1 . 
Similar to the parent study, i n the following cases withdrawal of study  drug is highly  
recommended. Only  in special circumsta nces, the i nvestigator, upon thorough assessment of 
all available clinical data, and taking into consideration the potential risks associated with 
administration of nintedanib , may  decide not to withdraw the patient, even though one or 
more of the below mentioned criteria are fulfilled. However, in such a case, continuation of 
study  treatment should be discussed with the patient, and the decision documented in the 
source data.

haemopty sis or haematuri a, active gastro -intestinal bleeding or ulcers.
Deterioration of the disease. A ≥ 10 % decrease in the absolute value of FVC% 
predicted within 12 months is cons idered deterioration (progression of disease). 
Patients have the right to withdraw from the stud y at an y time without the need to justify the 
decision. The investigator has the right to remove patients from the study  for non -
compliance, administrative or other reasons.
Data of patients who discontinue or withdraw prior to medication assignment will be

4.1 TREATMENTS TO BE ADM INISTERED
Nintedanib will be supplied by  Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG.
4.1.1
Identity of BI investigational product and comparator product
All patients will be treated with nintedanib in this trial; there is no active comparator or 
placebo.
Substance: nintedanib
Pharmaceutical form: Soft gelatin capsule
Source: BI Pharma GmbH Co. KG
Unit strengths: 150 mg , 100 mg
Posology : Twice dail y(bid)
Route of administration: Oral (swallowed)
4.1.2 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
In the parent blind phase III trials (1199. 32 and 1199.34) patients are assigned either a ctive 
drug ( nintedanib 150 mg bid) or placebo. In case patients experience adverse events related to 
drug tolerability , a dose reduction to 100 mg bid isallowed (both in active or placebo group).
At the end of treatment (Visit 9) in the parent trials, pat ients will be taking either 150 mg bid 
blinded study  medication (active drug or placebo) or 100 mg bid blinded study  medication 
(active drug or placebo) if their dose was permanently reduced during the trial.
Patients taking 150 mg bid blinded study  medica tion(active drug or placebo) in the parent 
trial will be treated with nintedanib 150 mg bid in the current extension trial .
Patients who had the dose reduced to 100 mg bid (active drug or placebo) in the parent trial 
will be allowed to be treated with nintedanib 100 mg bid or 150 mg bid. This will ensure that 
patients who were on reduced dose placebo in the parent trial will have a chance to get the 
full dose in the extension trial. 
The daily  dose of 
nintedanib will be decided at Visit 2 based on discussi on between the 
patient and the investigator.

will be used to assign medication numbers to eligible patients. Distribution of nintedanib to 
sites will be triggered b y IVRS/ IWRS.
Details on the IVRS/I WRS sy stem are provided in the I SF.
After conclusion and unblinding of the parent trials, patients who received 100 mg bid (active 
drug or placebo ) will also be allowed to increase their nintedanib dose to 150 mg bid, if this 
wasnot already  performed at the beginning of the extension trial and if it is medically 
justified. I n this situation, dose increase will need to be assigned through IVRS/I WRS during 
an additional visit (refer to Section 6.2.4).
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
Based on the phase IIsafety  and dose -finding trial 1199.30, a dose of 150 mg bid was 
selected for confirmatory phase IIItrials (1199.32/.34) ( U07-1248). With 150 mg bid, the 
limit of tolera bility  in IPF patients is considered to be reached. Lower doses may not ensure 
full efficacy  benefit. However, in case of lack of tolerability , the dose may be reduced
temporaril y or permanently to 100 mg bid. 
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
At V isit 2 patients who meet all eligibility  criteria will be assigned trial drug :nintedanib
either 150 mg or 100 mg bid (refer to Section 4.1.2 ). 
Boxes covering 4 weeks + 1 week reserve treatment will be dispensed to the patient:
-1 box at day  1 (V isit 2 );
-2 boxes at Visit 4;
-3 boxes at V isits 6, 7 and 8 ;
-4 boxes at Visit 9and following visits .
Please refer to the FlowChartfor dispens ingschedule. The investigational product should 
only be dispensed to participating patients according to the protocol b y authorised personnel 
as documented in the form “ Trial Staff List ”. 
Study  drug will be administered orall y on a twice daily  basis (bid). The patients should 
swallow the study  medication unchewed together with a glass of water (~250 mL ), and 
should observe a dose interval of 12 hours. Study  drug should be taken at the same time every  
day (between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, and between 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening).
Because nintedanib may cause stomach discomfort, it is recommended to take the drug after
food consumption .

TREATMENT
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatment
An antidote against nintedanib is not available. Potential side effects of nintedanib have to be 
treated s ymptomaticall y.
Dose reduction (150 mg bid to 100 mg bid) ortreatment interruption should be considered to 
manage adverse events. N o further dose reduction is possible for patients on the 100 mg bid 
regimen. In caseof adverse events observed at this dose, treatment interruption should be 
considered.
4.2.1.1 Management of diarrhoea
The guidelines for managing diarrhoea are the same a s in the parent protocols.
4-6 extra stools or i.v. fluid intake < 24 hours with no effect on dail y living activities 
Patients should be treated according to local standard (e.g. loperamide or equivalent).
If the severity  of diarrhoea persists for 8 or more consecutive day s despite optimal care, 
nintedanib treatment should be discont inued or reduced until return to less than 4 extra stools 
per day . Drug interruption is limited however to a maximum of 4 weeks and patients may  
restart treatment with nintedanib at a reduced dose (during a dose modification visit, refer to 
Section 6.2.4). 
Dose re -escalation is allowed at an y time after the beginning of the reduced dose if medicall y 
justified.
In case of re -occurrence of diarrhoea for 8 or more consecutive day s despite dose reduction 
and after optimal or prophy lactic therap y, patients have to permanently stop nintedanib and 
perform an End of Treatment Visit as soon as possible and a Follow -up Visit 28 day s after 
last drug intake (refer to theFlow Chart for visit procedures).
> 6extra stools or incontinence or i.v. fluid intake ≥ 24 hours or hospitalisation or decrease in 
daily  living activities
Nintedanib has to be interrupted until return to less than 4 extra stools per day  and patients 
should be treated with optimal supportive care (e.g. l operamide or equivalent). Thereafter, 
patients may  restart treatment with nintedanib at a reduced dose. 
In case of re -occurrence of diarrhoea for 8 or more consecutive day s despite dose reduction 
and after optimal or prophy lactic therap y, patients have to permanently  stop nintedanib and 
perform an End of Treatment Visit as soon as possible and a Follow -up Visit 28 day s after

4.2.2
Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Investigational therap y is not allowed during the entire study  period and must not 
have been introduced in the interval between parent trial and enrolme nt into this 
extension trial . 
Nintedanib is an anti -fibrotic kinase inhibitor which has been shown to have anti -
angiogenic properties. Inhibition of angiogenesis may  increase susceptibility  to 
bleeding. Therefore, concomitant anticoagulation, fibrinoly sisor high- dose 
antiplatelet therap y is contra -indicated (refer to Section 3.3.3 [4 weeks washout]). 
Patients who require fibrinolysis, full -dose therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g. vitamin K 
antagonists, dabigatran, heparin, hirud in), or high dose antiplatelet therap y are to be 
withdrawn. Proph ylactic low dose heparin or heparin flush as needed for maintenance 
of an indwelling intravenous device (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 I U s.c.per day ), as well as 
prophy lactic use of antiplatelet the rapy (e.g. acet yl salicy lic acid up to 325 mg/d, or 
clopidogrel at 75 mg/d, or equivalent doses of other antiplatelet therap y) should be 
allowed.
The concomitant administration of nintedanib with any drugs which are likely  to 
increase gastrointestinal even tssuch as diarrhoea , nausea, vomiting, is discouraged.
Washout of bronchodilators must be observed before spirometry : 24 hours for long 
acting and 8 hours for short acting bronchodilators, if applicable.

Study  medication will be dispensed to the patient at the study  site by  responsible site 
personnel. Details regarding dispensing of the study  medication to each participating patient, 
including pati ent identification, the amount of study  drug dispensed, the date the drug was 
dispensed, and the number of capsules returned to the site will be recorded in the drug 
accountability  form. 
Patients will be instructed to bring all stud y medication to the cli nic at each visit (except 
Visits 3 and 5) .The i nvestigator will be responsible for the assessment of patient compliance
andwill be encouraged to counsel patients on the importance of taking study  medication as 
directed at each visit.
Study  medication wil l be counted by  the investigator (or designated site personnel) and 
compliance will be calculated in a worksheet, which must be kept as a source document.
Compliance will be calculated according to the formula: Compliance (%) = Number of 
capsules actual ly taken since last count × 100 / Number of capsules which should have been 
taken in the same period. Compliance to 
nintedanib should be between 80% and 120%. 
Patients should not be discontinued for lack of compliance without prior discussion with the 
clinic al monitor.

5.1 TRIAL ENDPOINTS 
5.1.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary  endpoint is the incidence (number and % of patients) of overall adverse events 
over the course of the study , including incidence (number and % of patient s) of serious 
adverse events; adverse events leading to discontinuation and fatal adverse events
.
5.1.2 Secondary Endpoint s
Not applicable.
5.2 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
Measurements of FVC
Unique spirometry  devices (identical to the ones used in the parent studies) will b e supplied 
to all participating sites at trial initiation and spirometry performance will be centrally 
reviewed. During the course of the trial and specifically  at each interim analy sis, the sponsor 
will re -evaluate the use of central spirometry . If applic able, i.e. central spirometry  will be no 
longer used, measurements of FVC will be performed using calibrated electronic spirometers 
at the investigational site or at a referral site.
Spirometers and usage of spirometers must meet ATS/ERS criteria ( P05-12782 ), including 
daily  calibration of the spirometer, and regular calibration of the calibration pump. 
Spirometry  will be conducted while the patient is in a seated position. The test will be done in

captured b y spirometers provided b y the sponsor will be electronically transmitted and 
confirmed b y central reading. 
For each patient, pulmonary function testing will alway s start at approx imately  the same time 
of the day  (with  60 minutes maximum difference, time will be recorded). On day s of clinic 
visits, patients must refrain from strenuous activity at least 12 hours prior to pulmonary 
function testing. 
Smoking should be discouraged thr oughout the study  day (clinic visit) and will not be 
permitted in the 30 -minute period prior to spirometry . Patients should also avoid cold 
temperatures, environmental smoke, dust, or areas with strong odours (e.g., perfumes).
Definition of Acute IPF Exace rbations
Otherwise unexplained clinical features within one month, including all of the following:
Unexplained worsening or development of d yspnoea within 30 day s;
New diffuse pulmonary  infiltrates on chest X -ray, and/or new HRCT parenchy mal 
abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion (new ground -glass opacities) 
since last visit;
Exclusion of infection as per routine clinical practice and microbiological studies;
Exclusion of alternative causes as per routine clinical practice, including:
left heart failure, 
pulmonary  embolism,
identifiable cause of acute lung injury .
Acute IPF exacerbations will be collected as adverse events.
5.3 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.3.1 Physical examination
Physical examination includes assessment of heart, lung, abdomen a nd measurement of 
weight. Abnormal findings in the parent trial which were recorded as an adverse event and 
are still ongoing at the time of screening, as well as an y new abnormal finding at the time of 
screening, will be recorded as baseline conditions on the appropriate eCRF page. New 
abnormal findings or worsening of baseline conditions detected at the subsequent physical 
examinations will be recorded as adverse events on the appropriate eCRF page.

Vital signs including measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate, 
will be measured with the patient seated after having rested for at least 5 minutes at each on 
site visit.
5.3.3 S afety laboratory parameters
The laboratory  tests will include:
Haematology : red blood c ell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular 
volume, white blood cell count including differential, platelet count.
Chemistry : creatinine, AST, AL T, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin.
Coagulation: International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time 
(PTT).
If laboratory  values indicate toxicity , adequate and more frequent blood sampling will be 
performed at the discretion of the investigator.
Laboratory  anal ysis during main visits will be done using central labora tory services. Venous 
whole blood will be collected in appropriate s yringes provided b y the sponsor through the 
assigned central laboratory . Details regarding centrifuge, processing, storage and shipment of 
samples will be determined by  the central laborat ory in accordance with the sponsor. The 
investigators will be informed and instructed b
y the central laboratory and detailed 
documentation will be included in the I SF. 
Additionally , all patients will have intermediate liver function monitoring visits (AST , ALT 
and bilirubin) when the interval between 2 regular visits exceeds 8 weeks. At these visits 
blood may  be collected at the investigational site, primary  physician (GP or Pulmonologist) 
or external laboratory . However anal ysis will still be performed by the central laboratory .
In case of liver enz ymes elevation, close monitoring must be ensured b y the investigator 
(please refer to Section 4.2.1.2). 
For patients continuing treatment with nintedanib with inthis trial after the datab ase lock for 
the final anal ysis, laboratory  tests will no longer be part of the trial related procedures. 
However investigators are encouraged to monitor liver function locall y according to the 
recommendations provided in the Investigators Brochure and to manage liver enzy me 
elevations according to the recommendations provided in section 4.2.1.2 Management of 
liver enzy me elevations.

Regular ECGs are to be conducted during the first year of the trial. Rate, rhy thm and 
repolarisation changes have to be looked at, compared to previous one, and assessed for 
clinical relevance. Clinically  relevant findings at baseline of this trial will be recorded as 
baseline conditions, new abnormal findings therea fter will be recorded as adverse events.
5.3.5 Other Safety parameters
Not applicable.
5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.3.6.1 Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a 
pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any  AE which results in death, is immediately  
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs 
patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed seri ous for 
any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition s.
Every  new occurrence of cancer will be reported as a SAE regardless of the duration between 
discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the cancer.
Intensit y of adverse event
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) which is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge,

history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms.
Additional information for Japan: The reason for the decision on causal relationship needs to 
be provided in the eCRF.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal re lationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product
administered and the AE. 
Worsening of the underly ing disease or other pre- existing conditions
Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions will be recorded as an 
(S)AE in the e CRF.
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination, and laboratory  test results
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laborator y test results will be 
recorded as an (S) AE in the e CRF , if they  are judged clinically  relevant by  the investigator.
Protocol -specified significant events
Similar to the parent trials, t he following are considered as Protocol -specified significant 
events:
Hepatic injury  defined by  an el evation of AST and/or AL T ≥ 3 fold ULN combined 
with an elevation of bilirubin ≥ 2 fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample.
Patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to Section 
10.1.1 ofthis clinical trial protocol and the “DILI checklist” provided in ISF.
Adverse events relating to gastrointestinal perforation.
Protocol -specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to 
Serious Adverse Events, even if the y do not meet any of the seriousness criteria –for details 
please see Section 5.3.7 .
Expected Adverse Events
Expected (listed) AEs are described in S ection 7.9 of the Investigator’s Brochure ( U07-1248).

All adverse events , serious and non- serious, occurring during the course of the clinical trial 
(i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the observational period of 28 day s) 
willbe collected, documented and reported to the sponsor by  the investigator on the 
appropriate eCRFs / SAE reporting forms . Reporting will be done according to the specific 
definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse Event Reporting’ section of the
Investigator Site File.
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness ,and action taken with the investigational drug. The 
investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational drug to all AEs as defined in 
Section 5.3.6.1. 
The investigator also has the responsibility  to report AEs occurring in a certain period (28 
days)after a patient completes the study  drug administration .After this defined period all 
SAEs related to the stud y drug and/or stud y design have to be reported b y the investigator.
Theinvestigator must report the following events via telephone/fax using the SAE form 
immediately  (within 24 hours or the next bus iness day  whichever is shorter) to the sponsor: 
SAEs and non-serious AEs occurring at the same time as an SAE and/or which are medicall y 
related to the SAE(s), and protocol -specified significant events. 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In 
order to support the investigator with the identification of these “alway s serious adverse 
events”, if a non serious AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query  will be 
raised. The investigator must verify the description and seriousness of the event. If the event 
description is correct, the item “serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in 
expedited fashion following the same procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be foun d in the I SF.
Additional information for Japan: This information must be also reported immediately to the 
head of the trial site . 
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE report has to be 
provided. SAEs and non- serious AEs must includ e a causal relationship assessment made b y 
the investigator .
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(country -specific contact details will be provided in the I nvestigator Site File). This 
imme diate report is required irrespective of whether the investigational product has been 
administered or not and irrespective of causal relationship. I t also applies if new information 
to existing SAEs or protocol-specified significant events becomes availabl e. 
Pregnancy
As mentioned above, due to the reprotoxic potential of nintedanib , a patient must not become 
pregnant while treated with nintedanib and until 3 months after end of treatment.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow C hart. Some flexibility  
is allowed in scheduling the visits according to visit time windows as specified in the Flow 
Chart . If an y visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit 
date schedule (calculated from Visit 2). The trial medication kits contain sufficient 
medication to allow for these time windows. All deviations from the planned visit schedule 
will be documented.
The trial will run until all patients have discontinued treatment or a stopping criterion is met 
according to S ection 3.3.4 .
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISIT S
6.2.1 Screening
The study  will be explained to allpatients who complete the parent trials and are willing to 
continue treatment with nintedanib . No study  related procedure should be performed until the 
patient has signed the Informed Consent.
Patients will complete a 52 weeks treatmen tperiod with nintedanib (or placebo) at Visit 9 in 
the parent trial (1199.32 or 1199.34) and a follow -up period of at least 28 day s without drug
(Follow -up Visit) .
After concluding all visits from the parent trial and in order to assess eligibility  for th e 
extension trial (1199.33), patients are required to perform a screening visit (Visit 1) which 
includes laboratory  tests. 
Ifthe period between Visit 9 (End of Treatment) of the parent trial and the first visit of 
1199.33 is ≤ 6 weeks, Visit 1 and Visit 2 may occur on the same date. In this case, eligibility  
assessment will be based on laboratory  data f rom Visit 9 of the parent trial.
Please refer to the Flow Ch artfor complete procedures at Visit 1.
Patients who have a laboratory  test value that is outside the range specified by  the exclusion 
criteria may  have the test repeated once to determine eligibility ; however, the result must be 
available prior to Visit 2 .
Details of an y patient who has given informed consent for the trial but is found to be 
inelig ible must be entered in the Enrolment log and documented in the eCRF.

If the patient has been determined eligible b y the investigator to enter the trial (refer to 
Section 3.3) , the investigator will assign a medication number to the patient through 
IVRS/I WRS at Visit 2 (refer to Section 4.1.2 ). First dose of nintedanib will be administered 
at Visit 2 in the clinic (d ay 1).
Additional clinic visits will be scheduled after 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of treatment 
(Visits 3- 9).  L iver function monitoring visits will be performed at 18, 30 and 42 weeks of 
treatment (Visits 6a, 7a and 8 a). After the first year of treatment, complete clinic visits will be 
scheduled every  16 weeks with intermediate liver function monitoring visits.
For detailed description of the trial procedures at each visit and dispensing schedule , please 
refer to the Flow C hart.
End of Treatment (EOT)
If a reason for drug discontinuation is met (refer to Section 3.3.4 ) an EOT Visit should be 
scheduled as soon as possible after last drug intake . Reason for dis continuation must be 
documented in the eCRF.
For detailed description of the trial procedures at the EOT visit, please refer to the Flow 
Chart .
6.2.3 End of trial and follow -upperiod
A Follow -up (FU) Visit should be planned for 28 day s after last drug in take.
For detailed description of the trial procedures at the FU Visit, please refer to the Flow Chart . 
If the reason for removal of a patient from the treatment is an adverse event or an abnormal 
laboratory  test result, the patient must be followed until complete resolution or stabilization 
of the event for at least 28 day s after onset of the event or until follow -up is considered
adequate b y the investigator and theclinical monitor.
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the investigator is not able to contact him/her 
despite multiple attempts. Every  effort must be made ; at least 2 telephone contacts plus 1 
mailing should be documented. The site must notify the clinical monitor prior to designating 
a patient as lost to follow
-up. 
6.2.4 Dose modification visit
Every time a dose should be reduced or increased (refer to Section 4.1.4 andSection 4.2.1 ) 
patients will need to come to the site for a dose modification visit where the followin g will be 
performed:

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a multicenter, multi -national, open -label clinical trial to investigate the long term 
safet y of nintedanib in patients with I PF previously  treated in a double -blind phase III
placebo controlled trial (1199.32 or 1199.34).
This statistical paragraph deals with the anal yses to be performed on the extension trial only . 
Although data of parent trial will not be described in the scope of these analyses, they will be 
taken into account for adv erse events anal yses, as described in Section 7.3.4 .
As the main objective of this extension trial is to study  long -term safet y, only  descriptive 
statistics will be used. 
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
All analy ses in th is trial are descriptive and exploratory innature. No formal statistical 
inferences are foreseen.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
The treated set (TS) will consist of all patients who received at least one dose of open -label 
study  medication.
The definition of impo rtant protocol violations (IPV)will be specified in the trial statistical 
analysis plan (TSAP). These IPV definitions will include consideration of important 
violations of entry  criteria, treatment non -compliance, prohibited medications and inadequate 
follow-up of hepatic events.
Patients will be analy sed according to their randomized treatment group in previous studies 
1199.32/34, and overall.
The last available value between visit 1 and visit 2 (before first trial drug intake) will be 
considered as the b aseline, for this extension trial.
The main statistical analy sesas described below will be performed based on all data collected 
up to the third interim database lock date (see section 7.4 ). Afterwards, only adverse events 
and concomitant treatments listings will be provided.

A central laboratory  will be used to collect, anal yze and report the results of all blood 
samples.
To ensure standardization in FVC measurement, a central spirometry  review is put in place: 
unique spirometry  devices will be supplied to all participating sites. Two procedures will be 
performed using a CRO to ensure high qualit y of collected FVC measurements:
Quality  Assurance (QA) process designed for providing feedback to the 
investigational site and the CRA on the quality
 of the data received from the sit e. 
During this process, a clinical specialist anal yses and comments the data according to 
the ATS and study  specific guidelines. A site gets an alert fax if all measurements of a

The Best Test Review (BTR) is d esigned to choose the best effort that will be used to 
represent the Best value for a particular test set. Only  the acceptable efforts should be 
used to determine the best value. This choice is communicated to the Investigator 
whose confirmation is sought.
Data will be collected using a Remote Data Capture (RDC) s ystem. Training will be provided 
to all investigators, coordinators and field monitors to ensure consistency  and accuracy  of the 
data. The data will be source verified b y the field monitors.
Diagno ses and adverse events will be coded using MedDRA, and concomitant medications 
will be coded using WHO Drug Reference List. 
The data management procedures to ensure the quality  of the data are described in detail in
the trial data management and anal ysis plan (TDMAP) available in the CTMF.

10.1.1 Clinical Evaluation of Liver Injury
10.1.1.1 Introduction
Alterations of liver laboratory  parameters, as described in Section 4.2.1.2 andSection 5.3.6.1
(Protocol -Specified Significant Events), are to be further evaluated using the following 
procedures.
10.1.1.2 Procedures
Repeat the following laboratory  tests: ALT, AST, and bilirubin (total and direct) - within 48 
to 72 hours and provide additional blood sample to the central laboratory for automatic reflex 
testing of the below listed laboratory  parameters. Only  in case whereb y the central laboratory 
is not immediately  available (e.g. if the logistics are such that the p atient’s repeat specimen 
would not reach the central laboratory  in a reasonable timeframe), ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
(total and direct) must be evaluated b y local laboratory and results must be made available to 
the investigator and to BI as soon as possibl e.
If ALT and/or AST ≥3 fold UL N combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2 fold UL N 
are confirmed, the laboratory  parameters described below willbe made available to the
investigator and to BI as soon as possible.

After the database lock for the final analy sis 
(refer to section 7.3) and once consent has been 
provided, the remaining patients in the trial 
(patients without access to nintedanib outside the 
clinical trial) will be offered continuation of 
treatment within the trial. This period will consist 
of study visits every  16 weeks (±2 weeks) where 
the following procedures will be conducted:
-Assessment o f adverse events and conco mitant 
therap y since last visit;
-Dispensation of trial drug .
Patients will continue to receive treatment until 
they meet a reason for discontinuation (refer to 
section 3. 3.4) or until access to nintedanib is 
obtained outside th e clinical trial. 
Dose reductions, interruptions and re -escalations 
are possible at an y time during the scheduled 
study  visits or between visits to manage adverse 
events.
End of treatment and follow up visits have to be

STUDY DESIGN: 
ECOSPOR IV; Cohort 1 is an open-label extension of Study SERES-012. This study is designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a SER-109 treatment regimen in adult subjects 18 years of age or older with 
recurrent Clostridioides. difficile  infection (RCDI), who received a SER-109 or placebo treatment regimen in 
Study SERES-012. 
Approximately 30 eligible subjects with recurrent CDI di sease from Study SERES-012 are expected to enroll in 
Cohort 1. 
Subjects who had a per-protocol recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of receipt of a SER109 or placebo treatment 
regimen in Study SERES-012 and who have responded to CDI SOC antibiotic therapy defined as 10 to 21 days 
of treatment with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or fidaxomicin [200 mg BID] will be eligible to enroll in Study 
SERES-013, and will receive a SER-109 treatm ent regimen. A SER-109 treatment regimen is  
 adm inistered orally in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days.  
Subjects being considered for SERES-01 3 will start screening for 013 at the Recurrence Visit of Study SERES-
012.  Subjects with a confirmed recurrence of CDI will receive 10 to 21 days of treatment with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]. On Day -1, within 3 days of completion of SOC antibiotic treatment for 
their CDI, subjects will undergo a bowel cleanse followed by overnight fasting prior to scheduled randomization 
on Day 1. 
  Laboratory values or procedures obtained during the screening window and from the central laboratory of Study 
SERES-012 (e.g. Recurrence Visit) do not need to be  repeated at the Screening Visit for SERES-013. The 
SERES-012 Recurrence Visit may be used for the SERES-013 Screening Visit. However, if the SERES-012 Recurrence Visit occurred outside the SERES-013 screening window (Day -24 to Day -2), the required screening 
procedures for SERES-013 must be repeated within the screening window.  
 Subjects will come to the clinic after an overnight fast on the morning of Da y 1 to receive a single dose of oral 
SER-109  in 4 capsules and have all safety evaluations performed. On Day 1, subjects will be 
dispensed a 2-day supply of SER-109  in 4 capsules with instructions for home-a dministration of 
a single daily dose in the morning before breakfast on Day 2 and Day 3. Subjects will be contacted by phone on 
Day 2 and Day 3 to confirm they have taken study drug be fore breakfast and to inquire about their general health. 
If subjects have not taken study drug when contacted, they will be reminded to do so as soon as possible. From 
Day 1 to Week 8, all subjects will be contacted by phone by study site personnel weekly, with the exception of a 
home or in-clinic visit at Week 2 and an in-clinic visit at Week 8, and queried for adverse events (AEs) and diarrheal symptoms. After Week 8, all subjects will be contacted by phone by study site personnel every 4 weeks 
(i.e., Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24) and queried for serious adverse events [SAEs] and adverse events of special 
interest [AESIs]). Health-relat ed quality of life and health outcomes will be assessed throughout the study via the 
CDI-specific, Cdiff32 Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) 
questionnaires. 
To document episodes of diarrhea, su bjects will complete a diarrhea log (see  Investigator Site File) to include 
days with diarrhea as well as no diarrhea ,IGLDUUKHDOV\PSWRPVUHFXU 3 unformed stools per day over 2 
consecutive days) between scheduled visits, subjects will be  instructed to contact the investigator and return to 
the clinic for a C. difficile  stool toxin test and clinical evaluation for recurrence of CDI (Recurrence Visit). 
Subjects who have a confirmed CDI recurrence should continue to be followed for safety assessments through 
Week 24. Favorable clinical outcome (or Sustained clinical response) in this study will be determined by the 
absence of CDI recurrence up to 8 weeks after initiati on of the SER-109 treatment regimen. CDI recurrence is

 care, a C. difficile  stool test may be performed locally at the study site. Stool samples collected for suspected CDI 
recurrence will also be processed and shipped to a central laboratory for C. difficile  stool testing (see Laboratory 
Manual). The subject should not initiate antibiotics for suspected CDI prior to providing a stool sample for the 
central laboratory stool testing. Data from the C. difficile  toxin test (either EIA or CCNA), performed at the central 
laboratory, will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. The central laboratory results will be communicated to 
the investigator and the decision to treat with antibiotics will be based upon the investigator’s assessment. 
The schedule of assessments and procedures is provided in Table 1. 
 
The Open-Label cohort (Cohort 2) w ill commence after the last subject from SERES-012 rolls over into SERES-
013.    The primary objective in Cohort 2 is to describe safety and tolerability of SER-109 in subjects 18 years of 
age or older with at least a first recu rrence of CDI. Approximately -200 subjects are expected to be enrolled in 
Cohort 2  
In Cohort 2, subjects with symptoms suggestive of RCDI may submit a stool sample for CDI toxin or PCR 
testing at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendmen t (CLIA)- certified local laboratory or the central 
laboratory with a prescreening  or screening consent.  Stool samples submitted to the central lab for pre-screening 
and screening will be tested using a PCR . test.   All subjects who are confirmed to have toxin  or PCR positive 
CDI at prescreening will undergo all Screening Visit assessments after providing signed informed consent. 
Subjects with one or more recurrences of CDI (including the current episode) who have responded to CDI 
antibiotic therapy defined as 10 to 42 days of treatment with vancomycin or 10 to 25 days of fidaxomicin [200 
mg] will be potentially eligible to enroll in Study SE RES-013 to receive a SER-109 treatment regimen.  A SER-
109 treatment regimen is  admi nistered orally in 4 capsules once daily 
for 3 consecutive days. During the screening window (Day -24 to Day -2), after informed consent is obtained, 
subjects will be assessed for eligibility and undergo physical examination. Vital signs and laboratory specimens 
will be obtained. At screening, subjects will complete a EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Visual 
Analog Scale. 
On Day -1, within 3 days of completion of antibiotic treatment for their CDI, subjects will undergo a bowel 
cleanse with magnesium citrate, or GoLytely if they have renal impairment, prior to scheduled allocation on 
Day 1.  
Subjects will come to the clinic on the morning of Day 1 to receive a single dose of oral SER-109  
in 4 capsules. On Day 1, subjects will be dispensed a 2-day supply of SER-109  in 4 capsules with 
instructions for home-administration of a single daily dose in the morning on Day 2 and Day 3. Subjects will be 
contacted by phone on Day 2 and Day 3 to confirm they have taken study drug and to inquire about their general 
health. If subjects have not taken study drug when contacted, they will be reminded to do so as soon as possible. 
From Day 1 to Week 8, all subjects will be contacted by phone by study site personnel weekly, with the exception of a home or in-clinic visit at Week 8,and queried for adverse events (AEs) and diar rheal symptoms. At the Week 
8 visit, subjects will complete the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale and the Bowel 
Cleanse Patient Satisfaction Survey Meas ure.  After Week 8, all subjects will be contacted by phone by study site 
personnel every 4 weeks (i.e., Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24) and queried for serious adverse events [SAEs] and

Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
In Cohort 1, the primary efficacy outc ome is the recurrence of CDI determin ed by a toxin assay through Week 8 
after receipt of a SER-109 treatment regimen in the IT T Population. Subjects will be categorized as having 
favorable (sustained clinical response) (no CDI recurren ce) or unfavorable outcomes (had CDI recurrence). Rules 
for imputing CDI recurrence status for subjects with missing data will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).   
The number and percentage of subjects defined as having favorable and unfavorable outcomes will be reported 
with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for subjects who were randomized to SER- 109 and placebo in 
SERES-012 separately, as well as both groups combined. The CIs will be derived using the Clopper-Pearson 
exact method. 
In Cohort 2, the efficacy outcome is the recurrence of CDI determined by a toxin assay through Week 8 and 12  
after receipt of a SER-109 treatment regimen in the ITT Population. Subjects will be categorized as having 
favorable (sustained clinical response) (no CDI recurren ce) or unfavorable outcomes (had CDI recurrence). Rules

 4. INTRODUCTION  
Clostridioides difficile  is a sporeforming Gram-positive anaerobe present throughout the 
environment and, in low amounts, can be a compone nt of the gut flora of a healthy individual. 
Clostridioides difficile  infection (CDI) usually develops in pa tients with a history of antibiotic use 
that depletes the norma l gut flora, enabling C. difficile  to colonize and proliferate within the colon, 
elaborating virulent toxins A and B. These t oxins invade epithelial cells disrupting their 
cytoskeleton, resulting in damage to the epith elial barrier and promoting mucosal inflammation. 
The clinical manifestations of CDI vary broadl y, ranging from nuisance diarrhea lasting a few 
days, to more pronounced disease with severe  colonic inflammation that can develop into 
pseudomembranous colitis with associated syst emic toxicity requiring lifesaving colectomy. 
With ever increasing use of antib iotics, particularly in the agi ng populations in ho spitals and in 
nursing homes, the incidence of C. difficile - associated disease has been increasing such that 
C. difficile  is the leading cause of nosocomial infection in the United States (US). The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention estimate that C. difficile  causes diarrhea linke d to approximately 
29,000 American deaths each year ( Lessa et al, 2015 ). In Canada, there are approximately 37,900 
CDI episodes each year (2012); 7980 (21%) of these are relapses ( Levy, 2015 ). In the European 
Union (EU), the number of reported cases of CDI has also increased in recent years, and is 
estimated to affect 172,000 patients per year. 
Clostridioides difficile  spores can survive for months in ho spitals and long term  care facilities 
where they can cause repeated CDI episodes. Virt ually all antibiotics have been implicated in 
association with CDI. The mechanistic link to an tibiotic use is based on th e finding that a healthy 
microbial ecology resists pathogen colonization by competing for nut rients and resources in the 
gut ( Theriot et al, 2014; Weingarden- et al, 2014 ). Antibiotic use disrupts the microbiota and 
liberates nutrients that enable colonization by C. difficile (Ng et al, 2013 ).  
The incidence of recurrent CDI has paralleled th e increased incidence of primary infection. CDI 
recurs in approximately 25% of  patients after antibiotic treat ment for first time disease ( Bakken et 
al, 2011; Depestel and Aronoff, 2013; Surawicz- et al, 2013 ). After the first recurrent episode, 
patients are at an even higher risk for subsequent  CDI, estimated to be > 60% after the second or 
subsequent episode ( Higa and Kelly, 2013 ). There are few proven, a pproved therapeutic options 
for significantly reducing CDI recu rrence in patients with recurrent CDI. Some patients are treated 
with antibiotics indefinitely to avoid persis tent diarrhea and other sequelae of CDI. 
SER-109 is an Ecobiotic  drug being developed for the treatmen t of adults with recurrent CDI. 
SER-109 is an ecology of bacteria in spore form , enriched from stool donations obtained from 
healthy, screened donors. The bacterial spores ar e enriched by thorough killing of the vegetative 
microorganisms, then fractionati ng the resulting spore population away from inactive components 
and formulating and encapsulating the spores fo r oral delivery. SER-109 is administered to 
subjects after completion of a course of  antibiotic therapy fo r recurrent CDI.  
SER-109 has been shown to prevent CDI and to treat C. difficile  relapse in nonclin ical studies in 
mice and hamsters (see Investigator’s Brochure fo r more information). Clinical experience with 
SER-109 includes four studies : 1) a completed open-label, two-pa rt study in 30 subjects with a 
history of 3 or more occurrences of CDI (S ERES-001); 2) a completed double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-gro up study in adults with recurrent CDI (SERES-004); 3) a completed 
expanded access for intermediate-size patient populations and open-labe l extension of study

 and 12/15 (80.0%) subjects randomized  to receive placebo. Overall,  of the 42 subjects who met 
the primary endpoint of CDI recurrence by Week 8, 35 subjects discontinued the study due to their 
CDI recurrence prior to Week 8. Of the 35 subjects who discontinued the study due to a CDI 
recurrence prior to Week 8, 34 enrolled in the open-label extens ion study SERES-005. 
In Study SERES-004, a total of 66 of the 89 su bjects randomized (74.2%),  46 of the 60 (76.7%) 
subjects who received SER-109 and 20 of th e 29 (69.0%) subjects who received placebo, 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. Fi fteen of the 89 (16.9%) subjects,  11 of the 60 (18.3%) subjects 
who received SER-109 and 4 of the 29 (13.8%) s ubjects who received placebo, experienced at 
least 1 TEAE that was considered by the investig ators to be drug-related.  Like Study SERES-001, 
the most commonly reported SOC was GI disorder s (55% in the SER-10 9 group and 44.8% in the 
Placebo group). The most commonly re SRUWHGLQFLGHQFHSUHIHUUHGWHUPV  in the GI SOC 
reported in subjects who received SER-109 were diarrhea, abdo minal pain, flatulence, nausea, and 
constipation. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Six of the 60 (10%) 
subjects who received SER-109 expe rienced an event that  has been reported as  severe. Twelve of 
the 89 (10.1%) subjects enrolled  (9 subjects who received SER-109 [15%] and 3 subjects who 
received placebo [10.3%] have expe rienced a total of 43 treatment- emergent SAEs, none of which 
were considered to be drug-related by the inve stigator. One subject had an SAE (metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer) that was fata l and led to study withdrawal.  
SERES-005 began as an open-label extension stu dy of SERES-004 conducted in the U.S, offered 
to subjects who received an inve stigational product in SERES-004, but recurred prior to 8-weeks 
post-treatment. In April 2016, the study was amended to include expanded access  to an 
intermediate-size patient population of adults, 18 years of age or older w ith recurrent CDI, for 
whom there is no comparable or alternative th erapy. Seventy-two subjects, 34 who enrolled from 
Study SERES-004 and 38 who enrolled under expanded access met the eligibility criteria for the 
study. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate  CDI recurrence rates in adults up to 8 weeks 
post-treatment with SER-109. The primary safety objective was to eval uate the safety and 
tolerability of SER-109 in adul ts with recurrent CDI.  
Overall, CDI recurrence was obser ved within 8 weeks post-treatment in 38.9% (28/72) of subjects, 
including 52.4% (11/21) in the SERES-004 SE R-109 group, 15.4% (2/13) in the SERES-004 
Placebo group, and 39.5% (15/38) in the Expanded Access group. Among the 58 subjects treated 
with vancomycin followed by SER-109, CDI recu rrence within 8 week s post-treatment was 
observed in 41.4% (24/58). Among the 13 subjects  treated with fidaxomicin followed by SER-
109, CDI recurrence was observed within 8 weeks pos t-treatment in 30.8% (4/13) of subjects.

 Infections and infestations ( 36.1%) with preferred terms urinar y tract infecti on, nasopharyngitis, 
and cellulitis. Overall, most events were of mild  or moderate intensity:  33.3% of subjects had 
TEAEs that were mild in intensity, 31.9% subjects  had at least TEAE of moderate intensity. 
Related events mainly affected the GI SOC. 
Eleven subjects had 21 SAEs leading to three of  four deaths and study di scontinuation. One subject 
had 8 SAEs: diastolic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarc tion, left face zoster shingles, 
severe sepsis and septic shock, cerebrovascul ar accident, pneumonia an d aspiration pneumonia. 
Myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and aspiration pneumonia were fatal. One subject 
had inflammatory diarrhea and sepsis that was fatal. One subject had dehydration and 
cerebrovascular accident that was fatal. One subject had C. difficile  colitis that was fatal. All SAEs 
were not considered related to study drug. 
Of the other SAEs, 3 were seve re including diarrhea related to C. difficile , recurrent syncope, and 
CDI recurrence, and 4 were moderate in intensit y including lumbar compressi on fracture, diarrhea, 
hyperkalemia and exacerbation of end-stage renal di sease, and pancolitis. These SAEs and fatality 
rates are consistent with thos e expected in the study populatio n with multiple comorbidities. 
SERES-012 was a stratified, ra ndomized, double-blind placebo-co ntrolled Phase 3 study, that 
enrolled subjects with recurrent CDI defined as 2 or more recurrences of CDI in the previous 12 
months. Subjects were stratified by age (< \HDUV  65 years) and antibiotic treatment of the 
qualifying CDI (vancomycin; fida xomicin), and were randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to SER-109 
administered as 4 capsules ( ) for 3 consecu tive days or identic al appearing placebo 
after administration of a bowel cleanse on completion of antibi otics. The primary objective was to 
demonstrate the superiority of SER-109 vs. place bo in reducing recurrences by eight weeks, as

by EIA, reflexing to CCNA. Invest igator assessment that the subject required treatment must also 
have been met. 
This is a summary from the interi m analysis dataset. The majority of the 182 subjects were female 
(n = 109; 59.9%). Most of them  were white (n = 170; 93.4%). The mean age was 65.5 years and 
VXEMHFWVZHUH\HDUVRIDJH  There were more females in the SER-109 group 
62/90 (68.9%) vs. 47/92 (51.1%) and there were fewer subjects with  a second recurrence in the 
SER-109 group (56.7%) vs. placebo group ( 64.1%). Other demographic and baseline 
characteristics were similar between the two groups. 
The study met the primary endpoint of reducing the relative risk of CDI re currence by toxin assay 
up to 8 weeks following dosing in the ITT populati on. Overall, recurrence of CDI up to 8 weeks 
post-treatment was observed in 48 of 182 (26.4%) subject s of all subjects enrolled. Ten (10) of the 
90 (11.1 %) subjects randomized to receive SER-109, and 38 of the 92 (41.3%) subjects

 Overall, 168 of the 182 subjects (92.3%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. Eighty-four (84) of the 90 
(93.3%) subjects who received SER-109 experienced  a total of 529 TEAEs, and 84 of the 92 
(91.3%) subjects who received placebo experienced a total of 598 TEAEs. Overall, 94 of the 182 
(51.6%) subjects experienced a total of 452 TEAEs that  were considered by the Investigator to be 
related or possibly related to study drug – 51.1%  in the SER-019 group and 52.2% in the placebo 
group. Fifteen (15) of the 90 (16.7%) subjects w ho received SER-109 experi enced a total of 26 
treatment-emergent SAEs and 19 of the 92 (20.7%) subjects who received placebo experienced a 
total of 32 treatment-emergent SAEs. Four (4) of  the 90 (4.4%) subjects  who received SER-109 
experienced a total of 4 treatment-emergent adverse events of sp ecial interest ( for example, blood 
stream infection, meningitis, absce ss) (AESI) and 3 of the 92 (3.3%) subjects who received placebo 
experienced a total of 3 treatment -emergent AESIs. None of these SAEs or AESIs were considered 
related to investigational product by  the Investigator.  Three deaths were outcomes of SAEs, all in 
the SER-109 group, consisting of worsening glioblastoma, atrial  fibrillation and sepsis, and

urinary tract infection in subjects who received SER-109; and vomiting and C. difficile  colitis in 
subjects who received placebo. A larger number of  some GI AEs in the placebo group may be 
because of the higher rate of recurrences in th at group, Overall, the safety profile was similar 
between SER-109 and placebo recipients.  
Thus, clinical experience to date suggests that SE R-109 is well-tolerated with an acceptable safety  
profile. Overall, there have been  no drug-related treatment-emerge nt SAEs and the majority of 
related TEAEs have been mild or moderate in severity and most commonly associated with the 
gastrointestinal tract. Additional information re garding clinical experien ce with SER-109 can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Although safety data with SER-109 has been relativel y consistent across studies, efficacy data in 
the placebo-controlled Study SERES-004 was inconsis tent with results from the open-label Study 
SERES-001. There are a nu mber of factors that may explain why the primary endpoint of reducing 
the relative risk of CDI recurrence at up to 8-weeks was not achieved in Study SERES-004. First, 
the diagnostic test for entry may not have differe ntiated subjects with active CDI disease from 
those with C. difficile  carriage. This would have led to enrolling subjects who may have been 
experiencing post-CDI irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms but, were only colonized 
by C. difficile  and did not have an active infection. These subjects may not have been distributed 
equally between the treatment arms. Additionall y, the diagnostic test for recurrences which 
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013

Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 35 of 80 
 primarily used polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR), also known as nucleic acid amplification 
testing (NAAT), which could have overestimated recurrences during the tr ial.  Finally, although 
analysis of the microbiome identified that SE R-109 in SERES-004 was biologically active, the 
dose administered in Phase 2 may not have been op timal for efficacy (see rationale below).  Both 
changing the dose and definition of  recurrence in SERES-012 likely le d to a more robust and well-
controlled trial, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful  improvement observed. 
4.2. Rationale  
There are few proven, approved therapeutic options  for significantly reducing CDI recurrence in 
patients with recurrent CDI.   
This study is being conducted primar ily to gather safety and tolerability data  as well as efficacy 
from subjects exposed to SER-109 at the dose used in SERES-012. In addition to subjects rolling 
over from SERES-012 (Cohort 1), subjects with first recurrence or more will be eligible for Cohort 
2. There are no data to suggest diffe rences in safety profile in subj ects with at least one recurrence 
versus those with at least two recurrences. In a Phase 3b/4 study that described safety in groups 
with 0, 1, or 2 recurrences, there were no differe nces when comparing an extended pulsed course 
of fidaxomicin with vancomycin ( Cornely 2019 ).

The majority of subjects enrolled in the trial were having their first occurrence  of CDI.  Those with 
first and second recurrence make up a small propor tion of subjects.  However, there does not 
appear to be an increased AE, SAE, or death ra te going from first occurr ence to second and third 
occurrences.  These data support inclusion of fi rst recurrence (second occu rrence) subjects in the 
larger safety population.  Enrollment of patients w ith first CDI recurrence will allow participating 
centers to present the protocol to a higher numbe r of subjects, who previo usly did not qualify.  
The reason to require toxin testin g in the pivotal efficacy study was to ensure exclusion of carriers 
which could potentially be imbalanced across treatm ent arms.  However, this significantly limited 
availability of treatment to a popul ation in whom toxin testing was available.  Inclusion criteria 
have been broadened to allow evaluation of safe ty and tolerability in subjects who may receive 
SER-109 where toxin testing using EIA is not availa ble, but who meet the di agnostic criteria based 
on clinical indicators and a positive PCR test for C. difficile . In the IDSA treatment guidelines, 
diagnosis of C. difficile  infection using PCR alone is accepta ble in patients w ho meet clinical 
diagnostic criteria (McDonald 2018). Subjects who have been treated with longer duration and 
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013

Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 36 of 80 
 dose of vancomycin or duration of fidaxomicin will also be enrolled given changes in standard-of-
care durations of antibiotics to wards prolonged and tapering courses (McDonald 2018, Cornely 
2019). Broadening eligibili ty to subjects with C. difficile  infection who do not have access to toxin 
EIA testing or who have received longer courses of antibiotics prior to study participation better 
reflect ‘real world’ management of CDI patients.  Subjects prev iously screened in SERES-012 
who did not receive SER-109 and had not previous ly rolled over to SERES-013 will also be 
eligible. 
4.2.1.  Rationale for Dose and Treatment Regimen 
In this study, subjects will receive a dose of SER109 ( ) 
per day for 3 consecutive days. The dose and trea tment regimen was the one used in SERES-012. 
In Study SERES-001, subjects received doses of SER-109 ranging from  
 given over one or two days. Analysis of changes in the subject microbiome 
demonstrates that spore forming species richness in  the subjects' GI tract at 1 week was positively 
correlated with SER-109 dose. Importantly, of subjects who recurred in SERES-004, about 50% 
of recurrences in both placebo and SER109 arms happened by Day 10 and 75% by Day 20, starting 
as early as Day 3. In SERES-004, the engraftmen t of SER-109 spore-forming bacteria in treated 
subjects’ gastrointestinal tracts was less robust a nd less rapid as compared to that observed in 
SERES-001, although it was signif icantly greater than the changes in placebo-treated 
subjects. Engraftment improved at  later time points, but due to  early recurrences, the SER-109-
induced microbiome change in SERES-004 may have been too late from a therapeutic 
perspective. In addition, it was generally observe d that commensal spore-forming species richness 
at 1-week post dosing is correlate d with better clinical outcome. In aggregate, these observations 
are central to the design of the proposed re gimen that provides a higher daily dose ( ) 
repeated daily over 3 days following the comple tion of antibiotics as compared to dosing in 
SERES-004. Due to the fact that recurrence  happens early, the slower SER-109-induced 
microbiome changes in SERES-004 sugge st that the  was likely below 
the required amount to achieve a therapeutic res ponse. To account for variations in antibiotic 
washout, and to provide dosing prior to the earlie st observed recurrences, three (3) doses will be 
administered on Days 1-3 following antibiotic cessa tion. We have chosen a three-fold higher dose 
level based on the , as an amount  commensurate with engraftment 
richness to the degree correlating with protection ag ainst recurrence. 
4.2.2.  Rationale for Endpoints and C. difficile  Diagnostic Criteria  
The introduction of molecular tests, which are mo re sensitive and detect microbial DNA to the C. 
difficile  toxin gene instead of toxin, ha s led to greater detection of Clostridioides difficile but detect 
C. difficile bacteria regardless of toxin production. This phenomenon has called into question 
whether a positive PCR or NAAT result reflects clinical disease or represents C. difficile 
colonization ( Polange et al, 2015 ).  
Thus, in SERES-004, the diagnostic test for entry may not have differentiated subjects with active 
CDI disease from those with C. difficile  carriage. This would lead to enrolling subj ects who may 
be experiencing a post-CDI irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) if colonized by C. difficile. IBS 
following CDI is reported to occur in up to 25% of CDI patients ( Wadhwa et al, 2016 ). This would

CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 37 of 80 
 have decreased the power of the study to differentia te the treatment arms as those subjects without 
a true diagnosis of RCDI are less likely to recur. 
Since PCR diagnostics in SERES-004 may have led to misclassifica tion of subjects with diarrhea 
and C. difficile colonization as recurrence, the primary efficacy endpoint in this study is the 
recurrence of CDI in subjects who receive SER-109 or placebo using a C. difficile  toxin positive 
diagnostic (not toxin gene-based) up to 8 weeks after initiation of trea tment. Unlike the PCR 
diagnostic for C. difficile , the toxin-based tests, such as en zyme immunoassay (EIA) for toxin A 
and B or the cell cytotoxicity neutraliza tion assay (CCNA) det ects the presence of C. difficile toxin

 5. STUDY OVERVIEW 
ECOSPOR IV – Cohort 1 is an open-label extens ion of Study SERES-012. This study is designed 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy  of a treatment regimen SER-109 in adult subjects 
18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridioides difficile  infection (RCDI), who received a 
treatment regimen of SER-109 or placebo in St udy SERES-012. In Cohort 2 of ECOSPOR IV, the 
primary study objective is to examine safety and tole rability in a cohort of subjects receiving SER-
109 at the dose used in SERES-012.  
This study will be conducted at approximately 14 0 study centers in the North America. For  Cohort 
1, subjects who had a per-protocol recurrence of CDI within 8 week s of receipt of a treatment 
regimen of SER 109 or placebo in Study SERES- 012, and who have responded to 10 to 21 days 
of standard-of-care (SOC) antibio tic treatment for CDI (i.e. vanc omycin [125 mg QID] and/or 
fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]) will be eligible to enroll and receive a treatment regimen of SER-109 
in Study SERES-013. A treatment regimen of SER-109 is administered orally as  
 in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days. Approximately 30 
eligible subjects with recurrent CDI disease from Study SE RES-012 are expected to enroll in 
Cohort 1. Approximately 200 subjects will be enro lled through the Open-Label program in Cohort 
2For Cohort 2, subjects with one or more recurre nces of CDI (including the current episode) who 
have responded to CDI an tibiotic therapy defined as 10 to 42 days of treatment with vancomycin 
[125 mg QID] or 10 – 25 days of  fidaxomicin [200 mg BID] will be  potentially eligible to enroll 
in Study SERES-013 to receive a SER-109 treatment regimen. 
The study duration is approximately 27 weeks, in cluding a ~3-week Screening Period, an 8-week 
Efficacy Period, and a 16-week Follow-up Period fr om initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects 
treated with prolonged or tapering doses of antibiotics after prescr eening confirmation of CDI will 
be screened during the 3-week scr eening period (Day -24 to Day -2) 
In Cohort 1, favorable clinical out come, or sustained clinical res ponse, will be determined by the 
absence of CDI recurrence up to 8  weeks after initiation of treatment of study drug, with CDI

assay (either enzyme immunoassay [EIA] or cell cytotoxicity neutrali zation assay [CCNA]), 
performed at the central laboratory, will be used  for the primary endpoint analysis. The central 
laboratory results will be communicat ed to the investigator and the decision to treat with antibiotics 
will be based upon the investigator’s assessment. 
In Cohort 2, favorable clinical out come, or sustained clinical res ponse, will be determined by the 
absence of CDI recurrence up to 8 or 12 weeks af ter initiation of treatment of study drug, with CDI 
recurrence defined in the same  manner as for Cohort 1. 
5.1. Trial Conduct 
For Cohort 1, screening will begin at the Recurr ence Visit of Study SERES-012. Eligible subjects, 
or their legally authorized representative, will provide informed consent and undergo all baseline 
evaluations at the Screening Visit. Assessments  performed at the Recu rrence Visit of Study 
SERES-012 do not need to be repeated, if pe rformed within the SERES-013 screening window 
(Day -24 to Day -2) and from the cen tral laboratory of study SERES-012.  
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 39 of 80 
 For Cohort 2, subjects with symptoms suggestive of RCDI may submit a stool sample for CDI 
toxin or PCR testing at a Clin ical Laboratory Improvement Amen dment (CLIA)- certified local 
laboratory or the central laborat ory with a prescreening or screening consent. The central 
laboratory will only be performing PCR testing on  qualifying CDI. All subj ects who are confirmed 
to be toxin or PCR positive at prescreening wi ll undergo all Screening Vi sit assessments after 
providing signed informed consent.   Subjects who were previously  test negative who have a new 
episode may repeat pre-scr eening or screening using a new consent and study number. 
Cohort 1 subjects will receive 10 to 21 days of treatment with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or 
fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]. On Day 1, within 3 da ys of completion of SOC antibiotic treatment 
for their CDI, subjects will undergo a bowel cl eanse by consuming 10 oz. (~300 mL) of oral 
magnesium citrate followed by ove rnight fasting. Subjects with impaired kidney function who are 
unable to take magnesium citrate will take 250 mL of GoLytely (p olyethylene glycol electrolyte 
solution).   
Subjects will come to the clinic after an overnight  fast on Day 1 to receive a dose of oral SER-109 
( ) in 4 capsules and have all safety evalua tions performed. On Day 1, subjects will be 
dispensed a 2-day supply of SER-109 ( ) in 4 capsules with inst ructions for at-home 
administration of a single daily dos e in the morning before breakfast  on Day 2 and Day 3. Subjects 
will be contacted by phone on Day 2 and Day 3 to  confirm they have taken study drug in the 
morning before breakfast and to i nquire about their general health. If  subjects have not taken study 
drug when contacted, they will be reminded to do so  as soon as possible. From Day 1 to Week 8, 
all subjects will be contacted by phone by study site personnel weekly, with the exception of a 
home or in-clinic visit at Week 2 and an in-clini c visit at Week 8, and queried for adverse events 
(AEs) and diarrheal symptoms. After Week 8, all subjects will be contacted by phone by study site 
personnel every 4 weeks (i.e., Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24) and queried for serious adverse events 
[SAEs] and adverse events of special interest [A ESIs]). Health-related quali ty of life and health 
outcomes will be assessed throughout the study via the CDI-specific, Cdiff32 Health Related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL) and EuroQol 5 Dime nsion 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires. 
All AEs, SAEs/AESIs, and concomitant medications  will be collected from initiation of study drug 
administration up to Week 8. From Week 8 up to  Week 24, all SAEs/AESIs  and SAE/AESI-related 
data, and any antibiotic medication and its corresponding indication will be collected. 
To document episodes of diarrhea, subjects will co mplete a daily diarrhea log (see Investigator 
Site File) to include days with diarrhea as well as no diarrhea. ,IGLDUUKHDOV\PSWRPVUHFXU

x Subject choice (withdrawal of consent by  subject or their legally authorized 
representative; investigator will attempt to ascertain reason) 
x Protocol violat ion/non-compliance 
7.3.2.  Handling of Withdrawals and Discontinuations of Treatment 
The primary reason for withdrawal from the study w ill be recorded in an electronic case report 
form (eCRF). Subjects who volunt arily withdraw, or who are withdrawn from the study will be 
encouraged to complete the Early Termination Visit. The Early Termination Visit procedures are 
listed in Section 10.3.3 . Although subjects are free to withdr aw at any time, subjects will be 
encouraged to remain in the st udy for follow-up safety evaluation. 
Those subjects who withdraw from the study will  be referred to a physician for follow-up care. 
7.3.3.  Lost to Follow-up 
If a subject fails to appear fo r a follow up assessment, all attempts to contact the subject and 
information received during contact attempts must  be documented in the subject’s medical record. 
In any circumstance, every effort should be ma de to contact the subject and document subject 
outcome, (i.e., 3 documented contact attempts via phone calls, e-mail, etc., on separate occasions 
will be made to locate or contact the subject, and/or to determine health status). 
7.3.4.  Termination of Study 
Although the sponsor has every in tention of completing the study, the sponsor may terminate the 
study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons. 
8. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
8.1. SER-109 
SER-109 is an ecology of bacterial spores enrich ed from stool donations obtained from healthy, 
screened donors. SER-109 is formulated as an oral  capsule for administration to patients following 
cessation of antibiotic therapy. 
8.1.1.  Donor Screening 
Donors undergo a general health examination incl uding gastrointestinal (GI) medical history, 
familial GI medical history, blood chemistry, hema tology with complete blood count, urinalysis, 
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 48 of 80 
 and blood and fecal viral and bacterial pathoge n testing before donating stool. The donor must 
successfully complete the physical screening and laborato ry tests after the donation period before 
the material can be released for manufacturing. A description of donor screening procedures is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
8.1.2.  Manufacturing and Storage 
SER-109 is manufactured using current Good Manufac turing Practice (GMP).   Stool raw material 
is sourced from donors who are screened for health history, physical status, and a panel of pathogen 
tests; materials from a single donor are pooled to  make a manufacturing lot.  The manufacturing 
process inactivates non-spore forms of live bacteria and fungi, and pot ential parasites and viruses, 
and substantially reduces the amount of undige sted food and inactivated non-spore components 
via successive separation steps.  The purified mate rial is then concentrated  to enable oral capsule 
formulation, stored frozen, and qual ity control tested until formulation. 
8.2. SER-109 Kit Storage and Handling 
The investigational produc t (SER-109) will be provided as a pe r subject kit to include 3 bottles 
containing four size 00 capsules ( ) in an  opaque, 40 mL high density polyethylene 
container sealed with foil. 
SER-109 is odorless and tasteless as  prescribed. If chewed or if ca psule integrity is compromised, 
SER-109 has a sweet taste. 
Instructions for shipment, storage, accountability,  reconciliation, and destruction of study drug are 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
8.3. Compliance 
Subjects will be instructed to return all unused medication and all used packaging materials to the 
clinic at the Week 8 visit. Subject compliance to  study drug will be checked by the investigator or 
their designee(s) and documented in the CRFs (e.g., tablet count). Subjects will be instructed to 
take all study drug doses in the morning after an overnight fast (nothing by mouth except for small 
DPRXQWVRIZDWHURIKRXUV6XEMHFWVZLOOEHDVNHGWRUHPDL QIDVWL ng for up to 60 minutes 
following dosing. In Cohort 2, fa sting is not required.   
8.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Study Treatment  
This is an open-label study. All subjects who qualify for dosing will  receive single daily doses of 
SER-109 ( ) in 4 capsules administ ered over 3 consecutive days.  
The interactive voice and web response system (IxRS) will assign appropriate bottles of 
SER-109 that will be available at the site for a ll subjects on their Day 1 study visit. Subjects who 
discontinue this study or who have previous ly received SER-109 in this study will not be 
permitted to re-enter. Similarly, SER-109 dispensed to a subject may not be re-used, even if the 
bottle(s) are returned unopened.  
8.5. Maintaining the Randomization Code s and Breaking the Study Blind 
Not applicable. This study is not randomized or blinded.

8.7. Criteria for Confirmed  Clostridioides difficile  Recurrence 
Post-Randomization 
Cohort 1 subjects suspected of having CDI will be as ked to contact the investigator and return to 
the clinic for a C. difficile  stool toxin test and evaluation for r ecurrence of CDI (Recurrence Visit) 
(see Section 10.3.3 ). For both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 s ubjects, during the COVID-19 pandemic 
home visits will be allowed in place of clinic vi sits. subjects suspected of having CDI will be asked 
to contact the investigator and return to the clinic or have a home visit for a C. difficile  stool toxin 
test to be sent to the central laboratory and ev aluation for recurrence of CD I (Recurrence Visit). If 
the subject is seen in a home visit, the investigat or will determine treatment based on the clinical 
evaluation and stool  test result. 
The home visit will remain an option for a clinic visit during follow-up visits after enrollment for 
Cohort 2. 
Subjects must fulfill the following criteria: 
1.  unformed stools per day over 2 consecutive days 
2. Diarrhea as defined here should continue up until the day antibiotics to treat CDI are 
initiated. A positive C. difficile  test on a stool sample determined by a toxin assay 
 A C. difficile  stool test will be performed at the central laboratory. This result will 
be used for the primary endpoint analysis. The central laboratory results will be 
communicated to the investigator.

 9.7. Stool Sample Collection and Analysis 
Cohort 1, subjects will be asked to  collect stool at home or in th e clinic according to the schedule 
in Table 1 . The sample collected on Day -1 may be brought  to the study site for the Day 1 Visit. If 
the subject is unable to bring the stool sample to  the study site for any visit, arrangements may be 
made to pick up the sample at the subject’s home and bring it to the study site or may ship directly 
to the central laboratory (i.e., home visit by nurse or courier). Samples brought to the study site 
will be processed and then shipped to a central la boratory according to procedures defined in the 
Laboratory Manual. Stool collectio n kits will be provided to th e subjects by the study sites. 
Microbiome and metabolomics testing may be perf ormed on some or all stool samples collected 
on Day -1 (prior to administeri ng the bowel cleanse), at Week 1, Week 2, Week 8, Week 24 (for 
microbiome testing only), and at the Early Termina tion Visit or any Recurrence Visit to the study 
site, if applicable.  
If recurrent CDI is suspected, to inform subject care, a C. difficile test can be performed by a CLIA-
certified local laboratory using an FDA-approved test in order to inform subject treatment.  Stool 
samples collected for suspected CDI recurrence must  also be processed a nd shipped to a central 
laboratory for C. difficile  stool testing (see Laboratory Manual for details of C. difficile  testing 
performed at the central laborator y). The subject should not initiat e antibiotics for suspected CDI 
prior to providing a stool sample for the central laboratory stool testing. Data from the C. difficile  
toxin assay (either enzyme immuno assay [EIA] or cell cytotoxicity  neutralization assay [CCNA]), 
performed at the central laboratory, will be used  for the primary endpoint analysis. The central 
laboratory results will be communicat ed to the investigator and the decision to treat with antibiotics 
will be based upon their assessment. 
For Cohort 2, subjects will be aske d to collect stool prior to th e bowel cleanse on Day -1.  The 
sample collected on Day -1 may be brought to th e study site for the Day 1 Visit.  A subgroup of 
subjects who consent will collect a stool specimen at Week 1 and will make arrangements to return 
it to the clinic or ship directly to the central  laboratory.  Microbiome and metabolomics testing 
may be performed on some or all stool samples co llected on Day -1 (prior  to administering the 
bowel cleanse), and at Week 1.   
The subjects will be instructed to call the study s ite if diarrhea develops. If recurrent CDI is 
suspected, stool sample must be collected  and shipped to central laboratory for C. difficile  stool 
testing (see Laboratory Manual for details of C. difficile  testing performed at the central 
laboratory). The subject s hould not initiate antibiotics for suspect ed CDI prior to providing a stool 
sample for the central laboratory stool testing. Data from the C. difficile  toxin assay (either enzyme 
immunoassay [EIA] or cell cytotoxic ity neutralization assay [CCNA]), will be used for the primary 
endpoint analysis. The central laboratory result w ill be communicated to the investigator and the 
decision to treat with antibiotics will be based upon their assessment. 
 
9.8. Biological Specimen Collection for  Future Biomedical Research

9.10. Health Outcome Assessment 
Information such as mortality from any cause, hospitalizations, and hospital length of stay (in 
days), including days in the intensive care unit, w ill be collected as part of the health outcomes 
assessment throughout this study.  
9.11. Quality of Life Assessment 
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status. The CDiff32 HRQoL is a newly 
developed and validated health-rel ated quality of life questionnaire specific to pati ents with CDI 
(Garey et al, 2016 ). For Cohort 1 only, administer the EQ-5 D-5L and Cdiff32 HRQoL at the time 
points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  
For Cohort 2, the EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale w ill be completed using a paper questionnaire at 
Screening and Week 8.  In additi on, subjects will be asked to co mplete a Bowel Cleanse Patient 
Satisfaction Survey Measure at Week 8 on the bo wel cleanse procedure administered prior to 
SER-109. This survey is modified from one that  has previously been validated in subjects 
undergoing colonoscopy (Hatoun 2016) . This questionnaire has been minimally modified as

9.12. Clinical Response Evaluation 
Recurrence of CDI will be determined by the in vestigator based on the following definition: 
x A CDI episode is defined as  unformed stools per day over  2 consecutive days with 
a positive C. difficile  stool test on a stool sample determined by a toxin assay and a 
decision by the investigator, based on clinical assessment, that antibiotic treatment is 
needed. 
If subjects experience diarrhea symptoms XQIRUPHGVWRROVSHUGD \IRUFRQVHFXWLYHGD\V  or 
suspect a CDI episode, they shou ld contact the inves tigator immediately (inc luding on weekends) 
to arrange a Recurrence Visit for clinical evaluation and a C. difficile  stool toxin test (central 
laboratory). The subject should not initiate antibiotic treatment for suspected CDI until instructed 
to do so by the investigator. 
10. STUDY SCHEDULE 
The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures is presented in Table 1  and Table 2. Study days are 
relative to the oral administration of the firs t dose of study drug on Day 1. Assessments will be 
performed and noted in each subject’s chart or r ecord. In Cohort 1, as necessary for safety of 
subject, study visits including  Week 2, Week 8, Unscheduled, and Early Termination, may be 
conducted at subject’s home, with qualified nurse  or site personnel who will be ap propriately 
documented on the site’s delegation log to perfor m these Remote Study Visits and associated 
procedures.  If a nurse or s ite personnel cannot perform the vi sits, a telephone call or a video 
conference (Zoom, Skype, FaceTime, etc.) should be conducted in place of the Week 2, Week 8, 
Unscheduled, and Recurrence / Earl y Termination visits and must be documented in the source.  
Any required procedures not performed during a remote visit at the subject’s home will be

10.1. Screening Period  
For Cohort 2, subjects with symptoms suggestiv e of RCDI may submit a stool sample for CDI 
toxin or PCR testing at a Clin ical Laboratory Improvement Am endment (CLIA)- certified local 
laboratory or the central laborat ory with a prescreening or scr eening consent. Stool samples 
submitted to the central lab for screening will be tested via PCR.  ..Subjects who were previously 
test negative who have a new episode may repeat  pre-screening or screen ing using a new consent 
and study number.  
10.1.1.  Clinic Visit (Day -24 to Day -2) 
For Cohort 1, screening for this study begins  at the Recurrence Visit of Study SERES-012. 
Assessments performed at the Recurrence Visit in  Study SERES-012 do not need to be repeated if 
performed within the SERES-013 screening window (Day -24 to Day -2) and from the central 
laboratory of study SERES-012. Cohor t 2 subjects will undergo al l screening procedures and 
assessments, with the excepti on of urine dipstick.   
x After a full explanation of the study protocol, have each  subject or their legally 
authorized representative sign an informed  consent form (ICF) before performing any 
study-related activity (includi ng Screening activities).  
x Subjects will receive 10 to 21 days of treatm ent with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or 
fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]. For Cohort 2, su bjects will receive 10 to 42 days of 
vancomycin or 10 to 25 days of fidaxomicin  (200 mg). On Day -1, within 3 days of 
completion of antibiotic treatment for their CDI, subjects will undergo a bowel cleanse 
by consuming 10 oz. (~300 mL) of oral ma gnesium citrate followed by overnight 
fasting in Cohort 1 only. Cohort 2 will not requ ire fasting after bowel cleanse. Subjects 
with impaired kidney function who are unable to take magnesium citrate will take 250 
mL of GoLytely (polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution). 
x Assess each patient to ensure all inclusion cr iteria are met and no exclusion criteria are 
met.  
x Update medical history. Ensure documentati on of most recent CDI episode to include 
dates, test results, duration, and antibiotic treatment received.  
x Perform a physical examination including vital sign measurements (blood pressure, 
pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature), and weight.

11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY A ND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
All AEs, SAEs/AESIs, and concomitant medications will be collected from  the time of initiation 
of study drug up to Week 8. From Week 8 up to Week 24, all SAEs/AESIs  and SAE/AESI-related 
data, and any antibiotic medication and its corresponding indication will be collected.  
The investigator is responsible for: 
x Informing the sponsor in the event that a subject or a subject’s partner becomes 
pregnant during the study. A “Pregnancy Report Form” will be generated and the 
pregnancy will be captured in the safety da tabase and will be followed through to the 
outcome. 
x Instructing subjects in the self-reporting of selected AEs incl uding diarrhea and 
abdominal discomfort. 
x Evaluating subject safety including assessmen t of AEs for seriousness, severity, and 
causality. 
x Informing the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
of AEs as required and SAEs as per IRB/IEC guidelines. 
For the purpose of this study, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
who was administered study drug, regardless of its  causal relationship to  the study drug. An AE 
can, therefore, be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an  abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with  the use of the study drug, whether or not it is 
considered related to the study drug. 
An SAE is any AE regardless of causality that: 
x Results in death. 
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 66 of 80 
 x Is life threatening. Life threatening means that the subject was at  immediate risk of 
death from the adverse event as it occu rred. This does not include an event that, 
hypothetically had it occurred in a more se vere form, it might have caused death.  
x Requires inpatient hospitaliza tion or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization; hospital 
admissions and/or surgical operations sche duled to occur during the study period, but 
planned before study entry are not considered  AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the subject was enrolled in the st udy, provided that it di d not worsen in any 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surg ery performed earlier than planned). 
x Results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity. Disabil ity is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
x Is associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
x Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life threat ening, or require hos pitalization but may be considered an 
SAE when, based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the definition of an SAE. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, convulsions that  do not result in inpati ent hospitalization, and the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) (serious  or non-serious) is one of  scientific and medical 
concern specific to the produc t or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to  the sponsor is appropriate. 
In this protocol, an invasive infection (e.g., bact eremia, abscess, meningitis) is designated as an 
AESI, and as such, will be reported and followed in the same manner as an SAE during the course 
of the study. 
All AEs, including SAEs and AESIs, will be graded for severity by using common terminology 
criteria for adverse events' ( Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) 
Publish Date: May 28, 2009 with the exception of diarrhea .  Criteria for diarrhea severity will be 
as follows:   
x mild: 3-4 unformed bowel movements per day 
x moderate: 5-6 unformed bowel movements per day 
x VHYHUHXQIRUPHGERZHOPRYHPHQWVSHUGD\  
 
In general, the severity of AEs can be assessed using following guidelines: Severity Description 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms ; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive in tervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living*

Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 67 of 80 
  Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threaten ing; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabli ng; limiting self-care activities of daily living 
(ADL)** 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or  clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. **Self-care ADL refer to bath ing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, a nd not bedridden. Changes in  the severity of an 
AE will be documented, and documentation will in clude assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of intensity. Adverse events charact erized as intermittent will be documented based 
on the severity, onset, and duration of each episode. 
An abnormal laboratory test finding that meets any of the criteria below will be considered an AE: 
x Is associated with accompanying symptoms; 
x Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
x Leads to a concomitant drug treatment or any change in a concomitant medication or 
therapy; 
x Is considered an AE by the investigator. 
Laboratory results that fall outside  the reference range and do not meet one of the criteria above 
will not be reported as AEs. Repeating a test becau se of an abnormal result, in the absence of the 
above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an 
error will not be re ported as an AE. 
For all AEs, including SAEs, the investigator will report on the re lationship of the AE to the study 
drug by using the following definitions: 
x Unrelated : There is little or no chance that the study drug caused the AE; other 
conditions, including concurrent illnesses, pr ogression or expression of the disease 
state, or a reaction to a concomitant  medication best explain the event 
x Related  or Possibly Related : The association of the AE with the study drug is 
unknown; however, the AE is not clearly du e to another condition, or a reasonable 
temporal association exists between the AE  and treatment administration and, based on 
the investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the AE with the study drug 
seems likely 
Adverse events, including local and systemic reac tions not considered medi cally serious, will be 
recorded. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, investigator 
assessment of severity, relationship to study drug, date of resolution  of the event, seriousness, and 
outcome. Additionally, serious criteria  will be collected for all SAEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time th at the subject is screened will be considered as 
a baseline condition and not be reported as an AE. However, if it worsens at any time during the 
study, it should be recorded as an AE.

required) should NOT be entered as  an AE. Events of diarrhea that are not associated with CDI 
recurrence (e.g., due to food poisoni ng or flu), should be reported as an AE (e.g., Diarrhea [Not 
CDI related]). Other symptoms associated with  CDI recurrence, e.g. abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, should be report ed as adverse events. 
When CDI recurrence is deemed se rious due to hospitalization, CD I recurrence should be included 
as an SAE  term and recorded as the reason for hospita lization in the Hospitalization CRF page. 
11.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
The sponsor has requirements for expedited repor ting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to 
worldwide regulatory authorities. Therefore, the sponsor (or sponso r’s designee) must be notified 
immediately regarding any SAE that occurs  after administration of the study drug. 
All SAEs must be reported to the medical monito r within 24 hours of know ledge of the event at 
the study site. Refer to the Investigator Site File for deta iled instructions. 
The study site will tr ansmit an SAE report (SAE R) to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee by 
facsimile or email. The study site will be prov ided with SAER forms wherein the following 
information is requested: 
x Subject identification, investigator name, and study site number 
x SAE information: event term, onset date, se verity, and causal relationship to study drug 
x The outcomes attributable to the event (i.e. serious criteria) (e.g., de ath, life threatening, 
inpatient hospitalization, prolongation of  existing hospitaliz ation, a congenital 
anomaly, a persistent or significant disability  or incapacity, or ot her important medical 
event) 
x A summary of relevant test results, pertin ent laboratory data, a nd any other relevant 
medical history 
x The date of study drug administration 
x Whether or not the stud y drug was discontinued 
x Supplemental information, which may incl ude the following hospital records: 
laboratory results, radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room 
notes, holding and observation notes, discharg e summaries, autopsy reports, and death 
certificates 
In addition, relevant eCRF pages should be ap pended to communicate re levant study drug and 
subject outcome information. 
The SAER should be faxed or emailed within 24 hours with as much of the above information as 
available at the time. The following minimum information is required for an initial SAE report: subject identification, reporting so urce (i.e., Site Name and Site Number), and an event or 
outcome. Supplemental information may be tr ansmitted by using a follow-up report and should 
not delay the initial report. The sponsor may contac t the study site to solic it additional information 
or follow-up on the event.

 x Safety Population. The Safety Population w ill consist of all en rolled subjects who 
received any amount of SER-109. All safety  analyses will be conducted based on the 
Safety Population. 
12.3. Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 30 subjects are anticipated to enroll from SERES-012 (Cohort 1). The recurrence 
rates prior to 8 weeks after initiation of study drug assumed in SERES-012 are 16% in SER109 
and 36% in placebo. However, it is expected that only a fraction of subjects who recur in SERES-
012 prior to 8 weeks will roll-ove r to this study, since a follow-up of 8 weeks from start of study 
drug in earlier protocol versions of SERES-012  (up through and including Amendment 5) was 
required before rolling over to SERES-013, regardle ss of when the CDI recurrence occurred in 
SERES-012. Additionally, 200 subjects with RCDI may enroll in the Open-Label program (Cohort 
2) into SERES-013. Approximately 230 subjects total will be assessed for safety and tolerability, 
and efficacy. 
12.4. General Statistical Considerations 
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers a nd percentages for dichot omous or categorical 
variables, and the numbers, mean s, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for 
continuous variables will be provided. Listings of  individual subject data will be produced.  
All summary tables will be presented based on the following groups: For Cohort 1, 1) Subjects 
who were randomized to SER-109 in SERES-012, 2)  Subjects who were randomized to placebo 
in SERES-012, 3) Overall (groups 1 and 2 combined ).  For Safety and To lerability and Primary 
Efficacy, summary tables will include an additi onal fourth group consisting of Cohort 2 . The 
safety summary will be presented combining all subjects (pooling c ohort 1 and cohort 2). 
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP ) will be submitted to regulatory authorities. 
12.5. Subject Population and Baseline Characteristics 
Enrollment, protocol deviations, and discontinuations from the st udy will be summarized by group 
for the ITT Population. Demographics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, sex), ba seline characteristics 
(e.g., weight,), medical history, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by group for 
the Safety, ITT and mITT Populations. 
12.6. Study Drug Exposure 
SER-109 exposure will be summarized as the tota l number of capsules taken with counts and 
percentages of subjects by group. The summary will be presented for the Safety, ITT, and mITT 
Populations.  
12.7. Efficacy Analysis 
12.7.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
For Cohort 1, the primary efficacy endpoint is the recurrence of CDI up to Week 8 in the ITT 
Population. Subjects will be categorized as ha ving favorable (no CDI recurrence or sustained 
clinical response) or unfavorable outcomes (had  CDI recurrence). The number and percentage of

 subjects defined as having favorable (sustained  clinical response) a nd unfavorable (had CDI 
recurrence) outcomes will be reported with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each group. 
The CIs will be derived using the Clopper-Pearson exact method ( Clopper and Pearson, 1934 ). 
Subjects who are lost to follow-up, terminated the tr ial early, or died withou t a recorded recurrence 
of CDI before Week 8 will be defined as having an unfavorable outcome fo r the primary analysis. 
Subjects who miss any contact with the site (phone calls or the Week 2 visit) before Week 8 but

will be defined as having a favorable outcome (o r sustained clinical response) for the primary 
analysis. Additional rules for imputing CDI recurr ence status for subjects with at least one 
component of the CDI recurrence endpoint criter ia missing will be provided in the SAP.  
For Cohort 2. the efficacy endpoint is the recurre nce of CDI up to Week  8 or 12 in the ITT 
Population. Subjects will be categorized as havi ng favorable (no CDI recurrence or sustained 
clinical response) or unfavorable outcomes (had  CDI recurrence). The number and percentage of 
subjects defined as having favorable (sustained  clinical response) a nd unfavorable (had CDI 
recurrence) outcomes will be reported with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each group. 
The CIs will be derived using the Clopper-Pearson exact method ( Clopper and Pearson, 1934 ). For 
the Week 8 analysis, subjects who are lost to follow -up, terminated the trial early, or died without 
a recorded recurrence of CDI before Week 8 will be  defined as having an unfavorable outcome for 
the efficacy analysis. Subjects who miss any contact wi th the site (phone calls or the Week 2 visit)

for subjects with at least one component of the CDI recurrence endpoint criteria missing will be 
provided in the SAP. 
12.7.2.  Sensitivity Analysis for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary effi cacy endpoint as described in Section 12.7.1  will also be 
conducted as follows:  
x For Cohort 1, all subjects who are lost to follow-up, terminated the study prematurely, 
or died without having a CDI recurrence by Week 8, will be considered to have a 
favorable outcome (sustained clinical response). Subjects who missed any contact with 
the site before Week 8 (phone calls or th e Week 2 visit) but who do not report 2 or

Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 73 of 80 
 12.7.3.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis (applies to Cohort 1 only) 
Time to recurrence of CDI will be summarized by group for the ITT and mITT Populations using 
the median, 25th and 75th percentiles from a Kaplan Meier- analysis. The 95% CI for the median 
will also be provided. Subjects who complete th e follow-up period and do not experience a CDI 
recurrence by the end of the follow- up period will be censored on the date of last contact. Subjects 
who are lost to follow-up or who terminated the study prematurely before experiencing a CDI 
recurrence will be censored in the analysis on the date of last contact. Subjects who die before 
having a CDI recurrence will be censored on the date of death. Subjects who were assessed to have a CDI recurrence due to missing or incomplete data  for one or more of the 3 components of CDI 
recurrence will not be counted as an event, but cens ored on their last date of contact. Subjects who 
were not dosed will have their time to recurrence measured from their enrollment date. 
12.8. Exploratory Analysis 
The exploratory endpoints will  be summarized descriptively for the mITT populations. Mean, 
median, standard deviation, maximum and minimu m will be presented for continuous variable. 
Count, Percentage and total will be presented fo r categorical variables. More details of the 
exploratory efficacy e ndpoints will be specified in the SAP. 
12.9. Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be conduc ted in the Safety Population.  All safety summary tables will be 
presented for the following groups: 1) Cohort 1 2)  Cohort 2 3) all subjects pooling Cohorts 1 and 
2.  Any additional analyses w ill be detailed in the SAP. 
Adverse events will be coded by using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Summary tables of TEAEs will be pr ovided. A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, 
increased in frequency, or worsened in severity after initiation of SER-109. A listing of all AEs, 
including those occurring before the start of study drug, will be provided. The percentage of 
patients with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term on Day 10, Week 
2, Week 8 and Week 24. The incidence of TEAEs by system organ class and preferred term, by 
severity, and by relationship to treatment on Da y 10, Week 2, Week 8 and Week 24 will also be 
presented. Tables of any TEAE leading to SE R-109 discontinuation and SAEs will also be 
provided.   
An additional analysis will determine the incide nce of TEAEs based on the number of days the 
patients were followed before receiving antibiotics for treatment of recurrent CDI. The incidence 
of TEAEs per patient for days before receiving antibiotics will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term, and by severity and relationship to  treatment.   
Descriptive statistics of the laboratory paramete rs and vital sign measurements will be presented 
for all study visits at which they were collecte d. The change from Baseline to each post-baseline 
visit and to the overall worst post-baseline value will also be summarized. Laboratory parameters 
will be defined, as within or outside normal limits, and shift tables from baseline to each 
postbaseline visit will be provided.

 12.10.  Handling of Missing Data 
Every effort will be made to collect all data at specified times, according to the schedule of study 
events.  
For the primary endpoint in Cohort 1, subjects w ho are lost-to-follow-up, terminated from the 
study prematurely, or died without a CDI recurrence before 8 weeks after treatment are defined as 
having an unfavorable outcome for the primary an alysis. Subjects who miss any contact with the 
site before Week 8 (phone calls or  Week 2 visit) but who do not report 2 or more consecutive days 
ZLWK  3 unformed stools at the subsequent telephone  contact or by Week 8 will be defined as 
having a favorable outcome for the primary analysis . If the Week 8 visit is  missed, a subject will 
be considered as having an unfavorable outcome for the primary analysis if he reports 2 or more FRQVHFXWLYHGD\VZLWK  3 unformed stools at the next unmisse d telephone contact or  visit. If any 
of the 3 components of the CDI recurrence criteria is missin g, and the non-missing components 
meet the CDI recurrence criteria, then an unfavorab le outcome for the primary analysis is imputed. 
However, if some of the 3 components of the CDI recurrence criteria are mi ssing, and at least 1 of 
the non-missing components does not meet the CDI recurrence criteria, then  a favorable outcome 
for the primary analysis is imputed. The imputed recurrence status for subjects who have at least 
one component of the CDI recurrence endpoint cr iteria missing will be detailed in the SAP. 
For the efficacy endpoints determined at 2 timepoi nts in Cohort 2, subjects who are lost-to-follow-
up, terminated from the study prematurely, or di ed without a CDI recurr ence before 8 (or 12) 
weeks after treatment are define d as having an unfavorable outco me for the primary analysis. 
Subjects who miss any contact with the site befo re Week 8 (or 12) (phone calls) but who do not

Week 8 (or 12) visit is missed, a subject will be considered as ha ving an unfavorable outcome for 
the primary analysis if he repo UWVRUPRUHFRQVHFXWLYHGD\VZLWK  3 unformed stools at the next 
unmissed telephone contact or visit. If any of th e 3 components of the CDI recurrence criteria is 
missing, and the non-missing components meet the CDI recurrence criteria, then an unfavorable 
outcome for the primary analysis is imputed.
 
Missing data for the time to CDI recurrence analyses  will be handled with censoring by the Kaplan-
Meier method. Subjects who complete the study and do not expe rience a CDI r ecurrence by the 
end of the follow-up period will be censored on the da te of last contact. Subjects who are lost to 
follow-up or who terminate the trial prematurel y before experiencing a CDI recurrence will be 
censored on the date of last contact. Subjects wh o die before experiencing  a CDI recurrence will 
be censored on their date of deat h. Subjects who were assessed to have a CDI recurrence due to 
missing or incomplete data for one or more of the 3 components of CDI recurrence will not be 
counted as an event, but censored on their last date  of contact. Sensitivity analyses of the time to 
recurrence endpoint will be  provided in the SAP. 
No other imputations for missing da ta will be made (except as detailed in the SAP for missing 
dates and times).

Data will be collected for this study by using an  eCRF. The investigator and study site staff will 
receive training and support on th e use of the eCRF. All eCRF da ta are to be completed by the 
study coordinator or other designate d study site personnel. All data entry, modi fication, or deletion 
will be recorded automatically in the electronic  audit trail. All data changes will be clearly 
indicated with a means to locate prior values. A unique user identification and password will be 
assigned to all personnel approved to enter or cha nge data to prevent unauthorized access to the 
data.  
All electronic data entered by the study site (inclu ding the electronic audit trai l) will be maintained 
or made available at the study site in complianc e with Title 21 Part 11 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and other applic able retention regulations. The computerized system is able to 
generate accurate and complete copies of record s in paper or electronic form for inspection and 
review by applicable regul atory authorities, the IRB/IEC/Resear ch Ethics Board, and auditors or 
other designees authorized by the sponsor.  
In addition to capturing the user identification as pa rt of the audit trail for all data entry, the eCRF 
allows for application of electr onic signatures. The investigator or designated sub--investigator, 
after review of the data in the eCRF, will confirm the validity of each  subject’s data by electronic 
signature. This electronic signature will be certified as outlined in 21 CFR Part 11. 
The sponsor will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail. An electroni c or certified paper copy 
of all completed eCRF data, including query re solution correspondence, will be provided to the 
investigator at the end of the study.

ConfidentialPROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Amendment -01
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
The main reason for this protocol amendment is to modify the enrollment strategy , as described in the Summary  of Changes T able, 
with the aim of shortening the overall enrollment timelines.
Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations, the Sponsor considers it unlikely  that a dose modification will be n eeded 
within an age cohort, and therefore the initially  planned pause in enrollment after 12 participants have a complete set of PK samples in 
Panel A of an age cohort has been removed. Patients will continue to be enrolled in Panel A 
until the PK analy sis is completed , and 
the dose has been confirmed, enrollment in Panel B of the age cohort will commence.  Furthermore, the Sponsor co nsiders it unlikely  
that PK data from Pa nel A of Age Cohort 1 (12 to <18 years of age) will result in a modification of the planned dose (10mg/kg) for 
Age Cohort 2 (1 to <12 years of age), and therefore enrollment in Panel A of Age Cohort 2 will commence after the first 12 
participants in Panel A of Age Cohort 1 hav e completed all study  visits.  There is no change in the 2 planned evaluations of safet y data 
to be conducted b y the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after the first 12 participants in Age Cohort 1 complete the stud y and after 
the first 12 participants in Age Cohort 2 complete the study .
Additional changes have been made as well, as outlined in the Summary  of Changes table.

Plan Summary
10.5.3 – Efficacy  
PopulationThe enrollment strategy  has been 
modified as follows :
Enrollment into Age Cohort 2 will be 
initiated after 12participants in Age 
Cohort 1 
Panel A have completed all 
study  visits. The initial dose for Age 
Cohort 2 will be 10 mg/kg.
Enrollment into Panel A of each age 
cohort will not be paused during the 
time PK assessments in each age
cohort are conducted.This change will shorten the overall enrollment period by  
removing the enrollment pauses that were initially  planned
for the PK evaluation and the DMC safet y review .  Blinded 
safet y information from the trial is reviewed b y the 
Sponsor on an ongoing basis to identify  any unexpected 
safet y findings ;therefore, s afety oversight will not be 
impa cted.An evaluation of safet y data from the first 12
participants in each age cohort who complete the study  will 
still be conducted by
 the DMC as planned in the original 
version of the protocol.
Based on the adult population PK studies, neither intrinsic 
factors (including age) nor extrinsic factors affect the 
efficacy  or safet y of bezlotoxumab. The weight -based dose 
(10mg/kg) adequately  controls for differences in 
bezlotoxumab pharmacokinetics related to bod y weight.  
An evaluation of PK data from approxi mately 12
participants in each age cohort who provide all 
protocol -required serum samples for PK anal ysis will still 
be performed to determine if dose modifications are 
needed for that age cohort. Enrollment into Panel A will 
continue while this evaluation is performed, as it is 
unlikely  that the doses will need to be modified in the older 
age cohort based on the age range, mechanism of action, 
PK properties, and/or the established exposure- response 
relationships. Moreover, it is unlikely  that data from 12 to 
<18-year-old adolescents will inform dosing information in 
the y ounger age cohort.  Thus, there is no need to wait for 
the PK evaluation in the older cohort before initiating 
enrollment in the y ounger cohort.

6.1 –Inclusion Criteria
Appendix 5 –
Contraceptive Guidance 
and Pregnancy  TestingAdded language to clarify that 
contraception methods classified as 
“acceptable” (ie, with a failure rate of 
>1% per year when used consistently  
and correctl y) are sufficient for use 
in this study .This change was made to ensure it is clear that 
agreement to use a highly  effective method of 
contraception is not required to participate in this 
study .
Added language in Table 14 to 
specify  that acceptable contraceptive 
methods include progestogen -only
oral hormonal contraception, where 
inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary  mode of action.This change was made to allow for the use of 
progestogen-onl y oral hormonal contraception, where 
inhibition of ovulation is not the primary  mode of 
action, as an acceptable contraceptive method, in 
accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
(CTFG) guidelines.
Deleted the sentence in the Note in 
the Table 14 footnotes that stated, 
“Use should be consistent with local 
regulations regarding the use of 
contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies.”Note was deleted to remove potential ambiguit y about 
the choice of stud y-permitted contraceptive measures.
Corrected footnote “a” in Table 14 as 
follows: “Ty pical use failure rates are 
lower higher than perfect- use failure 
rates…”This change was made to correct a t ypo.
Deleted footnote “b” from Table 14, 
which stated, “ If hormonal 
contraception efficacy  is potentially  
decreased due to interaction with 
study  treatment, condoms must be 
used in addition to the hormonal 
contraception during the treatment This footnote does not apply  to this study  treatment, as 
there is no known or expected interaction between 
bezlotoxumab and hormonal contraception.

period and for at least 12 weeks  after 
the last dose of study  treatment.”
Deleted footnote “c” from Table 14, 
which stated, “ If locall y required, in 
accordance with Clinical Trial 
Facilitation Group (CTFG) 
guidelines, acceptable hormonal 
contraceptives are limited to those 
which inhibit ovulation.”This footnote does not apply  to this study  treatment.
6.2 –Exclusion Criteria Added exclusion of potential participants 
with a known hy persensitivity  to an y 
ingredients of bezlotoxumab.This revision was implemented for consistency  with the 
prescribing information in some markets that 
contraindicate the use of bezlotoxumab in patients with 
known hy persensitivity  to any  of the ingr edients .

6.2 –Exclusion Criteria
7.7 – Concomitant TherapyRemoved 
intravenous immune globulin 
(IVIG) as an excluded prior and 
concomitant treatment.IVIG was originally  excluded because this treatment 
contains a broad spectrum of antibodies and theref ore has 
the theoretical potential to impact efficacy  outcomes. 
However, efficacy  is not the primary  objective of this 
study , and participants who have received or may
 receive 
IVIG may still benefit from receiving bezlotoxumab.
Excluding patients who have r eceived IVIG butwould 
otherwise be eligible decreases the pool of potential 
participants because some types of pediatric patients who 
have CDI receive IVIG due to their underl ying condition. 
There are no anticipated safet y concerns with the use of 
bezloto xumab in participants who have received or will 
concomitantly  receive IVIG .
Asupportive anal ysis of efficacy  outcomes in an Efficacy  
Evaluable population has been added in this amendment; 
this population will exclude, among others, participants 
who receive IVIG .
6.2 –Exclusion Criteria Clarified that surgery  for CDI  exclusion 
criterion is specific to surgery  for the 
current CDI episodeClarified so that participants who had surgery  in the past 
for a prior episode of CDI are not excluded.
10.1 –Statistical Analy sis 
Plan Summary
10.5.3 – Efficacy  
PopulationAdded an Efficacy  Evaluable population. Added such that supportive anal yses of efficacy  endpoints 
can be conducted in a subset of participants who donot 
have an y important protocol deviations that may
 impact 
efficacy  results (specific deviations will be determined 
prior to final unblinding of the database) or require any 
prior or concomitant treatment with IVIG.

9 –Study  Assessments and 
ProceduresUpdated approximate total blood volume 
to be drawn over the 12 weeks of the trial 
from 21.5 mL  to 29 mL.Corrected to align wi th increased volume required for PK 
blood samples. The need for increased volume was 
identified after finalizing the original protocol and before 
enrolling the first participant in the trial.The maximum 
blood volume collected from each participant should be 
based on weight and should generall y not exceed 1% of 
total blood volume on any  1 day  or 3% of total blood 
volume (2.4 mL  blood per kg of body  weight) during a 
given 4 -week trial period, unless appropriate justification is 
documented b y the investigator .
9.3.5 –Disease -Related 
Events and/or Disease -
Related Outcomes Not 
Qualifying as AEs or SAEsSpecified that Clostridium difficile
infection (CDI)recurrence is not 
considered a reportable safet y event 
unless it meets one or more SAE criteria .CDI recurrence is being monitored as an efficacy  endpoint 
and therefore does not also need to be reported as a 
nonserious AE .
9.3.7 – Events of Clinical 
Interest (ECI)Specified that the ECI definition
regarding AST, ALT ,and bilirubin 
elevations is limited to postbaseline 
abnormalities that were not present at 
baseline or are clinically  significantl y 
worse than they  were at baseline (as 
determined by the investigator) .Revised because participants with hepatic impairment are 
allowed to enroll in the trial , so it is important to clarify  
that baseline AST or ALT elevations will not be 
considered ECIs unless they  clinically  significantly  worsen 
at a postbaseline time point .
2 –Schedule of Activities Added weight measurement to screening 
visit.Added to ensure adequate drug supply at site for future 
randomization and treatment.
6.1 –Inclusion Criteria
9.2.2 –Daily  Diary  Specified that watery  diarrhea 
corresponds to Bristol Stool Scale ty pes 
6 or 7.Revised for clarity .

Antibac terial Drug 
Treatment for CDIClarified that an y interruptions (ie, not 
just those >1 calendar day) in the

plan require documentation on the eCRF.Revised for clarity .
9.1.11 –Calibration of 
EquipmentRevised text and r emoved list of critical 
equipment.Textual revisions were applied to clarify  investigator 
responsibility  for calibration and maintenance of study  
equipment.
9.2.1.1 –Assessment of 
Disease SeverityRevised definition of hy poalbuminemia 
from <20 mg to <2 g/dL. Revision made to correct an inaccuracy .
12.2 –Appendix 2: Clinical 
Laboratory  TestsRemoved % reticulocy tes and 
phosphorous from the list of laboratory  
parameters.These parameters are not needed for assessment of 
bezlotoxumab safety  and tolerability  or for assessment of 
CDI.

Protocol Title:  
A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safet y, 
Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy  of a Single Infusion of Bezlotoxumab (MK -
6072, Human Monoclonal Antibody  to C. difficile Toxin B) in Children Aged 1 to <18 
Years Receiving Antibacterial Drug Treatment for C. difficile Infection (MODIFY III)
Short Title: 
Bezlotoxumab (MK -6072) versus placebo in children with CDI: MODIFY III
Objectives/Hypothes es and Endpoints :
The following objectives and endpoints will be evaluated in pediatric participants aged 1 
year to <18 y ears who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment for Clostridium difficile
infection (CDI):
Objective/Hypothesis Endpoint
Primary
1)Objective: To characterize bezlotoxumab 
pharmacokinetics (PK) in 2 age cohorts 
(Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 y ears; Age 
Cohort 2: 1 to <12 y ears) of pediatric 
participants to support dose selection in 
this population.
Hypothesis: The area under the 
concentration -time curve from 0 to 
infinity  (AUC 0-inf)of bezlotoxumab after 
treatment of 2 age cohorts of pediatric 
participants (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 
years; A geCohort 2: 1 to <12 y ears)
with a single infusion of bezlotoxumab is 
similar when compared to the AUC 0-infof 
bezlotoxumab after treatment of adult 
participants with a single infusion of 
10mg/kg bezlotoxumab, a dose 
demonstrated to be safe and efficacious 
in adults. That is, the true geometric 
mean ratios ( GMRs, pediatric 
participants/adults) for AUC 0-infof 
bezlotoxumab are contained in the 
clinical comparability  bounds of (0.6, 
1.6)in each of the age cohorts.The AUC 0-inf will be determined for 
each age cohort from bezlotoxumab 
serum concentration data.

Confidential3.Introduction
Study Rationale 
This trial is intended to determine a dosing recommendation for bezlotoxumab in the 
pediatric population and will evaluat ebezlotoxumab pharmacokinetics (PK), safet y, 
tolerability , and efficacy in children with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The proposed 
trial will randomize children aged 1to <18 y ears of age with a confirmed diagnosis of CDI
who are receiving antibacterial drug t reatment for CDI .Infants less than 1 year of age will 
not be evaluated due to challenges with accurate CDI diagnoses; during the first y ear of life, 
up to 70% of children have detectable levels of C. difficile in their stool y et are 
asymptomatic , and there is no evidence of an epidemiologic association between colonization
and disease during this timeframe [Bryant, K. 2009] .
The primary  objective sof thistrial are to evaluate the PK, safet y,and tolerability of 
bezlotoxumab ,and secondary  objective sare to estimate the rate sof CDI recurrence and 
sustained clinical response through 12 weeks following a single -dose infusion in participants 
with CDI  aged 1 year to <18 y ears. 
Background
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background 
information on bezlotoxumab .
Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
C. difficile is an anaerobic, spore -forming gram- positive bacillus that produces toxin A and 
toxin B [Voth, D. E. and Ballard, J. D. 2005] [Warny , Michel, et al 2005] . CDI  occurs when 
toxigenic strains of C. difficile , either endogenous to the colon or exogenously acquired, 
flourish after disruption of the normal bact erial colonic flora – typicall y following exposure 
to antibiotics that alter the endogenous micro -ecology  of the gut –and thus lead to clinically  
significant disease. The laboratory diagnosis of CDI requires the demonstration of toxigenic 
C. difficile or its toxins in stool. A number of diff erent tests are used, including enzyme-
linked immunoassay s (EIAs) for toxins A and B; cell culture cytotoxicity  assay ; anaerobic 
culture followed b y toxin detection ; nucleic acid amplification tests using polymerase cha in 
reaction (PCR) ,which detect sthe gene for toxin B ; and EIA for the C. difficile common 
antigen glutamate deh ydrogenase ,which is ty pically  followed b y either a toxin test ora PCR 
test[Crobach, M. J., et al 2016] . 
CDI represents an important medical and health care burden. The incidence, severit y, rate of 
complications (eg ,ileus, toxic megacolon ), and mortality  of CDI in adults have increased 
dramaticall y in the US, Canada, and Europe over the last 10 -15years [Goorhuis, Abraham, et 
al 2008] [Gravel, Denise, et al 2009] [L oo, Vivian G., et al 2005] [Loo, Vivian G., et al 2006] 
[McDonald, L . Clifford, et al 2005] [Pepin, Jacques, et al 2005] . Similarly , CDI  incidence 
rates in pediatric patients have increased over time [Kim, Jason, et al 2008] [Zilberberg, M. 
D., et al 2010] . Based on the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and 
0869YY

Protocol/Amendment No.: 001-01 
MK-6072 -001-01 Final Protocol 07-Feb-2019
ConfidentialPrevention for 2011, the incidence of CDI in pediatric patient s was 24.2/100,000 population 
whereas the incidence in those >65 years of age was 627.7/100,000 [Lessa, F. C., et al 2015] . 
Theincreased incidence in adult and pediatric patients isattributable in part to the emergence 
of the NAP1/BI/027 epidemic/hy pervirulent strain [Kim, Jason, et al 2008] [Freeman, J., et al 
2010]. 
The r isk factors for CDI in pediatric patients appear similar to those for adults (eg, antibiotic 
use, multiple antibiotics use, and longer duration of hospital stay ). In pediatric patients, CDI 
is also strongl y associated with additional factors, namely malign ancy , inflammatory  bowel 
disease (IBD), and immune suppression [Pant, Chaitany a, et al 2013] [Hojsak, I., et al 2012] 
[Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra, et al 2012] [Enoch, D. A., et al 2011] . The CDI risk appears to 
be highest in pediatric patients with malignancy  [Enoch, D. A., et al 2011] [de Blank, P., et al 
2013] [Price, Victoria, et al 2013] [Tai, E., et al 2011] . A case control study identified 
additional risk factors for pediatric CDI that include solid organ transplant, presence of 
gastrostom y or jejunostomy  tube, receipt of fluoroquinolones
, and lack of prior 
hospitalizati on;however ,the last of these may  be a result of control subjects who were 
hospitalized [Sandora, T. J., et al 2011] .In children, the majority  of cases of CDI are 
community -onset or community -acquired [McFarland, L . V., et al 2016] [ Lo Vecchio, A., et 
al 2016] .
Symptoms of pediatric CDI include fever, profuse diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, 
abdominal distension, leukocy tosis, volume depletion, electroly te imbalance, and 
occasionally, pseudomembranous colitis. Most cases of pediatric CDI are ty picall y mild in 
severit y and self -limiting in nature. However, moderate to severe CDI does occur in pediatric 
patients and accumulating evidence indicates that hospital- onset pediatric CDI  is associated 
with incr eased risk of death, longer length of stay , and higher costs as compared to 
community -onset CDI in children [Sammons, Julia Shaklee, et al 2013] .  
Treatment of pediatric patients with moderate to severe CDI typ ically involves 
discontinuation of predisposing antibiotics, supportive measures, and initiating antimicrobial 
therap y directed against C. difficile [Cooperstock, M. S., et al 2012] . Both metronidazole and 
oral vancom ycin have been used as standard-of- care regimens to treat pediatric CDI  
[McFarland, L. V., et al 2016] [American Academy  of Pediatrics 2015]. Fidaxomicin is a 
newer antibiotic ,which received approv al in 2011 in the US and other countries for treatment 
of CDI in adults ; however, its safet y and efficacy have not yet been established in pediatric 
patients.  
One of the key  challenges in the clinical management of CDIs in adults and children is to 
reduce the incidence of recurrent CDI; such recurrences in pediatric patients have been 
treated with tapered/pulsed administration of oral vancom ycin, vancomycin followed b y 
rifaximin, intravenous ( IV)immunoglobulin, and therapy  with other microorganisms ,
including fecal m icrobiota transplantation (FMT) [Kelly , Ciaran P. and LaMont, J. Thomas 
2008] . The available limited da ta for pediatric CDI recurrence rates ranges from 7.5% to 
38%, which is similar to that seen in adults [Lo Vecchio, A., et al 2016] [Kelsen, J. R., et al 
2011] [Mezoff, E., et al 2011] .

ConfidentialBezlotoxumab ( MK-6072) is a fully  human monoclonal antibod y(mAb) that bind sto and 
neutralize s C. difficile toxin B. I n Phase 3 trials in adults with CDI , bezlotoxumab
significantl y reduced CDI recurrence compared to placebo [Wilcox, M. H., et al 2017] . 
Bezlotoxumab is currently approved for use in adults for the reduction (United States) or 
prevention (European Union) of CDI recurrence in patients who are receiving antibacterial 
drug treatment for CDI and are at a high risk for CDI  recurrence .Aside from bezlotoxumab, 
noother therapeutic or prophy lactic biological agents or drugs to prevent CDI recurrences 
have been licensed to date, and bezlotoxumab is not approved for use in pediatric 
populations .In the context of the worsening CDI epidemic, there remain
sanunmet medical 
need for therapies to prevent CDI  recurrence in the pediatric population .
Bezlotoxumab does not have antimicrobial activity and does not take the place of a ntibiotic 
therap y for CD I. Moreover, bezlotoxumab does not impact the initial efficacy  of the 
antibiotics that are used to treat CDI because it is administered after the toxins have alread y 
caused damage to the gut lining and after antibiotics have alread ysignificantly  reduced the 
amount of toxin present in the colon. When administered concurrentl y with antibacterial drug 
treatments for CDI (metronidazole, oral vancomycin, or fidaxomicin in adults), 
bezlotoxumab prevents recurrent infections b y providing passive immunity against C. 
difficile toxin B produced by  the outgrowth of persistent or newly  acquired spores, thereb y 
preventing new or further damage to the gut epithelium.
In order to determine a dosing recom mendation for the pediatric population , the current trial 
was designed to assess the safet y, tolerability, and PKof bezlotoxumab, and to estimate the 
efficacy  of bezlotoxumab in participants 1to <18 y ears of age .
Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials
Details of pre -clinical studies are described in the bezlotoxumab IB.
Seven adult clinical trials of bezlotoxumab alone or in combination with MK -3415
(actoxumab, mAb directed against C. difficile toxin A) have been completed and are 
described in the bezlotoxumab IB. There are no completed pediatric clinical trials at this 
time.
Ongoing Clinical Trials
There are no other ongoing adult or pediatric clinical trials involving bezlotoxumab at the
time of approval of this protocol .

Participant s will be receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI . Please see Section 7.1.1
for further details on antibacterial drug treatment (eg,doses and administration routes for 
metronidazole ,oral vancomy cin, or fidaxomicin) for this trial . The investigator should also

Benefit/Risk Assessment
It cannot be guaranteed that participant s in clinical t rials will directly  benefit from treatment 
during participation .In general, bezlotoxumab has a favorable risk- benefit profile and fulfil ls 
a significant unmet medical need for therapies to prevent CDI recurrence .
Efficacy  data from 2 adult Phase 3 trials demonstrate that a single infusion of bezlotoxumab 
(10mg/kg) given in combination with antibacterial drug treatment for CDI is superior to 
placebo in prevention of CDI  recurrence through a 12 -week at -risk period for recurrence, 
addressing an unmet medical need. The low incidence of CDI recurrence in the 
bezlotoxumab group and the treatment difference in CDI  recurrence between the 
bezlotoxumab and placebo groups were clinicall y meaningful and highly  consistent in each 
of the Phase 3 trials. The trials inclu ded a substantial number of participants (76%) with 1or 
more risk factors for CDI recurrence ; bezlotoxumab consistently  lowered CDI recurrence 
rates compared with placebo across subgroups at high risk for CDI recurrence .In addition, 
superior efficacy  of bezlotoxumab compared with placebo was demonstrated for the
secondary  endpoint of sustained cure in the integrated Phase 3 data. In an exploratory  
analysis of a subset of participants evaluated for up to 12 months following infusion of the 
trial medication ,no bezlotoxumab -treated participants who had achieved sustained cure at 
the end of the 12- week main trial experienced a CDI recurre nce in the subsequent 9 months, 
thereb yproviding evidence that the efficacy  of bezlotoxumab observed in the main trial was
due to prevention of CDI recurrence rather than a delay  in onset of a recurrent episode.
In the Phase 3 program, the safet y analysis was conducted using integrated data, in which 
786participants received bezlotoxumab, 777 participants received actoxumab + 
bezlotoxumab, and 781 participants received placebo . The totality  of the safety  data show 
that bezlotoxumab, when given with antibacterial drug treatment for CDI ,does not increase 
the risks associated with administration of antibacterial drug treatment for CDI  alone.
Bezlotoxumab has a very low potential for immunogenicity , and b ezlotoxumab 
administration did not result in the development of treatment -emergent anti -drug antibodies 
in the Phase 2 and 3 trials; it is therefore unlikel y that anti -drug antibodies will comprom ise 
efficacy  of the product.
The Sponsor considers that 10 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab is an appropriate starting dosage to 
provide the proper benefit:risk ratio evaluation in this trial based on the efficacy and sa fety 
profiles of bezlotoxumab as demonstrated in the Phase 3 trials for adults w ith CDI .As 
described elsewhere in the protocol (Section 5.1), provisions are in place to perform PK 
assessments of the 10 mg/kg dose of bezlotoxumab in Panel A of both a ge cohorts in the 
trial.
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participant s participating in this

Confidential4.Objecti ves/Hypotheses and Endpoints
The following objectives and endpoints will be evaluated in pediatric participants aged 1 y ear 
to <18 y earswho are receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI :
Objective/Hypothesis Endpoint
Primary
1)Objective: To characterize 
bezlotoxumab PK in 2 age cohorts (Age 
Cohort 1: 12 to <18 y ears; Age Cohort 
2: 1 to <12 y ears) of pediatric 
participants to support dose selection in 
this population
.
Hypothesis : The area under the 
concentration -time curve from 0 to 
infinity  (AUC 0-inf)of bezlotoxumab after 
treatment of 2 age cohorts of pediatric 
participants (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 
years; Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 y ears) 
with a single infusion of bezlotoxumab
is similar when compared to the AUC 0-
infof bezlotoxumab after treatment of 
adult participants with a single infusion 
of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab, a dose 
demonstrated to be safe and efficacious 
in adults. That is, the true geometric 
mean ratios ( GMRs, pediatric 
participants/adults) for AUC 0-infof 
bezlotoxumab are contained in the 
clinical comparability  bounds of (0.6, 
1.6)in each of the age cohorts.The AUC 0-inf will be determined for 
each age cohort from bezlotoxumab 
serum concentration data.
2)Objective: To evaluate the safet y and 
tolerability  of a single infusion of 
bezlotoxumab as compared with a single 
infusion of placebo through 12 weeks 
following infusion .Proportion of participants experiencing 
adverse events (AEs)

This is a Phase 3, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multi- site, double -blind 
trial evaluating the PK ,safet y, tolerability, and efficacy of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab 
in pediatric participants from 1to <18 y ears of age receiving antibacterial drug treatment for 
CDI.
Participants will be enrolled into 1 of the following 2 age cohorts:
Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years of age
Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of age

ConfidentialEnrollment into the trialwill begin with Age Cohort 1, and Age Cohort 2 will commence 
later; t he timing for enrollment into each age coho rt is described in Section 5.1.2.
Atscreening, e ligible 
participants must have suspected or confirmed CDI, as described in 
Section 6.1, and be receiving or planning to receive a 10 -to 21 -day course of antibacterial 
drug treatment for CDI (Section 7.1.1). 
Prior to randomization, participants
’diagnosi s of CDI  must be confirmed by  a positive stool 
test for C. difficile toxin (see Appendix 7 for assay requirements) . Once the CDI  diagnosis 
has been confirmed, p articipant swill be randoml y assigned to a treatment group in a 3:1 ratio
(bezlotoxumab:placebo) and will receive a single IV infusion of either bezlotoxumab or 
placebo (Day 1)
. Note that the participant must still be receiving antibacterial drug treatment 
for CDI on the day  of randomization/study  infusion. Throughout the protocol, timing of 
assessments expressed as s tudy day and study  week isrelative to receipt of study  infusion, 
which is Day 1.
After receiving the stud y infusion, participants will be followed for 12 weeks (ie, 85 ± 
5days)for collection of blood sample s for PK and immunogenicit y assessment sand 
monitoring of safet yand tolerability  parameters ( clinical and laboratory  AEs, vital sign
measurements , phy sical examinations) and signs and sy mptoms ( including clinical laboratory  
assessments, 
watery  diarrhea or unformed bowel movements [UBMs] , abdominal discomfort, 
and body  temperature) to assess efficacy  outcomes (including initial clinical response, 
diarrhea recurrence ,and CDI recurrence )
(Figure 1).
Each day  throughout the 12
-week follow -up period, participants or the participants’ parents 
or caregivers will record in a paper diary  whether the participant had watery  diarrhea or 
UBMs in the previous 24 hours. Ifthe participant has at least a single episode of watery  
diarrhea or UBMs, the participant or the participants’ parents or caregivers will record the 
number of episodes, the participant’s worst abdominal discomfort score, and the presence or 
absence of a fever (and the highest body  temp erature if a fever is present) during the previous 
24 hours. T he diary  will be used as a tool for the investigator to use when performing 
efficacy  outcome assessments and will be maintained as a source document. Daily  diary 
entries will not be entered into the electronic data collection (EDC) system , with the 
exception of the specific information noted in Section
9.2.5.2.
Trial personnel will contact the participant or the participant’s parent or c aregiver at the 
following time points during the stud y:
Approximately  24 hours after the end of the infusion to assess for infusion -related 
reactions. 
A
t least 3 times per week during antibacterial drug treatment for the baseline episode 
of CDI for assessment of antibacterial drug treatment compliance.

the daily  diary  is maintained by  the participant or the parent or caregiver and to 
remind them to collect a stool sample if the participant experiences watery  diarrhea 
(
if the child is using diapers or other fecal collection device) or 3or more UBMs 
within a 24- hour period .
The information communicated b y the participant or the parent or caregiver during the 
contact is to be recorded in the source documents.
Initial clinical response will be assessed by  the investigator approximately  48hours after the 
last dose of antibact erial drug treatment for the baseline episode of CDI (EOT Visit) , as 
described in Section 9.2.5.1 . 
Diarrhea recurrence and CDI  recurrence will be assessed by the investigator as described in 
Section 9.2.5.2 a t each scheduled visit that occurs after the EOT Visitand at any  unscheduled 
visits due to diarrhea . The investigator will review the diary  to assess whether the 
protocol -specified criteria fordiarrhea recurrence were met.If the criteria for diarrhea 
recurrence were met , a stool sample will be testedforC. difficile toxin ,and theinvestigator 
will record whether the criteria for a CDI recurrence have been met .
Sustained clinical response will be derived from the investigator assessment of initial clinical 
response and CDI recurrence, as descri bed in Section 10.4.3.
An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC )will be appointed and will review the 
safet y and tolerability data. There will be 2planned reviews b y the DMC , as described in 
Section 5.1.2, with additional information provided in Appendix 3.

Enrollment Strategy
Each age cohort will be enrolled in 2 panels (Panel A and Panel B), as shown in Figure 2. 
Enrollment will start with Age Cohort 1 participants . Enrollment into Age Cohort 2 Panel A 
will commence after approximately 12participants in Age Cohort 1 Panel A complete all 
study  visits . 
The starting dose of bezlotoxumab for both age cohorts in Panel A will be 10 mg/kg bod y 
weight, which is the dose that has been shown to be effective in reducing recurrent CDI in 
adults. 
When approximately 12 participants from Panel A of each age cohort have complete PK 
data, their PK data will be evaluated to determine whether dose modification is warranted for 
subsequent participants in the respective age cohort.

If the criterion described in Section 7.2 is met, then participants enrolled subsequent 
to the PK evaluation will continue to receive the same dose (10 mg/kg) used in 
Panel A.
If the criterion described in Section 7.2 is not met, t he bezlotoxumab dose will be 
modified as needed (see Section 7.2), and participants enrolled subsequent to the PK 
evaluation will receive the modified bezlotoxumab dose.
Enrollment into Panel A of each age cohort will continue until the PK assessment is co mplete

Number of Participants
In Panel A, for which the purpose is to determine the dose for each age cohort, a minimum of 
24participants across both age cohorts will be enrolled (Age Cohort 1 Panel A: 12 
participants [9 bezlotoxumab, 3 placebo]; Age Cohort 2 Panel A: 12 participants 
[9bezlotoxumab, 3 placebo]). 
The trial will continue until trial enrollment has reached a total of 192 participants who 
received the final age -appropriate dose (Table 1 ). If the dose needs to be modified for either 
age cohort, then additional par ticipants will be enrolled in Panel B in order to achieve a total 
of 192 participants who received the final age-appropriate dose .
There is no requirement to enroll an equal number of subjects across the 2 age cohorts.
However, a minimum of 24 participants will be required to be enrolled in each age cohort at 
the final age- appropriate dose as follows:
Age Cohort 1: 24 participants (18bezlotoxumab at the final age- appropriate dose , 
6placebo); 
Age Cohort 2: 24 participants ( 18bezlotoxumab at the final age- appropriate dose , 6 
placebo) , with a minimum of 12 participants ( 9 bezlotoxumab, 3 placebo )aged 1 to 
<6 years of age, and a minimum of 12 participants ( 9 bezlotoxumab, 3 placebo) aged 
6to <12 years of age .
If a dose modification is needed , the number of participants may  be adjusted in order to 
ensure 192 participants receive the final age -appropriate dose.

Beginning and End of Study Definition
The overall trial begins when the first participant signs the informed consent /assent form.  
The overall trial ends when the last participant completes the last study -related phone -call or 
visit, withdraws from the trial or is lost to follow -up (i.e. the participant is unable to be 
contacted b y the investigator).
Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:
1.If the extent (incidence and/or severit y) of emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that 
the risk/benefit ratio to the trial population as a whole is unacceptable.
2.At the recommendation of the DMC based on their evaluation of the ongoing st udy safet y 
data and the resultant risk/benefit assessment.
3.Further recruitment in the trial or at (a) particular trial site(s) may  be stopped due to 
insufficient compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP )and/or other 
applicable regulatory  requirements, procedure -related problems or the number of 
discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.
Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Rationale for Endpoints
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The AUC 0-infof bezlotoxumab will be evaluated following a single IVdose from samples 
collected at time points through 12 weeks after the infusion, as specified in Section 2 –
Schedule of Activities (SoA ). Based on the shape of the concentration -time profile in adults 
and experience with this sampling scheme in the Phase 3 trials, thechosen sampling time 
points are anticipated to provide sufficient data for estimation of AUC 0-inf. In addition, 
maximum concentration (C max), time of maximum concentration (T max), terminal h alf-life, 
volume (V dss), and clearance (Cl) will be evaluated for 
bezlotoxumab. These endpoints will 
be assessed for Panels A and B.
Safety Endpoints
The safet y and tolerability of bezlotoxumab will be primaril yassessed b y clinical and 
laboratory  AEs.
Bezlotoxumab is a mAb, and mAbs have been associated with acute hy persensitivity  
reactions, referred to hereafter as infusion- related reactions. Although these ty pes of 
reactions were not observed in participants who received bezlotoxumab alone or in 
combination with actoxumab in the adult Phase 3 trials, it is important to continue to evaluate 
the potential for infusion -related reactions in a pediatric population because it is difficult to

Protocol/Amendment No.: 001-01 
MK-6072 -001-01 Final Protocol 07-Feb-2019
Confidentialdetect potentially  serious but low -frequency  toxic effects . Therefor e,the potential for
bezlotoxumab to cause infusion- related reactions will be evaluated in the current trial 
(Section 9.3.7.1) . 
Efficacy Endpoints
The efficacy  endpoint s in this trial include the proportion of participants who have a CDI 
recurrence and the proportion of participants who achieve sustained clinical response within 
12weeks (Day  85 ± 5 day s) of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo . CDI  recurrence 
is assessed b y the investigator as defined in Section 9.2.5.2 , and sustained clinic al response is 
derived from the investigator’s assessment of initial clinical response and CDI  recurrence, as 
defined in Section 10.4.3 .
In the adult Phase 3 trials of bezlotoxumab, a follow -up period of 12weeks for CDI 
recurrence was sufficient to allow for robust demonstrat ionof the efficacy  of bezlotoxumab .  
In these trials, 71% of all recurrences occurred b y Week 4 while 29% of recurrences occurred 
in Weeks 5 through 12. In a subset of participants followed for 12 months, recurrences were 
rarely observed. Therefore , a minimum of a 12-week follow -up period is necessary  to allow 
for robust assessment of efficacy ,but a longer period is not warranted. A 12-week follow -up 
period will be used in this pediatric trial.
Planned Exploratory Bi omarker Research
Planned Genetic Analysis
Genetic variation may  impact a participant’s response to therap y, susceptibility  to, and 
severit y and progression of disease. Variable response to therap y ma y be due to genetic 
determinants that impact drug absorpt ion, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; 
mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subt ype of the disease 
being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and I RB/IEC allow, a sample will be 
collected for DNA anal ysis from c onsenting participants.
DNA samples will be used for research related to the study treatment(s), the disease under 
study  and related diseases. They  may  also be used to develop tests/assay s including 
diagnostic tests related to the disease under study, rela ted diseases and study  drug(s). Genetic 
research may  consist of the anal ysis of one or more candidate genes or the anal ysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome [or anal ysis of the entire genome] (as appropriate).
DNA samples will be analy zed for varia tion across the entire genome. Analy ses may  be 
conducted if it is hy pothesized that this may  help further understand the clinical data. 
The samples may  be analy zed as part of a multi -study  assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understa nd study  disease or related conditions.

Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct Future Biomedical Research on specimens consented for future 
biomedical research during this clinical trial.  This research may  include genetic analy ses 
(DNA), gene expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma) and/or 
the measurement of other anal ytes, depending on which specimens are consented for future 
biomedical research.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main trial) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriatel y consented participant s. The objective of collecting /retaining specimens for 
Future Biomedical Research is to explore and identify  biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such inf ormation to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that 
participant s receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time.  The 
details of this Future Biomedical Research sub -trial are presented in Appendix 6 –
Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research.
Rationale f or The Use of Comparator/Placebo
A placebo control treatment of either 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose will be included 
in the trial. These are the approved diluent sfor the preparation of the bezlotoxumab infusion 
solution. 
Importantly , all participants (regardless of treatment group assignment) enrolled in this trial 
will receive antibacterial drug treatment for CDI (Section 7.1.1) concurrent with 
administration of trial inf usion. Placebo participants will therefore be receiving current 
medically acceptable treatment for CDI. Use of a placebo allows for estimat ion of efficacy  of 
bezlotoxumab and a comparison for safet yassessments .
Justification for Dose
Starting Do se for This Trial
The initial dose of the single, IV infusion of bezlotoxumab to be administered to Panel A of 
each age cohort is 10 mg/kg bod y weight. This dose demonstrated superior efficacy  in 
prevention of CDI recurrence in the adult Phase 3 trials con ducte d among adults aged >18 
years. This dose was also generall y safe and well tolerated in adults . 
Bezlotoxumab is catabolized through protein degradation processes; thus, metabolism does 
not contribute to its clearance and it is not eliminated by  renal or biliary  excretion. 
Consequently , the clearance of bezlotoxumab is not expected to be different in children 
compared with adults, except based on weight, which is account ed for b y weight -based 
dosing. Hence, the 10 mg/kg dose is anticipated to b e appropriate for children and to provide 
serum exposures similar to those observed in adult s.However, the dose may be modified for 
Panel B of each age cohort based on PK evaluations performed during this trial (Section 7.2).

Maximum Dose/Exposure for Thi s Trial
The maximum dose and exposure of bezlotoxumab during the trial will not exceed a single, 
20mg/kg IV dose of bezlotoxumab and the exposure associated with this dose previousl y 
observed in adults. As described in the bezlotoxumab IB, the maximum kno wn tolerat ed dose 
in humans is 20 mg/kg. Based on PK data from children obtained in the initial panels and age 
cohorts inthis trial, the starting dose may  be increased to achieve serum exposures similar to 
those observed in adults receiving 10 mg/kg (Sect ion7.2).
Rationale for Dose Interval and Trial Design
The dose and trial design are similar to those for the Phase 3 bezlotoxumab clinical trials in 
adults, MK -3415A Protocol 001 and 002 trials ,in which the safety  and efficacy  of 
bezlotoxumab was demo nstrated, as summarized in the bezlotoxumab IB.
The key  trial design differences between the current pediatric trial and the Phase 3adult trials 
are as follows:
Randomization is being stratified on the basis of age cohort instead of being stratified
based on antibacterial drug treatment for CDI or hospitalization status, 
Allowed d uration of antibacterial drug treatment for the baseline CDI episode has 
been increased to 21 days to increase the proportion of participants who achieve 
initial clinical re sponse and are assessable for the CDI  recurrence endpoint , 
Characterization of diarrhea recurrence (as defined in Section 9.2.5.2 )has been 
changed , 
The laboratory  diagnostic criteria for CDI at study  entry  and for CDI recurrences ha s
been changed to require a test that detects toxin in the stool , and
Clinical outcomes will be assessed b y the investigator. To be consistent with study  
inclusion criteria, an outcome of CDI recurrence will require that treatment be given.
6.Study Population
Male and female participant s between the ages of 1and <18 yearswith CDI will be enrolled 
in this trial.
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also 
known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

Screen Failures
Screen failure s are defined as participants who consent /assent to participate in the clinical 
study  but are not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory  authorities. Minimal information includes demograph y, 
screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and an y adverse events or serious adve rse events 
(SAE) meeting reporting requirements as outlined in the entry guidelines.
Participant Replacement Strategy
In general, a participant who discontinues from trial treatment or withdraws from the trial 
will not be replaced. However, if a Panel A pa rticipant discontinues from the trial prior to the 
last PK blood sampling or had incomplete PK sampling and the collected PK data were 
determined to be insufficient to allow PK assessments, a replacement participant may be 
enrolled to replace the original participant. The replacement participant will receive the same 
treatment that the original participant was randomized to receive .
7.Treatments
Study  treatment is defined as an y investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo ,
or medical device (s)intended to be administered to a study  participant according to the stud y 
protocol.
Clinical supplies [study  treatment(s) provided b y the Sponsor] will be packaged to support 
enrollment and replacement participant s as required.  When a replacement participant is 
required, the Sponsor or designee needs to be contacted prior to dosing the replacement 
supplies.  Clinical supplies will be affixed with a clinical label in accordance with regulatory 
requirements.

Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)
As indicated in Sectio n 7.1, the starting dose of bezlotoxumab for Panel A of each age cohort 
will be 10 mg/kg. As described in Section 5.1.2, data from approximately  12participants in 
Panel A of each age cohort who have complete PK data will be reviewed and evaluated 
against the following criteri on:
Bezlotoxumab e xposure in the relevant panel and age cohort is similar to that observed 
in adults, as determined by  a 90% CI for the pediatric/adult AUC 0-infcomparison 
within the clinical comparability  bounds of (0.6, 1.6) . These bounds have been 
established based on the clinical experience in the Phase 3 trials as reflecting the range 
of relative change in AUC 0-
infthat is expected to b e clinically  comparable to a 
10mg/kg dose in adult participants with respect to safet y and effic acy. Differences in 
ratios of bezlotoxumab exposures that fall within this range are not considered 
clinically  meaningful and do not warrant dose modification . It is important to note that 
the upper bound of 1.6 for bezlotoxumab reflects the limit of current clinical exposure .

Method of Treatment Assignment 
All eligible participant s will be randomly  allocated and will receive a 
treatment/randomization number.  The treatment/randomization number identifies the

Stratification
Treatment allocation/randomization will be stratified acc ording to the following factors:
1.Participant’s age at the time of randomization :
a. Age Cohort 1 (12 to <18 years of age)
b. Age Cohort 2 (1 to <12 years of age).
Blinding 
A double -blinding technique will be used.  Bezlotoxumab and placebo will be prepared 
and/or dispensed in a blinded fashion b y an unblinded pharmacist or qualified trial site 
personnel. The participant and the investigator who is involved in the study  treatment 
administration or clinical evaluation of the participant s are unaware of the group 
assignments.
See Section 9.1.10 for a description of the method of unblinding a participant during the trial, 
should such action be warranted.
Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Dose Preparation
The quantity  of bezlotoxumab administered is based on the participant’s actual body  weight. 
The initial dose will be 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab for participants in Panel A of each age 
cohort ,and potential dose modifications are described in Section 7.2.
The required dose of bezlotoxumab will be diluted directly in 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% 
dextrose to comprise a total infusion volume such that the final concentration is between the 
range of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL . For the preparation of placebo infusions, aweight -
appropriate volume of 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose solution will be given as an IV 
infusion. Additional details will be provided in the Operational Manual . 
In order to maintain the blind , the unblinded pharmacist (or qualified study site personnel 
designated to prepare the IV supplies) will be responsible solely for the preparation of the IV 
study  therapy . He/She will not be involved in evaluating participant s for efficacy  or safet y. 
Due to a slight difference in appearance of the bezlotoxumab diluted solution compared with 
0.9% sodium chloride and 5% dextrose , an opaque sleeve will be placed over the infusion 
bag or s yringe to maintain the blind .

Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
Discontinuation ofstudy  treatment does not represent withdrawal from the study .
As certain data on clinical events beyond study  treatment discontinuation may  be important 
to the study , they  must be collected through the participant ’s last scheduled follow -up, even 
if the participant has discontinued study  treatment .  Therefore, all participant s who 
discontinue study  treatment prior to completion of the single infusion (ie, participants who 
receive a partial dose) will still continue to participate in the study as specified in Section 2 -
SoAand Section 9.1.9 –Withdrawal/Discontinuation.
Participant s may  discontinue study  treatment at any  time for any  reason or be dropped from 
the study  treatment at the discretion of the investigator should an y untoward effect occur.  In 
addition, a participant may be discontinued from study  treatment by the investigator or the 
Sponsor if study treatment is inappropriate, the trial plan is violated, or for administrative 
and/or other safet y reasons.  Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at study  
treatment discontinuation are provided in Section 9.1.9 –Withdrawal/Discontinuation.
A participant must be discontinued from study  treatment but continue to be monitored in the 
study for an y of the following reasons:
○The participant or participant’s legall y acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
study  treatment .
oThe participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance which, in the opinion of 
the investigator and/or sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary  risk from continued 
administration of study  treatment .
For participants who are discontinued from study  treatment but continue to be monitored in 
the trial, all visits and procedures, as outlined in the trial flowchart, should be completed.
Participant s may  be allowed to begin study  treatment again if deemed medically  appropriate ; 
that is, if there is an interruption in the 1 -hour infusion 
for an y reason, the infusion can be re -
started if medicall y acceptable .
Withdrawal from the Study
A participant must be withdrawn from the study if the participant or participant’s legall y 
acceptable representative withdraws consent from the study .
If a participant withdraws from the study , they  will no longer receive study  treatment or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits.

Section 9.1.9 – Withdrawal/Discontinuation.
Lost to Follow Up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant , the following procedures are to be performed:
oThe site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit..  I f 
the participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol -specified vis it schedule.
oThe investigator or designee must make every  effort to regain contact with the 
participant at each missed visit (e.g. phone calls and/or a certified letter to the 
participant ’s last known mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These
contact attempts should be documented in the participant ’s medical record.

Consent /Assent and Collection of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research
The investigator or medically  qualified designee will explain the Future Biomedical Research 
consent /assent to the participant , answer all of his/her questions, and obtain written informed 
consent /assent before performing any  procedure related to the Future Biomedical Research 
sub-trial.  A cop y of the informed consent /assent will be given to the participant .
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator who is a qualified 
physician to ensure that the participant qualifies for the trial.
Participant Identification Card
All participant s will be given a Par ticipant Identification Card identify ing them as 
participants in a research trial. The card will contain trial site contact information (including 
direct telephone numbers) to be utilized in the event of an emergency. The investigator or 
qualified designee will provide the participant with a Participant Identification Card 
immediately  after the participant provides written informed consent /assent .At the time of 
treatment allocation/randomization, site personnel will add the treatment/randomization 
number t o the Participant Identification Card.
The participant identification card also contains contact information for the emergency  
unblinding call center so that a health care provider can obtain information about study  
treatment in emergency  situations where the investigator is not available.
Medical History
A medical history  will be obtained by  the investigator or qualified designee. In addition to 
the evaluation of a participant’s medical history in terms of trial eligibility , all medical 
conditions since birth will be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
The number of prior episodes of CDI will be documented separatel y on the appropriate 
eCRF , along with additional relevant info rmation, including timing and treat ment (s) given
forthe most recent prior episode .
Whether or not each participant is immunocompromised will be assessed by the investigator 
and will be based on the participants ’status at or before randomization. Compromised 
immunity  is defined as meeting 1 or more of the following criteria:
Active hematological malignancy  (including, but not limited to, leukemia, ly mphoma, 
multiple my eloma)
Receiving cytotoxic chemotherap y (or received within the 28 day s prior to onset of
the baseline CDI episode) for an a ctive malignancy

CDI episode.
Prior and Concomitant Medications Review
Prior Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including an y 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the participant
from 28daysprior to the onset of the baseline episode of CDI through signing of informed 
consent .This will include but is not limited to all antibacterial medications, anti-diarrheal 
medications , treatments for deh ydration (including fluids), and an y therapies given and 
procedures performed for treatment of CDI (eg, colectomy , endoscopy , FMT) .For breast -fed 
participants, the mothers’ prior medications should also be recorded .
Treatment(s) given for the most recent prior episode of CDI should be recorded even if the 
treatment ended more than 28 days prior to the onset of the baseline episode of CDI .
Concomitant Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if an y, taken by the participant
at an y point from the signing of informed consent through Week 12 (85 ±5 day s). This will 
include but is not limited to all antibacterial medications, anti -diarrheal medications, 
treatments for deh ydration (including fluids), any therapies given and procedures performed 
for treatment of CDI (eg, colectom y, endoscop y, FMT) , and any  medications used to treat 
AEs.For breast -fed participants, the mothers’ concomitant medications should also be 
recorded .
Assignment of Screening Number
All consented participant s will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify  the participant for all procedures that occur prior to randomization .  Each participant
will be assigned onl y one screening number.  Screening numbers must not be re -used for 
different participant s.

assigned at the initial screening visit.
Specific details on the screening visit requirements (screening/rescreening) are provided in 
Section 9.10 .1. 
Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Number
All eligible participants will be randomly  allocated and will receive a 
treatment/randomization number.  The treatment/randomization number identifies the 
participant for all procedures occurring after treatment allocation/randomization.  Once a 
treatment/randomization number is assigned to a participant , it can never be re -assigned to 
another participant .
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/randomization number.
Treatment Administration
Blinded trial staff will be responsible for a dministration of trial medication.
Study  treatment is to be given on the day  of treatment allocation/randomization or as close as 
possible to the date on which the participant is allocated/assigned.
Timing of Dose Administration
Bezlotoxumab or placebo will be administered as a single IV infusion over approximately 
60(±10) minutes on the day  of randomization (Day  1)or as close as possible to the date of 
randomization .All participants must still be receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI 
on the day of the infusion (that is, participants will receive their last antibacterial dose on the 
day of study  infusion or after) .
It is important to record the details of the infusion, including start and stop times and date as 
well as an y interruptions , on the appropriate eCRF. If a participant does not receive the entire 
infusion, the volume administered and reason the infusion was stopped must be recorded. 
Withdrawal/Discontinuation
Participant s who discontinue study  treatment prior to completion of the single infusion (ie, 
participants who receive a partial dose )should be encouraged to continue to be followed for 
all remaining stud y visits.
When a participant discontinues/withdraws from participation in the tr ial, all applicable 
activities scheduled for the Unscheduled Visit 2in the Schedule of Assessments should be 
performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any  adverse events which are present at the time 
of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in ac cordance with the safety  requirements 
outlined in Section 9.3-Adverse Events.

Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
A Participant’s consent for Future Biomedical Research may  be withdrawn by  the participant 
or the participant’s legally acceptable re presentative (as appropriate) and have their 
specimens and all derivatives destro yed.  A participant’s consent may be withdrawn at an y 
time by  contacting the principal investigator for the main trial.  If medical records for the 
main trial are still availa ble, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated 
mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com).  Subsequently , the participant 's 
consent for Future Biomedical Research will be withdrawn .  A letter will be sent from the 
Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal . It is the responsibility  of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal .  An y analy ses in progress 
at the time of request for withdrawal or alread y performed prior to the request being rece ived 
by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall res earch trial data and results.  
No new analy ses would be generated after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main trial are no longer available ( eg,if the 
investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or 
the specimens have been completely anon ymized, there will no longer be a link between the 
participant ’s personal information and their specimens.  I n this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be processed.
Participant Blinding/Unblinding
STUDY TREATMENT IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS TO BE UNMASKED 
ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY 
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO U NBLIND.
For emergency  situations where the investigator or medically  qualified designee (cons istent 
with local requirements) needs to identify  the drug used by  a participant and /orthe dosage 
administered he/she will contact the emergency  unblinding call c enter b y telephone and make 
a request for emergency  unblinding. As requested by  the investigator or medicall y qualified 
designee ,the emergency  unblinding call center will provide the information to him/her 
promptly  and report unblinding to the Sponsor .Prior to contacting the emergency  unblinding 
call center to request unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment, the investigator who 
is a qualified ph ysician should make reasonable attempts to enter the intensity of the AEs
observed, the relation to study  drug, the reason thereof, etc., in the medical chart . If it is not 
possible to record this assessment in the chart prior to the unblinding, the unblinding should 
not be delay ed.
Participant s whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by  the investigator or medicall y 
qualified designee and/or non- study  treating ph ysician should continue to be monitored in the 
trial.
Additionally , the investigator or medically  qualified designee must go into the IVRS sy stem

Study  treatment identification information is to be unmasked ONLY if necessary for the 
welfare of the participant .  Every  effort should be made not to unblind the participant unless 
necessary . 
In the event that unblinding has occurred, the circumstance s around the unblinding ( eg,date, 
reason and person performing the unblinding ) must be documented promptly , and the 
Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible. Once an emergency  unblinding has 
taken place, the principal investigator, site pers onnel, and Sponsor personnel may  be 
unblinded so that the appropriate follow -up medical care can be provided to the participant.
Calibration of Equipment
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility  to ensure that any  device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinical study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy  parameters shall be suitably  
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained is reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the 
study  site.

Details of Baseline and Recurrent CDI Episodes
Details of the baseline episode of CDI and an y recurrent episodes with an onset during the 
12-week follow -up period should be documented separately  in the source documents and on 
the appropriate eCRFs (including documentation of the local stool test for toxigenic C.
difficile , as per Appendix 7). The investigator site personnel will also need to record on the 
appropriate eCRF the onset date and the highest number of UBM s in a 24- hour period for the 
baseline and recurrent CDI episodes.
Additionally , the following information of relevance to the baseline and each recurrent CDI 
episode willbecollected on the appropriate eCRF :

Assessment of Disease Severity
The baseline episo de of CDI  and any  recurrent episodes with an onset during the 12 -week 
follow -up period will be characterized by  severity (mild to moderate versus severe) and
severe -complica ted course .
Severity  will be assessed by  the investig ator. Participants who meet at least one of the 
following criteria during the CDI  episode will be characterized as having severe CDI [van 
Dorp , S. M., et al 2017] :
the presence of blood y diarrhea ; and/or 
pseudomembranous colitis; and/or
diarrhea accompanied b y dehydration (as judged by the treating ph ysician); and/or
hypoalbuminemia (<2 g /dL);and/or
fever ( ≥38.0°C) with leukocy tosis (>15.0 × 109/L). 
Participants will be characterized as having severe -complicated CDI if they meet at least o ne 
of the following criteria associated with the CDI episode within 30 day s after diagnosis of the 
episode [Na, X., et al 2015] , as assessed by the investigator:
Intensive care unit admission

oIntensit y of abdominal discomfort; and
oElevations in body  temperature.
It is recommended to complete the diary nightly  (at approximately  the same time each day ).
If all or a portion of the daily  diary is lost or misplaced, the participant or the participant ’s 
parent or caregiver should contact study  personnel to obtain a repl acement.  
At the end of the trial, the daily  diary will be maintained as a source document .The data 
recorded on the diary  will not be entered into the EDC sy stem , with the exception of the 
specific information noted in S ection 9.2.5.2.
Phone/Visit Contac t 
Trial personnel will contact the participant or the participant’s parent or caregiver at least 
3times per week during antibacterial drug treatment for the baseline episode of CDI for 
assessment of antibacterial drug treatment compliance. 
Trial personnel will also contact the participant or the participant’s parent or caregiver either 
by phone or in person approximately  24hours after the end of the infusion to assess for 
infusion- related reactions (see Section 9.3.7.1 ). 
Trial personnel will contact the participant or the parent or caregiver twice weekl y from 
approximately  48 hours after the last dose of antibac terial drug treatment ( EOT) through 
Week 12 to ensure that the daily  diary  ismaintained by  the parent or caregiv er. These phone 
calls will help to determine if the participant experienced watery  diarrhea (for participants 
using diapers or other t ype of fecal collection device) or 3or more UBMs within a 24- hour 
period, at which point a stool sample will be collected and an unscheduled study  visit will be 
conducted to assess whether the criteria for a diarrhea recurrence or a CDI recurrence have 
been met (as defined in Section 9.2.5.2 ).
Study  personnel do not need to contact the participant or the participant ’s parent or caregiver
on weekends or holiday s, unless the 24 -hour infusion follow -up assessment for 
infusion- related reactions occurs on one of these days.
The information communicated b y the participant or the parent or caregiver during the 
contact is t o be recorded in the source documents .In addition, if an y discrepancy is noted
between the information obtained via phone contact and the information provided in the daily  
diary , study  personnel must discuss the discrepancy with the participant /caregiver , and the 
explanation/resolution must be documented.

Stool Sample Collection and Assessments
Before screening , a stool sample collected during the episode of CDI being treated at the time 
of randomization must have tested positive by the local laboratory fo r toxigenic C. difficile ; 
results of all C. difficile tests (positive of negative) performed for this episode are to be 
recorded in the eCRF . Positive r esults of any  other tests performed at the local laboratory  
during this CDI episode to detect other pathogens in stool are to be recorded in the eCRF. 
During screening , a new stool sample may need to be collected for study -specific testing (see 
Appendix 7 for assay  requirements). A new sample is not needed if aliquots of the same stool 
sample that was u sed for the pre -screening diagnosis are available. If the pre -screening 
diagnosis was based on a method that does not test for the presence of C. difficile toxin, a 
new test will need to be performed at the local laboratory prior to randomization to confir m 
the diagnosis. Results of the new tes t areto be recorded in the eCRF.
An aliquot of the pre -screening stool sample or a sample obtained during screening will also 
be sent to the central laboratory .
After completion of antibacterial drug treatment for the baseline episode of CDI , if the 
participant experiences watery  diarrhea (if the child isusing diapers or other fecal collection 
device) or 3 or more UBMs within a 24 -hour period, a stool sample will be collected that 
same day , frozen, and brought to th e unscheduled visit; if the criteria for a diarrhea 
recurrence are met (Section 9.2.5.2), the aliquots will be sent to both a local laboratory and 
the central laboratory for testing. The local laboratory  will perform a C. difficile toxin teston 
stool samples (see Appendix 7for assay requirements) .
The central laboratory  will perform the following test son stool samples :
Anaerobic culture followed by toxin testing for C. difficile strains isolated
Toxigenic strain ribot yping
Antibacterial susceptibility  testing (vancomy cin, metronidazole, and fidaxomicin)
Panel for gastrointestinal pathogens (Section 9.2.4.1)
Stool samples will be collected at the time points indicated in Section 2 – S oA.Stool samples 
collected at sites will be stored at –70°C or below and shipped frozen to the central 
laboratory .Results of central laboratory  tests are for data anal ysis purposes only  and will not 
be available during the conduct of the study  to inform patient care decisions .
Gastrointestinal Panel
The c entral laboratory  will test froze n stool samples using FilmArray®gastrointestinal panel , 
manufactured b y Biofire D iagnostics, Salt Lake City , UT, US . The FilmArray  
gastrointestinal panel is a sensitive and specific multiplex PCR -based assay capable of 
detecting 22 different pathogens directl y from stool specimens ( Table

Investigator Assessment of Clinical Outcome s
Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response
The investigator will assess clinical outcomes of the baseline episode of CDI approximately  
48hours after the last dose of antibac terial drug treatment (EOT) for determination of initial 
clinical response (Table 7).This assessment can be performed via telephone contact or in 
person. The outcome of the investigator assessment will be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF.
Randomized participants who are de emed clinical failures or have an indeterminate 
assessment will be medically  managed as necessary  and continue to be monitored during the

2 day s after completion of up to 21 days of antibacterial drug 
treatment for CDI.
Clinical Failure Initial clinical response not achieved.
Indeterminate Study  data are not available for evaluation of clinic al 
outcome for one of the following reasons:
a)Participant was withdrawn for an y reason or died before 
sufficient data had been obtained to permit evaluation; OR
b)Extenuating circumstances ( eg, a protocol violation) 
preclude classification as "initial clinical response" or 
"clinical failure."
Investigator Assessment of a New Episode of Diarrhea During the 12 -Week 
Follow -Up Period
An investigator assessment will occur at each study visit after the EOT visit . In addition, a n
unscheduled visit will be conducted if the participant experiences watery  diarrhea (if the 
child is using diapers or other fecal collection device) or 3 or more UBMs within a 24- hour 
period, and an investigator assessment will determine whether the criteria for a diarrhea 
recurrence or a CDI recurrence have been met (Table 8).The unscheduled visit should 
preferabl y occur within 2 days of the onset of diarrhea or UBMs. The investigator assessment 
and information to support this assessment (eg, stool test result, treatments given, maximum 
number of UBMs, maximum temperature, maximum white blood cell count, max imum 
abdominal discomfort score ) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
Every  effort will be made to ensure that all diarrhea recurrence episodes are asse ssed for CDI 
recurrence.
Sustained clinical response will be derived from the investigator assessment of initial clinical 
response and CDI recurrence, as described in Section 10.4.3.

Method of Detecting AE and SAE
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open- ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrence .
Changes resulting from normal gro wth and development that do not vary  significantly  in 
frequency  or severit y from expected levels are not to be considered AEs. Examples of this 
may include, but are not limited to, teething, ty pical cry ing in infants and children ,and the 
onset of menses o ccurring at a ph ysiologically  appropriate time.
Follow -up of AE, SAE and Other Reportable Safety Event Information 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAE, pregnancy  and exposure during 
breastfeeding, Events of Clinical interest (ECI), Cancer, and Overdose will be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to 
follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). In addition, the investigator will make every attempt to 
follow all non- serious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome.  Further 
information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4.
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Promp t notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the sponsor of SAE is 
essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of 
participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
Thesponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and 
other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study  treatment under clinical 
investigation. All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory  authorities, I RB/IECs 
and investigators in accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations, i.e., 
per ICH Topic E6 (R1) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
Investigator s afety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory  requirements and sponsor policy  and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the spo nsor will file 
it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.
Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AE s
or SAEs
A CDI  recurrence is not considered a reportable event and will not be reported to the Sponsor 
as described in Section 9.3.1 unless it meets one or more SAE criteria.

Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy  and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered adve rse 
events, an y pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneousl y 
reported to the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the trial are reportable to the 
Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the c ompletion/termination of the pregnancy . 
Pregnancy  outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign h ydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reporte d.
Events of Clinical Interest (ECI)
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Eve nts of Clinical I nterest 
(ECI) and must be reported to the Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 
1.an elevated AST or ALT postbaseline lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the 
upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or 
equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase 
lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined b y way of 
protocol -specified laboratory  testing or unscheduled laboratory  testing in a participant 
with baseline values that did not meet these criteria, or if baseline values were 
elevated, there is a clinically  significant worsening , as determined b y the investigator .*
* Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory  guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify  a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that 
may require an additional evaluation for an underly ing etiology . The trial site 
guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the 
Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).
2.infusion- related reactions (Section 9.3.7.1).
Infusion -Related Reactions
Anaph ylaxis is likely  when multiple organ s ystems are adversel y affected following exposure 
to an allergen. A list of symptoms that may be present during anaph ylaxis include flushing, 
apprehension, s yncope, tach ycardia, thread y or unobtainable pulse associated with a fall in 
blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, wheezing, d yspnea due to 
laryngeal spasm, lower airway  obstruction, pruritus, rashes (such as urticaria), or 
angioedema. A modification of the Sampson criteria [Sampson, H. A., et al 2006] will be 
used to identify  potential anaph ylaxis due to bezlotoxumab (infusion- related reactions ).
Participants will be monitored during the infusion of study  medication and asked to report 
onset of new s ymptoms through 24 hours following the end of the infusion ; this monitoring

Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
●The investigator or medically  qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and rec ord any  clinically  
relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the CRF. The 
laboratory  reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically  significant 
abnormal laboratory  findings are those which are not associated with the und erlying 
disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
participant's condition.
●If laboratory  values from non -protocol specified laboratory  assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory  require a change i n study  participant management or 
are considered clinically  significant b y the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg,SLAB).
●For an y laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal 
during participation in the study  or within 12weeks after the last dose of study 
treatment , every  attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the 
values return to nor mal or baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined 
by the investigator . 
All clinical safet y laboratory assessments specified in Appendix 2 will be performed b y local 
laboratories.

Visit Requirements
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 2 – Schedule of Activities (SoA) . Specific 
procedure -related details are provided above in Section 9 –Study  Assessments and 
Procedures.
Screening
Screening period can start as earl y as the first day of antibacterial drug treatment for the 
baseline episode of CDI and can extend as long as the last day of antibacterial drug treatment 
for the baseline episode of CDI. During this time, p otential participants will be evaluated to 
determine that they fulfill the entry requir ements as set forth in Sections 6 .1and 6.2 . 
Screening and randomization may  occur on the same day , as long as all trial entry  criteria 
have been met. The duration of the screening period cannot be longer than the a ntibacterial 
drug treatment regimen for the baseline episode of CDI , asthe participant must still be 
receiving antibacterial drug treatment on the day  of randomization/study  infusion.
Screening procedures may be repeated after consultation with the Sponsor. If the subject is 
rescreened, screening procedures should be repeated, unless they  fall within the window 
specified.
Treatment Period

Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. If, after the 
study  has begun, but prior to any  unblinding /final database lock, changes are made to 
primary  and/or secondary h ypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hy potheses, 
then the protocol will be amended (consistent with I CH Guideline E -9). Changes to 
exploratory  or other non -confirmatory  anal yses made after the protocol has been finalized, 
but prior to unblinding/fi nal database lock, will be documented in a supplemental SAP 
(sSAP) and referenced in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR) for the study . Post hoc exploratory  
analyses will be clearl y identified in the CSR. Separate anal ysis plans ( ie, separate 
documents from th e sSAP) will be developed to detail other planned anal yses ( ie, those 
specific to the anal ysis of PK data, and future biomedical research).
Key elements of the statistical anal ysis plan are summarized below; the comprehensive plan 
is provided in Sections 10.2 - 10.12.
Study Design Overview A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Clinical 
Trial to Evaluate the Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics 
and Efficacy  of a Single Infusion of Bezlotoxumab (MK-
6072, Human Monoclonal Antibody to C. difficile Toxin 
B) in Children Aged 1 to <18 Years Receiving 
Antibacterial Drug Treatment for C. difficile Infection
Treatment Assignment There are 2 stud y treatment arms.  Participants will be 
assigned randoml y in a 3:1ratio to bezlotoxumab or
placebo, respectivel y, and will be stratified into 2 age 
groups according to the participant’s age at the time of 
random ization (1 to <12 years of age or 12 to <18 y ears of 
age).
Analysis Populations Pharmacokinetics : Per-Protocol (PP)
Safety: All Participants as Treated (AP aT) 
Efficacy: modified Intent to Treat (mITT), Efficacy  
Evaluable (EE)
Primary Endpoint(s) Pharmacokinetic :The AUC 0-inf will be determined for

Statistical Methods for 
Key Efficacy/
Pharmacokinetic AnalysesPharmacokinetic : In each age cohort , apoint estimate as 
well as its 90% confidence interval ( CI)will be generated 
from ananaly sis of variance (ANOVA )model contain inga 
factor forcohort (pediatric participants and adults) for the 
GMR ( pediatric participants /adults) of bezlotoxumab
AUC 0-inf. The 90% CI  of the GMR will be compared 
against the pre -specified bounds (0.6, 1.6). If the 90% CI  
for the GMR falls within (0.6, 1.6), then it will be claimed 
that the AUC 0-inf of bezlotoxumab in the pediatric age 
cohort is similar t o adults.
Efficacy: Miettinen and Nurminen’s method for stratified 
data will be used to compare the proportion of participant s 
with CDI  recurrence and the proportion of participant s who 
achieved sustained clinical response between the treatment 
groups ( bezlotoxumab and placebo). The strata will be the 
participant 's age category at time of trial entry  (same as the 
stratification for the randomization). Similar method ology
will be used for sustained clinical response.

Interim Analyses An independent, unblinded DMC will be appointed and 
will review the safet y and tolerability data. There will be 2
planned reviews b y the DMC ,which will occur during th e 
pre-specified time points. There are no plans to conduct a n
interim analy sis of unblinded efficacy  data in the study .
Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is being made.
Sample Size and Power Pharmacokinetic : The estimated log -scale between -
subject standard deviation for AUC 0-infof bezlotoxumab
following single -dose IVadministration of 10 mg/kg 
MK-3415A in adults was 0.402 based on data from two 
Phase 3 trials (MK- 3415A P001 and MK -3415A P002). 
Assuming the same variability  in pediatric participants, if 
the true GMR (pediatric participants/adults) is 1.00 for 
AUC 0-infof bezlotoxumab
, then 9 pediatric participants
and 1400 adults provides at least 93.6% probability of 
observing the 90% CIs of AUC 0-infof bezlotox umab to be 
contained within (0.6, 1.6).
Safety: 
The fundamental justification for the sample size 
is to complete the trial in a timely manner while still 
providing a sufficient number of participants with 
bezlotoxumab exposure in this population to assess the 
safet y profile .
Efficacy: The study  is not powered for the assessment of 
efficacy .

sufficiently  to ensure that these data will be likel y to exhibit the effects of treatment, 
according to the underl ying scientific model . The non -compartmental PK analy sis will be 
conducted for the PP population. 
Safety Population
The All Participants as Treated (A PaT) population will be used for the analysis of safet y data 
in this study . The APaT population consists of all randomized participants who receive 
infusion of study  medication. Participants in Panel A (Cohort 1 and/or 2) will only be 
included in the APaT population if there is not a dose modification as described in Section 
5.1.2; if there is a dose modification in a particular cohort , participants in Panel A of that 
cohort will be summarized separately .Participant s will be included in the treatment group 
corresponding to the study treatment they  actually  received for the anal ysis of safet y data 
using the APaT population. For most participants , this will be the treatment group to which 
they are randomiz ed.
At least 1 vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least one dose of study treatment 
is required for inclusion in the anal ysis of each specific parameter. To assess change from 
baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.
Efficacy Population
The mITTpopulation will serve as basis for the efficacy  anal yses. The mITTpopulation is a 
subset of all randomized participant s with participant s excluded for the following reasons:
Did not receive any amount of study  medication
Did not have a posit ive local stool test for C. difficile toxin to confirm CDI diagnosis 
of the baseline episode
Was not taking a protocol -defined antibacterial drug treatment for CDI on the day of 
the infusion.
In addition, participants will only be included in the mITT population if they  received the 
final age- appropriate dose ; if there is a dose modification in a particular cohort , participants 
in that cohort will be summarized separatel y.

important deviations from the protocol that may affect the efficacy  results
prior or concomitant usage of IV immune globulin (IVIG)
The final determination on protocol deviations ,and thereb y the composition of the EE

Statistical Methods
Statistical Methods for Pharmacokinetics Analyses
During the conduct of the trial, and to inform enrollment of additional participant s, initial PK
evaluations will i nclude all participant s in Panel A who received the infusion of trial 
medication and who have sufficient data to calculate AUC 0-inf. Data will be natural log 
transformed prior to model fitting. The AUC 0-infof bezlotoxumab following a single -dose IV 
administration in Panel A of each pediatric age cohort will be compared to the AUC 0-infof 
bezlotoxumab in adults using an anal ysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The adult PK 
dataset(s) to be used in this comparison will be based on that obtained from the participant s 
in the 2adult Phase 3 trials (MK- 3415A P001 and MK -3415A P002). The ANOVA model 
will contain a factor accounting for group (pediatric participants and adults). L east-squares 
geometric mean (GM) (95% CI) of the AUC 0
-infof bezlotoxumab inpediatric participants
will be calculated from the model. A point estimate as well as its 90% CI will also be 
generated from the model for the GMR ( pediatric participant s/adults) of bezlotoxumab
AUC 0-inf. The 90% CI  of the GMR will be compared against the pre-specified bounds (0.6, 
1.6). If the 90% CI for the GMR falls within (0.6, 1.6), then it will be claimed that the AUC 0
-
infof bezlotoxumab in the pediatric age cohort is similar to adults. 
At the conclusion of this trial, PK data from all participant s who received the trial medication 
and who have sufficient data to assess PK from both Panels A and B will be used to compile 
an overall bezlotoxumab PK profile in the pediatric population. 
Individual values will be listed for each PK parameter b y treatm ent and age coho rt, and the 
following (non -model -based) descriptive statistics will be provided: N (number of subjects 
with non- missing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic  percent CV 
(calculated as 100 x standard deviation/arithmetic me an), median, minimum, maximum, GM, 
and geometric percent CV (calculated as 100 x sqrt( exp(s2) -1), where s2is the observed 
variance on the natural log -scale). Descriptive statistics will be provided by gender and race 
or other covariates of interest as well if needed.

Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed b y clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs and vital signs .
The anal ysis of safet y results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 10). The tiers differ with 
respect to the anal yses that will be performed. Safety  parameters or AEs of special interest 
that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that wil l be subject to 
inferential testing for statistical significance with p -values and 95% CIsprovided for 
between -group comparisons. Other safety  parameters will be considered Tier 2 or Tier 3. 
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CI s provided for between -
group comparisons; only  point estimates by  treatment group are provide d for Tier 3 safet y 
parameters.
Adverse events (specific terms as well as s ystem organ class terms) and predefined limits of 
change in laboratory  and vital signs that are not pre -specified as Tier 1 endpoints will be 
classified as belonging to "Tier 2" or "Tier 3", based on the number of events observed. 
Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 12participants in the bezlotoxumab treatment 
group or 2 participants in the placebo treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEs and 
predefined limits o f change will belong to Tier 3.
The threshold of at least 12 participants in the bezlotoxumab arm was chosen because the 
lower limit of 95% CI  for the between -group difference (bezlotoxumab –placebo) in percent 
incidence would not exclude zero when the number of participants in bezlotoxumab was less 
than 12 and thus would add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful differences. 
Similarly , the threshold of at least 2 participants in the placebo arm was chosen because the 
upper limit of 95% CI  for the between -group difference (bezlotoxumab –placebo) in percent 
incidence would not exclude zero when the number of participants in placebo was less than 2 
andthus would add little to the interpretation of potentially  meaningful differences. Because 
many  95% CIs may  be provided without adjustment for multiplicity , the CIs should be 
regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in review, not a formal met hod for 
assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences in AE s.
Continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory  and vital signs parameters 
that are not pre -specified as Tier 1 endpoints will be considered Tier 3 safety parameters.  
Summary  statistics for baseline, on -treatment, and change -from -baseline will be provided by 
treatment group in table format.
For this protocol, there ar e no Tier 1 events given the favorable safet y profile demonstrated 
in the Phase 3 program .  The broad clinical and laboratory  AEcategories (through the 12 
week follow up period) consisting of the percentage of participants with any AE, a 
drug-related AE, a serious AE, a death, an AEwhich is both drug- related and serious, a
discontinuation due to an AEand specific AEs (meeting the thresholds described above) are 
considered Tier 2 endpoints. I nfusion -related reactions, as previously  defined in Section 
9.3.7.1, will also be considered Tier 2 endpoints. 95% CIs (Tier 2) will be provided for 
between -treatment differences in the percentage of participants with events; these anal yses

Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
Miettinen and Nurminen’s method for stratified data will be used to compare the proportion 
of participant s with CDI recurrence and the proportion of participant s who achieve sustained 
clinical response between the treatment groups ( bezlotoxumab and placebo). The strata will 
be the participant 's age category  at time of trial entry  (same as the stratification for the

Confidentialrandomization). Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel weights will be used. The 95% CIfor the 
difference sin proportions will be presented along with nominal 2 -sided p- value s.  As there 
are no associated h ypothes es to be tested, the p- value sare not inferential and are only 
presented as an additional measure of the effect size.
For the proportion of participants who have CDI recurrence in subset sof participants at high 
risk of CDI recurrence , the bezlotoxumab vs. placebo difference (with a nominal 95% CI) 
will be estimated using Miettinen and Nurminen’s method without stratification.  Sustained 
clinical response in subset of participants at high risk of CDI  recurrence will use the same 
methodology .
The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the time to CDI  recurrence 
distribution for each tr eatment group. Treatment differences in time to CDI recurrence will 
be assessed using the stratified log -rank test.
For the anal yses of efficacy , participants at the final dose selected for each cohort will be 
pooled across cohorts.  In addition, key  summ aries of efficacy  will be provided separatel y by 
cohort as described in Section 10.10. L imited summaries of efficacy  will be provided in 
participants in Panel A if there is a dose modification.
Statistical Methods for Immunogenicity Analyses
The Agresti & Coull method will be used to calculate the 95% CI for the bezlotoxumab 
group for the proportion of participants with treatment -emergent positive antibodies to 
bezlotoxumab. 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The comparability  of the treatment group s for each relevant characteristic will be assessed b y 
the use of tables and/or graphs. No statistical h ypothesis tests will be performed on these 
characteristics. The number and percentage of subjects screened, randomized, the primary  
reasons for screen ing failure, and the primary  reason for discontinuation will be 
display ed.Demographic variables ( eg, age, sex, race), baseline characteristics, primary and 
secondary  diagnoses, and prior and concomitant therapies will be summarized by  treatment 
either b ydescriptive statistics or categorical tables.
Interim Analyses
Initial PK evaluations will be conducted as described in Section 10.6.1.
An independent, unblinded DMC will be appointed to review safet y and tolerability data for 
Panel A of both Age Cohort 1 and Age Cohort 2, as described in Section 5.1.2, with 
additional information provided in Appendix 3. A description of the structure, function, and 
guidelines for decision -making by  the DMC will be outlined in the DMC charter. There are

Sample Size and Power Calculations
Sample Size and Power for Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The estimated log -scale betwe en-subject standard deviation for AUC 0-infof bezlotoxumab
following single -dose IVadministration of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab in adults was 0.402 
based on data from two Phase 3 trials (MK -3415A P001 and MK -3415A P002). 
Primary  hypothesis: Assuming the same var iability  in pediatric participants , if the true GMR 
(pediatric participant s/adults) is 1.00 for AUC 0-infofbezlotoxumab , then 9 pediatric 
participant s and 1400 adults provides at least 93.6% probability of observing the 90% CI s of 
GMR (pediatric participa nts/adults) for AUC 0-infof bezlotoxumab to be contained within 
(0.6, 1.6). 
Precision estimates: 
9 pediatric participants who receive bezlotoxumab in each age cohort
provide sat least 69.7% probability  that the 95% CI of the 
GMis within 60% and 140% of 
the GM estimates of AUC 0-inffor bezlotoxumab . Aminimum of 27 participants who receive 
bezlotoxumab in each age cohort provides at least 99.9% probability  that the 95% CIis 
within 60% and 140% of the GMestimates of AUC 0
-inffor bezlotoxumab .
Sample Size and Power for Efficacy Analyses
This study  will randomize approximately  144participants into the bezlotoxumab group and 
48into the placebo group at the final dose selected for each age cohort. The planned sample 
size for thi s study  will have limited power to confirm superiority  of bezlotoxumab over 
placebo.  Table 11presents the treatment 
difference and 95% CI for various possible 
combinations of CDI  recurrence event rates that could be observed in this study .  
Assumptions about the incidence of CDI recu rrence among participant s on bezlotoxumab are 
based on the pooled results from the Phase 3 clinical trials (PN001 and PN002) of a single 
infusion of this investigational product and expectations about the rates anticipated in this 
study  population . In thes e studies, CDI  recurrence was observed in 16.5% (129/781) of 
bezlotoxumab participants in the primary  anal ysis population , while the recurrence rate 
among participant s on placebo was 26.6% (206/773). Rates were slightl y higher, in both 
treatment groups, in the subset of participants with initial clinical response: in this subset,
CDI recurrence was observed in 20.6% (129/ 625) of bezlotoxumab participant s, while the 
recurrence rate among participant s on placebo was 33.2% (206/ 621).
Similarly , there is also limited power for this study for sustained clinical response; the pooled 
response rate sobserved inthe Phase 3 clinical trials (PN001 and PN002) were 63.5% 
(496/781) inbezlotoxumab participants, while the response rate samong participants on 
placebo were 53.7% (415/773).

Sample Size and Power for Safety Analyses
The fundamental justification for the sample size is to complete the trial in a timely manner 
while still providing a sufficient number of participants with bezlotoxumab exposure in this 
population to assess the safet y profile .  A 3:1 randomization was use d to maximize the 
number of participants exposed to bezlotoxumab while still maintaining a control arm of 
reasonable size.
The probability  of observing at least one serious adverse event in this study depends on the 
number of subjects treated and the underl ying percentage of subjects with a serious adverse 
event in the study  population. If the underl ying incidence of a serious adverse event is 1% (1 
of every  100 subjects receiving bezlotoxumab), there is a 76% chance of observing at least 
one serious adverse event among 144 subjects in the bezlotoxumab group. If no serious 
adverse events are observed among the 144 subjects in bezlotoxumab group, this study  will 
provide 95% confidence that the underl ying percentage of subjects with a serious adverse 
event is ≤2.6% (<1 in every  38 subjects) in the bezlotoxumab group.

Subgroup Analyses
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the 
estimate of the between- group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI ) for the CDI 
recurrence and the sustained clinical response will be estimated within each category  of each 
subgroup.  The following subgroups will be examined : 
Age cohort (1 to <12 y ears, 12 to <18 y ears)
Sex (female, male)
Race (white, non -white)
Antibiotic use dfor treatment of CDI episode ongoing at time of infusion 
(metronidazole, vancom ycin, fidaxomicin)
The 95% CIwill only  be calculated ifthere are 10 or more participants in each treatment 
group.
As a secondary objective , the proportion of participants with CDI recurrence and the 
proportion of participants who achieved sustained clinical response in the subset of 
participants at high risk for CDI recurrence will be assessed as discussed in Section 10.4.3. 
Additionally , the proportion of participants who have a CDI recurrence and the proportion of 
participants who achieved sustained clinical response will be calculated in the subset of 
participants meeting the criteria for each risk factor. As above, the 95% CIwill only be 
calculated if there are 10 or more participants in each treatment group.
Compliance (Medication Adherence)
Compliance assessments are not relevant for a single -dose infusion study .
Extent of Exposure
Assuming no change in dose following review of exposures in Panel A participants , all 
participants will receive the same dose (10 mg/kg).  Given this, the extent of exposure will be 
the same for all participants and no summary  of this information will be provided.   If a dose 
change is required, the number of participants exposed at each dose lev el will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics.

Appendix 3: Study Governance Considerations
Merck Code of Conduct for Clinical Tri als
Merck*
Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
I.Introduction
A. Purpose
Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in 
compliance with the high est ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant safety is the overriding concern 
in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
B. Scope
Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the 
party (parties) employed for their execution (eg,contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This 
Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code 
does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are not under the control of Merck.
II.Scientific Issues
A. Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices o f Merck or comparator products.  Alternatively, Merck may 
conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine 
participant preferences, etc.  
The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose 
of the trial.  Research participant s must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participant s, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations.  Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the tria l.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical 
Practice.  Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified v ersus source 
documentation according to standard operating procedures.  Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, 
misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, 
the clinical site will be clo sed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and 
data disclosed accordingly. 
B. Publication and Authorship
To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts.  Some early phase or 
pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing.  In such cases, publication of 
0869YY
Product: MK-6072 104
Protocol/Amendment No.:   001-01 
MK-6072 -001-01 Final Protocol 07-Feb-2019
Confidentialresults may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues 
of multiplicity.
Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH -Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, 
performance or interpretati on of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript.  All named authors must be able to 
defend the trial results and conclusions.  Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. 
III. Participant Protection
A.IRB/IEC review
All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/ IECbefore being initiated at each site.  
Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/ IECprior to implementation, except that 
changes required urgently to protect participant safety and well -being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/ IEC
approval. For each site, the IRB/ IECand Merck will approve the participant informed consent form. 
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance.  
Potential participant s will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a 
minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care.  Participan ts are never denied access to 
appropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. 
All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary.  Participants are enrolled only after providing informed consent 
for participation.  Particip antsmay withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, 
or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C.Confidentiality
Merck is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the great est extent possible.  Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential 
medical records that might identify the research participant by name.  
D.Genomic Research
Geno mic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by 
an Ethics Committee.
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive.  It is Merck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performe d in support of Merck trials.  Merck does not pay incentives to 
enroll participant s in its trials.  However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, add itional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
Merck does not pay for participant referrals.  However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding 
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial.  However, the local IRB/ IECmay wish to alter 
the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution.  As noted above, 
publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding.

ConfidentialC.Funding for Travel and Other R equests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff ( eg,to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical 
Association (AMA ). 
V. Investigator Commit ment
Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing 
the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards.

Committees Structure
Scientific Advisory Committee
This trial was developed in collaboration with a Scientific Advisory  Committee (SAC).  The 
SAC com prises both Sponsor and non- Sponsor scientific experts who provide input with 
respect to trial design, interpretation of trial results and subsequent peer -reviewed scientific 
publications.
Executive Oversight Committee
The Executive Oversight Committee (EO C) comprises members of Sponsor Senior 
Management.  The EOC will receive and decide upon any  recommendations made by  the 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) regarding the trial.
Data Monitoring Committee
To supplement the routine trial monitoring outlined in this protocol, an external Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the interim data from this trial.  The voting 
members of the committee are external to the Sponsor.  The members of the DMC must not 
be involved with the trial in any  other way  (eg,they cannot be trial investigators) and must 
have no competing interests that could affect their roles with respect to the trial. 
The DMC will make recommendations to the EOC  regarding steps to ensure both participant
safet y and the continued ethical integ rity of the trial.  Also, the DMC will review interim trial 
results, consider the overall risk and benefit to trial participants (see Section 10.7 - Interim

protocol.
Specific details regarding composition, responsibilities, and governance, including the roles 
and responsibilities of the various members and the Sponsor protocol team; meeting 
facilitation; the trial governance structure; and requirements for and proper doc umentation of 
DMC reports, minutes, and recommendations will be described in the DMC charter that is 
reviewed and approved by all the DMC members.
Publication Policy
The results of this study  may  be published or presented at scientific meetings. The sponso r 
will comply  with the requirements for publication of study  results. I n accordance with 
standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generall y support publication of 
multicenter studies only  in their entiret y and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by  mutual agreement.
If publication activity  is not directed by  the sponsor, the investigator agrees to submit all 
manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  This allows the sponsor to protect 
proprietary  information and to provide comments.  
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with I nternational Committee 
of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.
Compliance with Trial Registration and Results Posting Requirements
Under the terms of the Food and Drug Administration Amendment s Act (FDAAA) of 2007

Appendix 4: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
Definition of AE
AE Definition
●An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally  associated with the use of study  treatment , whether or not considered 
related to the study  treatment .
●NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and uninten ded sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  treatment .
●NOTE: for purposes of AE definition, study  treatment (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes a ny pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, device, 
diagnostic agent or protocol specified procedure whether investigational (including 
placebo or active comparator product) or marketed, manufactured b y, licensed by, 
provided b y or distributed by the sponsor for human use.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
●Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those t hat worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
●Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the con dition.
●New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
●Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
●Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. 
●For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated 
adverse event, the AE term should reflect the cli nical sy mptoms or abnormal test 
result.  An overdose without any  associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory  
results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without 
adverse effect.”

Confidential●Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
●Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
● Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
●Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
●Surgery  planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre-existing con dition that has 
not worsened.
●
Refer to section 9.3.5 for protocol specific exceptions.
Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met 
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
●The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
●Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay , even 
ifthe hospitalization is a precautionary  measure for continued observation.  (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre -existing condition is a clinical 
condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in 
the patient’s medical history .

Confidentiald.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
●The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
●This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may inter fere with or prevent 
every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
●in offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis
f.Other important medical events:
●Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  
jeopardize the participant or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually  
be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive tr eatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
Additional Events reported
Additional Events which require reporting 
●In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
●Is a cancer;
●Is associated with an overdose.

ConfidentialRecording AE and SAE
AE and SAE Recording
●When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.
●The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the Adverse Event 
case report forms/worksheets at each examination .
●It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
●There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y the Sponsor. I n this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of 
the participant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before 
submission to the Sponsor.
● The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs,
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms ) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
●An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
●The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE (and 
other reportable safet y event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the 
following categories: 
●Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  the participant, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.  (for pediatric trials, 
awareness of s ymptoms, but easily  tolerated)
● Moderate: An event that causes suffi ciently  discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities. (for pediatric trials, definitely acting like something is wrong)
● Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with a n SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for 
rating the intensit y of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe 
(for pediatric trials, extremely  distressed or unable to do usual activities).

ConfidentialAssessment of Causality
●Did the Sponsor's pro duct cause the adverse event?
●The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor's product caused the adverse 
event will be provided b y an investigator who is a qualified physician.  The 
investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or workshe et that 
supports the causalit y noted on the AE form, ensures that a medicall y qualified 
assessment of causality  was done.  This initialed document must be retained for 
the required regulatory  time frame.  The criteria below are intended as reference 
guidel ines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship 
between the test product and the adverse event based upon the available 
information
●The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between 
the Sponsor's product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the 
components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensit y), the more 
likely  the Sponsor's product caused the adverse event:
●Exposure:   Is there evidence that the participant was actuall yexposed to the 
Sponsor's product such as:  reliable history , acceptable compliance assessment 
(pill count, diary , etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodil y specimen?
●Time Course:   Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor's product? I s the time of onset of the AE 
compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational 
medicinal product)?
●Likely Cause:   Is the AE not reasonabl y explained by  another etiology  such 
as underl ying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental 
factors
●Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor's product discontinued or 
dose/exposure/frequency reduced?
●If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
●If yes, this is a po sitive dechallenge. 
●If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability ; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of 
the Sponsor's product; (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor's 
product(s) is/are only  used one time.)

Confidential●Rechallenge:   Was the participant re-exposed to the Sponsor's product in this 
trial?
●If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
●If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. 
●If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the initial AE resulted in death 
or permanent disability , or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (3) 
Sponsor's product(s) is/are used onl y one time.)
NOTE:  IF A RECHALLENGE IS PL ANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHI CH 
WAS SERI OUS AND WHI CH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR'S 
PRODUCT, OR IF RE- EXPOSURE TO THE SPONSOR'S PRODUCT POSES 
ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE PARTI CIPANT THEN 
THE RECHALLENG E MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR 
CLINICAL DIRECTOR , AND IF REQUIRED, THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW 
BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHI CS COMMITTEE.
●Consistency with Study treatment Profile: Is the clinical/pathological 
presentation of the AE consistent with pr evious knowledge regarding the 
Sponsor's product or drug class pharmacology  or toxicology ?
● The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets 
by an investigator who is a qualified ph ysician according to his/her best clin ical 
judgment, including consideration of the above elements.
● Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor's product relationship).
●Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's p roduct relationship:
There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor's product.  The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor's product is 
reasonable.  The AE is more likely  explained by  the Sponsor's product than by  
another cause. 
●No, there is not a reasonable possibility  of Sponsor's product relationship:
Participant did not receive the Sponsor's product OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the Sponsor's product is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely  explained by  another cause than the Sponsor’s product.  (Also 
entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)

Confidential● For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE a nd has provided an assessment of causality .
●There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s make an assessment of causality  for every  
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
●The investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  assessment.
●The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements
Follow -up of AE and SAE
●The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  Sponsor 
to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This 
may include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consulta tion with other health care professionals.
●New or updated infor mation will be recorded in the CRF.
●The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
Reporting of AE, SAE , and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE , and Other Reportable Safety Event Reporting to Sponsor via Electronic 
Data Collection Tool
●The primary  mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data 
collection (EDC) tool.  
●Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
●If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will 
use the paper AE Reporting form.

available.
●After the stud y is completed at a given site, the el ectronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
●If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electroni c data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or by 
telephone (see next section).
●Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via Paper CRF
● If the electronic data collection tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or 
secure e -mail of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the Sponsor.
●In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by  
telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
● Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.
● Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be 
found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below) 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
● Premenarchal
●Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
○ Documented h ysterectomy
○Documented bilateral salpingectomy
○Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
●Postmenopausal female
○A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. 
▪A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, c onfirmation with two FSH measurements in the 
postmenopausal range is required . 
○Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non -hormonal highly  effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their H RT during the study . Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception Requirements
Female Participants:
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if t heyagree to use 
any one of the contraception methods described in Table 14 , including those classified as

not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
●Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterose xual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)

5.Biorepository Specime n Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for anal yses using good scientific 
practices.  Anal yses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may  be 
performed b y the Sponsor, or an additional third party (e.g., a universit y investigato r) 
designated b y the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the anal ysis will follow the 
Sponsor’s privacy  and confidentiality  requirements. Any  contracted third party anal yses 
will conform to the specific scope of anal ysis outlined in this sub- trial. Future Biomedical 
Research specimens remaining with the third party  after specific anal ysis is performed 
will be reported to the Sponsor.
6. Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research 
Participant s may  withdraw their consent for Future Biomedical Research and ask that 
their biospecimens not be used for Future Biomedical Research.  Participant s may  
withdraw consent at an y time by  contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If 
medical records for the main trial are still available, the investigator wi ll contact the 
Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). 
Subsequently , the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository  and 
restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected from study parti cipants 
specificall y for Future Biomedical Research, these specimens will be removed from the 
biorepository  and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigat or confirming 
withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to 
inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable.  
Any anal yses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already  
performed prior to the request being received b y the Sponsor will continue to be used as

8.Data Security
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only  to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated trial administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication i s highl y secure, and is 
accomplished using network securit y policies and practices b ased on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.
9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participant s
No information obtained from exploratory  laboratory  studies will be reported to the 
participant , famil y, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of pr edictive 
capability , and concerns regarding misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may  publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly  report this information to doctors and participant s.  Participant s will not be 
identified by  name in any published reports about this study  or in any  other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population
Every  effort will b e made to recruit all participant s diagnosed and treated on Sponsor 
clinical trials for Future Biomedical Research.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research 
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been minimized. No 
additional risks to the participant have been identified as no additional specimens are 
being collected for F BR(ie, only  leftover samples are being retained).

Appendix 7: C. Difficile Diagnostic Test Method Requirements
A diagnosis of CDI is required prior to consent of the participant. A stool sample must have
tested positive for toxigenic C. difficile according to local diagnostic criteria prior to 
assigning the participant a screening number.
If the local diagnostic method(s) does not include an assay which detects the presence of C. 
difficile toxin in stool , a confirmatory  test that detects C. difficile toxin in stool must be 
performed prior to randomization. The confirmatory test must notdetect only  toxin A (ie , it 
must also detect toxin B) and must be one of the following test types:
1.Cell culture cy totoxic assay , OR
2.Commercial stool assay s, approved b ythe local regulatory  agency , must detect the 
presence of C. difficile toxin ,and the specificity of the assay must be ≥94% as stated 
in the manufacturers’ product insert 
The commercial tests shown in Table 15 are allowed per protocol. Use of other commercial 
tests not included in Table 15 must be discussed with the Sponsor.

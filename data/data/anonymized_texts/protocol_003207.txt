NAME OF SPONSOR: Amgen Inc. PROTOCOL No.: 20150168  
NAME OF STUDY TREATMENT: ABP 959 
TITLE OF STUDY:  A Randomized, Double-blind, Active-con trolled, Phase 3 Study Evaluating the 
Efficacy and Safety of ABP 959 Compared With Ecul izumab in Adult Subjec ts With Paroxysmal 
Nocturnal Hemo globinuria (PNH ) 
STUDY CENTERS:   Approximatel y 45 sites globall y 
STUDY PERIODS:   Subjects will be treated in 2 study 
periods.  Period 1 will be 52 weeks in duration.  Period 2 
will be 26 weeks in duration. PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 3 
PLANNED STUDY DATES:   The planned duration of the clinical study is approximately 
30 months (approximately 12 months for enrollment and approximately 18 months for treatment), 
from approximatel y Q1 2019 to Q3 2021. 
OBJECTIVES:   
Primary Objective:  The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ABP 959 
compared with that of eculizumab base d on control of intravascular hemolysis. 
Secondary Objective:  The secondary objective is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
and immunogenicity of ABP 959 compared with that of eculizumab.  
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 
2-period crossover study in adult subjects wi th PNH.  Approximately 40 subjects will be 
randomized (1:1) to receive each investigational product (IP) in 1 of 2 sequences, either 
treatment T followed by treatment R (TR) or treat ment R followed by treatment T (RT).  Treatment 
will be administered over 2 periods: Period 1 will be 52 weeks in duration; Period 2 will start at 
week 53 with a crossover in treat ment and will be 26 weeks in durat ion.  Randomization will occur 
within 8 days before the first dose of IP admin istration and will be stratified by red blood cell 
(RBC) transfusion received within the last 12 months before randomization (yes vs no). 
Period 1 (week 1 to week 53): 
Treatment T:  ABP 959 at a dose of 900 mg intr avenously (IV) every 14 ± 2 days for 52 weeks 
Treatment R:  eculizumab at a dose of 900 mg IV every 14 ± 2 days for 52 weeks 
 
Period 2: (week 53 to week 79) 
Treatment T:  ABP 959 at a dose of 900 mg IV every 14 ± 2 days for 26 weeks 
Treatment R:  eculizumab at a dose of 900 mg IV every 14 ± 2 days for 26 weeks 
Subjects may require dose adjustments  for IP based on signs and symptoms of intravascular 
hemolysis, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) le vels.  Upon investigator’s determination of 
resolution of symptoms, subjects should resume the 900 mg dose within the recommended 
dosing schedule ie, every 14 ± 2 days.  If a subject requires extended dose adjustments of IP 
indicating that the subject is no longer adequ ately responding to the tr eatment regimen, the 
subject will be discontinued from study.   
Subjects will remain in the treatment phase unt il 14 days after the last planned dose of IP in 
Period 2 (ie, at week 79).    An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will evaluate the safety data throughout the 
study.

ConfidentialNUMBER OF SUBJECTS :Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 
2treatment sequences . The sample size of 40 was chosen to provide approximately 87% power 
to demonstrate non-inferiority (NI)at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 on the primary  endpoint 
of week 27 LDH for the parallel comparison , assuming an inter -subject coefficient of variation
(CV)of 130% for ABP 959 and eculizumab, a true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between 
ABP 959 and eculizumab, a nNImargin of 2.873 , and a 10% dropout rate. The 2.873 margin is 
considered appro priate to rule out a potential clinically relevant difference, as it essentially 
equates to a mean LDH in th e ABP 959 arm of less than 1.5 -fold of the mean LDH in the 
eculizumab arm. The sample size of 40 will also provide greater than 95 %power to
demonstrate similarity at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 on the primary  endpoint of time -
adjusted area under the effect curve (AUEC) of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to 
week 53, and from week 65 to week 79for the crossover comparison , assuming an intra -
subject CV of 34%, a true GMR of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a similarity margin of 
(0.77, 1.30), and a 10% dropout rate .Blinded assessments of the inter -subject CV of LDH and 
the intra -subject CV of time -adjusted AUEC of LDH will be performed. If the aggregated intra-
subject CV of AUEC is greater than 44 %,additional subjects will be enrolled if feasible .If the 
aggregated inter-subject CV of LDH is greater than 130%, the primary  endpoint of parallel 
comparison of LDH at week 27 will be replaced by crossover comparison of LDH at week 53 and 
week 79.

ConfidentialThe clinical similarity of the week 27 LDH between treatments will be assessed by comparing the 
1-sided 9 7.5% upper confidence interval (CI) limit for the GMR of the LDH at week 27 between 
ABP 959 and eculizumab treatment with an NI margin of 2.873. The point estimate of the mean 
difference in the log -transformed LDH and the corresponding 1-sided 9 7.5% upper CIlimitwill be 
estimated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification factor, week 1 LDH 
value, time (as a continuous varia ble), andtreatment by time interaction termas fixed effects, and 
subject as a random effect. Lactate dehydrogenase values from all assessed time points from 
week 13 to week 27 will be included in the mixed model.  The point estimate and the upper CI
limitfor the GMR will then be calculated by transforming back to the original scale.
The primary  analysis of the primary endpoint of time -adjusted AUEC of LDH for the crossover 
comparison will be conducted on the Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS), consisting of all 
randomized subjects who have a nLDH-time profile evaluable for the time -adjusted AUEC within
at least one of the following 14 -week assessment period s: week 13 to week 27, week 39 to 
week 53,and week 65 to week 79, according to treatment per the randomized sequence 
regardless of treatment actually received. Sensitivity analyses, such as per -protocol, will also be 
performed.
The linear trapezoidal rule will be used to derive the AUEC of LDH from week 13 to week 27,
from week 39 to week 53,and from week 65 to week 79 for each subject.  T he time -adjusted 
AUEC will be calculated by dividing the AUEC by the total duration of observed LDH data (in 
weeks) for each individual subject within each 14- week assessment period .  
The clinical similarity of the AUEC between treatments will be assessed by comparing the 2 -sided 
90% CI for the GMR of the time -adjusted AUEC of LDH ( week 13 to week 27, week 39 to week
53,and week 65 to week 79) between ABP 959 and eculizumab treatment with a similarity 
margin of (0.77, 1.30). The point estimate of the mean difference in the log -transformed time -
adjusted AUEC and the corresponding 2-sided 90% CI will be calculated from a linear mixed 
effects model with tr eatment, stratification factor, assessment period , and sequence as fixed 
effects, a nd subject as a random effect. The point estimate and CI for the GMR will then be 
calculated by transforming back to original scale.
The analysis of secondary endpoints (except for PK)will be conducted on the Full A nalysis Set
(FAS). Total complement, total hemoglobin, serum -free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, bilirubin, 
degree of hemoglobinuria, and type III erythrocytes (%) at week s27,39, 53, 65,and 79 will be 
summarized descriptively . For the endpoint of RBC transfusions, summary  statistics for the 
number of packed red cells transfused per month after week 13 will be presented. A descriptive 
summary  of LDH at each time point through the EOS visitwill be presented. Indivi dual and mean 
LDH-time profile sthrough theEOS visitwill also be presented graphically.
The secondary endpoint of crossover comparison of LDH at week 53 and week 79 will be 
evaluated descriptively.  The point estimate of the mean difference in the log -transformed LDH 
between treatments and the corresponding 1-sided 97.5% upper CIlimitwill be calculated from a 
linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification factor, period, and sequence as fixed 
effects ,and subject as a random effect. The poi nt estimate and 1-sided upper 97.5% CIlimitfor 
the GMR will then be calculated by transforming back to original scale.   
The PK Concentration Analysis Set will be defined as the subset of subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set who have at least 1 serum concentration of ABP 959 or eculizumab.  Serum ABP 
959 and eculizumab trough concentrations will be summarized descriptively on the PK 
Concentration Analy sis Set for the study through the EOS visitby actual treatment (ABP 959 or 
eculizumab) and by visit within each period. 
The PK Parameter Analy sis Set will be defined as the subset of subjects in the Safety  Analy sis 
Set who have an evaluable ABP 959 or eculizumab serum concentration -time profile from week 
13 to week 15.  Pharmacokinetic AUC from week 13 to week15will be an alyzed on the PK 
Parameter Analy sis Set according to the actual treatment received with GMR and 90% CI 
provided descriptively.

Confidential6 INTRODUCTION
6.1 Disease Review
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, life- threatening ,bone marrow 
disorder characterized by intravascular hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure, and
thrombo -embolic episodes ,and is associated with a significant increase in mortality, 
development of arterial and venous thrombo -embolic episodes ,visceral organ 
damage, and rapid deterioration in quality of life ( Kelly et al, 2009; Hill et al, 2007; 
Hillmen et al ,2006; Rother et al, 2005). The disease is caused by the expansion of a 
clone of hematopoietic cells lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored 
membrane proteins (eg, CD 55 and CD 59) , which leads to chronic, complement -
mediated intravascular hemolysis. The clinical symptoms of the chronic complement 
activity and hemolysis include abdominal pain, chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoglobinuria, and life -threatening complications include thromboembolism, 
pulmonary hypertension, and impaired renal function (Hill et al, 2007). Laboratory 
evidence of intravascular hemolysis includes high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin, and low or undetectable serum haptoglobin. Lactate dehydrogenase is a 
sensitive biochemical marker of intravascular hemolysis and can be more than 25times the normal concentration during periods of severe hemolysis (Rother et 
al,2005) . 
6.2 Eculizumab
Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris
®(Alexion Pharmaceuticals), is a 
monoclonal antibody that specifically binds with high affinity to the complement 
protein C5, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the 
generation of the terminal complement complex C5b- 9. Eculizumab inhibits terminal 
complement -mediated intravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH ,atypical 
hemolytic uremic syndrome, and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (Soliris®
Summary of Product Characteristics , 2018 ). 
6.3 Compound Review
ABP 959is being developed as a biosimilar to Soliris®(eculizumab ), for the treatment 
of PNH and other indications .  The active ingredient of ABP 959is an anti -C5
monoclonal antibody thathas the same amino acid sequence as eculizumab and 
equivalent nonclinical pharmacologic function, based on comprehensive bioanalytical 
assays .  ABP 959has the same pharmaceutical f orm,dosage strength, route of 
administration, and dosing regimen as US- and European Union ( EU)-licensed 
eculizumab .

Confidential6.4 Study Rationale
The similarity of ABP 959 to eculizumab has been shown using bioanalytical 
methods and nonclinical studies (refer to the investigator’s brochure for additional 
information).  As outlined in the guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies ( EMA/CHMP/BM WP/403543/2010 ), applicants are 
expected to provide data on similarity of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics(PK/PD), safety, and efficacy.  
In the US , EU, and much of the world, laws, regulations, and guidances have been or 
are being put in place to increase availability of biological treatments by developing 
and licensing biosimilar products ( CHMP/437/04 Rev 1 ;
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1; US FDA 
2012a; US FDA 2012b).  A biosimilar product, generally, is one that is highly similar 
to a licensed biologic reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically 
inactive components , and there are no clinically relevant differences between the 
biosimilar and reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.  Biosimilarity 
is demonstrated by the totality of the evidence, including quality, nonclinical, and clinical evidence.  The quality and nonclinical data for ABP 959 and eculizumab are 
summarized in the investigator’ s brochure.  The current study is designed to 
demonstrate that there is no clinically relevant difference between ABP 959 and 
eculizumab in terms of efficacy, PD, PK , safety , and immunogenicity in adult subjects 
with PNH.

Confidential8 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a randomized, double -blind, active- controlled , 2-period crossover study in 
adult subjects with PNH.  
The study will be run in approximately 45sites globally .
Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized ( 1:1) to 1 of the 2 treatment 
sequences, either treatment T followed by treatment R ( TR)or treatment R followed 
by treatment T ( RT).Treatments will be administered over 2 periods .  Period 1 will 
be 52 weeks in duration ; Period 2 will start at week 53 ,with a crossover in treatment, 
and will be 26 weeks in duration.  Randomization will occur within 8 days before the 
first dose of IP administration (defined as day 1) and will be stratified by red blood 
cell ( RBC) transfusion received within the last 12 months before randomization (yes 
vs no).
The treatment sequences will be as shown in Figure 1:
Sequence T R:ABP 959 for 52 weeks in Period 1 followed by eculizumab for 
26weeks in Period 2, each at a dose of 900 mg administered as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion every 14 ± 2 days
Sequence RT: Eculizumab for 52 weeks in Period 1 followed by ABP 959 for 
26weeks i n Period 2, each at a dose of 900 mg administered as an IV infusion every 
14 ± 2 days .
Subjects will remain on the treatment phase until 14 days after the last planned dose 
of IP in Period 2 (ie, at week 79).   
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC ) will perform safety reviews
approximately every 6 months throughout the study (Section 12.6.8 ).  Blinded study 
data will also be monitored on an ongoing basis by the clinical study team. 
The study endpoints will be analyzed as described in Section 12.6.

8.2 Discussion of Study Design
This study is randomized to prevent bias in treatment sequence allocation. The
assessment of the primary endpoint for the parallel comparison of the study will be 
based on LDH at week 27 ,and the assessment of the primary endpoint for the 
crossover comparison will be based on the time- adjusted area under the effect curve 
(AUEC) of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53,and from week 
65 toweek 79.  The primary analysis for the parallel comparison of the study will be 
performed when the last subject has completed or has had the chance to complete
the week 53evaluations . The primary analysis for the crossover comparison of the 
study will be performed when the last subject has completed the week 79
evaluations.
8.3 Study Duration
Study participation consists of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, followed by 
Period 1 (treatment every 14 ± 2 days for a total of 52 weeks), followed by Peri od 2 
(treatment every 14 ± 2 days for a total of 26 weeks), and an endofstudy (EOS) 
visit, 2weeks after the last dose of IP.  The total duration of study treatment is up to 
78 weeks.
The planned duration of the clinical study is approximately 30months (approximately 
12months for enrollment and approximately 18 months for treatment), from 
approx imately Q 12019 to Q32021.

oophorectomy.
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy(HRT) . However ,in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use 1 of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment .

8.4.3 Withdrawal and Replacement of Subject s
8.4.3.1 Criteria for Subject Withdrawal
Subjec ts have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to future medical care by the physician or at the institution.
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP
and/or other protocol -required procedures at any time during the study.  If this 
occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation of treatment with the IP.  Additionally, the subject should be followed 
and complete the EOS visit, 2weeks (± 2days) after the last dose of IPand prior to 
starting commercial eculizumab or other PNH treatment .

ConfidentialWithdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or 
is unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of 
consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and ,where permitted, publicly 
available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to 
discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study might include:
Worsening of PNH
Subject request to end IP(s) administration
Safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event, failure to follow contraception
requirements , and/or noncompliance with protocol requirements)
Pregnancy
Withdrawal of consent to participate in study
Meningococcal infection
Decision by sponsor
8.4.3.2 Evaluations at W ithdrawal
For any subject who is withdrawn before completing all treatment visits, the 
investigator should do all of the following :
Perform all procedures scheduled for the EOS visit ( ie, week 79 visit 
[Section 9.4.2 ]). These assessments will be performed 2weeks (± 2days)
after the last dose of IP(unless the subject withdraws consent to do so) .
Complete all appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF)screens , 
providing the date of and explanation for the subject’s 
withdrawal/discontinuation.
If asubject discontinues IPand willnotreceive commercial eculizumab, or 
another PNH treatment, the subject willbe monitored for at least 8 weeks to 
detect serious hemolysis and other reactions as detailed in Section 9.4.2 .
8.4.3.3 Replacement of Subject s
Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced. 
8.5 Treatment
8.5.1 Treatments Administered
The investigator must ensure that the IPwill be used only in accordance with the
protocol.  ABP 959and eculizumab will be considered the IPs.
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio.  
Treatments will b e administered over 2 periods :Period 1 will be 52 weeks in 
duration; Period 2 w ill start at week 53 with a crossover in treatment and will be 
26weeks in duration. Randomization will be stratified by RBC transfusion received
within the last 12 months before randomization (yes vs no).

ConfidentialInvestigational product will be administered after all other procedures have been 
completed for each visit.
Investigational product will be administered according to local practice for 
administration of eculizumab therapy, ie, as an IV infusion over 25 to 45 minutes .  
Investigati onal product must not be administer edas an IV push or bolus.
Subjects should be monitored for 1 hour following the IPinfusion.  If an adverse 
event occurs during the administration of IP, the infusion may be slowed or stopped 
at the discretion of the investigator .  If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time 
may not exceed 2 hours.
As with all protein products, administration of IPmay result in infusion reactions, 
including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions.  In clinical trials of
eculizumab, no subject s experienced an infusion reaction thatrequired 
discontinuation.  Hypersensitivity reactions should be managed according to institutional guidelines.
Subjects should be educated about the signs and symptoms of meningococcal 
infectio n and strongly advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these 
signs or symptoms occur.  These signs and symptoms are as follows:
Moderate to severe headache with:
onausea or vomiting
ofever
ostiff neck or stiff back
Fever of 103°F (39.4°C) or higher
Fever and a rash
Confusion
Severe muscle aches with influenza -like symptoms and eyes sensitive to light
Subjects will be provided with a Patient Safety Car d, which they will be instructed to 
carry with them at all times.  This card describes symptoms that, if experienced, 
should prompt the subject to immediately seek medical evaluation.
Subjects will be discontinued from the study and treated per standard of care if they develop a meningococcal infection or become pregnant .
Additionally, subjects may experience increased signs and symptoms of PNH, such 
as hemolysis when subjects are rev accinated against Neisseria meningitidis . 
Therefore, subjects should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after 
recommended vaccination.

protected from direct sun light at 2°C to 8°C ,and according to the storage and 
expiration information (where required) provided on the label that is affixed to the 
package containing the IP.  Do not freeze or shake.
8.5.5.2 Study Treatment Accountability
All supplies of IPswill be accounted for in accordance with GCP.  There will be an 
individual study drug accountability record for each subject ,and the pharmacist, or 
designee, should maintain accurate records of the disposition of all IPsupplies 
received during the study.  These records should include the amounts and dates 
clinical drug supplies were received and destroyed/ returned to Amgen or its 
designee. If errors or damages in the clinical drug supply shipments occur, the 
investigator should contact Amgen or its designee immediately.  The study monitor 
will periodically check the supplies of IPheld by the investigator or pharmacist to 
verify accountability of the IP used. Copies of the IPaccountability records will be 
provided by each investigator for inclusion in the Trial Master File during a nd at the 
end of the trial .  
The investigator will administer the medication only to the identified subjects of this 
study, according to the procedures described in this study protocol.  After the end of 
the study , all unused medication and all medication containers should be destroyed 
onsite or returned to Amgen or its designee, as appropriate ,for destruction. In either 
instance, complete documentation will be returned to the sponsor .
8.5.6 Dose Adjustments and Dose Escalation
Subjects may require dose adjustment sfor IPbased on signs and symptoms of 
intravascular hemolysis, including LDH levels.  Upon investigator’s determination of 
resolution of symptoms, subjects should resume the 900 mg dose within the recommended dosing schedule, ie, every 14 ± 2 days.  If a subject requires extended

Confidentialdose adjustments of IPindicating tha t the subject is no longer adequately responding 
to the treatment regimen , the subject will be discontinued from the study.   
If any scheduled dose of IPis delayed from the schedule d visit date (by more than 
2days), then the dose will be administered as soon as possible, and subsequent 
doses will be adjusted accordingly to remain every 14 days (± 2days ) from the 
adjusted dose date.
Administration of IP(ABP 959 or eculizumab) will be withheld for any subject who 
experiences a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event per the National Cancer Institute ( NCI; 
US) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ,version 5.0,
reported by the investigator as related to IP. Re-exposure to IPmay occur only when 
the event resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or the subject’s baseline and if the investigator and 
Amgen, or its designee, agree that subject safety will not be compromised.
Subjects are to be discontinued from the study and treated per standard of care if 
they develop a meningococcal infection or become pregnant.
8.5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any experimental (biological or non -biological) therapy (within or outside a clinical 
study) is prohibited at any time du ring the study.
Excessive vitamin C intake, ie, more than 2000 mg a day ,and intravenous 
immunoglobulin treatment areprohibited at any time during the study.
Subjects taking erythropoietin and/or immunosuppressants ,corticosteroids, low 
molecular weight heparin, iron supplements, and/or folic acid must be on a stable 
dose, and the dose must be expected to remain stable during the treatment periods.
Subjects taking anticoagulants must be at a stable international normalized ratio
(INR) level and are expected to maintain a stable INR level during t he treatment
periods .
Any non-experimental , prescribed therapy , including prophy lactic antibiotics, that 
is considered necessary for the subject’s welfare may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator .
All subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment with the IPshould be offered 
alternative treatment if applicable.  Treatment should be given according to normal 
clinical practice, after EOS assessments have been performed .

Confidential8.5.8 Treatment Compliance
IPwill be administered by site staff and recorded in the eCRF and subject records.  
No other measures of compliance are required.  Records of IPused and intervals 
between visits will be kept during the study.  Drug accountability will be noted by the 
study monitor during s tudy center visits and at the completion of the study.  An up- to-
date treatment inventory/dispensing record must be maintained .
8.5.9 Assignment to Treatment
Whensubjects enter the screening period for the study , the investigator (or designee) 
will contact the IXRS and receive a unique 11-digit subject identification number 
before any study procedures are performed.  This number will be used to identify the 
subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.   Unique 11 -digit subject identification numbers will be 
assigned in sequential order for each site in the format 168XXXXX ###, where 
“168XXXXX ” refers to the site number, and “###” refers to the sequential subject 
ordering as each subject at a site is entered into the IXRS (eg, 16812345001 ).  
Signing of the ICF establishes entry into the screening period.
The subject identificati on number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed at the time of rescreening, enrollment, or 
randomization. This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization 
number assigned for the study.
Upon com pletion of screening and confirmation of eligibility , the investigator (or 
designee) will contact the IXRS to randomize the subject centrally to 1 of the 
2treatment sequences (Figure 1).  Randomization will occur within 8 days before the 
first dose of IP administration and will be stratified by RBC transfusion received within 
the last 12 months before randomization (yes vs no).
8.5.10 Unblinding Procedures
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.  Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the PRA or Amgen Medical Monitor (or 
designee) before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment but must do so 
within 1 working day after the event.
The identity of IPassig ned to subject numbers or to individual boxes of IPwill be 
available for emergency situations through the IXRS. Authorized site staff will be 
provided with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the IXRS to

11.1 Adverse Events
11.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse event sobserved by the 
investigator or reported by the subject isrecorded in the subject’s medical record as well 
asinthe eCRF.
The definition of adverse event sincludes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, an d/or duration, and/or has an 
association with a significantly worse outcome.  In the case of worsening of a 
pre-existing condition, the start date of the event is the date when the first signs of 
worsening were observed.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened during the 
study or involves an intervention ,such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical 
procedure while on study ,is not considered an adverse event .
11.1.2 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse event sobserved by the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur from day 1 through the EOS visit or for 
8 weeks after last dose of IPfor subjects that will not receive commercial eculizumab or 
another PNH treatment after EOS are reported using the applicable eCRF Adverse 
Event Summary page. Adverse event s observed by the investigator or reported by the 
subject that occur after signing of inform ed consent but before day 1 will berecorded as 
medical history ,unless the adverse event is serious.
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or
symptoms)
Dates of onset and resolution
Severity
Assessment of relatedness to IP
Action taken
Adverse events must be graded for severity according to the NCI-C TCAE (US), version 
5.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic
_applications/ctc.htm).
Approved  
  
Product: A BP959
Clinical Study Protocol: 20150168
Date: 05March 2020 Page 46of 71
ConfidentialThe investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to IP.  This 
relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “ Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the IP?”
Worsening of PNH should not be reported as an adverse event .  However, any specific 
symptoms or sequelae of the disease progression or recurrence ( eg, organ failure, 
respiratory distress) will be considered adverse event s and will be captured on the 
eCRF.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value foranyindividual study subject repr esents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator ’sjudgment ) are not to be 
recorded as adverse event s.  However, laboratory value c hanges that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse event s.  W here applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event s.
The investigator ’s clinical judgment is used to de
termine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event .  A subject, or subject’s legal guardian, 
can also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event .  If the subject 
withdraws consent, the subject is encouraged t o undergo, at a minimum, an EOS
assessment.
11.2 Serious Adverse Events
11.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
Aserious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria:
Fatal
Life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of de ath)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Other medically important serious event
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization” if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).

ConfidentialIf an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious c riteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event .”  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug -induced liver injury, 
or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent 
intervention.
11.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse event sobserved by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the ICFthrough the 
EOS visit or for 8 weeks after last dose of IP for subjects that will not receive commercial 
eculizumab or another PNH treatment after EOS are recorded in the subject’s medical 
record and are submitted to Amgen.  
The serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen, or its designee, within 24 hours 
following the investigator ’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF.
If the electronic data capture ( EDC) system is not functional, the serious adverse event
can be reported by faxing a completed paper Serious Adverse Event Fax Cover Sheet

While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious 
adverse event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate 
will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Note that an 
elective termination with no information on a fe tal congenital malformation or 
maternal complication is generally not considered an adverse event, but still 
must be reported to Amgen as a pregnancy exposure case.
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as 
a serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital 
anomaly) the investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event.
Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy 
which is considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the 
investigator, will be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety.  W hile the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former s tudy

12.2 Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 40subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 1of the 2 treatment sequences (TR 
or RT [Section 8.1]). 
The sample size of 40 was chosen to provide approximately 87% power to demonstrate 
non-inferiority  (NI)at a 1-sided significance level of 0.02 5 on the primary endpoint 
(Section 8.6.1.1) of week 27 LDH for the parallel comparison , assuming an inter -subject 
coefficient of variation (CV)of 130% for ABP 959 and eculizumab, a true geometric 
mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, an NImargin of 2.873 , and a 
10% dropout rate. The 2.873 margin is considered appropriate to rule out a potential 
clinically relevant difference, as itessentially equates to a mean LDH i n the ABP 959 
arm of less than 1.5- foldof the mean LDH in the eculizumab arm.
The sample size of 40 will also provide greater than 95% power to demonstrate 
similarity at a 2- sided significance level of 0.05 on the primary endpoint of time -adjusted 
AUEC of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and from week 
65 to week 79 for the crossover comparison, assuming an intra -subject CV of 34%, a 
true GMR of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a similarity margin of (0.77, 1.30), and 
a 10% dropout rate .

week 27, from week 39 to week 53,and from week 65 to week 79 for each subject.  The 
time-adjusted AUEC will be calculated by dividing the AUEC by the total duration of 
observed LDH data (in weeks) of each individual subject within each 14 -week 
assessment period. An LDH -time profile will be considered evaluable for AUEC if it 
contains at least 3 LDH measurements within the 14- week assessment period.  LDH 
values impacted by confounding events (ie ,acute infection, or trauma including surgery), 
unrelated to efficacy of IPthat trigger dose adjustment, will be excluded from the 
calculation of AUEC.  The details will be described in the SAP.
The clinical similarity of the AUEC between treatments will be assessed by comparing 
the 2 -sided 90% CI for the GMR of the time -adjusted AUEC of LDH ( week 13 to week
27, week 39 to week 53,and week 65 to week 79) between ABP 959 and eculizumab 
treatment with a similarity margin of (0.77, 1.30).  The point estimate of the mean 
difference in the log -transformed time -adjusted AUEC and the corresponding 2-sided 
90% CI will be calculated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification 
factor, assessment period , and sequence as fixed effects, and subject as a random

The secondary endpoints oftotal complement, total hemoglobin, serum -free hemoglobin, 
haptoglobin, bilirubin, degree of hemoglobinuria, and type III erythrocytes (%) at 
week 27, week 39, week 53, week 65 ,and week 79 will be summarized descriptively by 
randomized treatment (ABP 959 vs eculizumab) using the FAS.
The secondary endpoint of crossover comparison of LDH at week 53 and week 79 will 
be evaluated descriptively . The point estimate of the mean difference in the 
log-transformed LDH between treatments and the corresponding 1-sided 97.5% upper
CIlimitwill be calculated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification 
factor, period, and sequence as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. The point 
estimate and 1-sided 97.5% upper CIlimitfor the GMR wil lthen be calculated by 
transforming back to original scale. LDH values impacted by confounding events (ie ,
acute infection, or t rauma including surgery), unrelated to efficacy of IPthat trigger dose 
adjustment, will be excluded from the crossover comparison of LDH.  The details will be 
described in the SAP.
For the secondary endpoint of RBC transfusions, summary statistics for the number of 
packed red cells transfused per month after week 13 will be presented. A descriptive 
summary of LDH at each time point through the EOS visitwillbe presented. Individual 
and mean LDH -time profile through the EOS visitwill also be presented graphically.
The p harmacokinetic AUC from week 13 to week 15 will be analyzed on the PK 
Parameter Analysis Set according to the actual treatment received with GMR and the 
90% CI provided descriptively. Serum ABP 959 an d eculizumab trough concentrations 
will be summarized descriptively on the PK Concentration Analysis Set for thestudy

All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject ’s 
state of health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, 
an agreement will be obtained in writing. 
The investigator must ensure that each subject ’s anonymity is maintained. On eCRFs 
and other documents submitted to the sponsor or the CRO, subject s must not be 
identified by name. Instead, subject s will only be known by theunique subject number 
allocated to them to ensure confidentiality on all study documentation . Subject s will 
retain this unique number throughout the study. The investigator will keep a separate 
log of these codes.
To comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject safety, it may be 
necessary for the sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research 
review board, or regulatory authorities, such as the US FDA  or the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA), to review subject s’ medical records as they relate to this study. Only the 
subject ’s unique number on the eCRFs will identify him/her, but his/her full name may be 
made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized government or health 
care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the sponsor .
Documents that are not for submission to the sponsor or the CRO ( eg, consent forms) 
will be maintained by the investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary 
to allow monitoring by the sponsor and the CRO, and auditing by regulatory authorities.

15.1 Regulatory Approval
Amgen Inc., or their appointed agents ,will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country requirements.
No subject may enter the study until this approval has been obtained. A copy of the 
approval (where one is provided as requested , according to local country requirements) 
will be provided to the investigator and to the IRB/IEC .
15.2 Protocol Amendments
In accordance with ICH Topic E6 (R1) Guideline for GCP ,the investigator should not 
implement any deviation from or changes to the protocol without agreement by the 
sponsor and documented approval from the IRB/IEC of a protocol amendment, except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in 
monitor[s], change of telephone number [s]).
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by the sponsor . A written amendment must be submitted 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to t he IRB/IEC assuming this responsibility. 
The investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before 
implementing the changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to subject s. In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified within 5days of the 
change.
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate 
regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC , except for administrative amendments, which 
require notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment 
will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the 
amendment to the protocol.
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC orthe investigator and/or sponsor, the protocol
amendment alters the study design orprocedures and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject , the currently approved written ICFwill require modification. The modified 
ICFmust also be reviewed and approved by the sponsor , appropriate regulatory 
authorities, and the IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained 
from subject s enrolled in the study before participation continues.

Rationale:
This amendment is issued to make the following changes:
To update the planned number of sites from 25to 45.
To update the threshold of the aggregated intra-subject CV from the first blinded
interim analysis from 42% to 44% according to the modified statistical analysis after
adding week 13 to week 27 data.
To update the primary endpoint for crossover comparison to include an additional
assessment period from week 13 to week 27. Appropriate statistical sections were
updated as well.
Toaddthe End of Study definition aslastsubject, last visit in Section 8.3.1 (End of
Study Definition).
To amend text in Section 8.5.7 ( Prior and Concomitant Therapy )to clarify that
concomitant therapy may include prophylactic antibiotics.
To update timing of the first blinded interim check of CV to take place prior to the end
of enrollment rather than when approximately 20 subjects complete their week 27
visit.
To clarify thecriteria fordiscontinuation of the trial in Section 15.8 (Discontinuation of
the Study).
To make minor administrative updates and non- substantive grammatical and
typographic corrections (changes not detailed in this summary) .

27 LDH for the parallel comparison, assuming an inter -subject coefficient of variation (CV ) of 
130% for ABP 959 and eculizumab, a true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between ABP 
959 and eculizumab, a NI margin of 2.873, and a 10% dropout rate.  The 2.873 margin is 
considered appropriate to rule out a potential clinically relevant difference, a s it essentially 
equates to a mean LDH in the ABP 959 arm of less than 1.5 -fold of the mean LDH in the 
eculizumab arm.  The sample size of 40 will also provide 90% power to demonstrate 
similarity at a 2-- sided significance level of 0.05 on the primary endp oint of time -adjusted 
area under the effect curve (AUEC) of LDH for the crossover comparison, assuming an 
intra-subject CV of 34%, a true GMR of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a similarity 
margin of (0.77, 1.30), and a 10% dropout rate.  Blinded assessm ents of the inter -subject 
CV of LDH and the intra- subject CV of time -adjusted AUEC of LDH will be performed.  If the 
aggregated intra -subject CV of AUEC is greater than 42%, additional subjects may be

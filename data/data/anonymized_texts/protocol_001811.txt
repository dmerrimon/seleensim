7 1 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background 
Premature infants  (<37 weeks gestational age at birth)  are at high risk for under vaccination. 
Despite concerns regarding the immaturity of the premature infant immune system, the majority of premature infants achieve antibody concentrations generally accepted to correlate with 
protection.
1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Americ an Academy of Pediatrics have  thus 
recommended that in most cases with the exception of hepatitis B vaccine, premature infants should receive all routinely recommended vaccines at the same chronological age as term 
infants.
2 Despite this recommendation, premature infants have been shown to be 
underimmunized at 6 months,3 12 months,3,4 24 months,5 and 36 months6 chronological age. 
Infants who are discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after lengths of stay 
≥60 days are at particularly high risk, with only approximately 50% up- to-date at the time of 
discharge.7 Vaccination delay at this earlier age thus contributes to under vaccination at later 
ages.  
Premature infants are underimmunized for multiple reasons. In the general healthy infant 
population, vaccination rates are linked to a variety of factors, including socioeconomic status,8 
parental anxiety,8 and young maternal age.9 While these issues still may play a role for 
premature infants, especially considering the increased burden of prematurity among mothers of low socioeconomic status,
10 it is clear that additional factors have an impact on vaccination 
rates for premature infants hospitalized in the NICU. Some studies have shown lower birth weight to be a risk factor for under vaccination,
5,6 possibly indicating that more critical disease 
status may affect the decision to administer vaccines. On the  contrary, diagnoses of congenital 
heart disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were associated with increased vaccination rates in another study of infants discharged from the NICU.
7 It is likely that factors affecting 
vaccination rates vary according to geographic region and individual NICU.  
The perceived risk of reappearance or worsening of apnea after vaccination in premature 
infants likely contributes to under vaccination. Apnea is a common symptom noted in the NICU 
in the presence or absence of  vaccination due to apnea of prematurity. Apnea of prematurity is 
a developmental disorder characterized by cessation of breathing and often accompanied by 
bradycardia, cyanosis, or pallor. Apneic events can be divided into 3 subt ypes: central (failure of 
the infant to initiate a breath; obstructive (related to pharyngeal obstruction); and mixed 
(combination of central and obstructive). The pathogenesis of apnea of prematurity involves 
persistence of immature reflexes and immature responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. The 
incidence of apnea  is inversely proportional to the gestational age (GA) at birth, with essentially 
all infants ≤28 weeks’   gestation diagnosed with apnea and 20% of those born at 34 weeks’ gestation
.11 Most, but not all, of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels for the commonly 
administered infant vaccines mention premature infants ( Table 1 ). While none of the 
vaccinations are specifically indicated in premature infants, several labels provide warnings that 
advise of the risk of apnea following vaccination in premature infants  (Table 1). Awareness of 
this potential risk has originated from a number of retrospective and observational studies that 
have evaluated vaccination safety in premature infants ( Table 2 ). The incidence of 
cardiorespiratory events  (i.e. apnea and/or bradycardia)  following vaccination ranged from 0-
47% in these studies. Risk factors for cardiorespiratory events in some studies included lower 
gestational age and higher clinical disease severity (such as longer period of ventilation and 
presence of chronic lung disease). In several of these studies, infants served as their own 
controls, as they were observed pre- vaccination.  
The relationship between vaccination and apnea has been studied extensively but the 
evidence is inconclusive for a causal association.  While retrospective and prospective 
observational studies suggest a possible link between vaccination and apnea in premature 
infants, ther e are several inherent problems with these studies. Each study examines different 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
8 combinations of vaccinations, and they commonly have small sample sizes, use retrospective 
data, and vary in inclusion criteria and definition of adverse events. Observational studies that 
use immunized infants as their own controls also have an important flaw: clinicians are most 
likely to immunize an infant at a period of high stability. Thus, a small window of time prior to 
vaccination is likely to contain fewer cardiorespiratory events. After vaccination, infants may 
experience events associated with prematurity and disease status. Only one randomized 
controlled trial has been performed and showed no difference in prolonged apneic events 
between the immunized and control gr oups.12 Infants in this study were enrolled at 56 -60 days 
postnatal age.  However, some infants in this study received DTaP alone, while others received 
DTaP -HBV-IPV.  The variability in the evidence makes it inconclusive if the apnea described 
after vaccination in preterm infants is vaccine- related or a complication of underlying 
prematurity .

1.2 Summary & Rationale  
Premature infants are at high risk for apnea. Current published recommendations state that 
this group of infants should receive vaccinations according to chronological age, but frequently 
this does not occur. Clinicians often delay administration of vaccinations due to concern about 
the reappearance or worsening of apnea, but evidence to support a causal association is 
inconclusive. Further study is warranted to quantify the risk  and clinical importance of apnea in 
premature infants after vaccination.  
We therefore propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the risk of apnea in 
premature infants following routine vaccination. In addition, the study would provide more information about other adverse events following vaccination in the context of current US 
childhood vaccination practices.  This study will provide evidence about the risk and clinical 
importance of apnea after vaccination in preterm infants and will broaden understanding of adverse events after vaccination in the context of current US vaccination practices. A better 
understanding of the safety of routine vaccination in preterm infants will assist with clinical decision- making and anticipatory guidance to parents which may improve timely vaccination in 
preterm infants. Information from this study will also help guide future research efforts to identify 
potential risk factors and prevention strategies for apnea after vaccination.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
This study is a prospective, randomized, open -label clinical trial to assess apnea in the 48 hours  
after  randomization (“unvaccinated” group) versus 48 hours after vaccination (“vaccinated” 
group) with 13- valent Conjugate Pneumococcal Vaccine (PCV13), D iphtheria Toxoid, Tetanus 
Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (DTaP),  Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), Inactivated Polio 
Vaccine (IPV), and Haemophilus influenzae Type B Vaccine (Hib) vaccines in premature infants 
<33 weeks and 0 days gestation at birth who have been hospitalized since birth and eligible to 
receive 2- month vaccines per the ACIP schedule.30 
At least 300 infants will be enrolled over a period of 28 months at  Duke  University (Duke), 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical 
Center (CCHMC).  The first 12 infants (Duke: 4, UNC: 4, CCHMC: 4) will be enrolled in a pilot 
study to assess the feasibility of the protocol and study instruments . The remaining 288 will be 
enrolled after the pilot study; 86 infants at Duke, 86 infants at UNC and 116 infants at CCHMC.  
 
On day 1, eligible infants will be randomized 1:1 to a “vaccinated” or “unvaccinated” group. 
Infants in the “va ccinated” group will be continued on cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry 
monitoring and PCV13, DTaP,  HBV, IPV, and Hib vaccines will be given within 6 hours of 
randomization. Vaccines will be administered per ACIP recommendations .2  Infants in the 
“unvaccinated” group will be continued on cardior espiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring and 
no vaccines will be administered.  Continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
13 are standard of care procedures for infants hospitalized in NICU. The study will collect data from 
the continuous car diorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitors from randomization to 48 hours 
after randomization for infants in the unvaccinated group, and from randomization to 48 hours after vaccination for infants in the vaccinated group.  B linded analyst (s) at Duke Unive rsity will 
evaluate data recorded by  the cardiorespiratory  and pulse oximeter monitors during this time 
period to determine the occurrence of apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation.  In addition, 
information will be collected on increased respiratory support,  sepsis evaluation and serious 
adverse events.  
 For infants in the “vaccinated” group , the study will also collect adverse events of clinical 
interest and serious adverse events  occurring between the end of the 48- hour monitoring period 
and 14 days after vaccination. This information will be collected through parental report and review of medical records.

17 • Record standard of care procedures (including, but not limited to, any surgical procedures, 
eye exams, central line placements)  
• Record clinically important adverse events (including apnea) and serious adverse events  
• Of note, the unvaccinated group completes the study 48 hours after randomization.  
 
Study Days 3 -14 (Vaccinated group only)  
*This period of time (day 3- 14) will begin at 48 hours after vaccination.  
• Record clinically important adverse events (including apnea) and serious adverse events in 
vaccinated group only  
• If infant is discharged from the hospital prior to day 14, then follow -up of events 
will occur via telephone call with the parent/LAR and/or chart review of outpatient 
clinic notes  or inpatient clinic notes (if infant is rehospitalized and these are 
available) . 
 
5.3 Parent /LAR Permission Process (Informed Consent)  
The consent process will take place in the NICU or in a private conference room if preferred by 
the parent(s)/LAR(s) .  Initial discussions regarding the study may occur over the phone. Study 
staff will be available to answer all parent /LAR  questions before and after permission is 
obtained.  Parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be given as much time as needed after bei ng approached about 
their infant  participating in the study and needing to decide whether or not to participate.  We 
anticipate that the initial consent discussion, including presenting the information in the consent 
document and answering questions will t ake about 30 minutes.   Parent(s)/LAR(s)  will have the 
opportunity to take the consent form home and discuss the document with other family members or friends.  During the consent process , it will be emphasized that participation is 
voluntary and that paren ts can withdraw permission for their infant  to participate at any time.  
Permission will not be obtained from parent(s)/LAR(s)  who do not read, who are blind, or who 
do not read/understand English or Spanish. Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be given a copy of the si gned 
informed consent to take home with them.  The original copy of the consent will be kept in the 
study records and a third copy will be included in the infant ’s medical record per local 
requirements . 
 
 
5.4 Data Collection  
Study staff will collect participant data at times according to Table 1 .  
Demographic information 
The participant’s postnatal age (days), race/ethnicity, sex, and insurance payer status will be 
obtained from the electronic health record (EHR) at the time o f randomization.   
 
Birth and delivery information  
The subject’s birth and delivery information including g estational age, b irth weight, multiple birth, 
reason/indication for premature delivery will be captured from the EHR.  
 
Medical history  
The participant’s medical history including but not limited to the following (apnea of prematurity, 
respiratory support at 36+0 weeks postmenstrual age (if ≥36+0 weeks postmenstrual age at randomization) , necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage and grade, periventricular 
leukomalacia, and seizures) be captured by the EHR. Current weight will also be recorded.
 
 
Respiratory support  at time of randomization/vaccination  
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
18 Respiratory support at time of randomization in the unvaccinated group  and vaccination in the 
vaccinated group, including mode ( noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP), nasal cannula >1 liters per minute , nasal cannula <1 LPM, or none) 
and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2), will be obtained from the EHR.  
 
Concomitant medications The participant’ s exposure to all prescribed medications in the 1  week prior to  randomization will 
be obtained from the EHR.  Start and stop dates will be collected. In addition, caffeine and 
acetaminophen administration will be collected during the study period with start/stop dates.  
 
Cardiorespiratory monitoring  data capture  
All participants will have data captured from  their continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse 
oximetry monitoring after randomization.  Capture of continuous m onitoring data will begin at 
randomization and end at 48 hours after vaccination (vaccinated group) or randomization 
(unvaccinated group).  If infants i n the vaccinated group are not vaccinated by 12 hours after 
randomization, capture of monitoring data will end at 60 hours after randomization.  At the end 
of the 48-hour monitoring period, s tudy staff at all enrolling sites will collect digital or printed  
output  of data from cardiorespiratory monitors for all infants and send to the analysts at Duke 
University who will be blinded to the randomization group of the participants.   To ensure the 
analysts are blinded to the treatment arms, the data obtained from the monitor for each infant 
will not include any personal or study identifiable information. Each output will be assigned a 
non-sequential coded number before they are sent to the analysts.  The blinded analysis will 
interpret the output  and record the date, time, and duration of each cardiorespiratory event  
(apnea, bradycardia, desaturation, and severe cardiorespiratory event) as defined below.   
Procedures  
Any procedures  done as part of routine care (including, but not limited to, surgi cal procedures, 
eye exams, and central line placements) that occur beginning at randomization and ending at 
48 hours after vaccination (vaccinated group) or randomization (unvaccinated group) will be 
recorded. Procedures occurring >60 hours after randomization in the vaccinated group will not 
be recorded. Data recorded will include the type of procedure, date/time of the procedure, 
length of the procedure, and a narrative describing any other important clinical information 
regarding the procedure.

Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
21 Serious adverse events (SAEs)  (EOM 2.4)  
An SAE is defined as  an adverse event that results in one of the following outcomes during the 
infant’s participation in the study : 
• Results  in death   
• Is life -threatening (defined as im mediate risk of death  at the time of the  event)  
• Requires  inpatient hospitalization (i.e. re -admission) or prolongation of  inpatient  
hospitaliz ation   
• Results  in a persi stent or significant disability/in capacity  
• Any other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require 
hospitalization,  may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate m edical  
judgment, the  event  may jeopardize the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention to prevent  one of the  outcom es listed  above.   
Study site investigators will assess relatedness  to study procedures  and vaccines  for all S AEs 
(related, possibly related, or unrelated) .  
5.4 Reporting Adverse Events  
SAEs  will be reported to the CDC and all participating IRB s according to institutional 
requirements . 
If indicated, adverse events (AEs) will be reported to the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System (VAERS). The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act  requires healthcare 
providers to report:  
• Any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further 
doses of the vaccine; or  
• Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following 
Vaccination  [ PDF - 75KB]  that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination.  
In addition, CDC encourages report ing of  any clinically significant adverse event that occurs in a 
patient following a vaccination, even if there is uncertainty regarding if a  vaccine caused the 
event.  
 
5.5 Follow- up on days 3- 14 for infants in the vaccinated group  
*This period of time (day 3- 14) will begin at 48 hours after vaccination.  
Infants in the vaccinated group will be followed for the above clinically important AEs, SAEs, and 
concomitant medications on days 3- 14. If an infant in the vaccinated group is discharged or 
transferred prior to day 14 (with no EHR accessible), then these data will be obtained via follow -
up phone call from the study staff to the parent/guardian.   
5.6 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
This is an open -label, prospective, randomized study for infants who are eligible to receive 2-
month vaccinations. To the extent feasible, all infants randomized to the vaccinated group will 
be given the same type/brand of vaccines  at all sites . Infants in the unvaccinated group will not 
receive any vaccine during the study.  
 
5.6.1  Randomization  
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either vaccinated or unvaccinated groups  using a 
permuted block randomization scheme stratified by  gestational age (<28 weeks, ≥28 weeks) 
and study site (i.e. Duke University Medical Center , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
22 Hospital,  and Cincinnat i Children’s Hospital Medical Center). Randomization will occur within 6 
hours of anticipated vaccination of infants in the vaccinated group, but infants will be allowed to 
receive vaccines up to 12 hours post -randomization. The first 12 infants enrolled i n the Pilot 
Phase I will be randomized in a separate permuted block  by manual randomization (e.g., 
envelopes) . The project statistician at Duke University will generate permuted block 
randomization schemes, which will be uploaded to REDCap for the full study . The 
randomization schedule will not be available to the study staff, so the next randomization allocation will not be known before randomization occurs. Following confirmation of study 
eligibility criteria, participant randomization will be through RED Cap with treatment allocation 
recorded on the case report form. In the event that REDCap is unavailable, manual 
randomization will occur through the use of envelopes. The project statistician will prepare 20 
envelopes per site that will use the same random ization strategy as the primary scheme 
embedded in REDCap. When manually randomizing, the team member  will pull the next 
envelope in order. In order to capture the allocation per subject, a separate form in REDCap will 
be used by the personnel to add the assignment. A log will need to be kept at the site capturing 
these instances.  
 
5.6.2  Blinding  
This study wil l be open label and study staff, caregivers, and parent(s)/LAR(s) will not be 
blinded to treatment arm assignments. The output from the cardiorespiratory monitors will be 
read by analysts who are blinded to the treatment arm assignments.  
 
5.5.3  Vaccine Supply, Storage, and Administration  
Vaccine Supply and Storage 
Pharmacy -supplied US licensed vaccines will be administered to the vaccination group as part 
of this study. The following vaccine brands will be used for this study: PCV13 (Prevnar
® 13, 
Pfizer); DTaP -IPV-HBV (Pediarix®, GlaxoSmithKline); and Hib (ActHib®, Sanofi Pasteur). 
However, given the potential for unforeseen manufacturing issues/specific product shortages, 
the use of alternate U.S. -licensed vaccines may be required.  
  
Vaccine Administration  
Only infants randomized to the vaccinated group will be vaccinated during the protocol specified 
observation period. A single  administration  of PCV13 and DTaP -HBV-IPV and Hib co mprises  
intramuscular  delive ry of 0.5 mL total volume of each vaccine.  For each infant, a ll vaccines will 
be administered simultaneously by licensed nurses within the study sites.  Injections given in the 
same thigh should be separated by 1 inch or more, if possible, so that any local reactions can 
be differentiated.  The research staff will record vaccine brand, lot numbers, dose, date/time and 
site of vaccine administration. For continuity of care purposes, documentation of vaccine 
administration will be done in a manner that the infant’s healthcare provider can access.  
  
After  administration,  used study  syringes will be disposed of accor ding to standard operating  
procedure.  
 Although oral rotavirus vaccine is recommended by the ACIP for infants at 2- months of age, this 
vaccine will not be administered during the study to prevent  potential nosocomial spread of this 
live vaccine virus.  
 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
23 6.5 Sample Size and Power Estimation  
Power considerations related to the p rimary objective  
 The study has approximately 84.3% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in 
the proportion of infants with apnea in the “vaccinated” group compared to the “unvaccinated” 
group based on a two- side alpha 0.05 chi -square test with N=135 per group.  This assumes that 
the proportion of infants with apnea will be 15% in the “unvaccinated” group and 2- fold higher 
(30%) in the “vaccinated” group. This assumption is based on a review of the literature14 and 
expert opinion. The study allows for a 10% d rop out rate to give a total sample of 300 infants.  
During the pilot study, at least 12 infants will be enrolled to assess feasibility.  Following 
completion of the pilot study, a total of at least 288 infants will be enrolled.   
 
6.6 Analysis Plan  
 
6.6.1  Pilot Stud y 
The pilot phase of the study will include 12 infants .  There will not be any formal analysis of 
study data.  However, the feasibility benchmarks listed in Table 5 will be documented for the 
first 1 2 patients to assess protocol adherence.  These subjects will contribute to the final 
sample for analyses in the study objectives.

6.6.2  Full Study  
6.6.2.1  Study Populations  
We will define 3 study populations for the purpose of analyses.  
1) Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population 
• Definition: The ITT population includes any infant that was enrolled and 
randomized in the study . 
 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
24 • Analysis: For the ITT analysis, study outcomes in the 48- hour monitoring after 
randomization will be evaluated in both vaccinated and unvaccinated group.  
Infants will be analyzed in their assigned treatment arms irrespective of receipt of 
vaccine.  
Figure 3. Intent to Treat (ITT) Analysis  
 
 
2) Modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population  
• Definition: The mITT population includes any infant that was enrol led and 
randomized in the  study . 
• Analysis: For the mITT analysis, i nfants will be analyzed in their assigned 
treatment arms irrespective of receipt of vaccine.  Study outcomes will be included 
in the analysis as follows:  
o Vaccinated group: study outcomes in the 48 -hour monitoring after 
vaccination. If vaccination does not occur by 12 hours after randomization, 
then study outcomes will be assessed between 12 and 60 hours after 
randomization.  
o Unvaccinated group: study outcomes in the 48 -hour monitoring period after 
randomization.  
 
Figure 4. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Analysis  
 
  
      
3) Per protocol (PP)  population 
• Definition: The PP population includes any infant that was enrolled, randomized 
and did not have any major protocol violations as determined by the study 
investigators.  

Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
25 • Analysis: For the per protocol analysis, study outcomes will be included in the 
analysis as follows:  
o Vaccinated group: study outcomes in the 48 -hour monitoring after 
vaccination. The analysis will exclude infants who do not receive vaccine 
by 12 hours.  
o Unvaccinated group: study outcomes in the 48 -hour monitoring period after 
randomization. The analysis will exclude infants who are vaccinated during the study period.  
The mITT  population will be the primary analysis population for all planned analyses for the 
study objectives. For comparison, pre- specified secondary analyses will also be performed 
using the ITT and PP populations. The ITT population will only be analyzed for the primary 
and secondary objectives.  The PP population will be analyzed for all planned objectives as 
supporting analyses.  
 
6.2.2.2 Interim Safety Data Review   
Given that this study involves administering U.S.-licensed vaccines recommended by the ACIP 
for preterm infants and included as part of routine clinical care,  there will not be a designated  
data safety  monitoring board for this  study. However, due to the fragility of the study population 
and interventional design, one interim safety data review will be performed with the goal of 
identifying unexpected safety concerns of clinical importance. The safety data review will 
provide the study the opportunity to identified unexpected safety concerns and make changes to 
the protocol if needed.  The interim safety data review will be done by a safety monitoring panel  
with relevant expertise, comprised of experts who are not co- investigators on this study . The 
safety population for the interim safety review will include infants who were enrolled and randomized. Infants who participated in the pilot study will also be included. T he safety 
monitoring panel will review clinical narratives of SAEs . If the CDC and study investigators 
determine additional analyses or reviews are needed, efforts will be made to conducted additional analysis  or reviews that will not include analyzing the primary endpoint as a first step. 
This is to avoid introducing bias or increasing sample size needs for statistical power.
 
 Enrollment will continue during the interim safety data review.  
 6.2.2.3 Final study analysis  
A final analysis of the data will occur after all infants have completed the study and will  
include data from infants enrolled in the pilot study .
 
All proportions specified below in the objectives will be compared by group (unvaccinated 
group or vaccinated group) using a Mantel- Haenszel statistic in a stratified analysis by site 
(i.e. Duke, UNC and CCHM C) to control for the randomization blocks at the two- sided alpha 
0.05 level  unless otherwise specified. The odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will also be calculated and presented.   There will be no adjustment to the alpha level 
made for the secondary and exploratory objectives.  
Primary Objective 1  - To compare proportions of preterm infants with apnea in a 48 -hour 
monitoring period after vaccination in the “vaccinated” group versus a 48 -hour monitoring 
period after randomization in the “unvaccinated” group.    
The proportion of infants with ≥ 1 apneic event apnea (as defined in Section A.5.3) will be 
presented for each group and compared using a Mantel -Haenszel statistic.  
 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
26 Secondary Objective 1 - To compare the clinical importance of apneic events in a 48 -hour 
monitoring period after vaccination in the “vaccinated” group  versus a 48-hour monitoring period 
after randomization in the “unvaccinated” group.    
For this  objective we will present the proportions of infants in each group who required increase 
in respiratory support (as defined in Section A.5.3) and compare these proportions using a 
Mantel -Haenszel statistic. We will also report summary statistics regarding the number of 
distinct episodes and the duration of episodes, including mean, median, standard deviation, 
interquartile range, and range. We will compare the number of distinct episodes of apnea and 
the duration of episodes between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
 
Secondary Ob jective 2 - To compare proportions of preterm infants with severe 
cardiorespiratory events in a 48- hour monitoring period after vaccination in the “vaccinated” 
group versus  a 48-hour monitoring period after randomization in the “unvaccinated” group. 
For this  objective we will present the proportion  of infants in each group experiencing a severe 
cardiorespiratory event (as defined in Section A.5.3) or received positive pressure ventilation at 
least once during the 48 hours after randomization/vaccination and compare these proportions 
using a Mantel -Haenszel statistic.  
 
Exploratory  Objective 1 - To compare proportions of preterm infants with temperature instability 
in a 48- hour monitoring period after vaccination in the “vaccinated” group versus a 48-hour 
monitoring period after randomization in the “unvaccinated” group. 
For this  objective we will present the proportion  of infants the proportion of infants in each group 
experiencing fever and the proportion in each group experiencing hypothermia (as defined in 
Section A.5.3) at least once during the 48 hours after randomization/vaccination and compare 
these proportions using a Mantel -Haenszel statistic.  
 
Exploratory Objective 2 - To compare proportions of preterm infants with other clinically 
important adverse events in a 48 -hour monitoring period after vaccination in the “vaccinated” 
group versus a 48 -hour monitoring period after randomization in the “unvaccinated” group. 
 
For thi s objective we will present the proportion  of infants the proportion of infants in each group 
experiencing other clinically important adverse events (as defined in Section A.5.3) at least once during the 48 hours after randomization/vaccination and compare  these proportions using a 
Mantel -Haenszel statistic. We will repeat these analyses for serious adverse events. We will 
report SAE narratives and relatedness  descriptions  (see section 5.3) . 
 
Exploratory Objective 3 - To compare clinically important adverse events occurring between 48 
hours and 14 days  after vaccination among infants in the vaccinated group who do, and do not 
have apnea in a 48 -hour monitoring period after vaccination.  
For this objective we will present  the proportion of infants in the vaccinated group with and 
without apnea in a 48 -hour monitoring period who experience each of these clinically important 
adverse events (as defined in section A.5.3) at least once between 48 hours and 14 days after vaccination.  These subgroup comparisons will be conducted a Fisher’s Exact Test at the alpha 
0.05 level.   
  
6.7 Data Management  
The amount of data that will be collected for the proposed project will be substantial and will 
require a sophisticated, practical and flexible system. The novel Vanderbilt -designed resource 
developed specifically for online collection of research information, the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform, will be used to design study forms, including the reaction 
forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect information from study subjects. This 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
27 system will be used by all the study sites (i.e. Duke , UNC,  and CCHMC) .  All electronic linkages 
will fulfill regulations for protection of human subjects and requirements to minimize the risk of 
breach of confidentiality. After initial set -up, the work load required for electronic data collection 
will be substantially reduced (description of REDCap resources below).31 Duke investigator s 
have previously used the REDCap system for collection and analysis of large quantities of data. 
All study -related documents containing protected health information, e.g. enrollment logs, case 
report forms completed by study participants, will be maintained in secure research offices at 
Duke , UNC and CCHMC , which are accessible to research staff only.  
 
6.7.1  Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
Investigators within the NIH -funded Clinical and Translational Research Unit at Vanderbilt have 
developed REDCap ( http://project -redcap.org/ ), to collect and manage data for diverse clinical 
and translational research studies. REDCap was designed around the concept of giving 
research teams an easy method to specify project needs and rapidly develop secure, web-
based applications for collection, management and sharing of research data. REDCap 
accomplishes these key functions through use of a single study metadata table referenced by 
presentation- level operational modules. Based on this abstracted programming model, 
databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a single data dictionary. The concept of metadata- driven application development is 
well established, and the critical factor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple 
workflow methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related 
metadata in an efficient manner.  The product  includes secu re institutional data hosting and 
include full audit -trails in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) security requirements. The REDCap Consortium is comprised of 2318 active 
institutions.   The REDCap currently supports  68,000 projects with over 89,000 users spanning 
numerous research focus areas across the consortium.  The current project will use this 
software application for the design of electronic forms to collect information from study 
participants, to link the bas eline data, sample collection date, and laboratory results in an 
automated database family, to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, and 
to design an analytical dataset for the analysis of the project data.  
 
Data will be entered directly into the REDCap database by members of the study team  at the 
study sites.  Study investigators will be responsible for assuring that all paper records are securely stored according to the requirements of their IRBs.  The study investigators will be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the data entered from the paper forms into REDCap, as 
appropriate .  Only the assigned identifiers will be used in REDCap. Therefore, personal health 
identifiers will not appear in the REDCap database. 
 
In order to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, numerous built -in filters 
and checks for consistency of the data including range and limit checks, branching logic and pull down menus to limit choices for categorical variables to a pre -specified list will be implemented 
and performed automatically to minimize data entry error. The data will be randomly sampled and checked against source records on a regular basis. The data and related analytical 
datasets will also be stored at all the study sites (i.e. Duke , UNC,  and CCHMC) with secured 
password- protected computers. Coded data without personal identifiers  will be made available 
to the CDC and transferred using a secure transfer method.   
 
6.8 Role of the CDC Investigators in the Project  
This study is funded by a CDC contract with Duke University (and subcontract with UNC) and  
CCHMC as Task Orders in the CISA Project Contract . The Duke University PI will oversee the 
study in partnership with the CCHMC’s PI.  CDC staff will collaborate with  both sites to develop 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
28 the protocol, conduct the study, ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and 
Human Services public health priorities, and analyze the data and disseminate the results. CDC 
may receive access to coded data not containing any directly identifying information.  
 
7    HUMAN SUBJECTS  
7.5 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
 
Duke and CCHMC investigators , along with subcontractor investigators,  will be responsible for 
submitting the protocol, informed consent  and any written or verbally conveyed materials  
specific to this project to their institutional review boards.  CDC staff will be responsible for submitting materials to the CDC for review and obtain reliance on Duke IRB .   
 
 
To facilitate subject recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent and HIPAA 
authorization for ascertainment (identification, selection) and/or recruitment of potential subjects 
while recording identifiable private health information (PHI) prior to obtaining the subject’s 
consent.  This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical 
record systems in the clinics  in order to determine eligibility for study enrollment. We will review 
information  only the minimum amount of information necessary to determine potential eligibility, 
e.g. to consent will be used to recruit and screen only. Use of PHI in this manner involves no 
more than minimal risk to subjects and no information will leave the study sites . 
 
Continuing reviews will be submitted to the IRBs on an annual basis.  P rotocol deviations or 
concerns about study integrity will be reported promptly to the overseeing IRB in accordance 
with institutional requirements . 
 7.6 Sources of Material  
Medical history, vaccination history , and concomitant medication history  will be obtained from 
the EHR.  Demographic information will be obtained from the EHR or parent/LAR .  Adverse 
events will be recorded using the output from cardiorespiratory monitors (for cardiorespiratory 
events only), EHR, and/or phone call to the parent/LAR (days 4 -14).  
 7.7 Potential Risks and Benefits  
PCV13, DTaP, IPV, HBV, and Hib are US - licensed vaccines approved for use in infants ≥6 
weeks of age. These vaccines are recommended by the ACIP  for use in preterm infants .
30  
Participants will be provided with the CDC Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) for infant 2 -
month vaccinations ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/multi.pdf ).  
 Risks of the DTaP -IPV-HBV combination include m inor problems  such as soreness, redness, 
swelling , or pain where the shot was given, fever, drowsiness, irritability/fussiness, vomiting, and 
loss of appetite. Other potential adverse reactions include a small increased risk of apnea in 
premature infants.  
 
Most common risks of PCV13 include fever, injection site erythema, induration, or swelling. 
Uncommon symptoms include apnea.  
 Most common risks of Hib include injection site erythema, induration, or swelling. Uncommon 
symptoms include apnea.  
 
Problems that could happen after any injected vaccine:  
• Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis . Such 
reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and 
Apnea in Preterm Infants Following the  Version 3.0  
Administration of Routine Childhood  Vaccines   January 22, 2024  
29 would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any 
medicine, there is a  very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death.  
 There is a small potential risk that infants in the no vaccination group could develop infection 
due to one of the organisms covered by the vaccine during the 48 -hour monitoring period that 
vaccination is withheld.  After their participation in the study, the study team will communicate 
with the clinical team to facilitate vaccination of these infants in a timely manner.  
 There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality about information obtained as part of this 
study.   
 
7.8 Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 7.8.1  Protections against Risk 
Participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be counseled on possible side effects following vaccination and followed closely during the 14 days post -vaccination f or clinical status changes.  Subjects 
with a prior history of any severe reaction following HBV administration will be excluded from 
study enrollment.  
 
Infants in the unvaccinated group will complete the study 48 hours after randomization, after 
which clinicians may administer the recommended vaccines in a timely fashion, limiting the risk.  
 Every effort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. 
Computerized participant information will be kept in password- protected files on secured 
servers.  Any publications resulting from this work will not contain any identifiable participant 
information.  
 7.8.2  ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
The project will be  registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
7.9 Human Subjects  
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator and study team will comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirements, Good Clinical Practices, and ethical principles. The 
parent or LAR must sign and date the written informed consent form prior to initiation of any 
study procedure.  
 7.9.1  Vulnerable Subjects Research 
Vulnerable subjects  
Children are a vulnerable research population and require additional protections when they are 
potential research subjects. T his is a minimal risk study, involving the administration of routine 
infant  vaccinations in a manner that is consistent with ACIP recommendations.  Because this 
study is no more than minimal risk, the permission of only one parent/LAR will be obtained.   
Because the participants will be infants they will not be capable of providing assent.

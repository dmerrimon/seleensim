Com
mon Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; Version 4.0) that 
occur after Cycle 1, Day 1 combination immunotherapy
 
 
 
 
1.3
 
Exploratory Objectives
 
 
1.3.1
 
To evaluate the effects of combination of 
pembrolizumab
, GVAX, and SBRT 
upon the activation and
 
expansion of T effector cells (Teffs) infiltrating into the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) compared to data from ongoing JHU trials

or 2) immunotherapy alone
.
 
 
1.3.2
 
To monitor the 
IHC of immune parameters relevant to and the 
activation 
of
 
PD
-
L1/PD
-
1 associated immunosuppressive pathways, vaccine
-
induced immune 
regulatory signatures, and peripheral and
 
intratumoral
 
antigen specific T cell 
responses
 
after treatment with pembrolizumab,
 
CY, 
GVAX, and 
standard 
multimodality treatments
 
 
1.3.3

Study Design
 
 
This is a single
-
center, open label, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the clinical activity 
of a combination of GVAX with pembrolizumab 
in patients receiving 
standard 
chemotherapy and SBRT for LAPC.  We will enroll 
subjec
ts with LAPC 
diagnosed
 
based upon criteria from NCCN Guidelines as determined by 
review of imaging and 
pathology 
at our institutional multidisciplinary pancreatic tumor clinic and tumor 
board. 
 
The patients will 
be evaluated 
one 
to 
five weeks after having 
receive
d
 
at least 
fou
r 28
-
day cycles of
 
FOLFIRINOX 
based 
or gemcitabine/abraxane based 
chemotherapy.
 
Patients should not receive more than 8 cycles of chemotherapy prior 
to enrollment on study.
 
Patients will be e
ligible for enrollment
 
if they are free from 
metastatic disease
 
according to 
C
T
,
 
PET
, or MRI
 
imaging
 
following chemotherapy
.
 
 
Within seven weeks of 
receiving 
the 
last dose of
 
chemotherapy
, p
atients will 
subsequently undergo EUS
-
guided fiducial placement 
along with 
core biopsy of the 
pancreas tumor 
and research blood draws to evaluate for circulating tumor cells and 
other inflammatory markers
, as well as an SBRT simulation
.  
P
articipants
 
will 
then 
receive 
their first dose of 
combination immunotherapy, consisting of 
cyclophosphamide
 
(Cy) 200
 
mg/m
2
 
given intravenously (
IV
)
 
and pembrolizumab 200
 
mg
 
IV
 
on day 1
 
followed by GVAX, administered as six intradermal injections
,
 
on day 
2.  
Three weeks lat
er
, 
subjects
 
will receive their second dose of combined 
immunotherapy on the same day as initiation of SBRT (6.
6 
Gy x 5 days).  
 
 
Three 
to six weeks after completion of SBRT, patients 
will 
undergo repeat imaging 
with 
FDG
-
PET
,
 
CT
, or MRI
 
to evaluate for met
astatic disease, progression
, and/or 
surgical resectability.  
If participants are deemed a surgical candidate, they will be 
offered
 
surgical 
resection 
or 
N
ano
K
nife 
treatment
 
at Johns Hopkins Hospital
.  
If the 
Phase 2 Study of MK

patient is found to have
 
an unresectable tu
mor during surgery, research core biopsies 
will be obtained intraoperatively. 
I
f participants
 
still 
have 
locally advanced 
tumors 
they 
will 
undergo
 
an additional 
EUS
-
guided 
tumor biopsy.  
Patients who undergo Nanoknife 
treatment will have the post
-
treatment
 
biopsy obtained intraoperatively. 
Both the 
surgical group and persistent LAPC group will be treated with 
an 
additional two cycles 
of FOLFIRINOX 
based 
or gemcitabine/abraxane
 
based therapy
.  
Surgery and 
chemotherapy are considered standard of care. Patient
s will be considered off study 
between 28 days after Cycle 2 of immunotherapy and resuming Cycle 3 of 
immunotherapy, while they are receiving SOC treatment. 
If imaging or surgery had 
shown 
local progression of disease
 
or 
poor pathologic response
, 
or if che
motherapy 
intolerance has developed, 
patients who had received prior FOLFIRINOX can 
alternately receive gemcitabine/abraxane and vice versa.  
At c
ompletion of 
chemotherapy
, patients will have eligibility criteria re
-
confirmed
 
to resume
 
every 3 
week cycles 
of combination immunotherapy 
for six additional cycles or 
until 
development of distant metastases.  Participants with metastatic disease to the liver 
or 
safely biopsiable other metastases (as determined by our interventional radiology team) 
after the initi
al immunotherapy will additionally be offered biopsy of the metastatic

BACKGROUND
 
 
2.1
 
Dise
ase Type
 
 
Over 46,000 people were diagnosed with pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
 
in the United States 
in 2014
, with only a 
6.7% expected 5 year survival.
1
  
Surgical 
resection is the only potentially curative 
modality of treatment
;
 
however, 
only about 
8% of patients are deemed surgical candidates. 
 
Of even those who receive treatment,
 
79% will eventually succumb to recurrent disease.
2
  
In addition, t
he vast majorities of 
patients are considered locally advanced (involving 
adjacent vessels, nerves, and other 
structures) or 
metastatic at diagnosis
, and thus nonsurgical
.
  
Unfortunately, there is no 
established standard of care in the United States at this time for treatment of locally 
advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), and its
 
overall mort
ality is 
grim.
 
 
2.2
 
Management
 
of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
 
(LAPC)
 
Though
 
the treatment for LAPC consists of a combination of radiation therapy (RT) 
and chemotherapy, optimal treatment sequence, technique, and dosing are 
controversial
.
 
 
Chemotherapy and RT are mainly effective 
in LAPC 
at
 
improving 
local
 
control
 
and increasing the likelihood of
 
a
 
margin
-
negative resection (ECOG 
4201).
3
  
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradi
ation result in better outcomes 
when compared to other treatment sequences
.
4
  
However, conventional
 
external 
beam
 
radiation ther
apy
 
(EBRT)
 
can take up to
 
6
 
weeks
 
to complete, is given with low 
dose chemotherapy, delays full
-
dose chemotherapy, and
 
can
 
lead to
 
high rates of grade 
3
-
4 acute
 
toxicity (ECOG 4201 and FFCD).
3
, 
5
 
 
 
Recent advancements
 
in RT delivery techniques have led to
 
increased use 
of
 
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
 
due to
 
its shorter
 
duration (3
-
5 days), 
increased feasibility,
 
and
 
established
 
efficacy in other disease sites. Earlier 
studies
 
evaluating
 
SBRT
 
in patients with
 
LAPC have
 
reported
 
superior local control
 
in 
comparison with EBR
T
 
but resulted in high rates of grade
 
2
-
4 late GI toxicity.
6
 
 
A 
prospective multicenter phase II study of SBRT five fra
ctions (5
-
6.6 Gy/fraction for a 
total dose of 25
-
33 Gy) following induction gemcitabine chemotherapy in 49 patients 
with LAPC
 
was recently reported
.
7
   
The m
edian OS was 13.9 months (95% CO: 10.2
-
16.7) and metastasis free survival was 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.8
-
10.2).  The median 
local PFS was not observed and 78% were free from local progre
ssion at 1 year.   Rates 
of acute and late grade 

 
2 gastritis, fistula enteritis, or ulcer toxicities were 2% and 
11%.  Five fraction SBRT not only provided superior local control but also resulted in 
a lower toxicity profile than the single fraction SBRT
.  There was also a significant 
improvement in pain scores (p = 0.001) and n
o decrease in quality of life.  Studies 
evaluating combination chemotherapy and SBRT are ongoing.  However, the addition 
of immunotherapy may potentially provide further benefit by
 
additionally targeting 
PDAC with a completely different mechanism of action.

2.3
 
Vaccine Therapy (GVAX)
 
 
Immunotherapy has been investigated as a potential concurrent treatment mechanism 
by stimulating the immune system to recognize a diverse array of tum
or antigens. 
Vaccine therapy has been successful in stimulating immunologic killing of tumor cells 
via alternate mechanisms than that of chemotherapy or radiation.  
The GVAX pancreas 
vaccine is a combination of two irradiated, granulocyte
-
macrophage colony
-
stimulating factor (GM
-
CSF)
 
secreting allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell lines.
8
, 
9
  
GM
-
CSF 
is
 
an important cytokine in inducing the 
growth and differentiation of d
endritic 
cells, which act as antigen
-
presenting cells in 
encoding tumor antigens
.
 
 
Autologous 
GM
-
CSF secreting vaccines h
ave shown immune activation in 10
-
40% of treated 
subjects in melanoma, renal cell, prostate, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers.
10
-
12
   
However, autologous vaccines are often technically difficult to prod
uce, and so 
allogeneic GM
-
CSF vaccines have been trialed and 
shown to be safe, tolerable, and 
prime even HLA
-
incompatible CD8+ effector T cells to tumor beds.
9
, 
13
 
 
The in
itial Phase I study 
of GVAX 
in PDAC 
was a dose escalation trial 
of 
adjuvant 
vaccination in
 
14 patie
n
ts with Stage 2 or 3 disease.
9
  
Subjects received vaccination 8 
weeks following resection, then adjuvant chemoradiation, then three additional 
monthly vaccinations.  Treatment was well to
lerated, with toxicities limited to grade 1 
and 2 local reactions at the vaccine site, and self
-
limited systemic rashes, with DTH 
responses observed in 1 of 3 patients receiving 10
8
 
and in 2 of 5 patients receiving 5 x 
10
8
 
vaccine cells.  
Analysis of 60 pa
tients in a follow
-
up phase II trial of adjuvant 
GVAX 
who subsequently received a total of 5 vaccinations in addition to 
chemoradiation 
showed 86% one
-
year survival and 61% two
-
year survival.
14
  
The 
vaccine was again well tolerated, with transient local site reactions, mild eosinophilia, 
rashes, flu
-
like sy
m
ptoms (low grade fever, chills, malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, and 
fatigue).
 
 
Further studies 
have shown the boosted effect of GVAX by its combination
 
with low 
dose cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, CY) as an immune modulator.  Tumors have several 
mechanisms fo
r evading immune surveillance, including
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
tolerance 
with immunosuppressive reg
ulatory T cells (Treg).
15
-
18
   
In murine 
breast cancer models
 
treatment with CY prior to vaccination showed an enhancing effect with suppression 
of Treg and increase in 
effector T cells (Teff)
.
19
  
In a phase II trial of treatment for 
Stage IV pancreatic cancer patients, 
the combination of CY/GVAX was 
noted to be 
safe and well tolerated
 
in gemcitabine resistant metastatic pancreatic
 
cancer
, with grade 
3/4 treatment related events i
n only one of 30 subjects
.
20
  
Median survival was 2.3 
months versus 4.7 months in subjects receiving GVAX without and with CY, 
respectively
.  Pathologic evaluation revealed that there was a trend toward prolonged 
progression
-
free survival in subjects who had persistent mesothelin
-
specific T cell 
responses with therapy.  
 
 
An ongoing n
eoadjuvant trial 
and adjuvant trial 
of CY/GVAX
 
in patients with 
rese
ctable pancreatic cancer
 
(
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
showed that on

The
 
importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.
21
  
Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor
-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and 
favorable pro
gnosis in various malignancies
.  In particular, the presence of CD8
+
 
T
-
cells and the ratio of CD8
+
 
effector T
-
cells / FoxP3
+
 
regulatory T
-
cells seems to 
correlate with improved prognosis and long
-
term survival in solid malignancies such 
as ovarian, colorec
tal and pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant MEL 
and RCC.  TILs can be expanded 
ex vivo
 
and re
-
infused, inducing durable objective 
tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma
.
22
, 
23
 
 
The PD
-
1 receptor
-
ligand interaction i
s a major pathway hijacked by tumors to 
suppress immune control
.  
The normal function of PD
-
1, expressed on the cell surface 
of activated T
-
cells under healthy conditions, is to down
-
modulate unwanted or 
excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. 
The ligands for PD
-
1 
(PD
-
L1 and PD
-
L2) are constitutively 
expressed or ca
n be induced in various tumors
.
24
-
27
  
Binding of either PD
-
1 ligand to PD
-
1 inhibits T
-
cell activation triggered through 
the T
-
cell receptor.  PD
-
L1 is expressed at low levels on various 
non
-
hematopoietic 
tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD
-
L2 protein is only 
detectably expressed on antigen
-
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD
-
L2 is thought to control immune T
-
cell activa
tion in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD
-
L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T
-
cell 
function in 
peripheral tissues
.
24
  
Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD
-
L1, a variety of 
cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T
-
cell inhibitor.  
High 
expression
 
of PD
-
L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent of PD
-
L2) has been found 
to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various cancer types, including renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC),
28
 
pancreatic carcinoma
,
29
 
hepatocellular carcinoma
,
30
 
ovarian 
carcinoma
.
31
  
Furthermore, PD
-
1 has been suggested to regulate tumor
-
specific T
-
cell
 
expansion in patients with malignant 
melanoma
.
32
 
The observed correlati
on of clinical 
prognosis with PD
-
L
1
 
expression in multiple cancers suggests that the PD
-
1/PD
-
L1 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
 
Pembrolizumab
 
(previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly
-
selective 
humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction 
between PD
-
1 and its ligands, PD
-
L1 and PD
-
L2.

Pembrolizumab
 
strongly enhances T lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells from 
healthy human donors, cancer patients, and primates
.  In T

human donor blood cells, the EC50 was in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 nM. 
Pe
m
brolizumab
 
also modulates the level of interleukin
-
2 (IL
-
2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), 
interferon gamma (IFNγ), and other cytokines.  Th
e antibody potentiates existing 
immune responses only in the presence of antigen and does not nonspecifically activate 
T
-
 
cells.
 
The FDA
-
approved Q2W dose of Pembrolizumab is 2 mg/kg.  A fixed dose of 200 mg 
was, however, recommended by Merck for the Q3W s
chedule in order to synchronize 
the schedule of pembrolizumab with GVAX.  “200 mg Q3W” is currently being tested 
in multiple ongoing Merck
-
sponsored clinical studies including PN012, PN021, 
PN023, PN024, PN045, PN055, etc. (Investigator’s Brochure, Table 1
9). According to 
the PN012 study, MK

3475 200 mg Q3W is well tolerated and has a similar toxicity 
profile as the 2 mg/kg Q2W (Investigator’s Brochure, Tables 42

Rationale
 
A
ttempts to apply anti
-
CTLA4 and anti
-
PD1 agents directly to 
GI tumors and PADC
 
ha
ve
 
been limited due to their nonspecific immune modulation and 
diminished
 
reactivity in these tumor types, except in select popula
tions.  For example, though anti
-
PD1 appears to have minimal activity in patients with colorectal cancer, a subset of 
colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) disease, were noted 
incidentally to have complete response to PD
-
1 inhibi
tors
.
33
  
Pathologic 
review of those 
more sensitive
 
samples is
 
noted to have increased numbers of neo
-
antigens (to 
stimulate immune response) and tumor infiltr
ating lymphocytes (TILs).
34
  
 
GVAX administration 
has been shown to activate the
 
tumor microenvironment (TME)
 
by diminishing
 
Tregs and increas
ing
 
Teffs
.  This
 
provides
 
an opportunity 
to convert 
PDAC TME 
into an environment similar to 
t
hat observed in melanomas 
with 
infiltrating, but immunosuppressed T c
ells that may be more amenable 
to checkpoint 
inhibitors.
 
The combination of ipilimumab (CTLA
-
4
 
inhibitor) 
with GVAX in advanced 
pancreatic cancer patients is ongoing, and has shown promise in a phase I study of 30 
patients with previously treated PDAC showing median OS 3.6 v 5.7 months and 7 
versus 27% 1
-
yr OS in patients treated with ipilimumab without and with GVAX 
respectively.
35
  
H
owever, anti
-
CTL
A4 antibodies may have high
er toxicity profiles 
than PD
-
1 inhibitors.  Additionally, PD
-
1 ligand is highly expressed in a variety of 
human tumors, including 
some 
pancreatic cancer
 
and thus may be a more specific 
target.
36
 
In addition, treatment of tumors with GVAX in p
reclinical models demonstrate 
that the i
ncreased Teffs leads to 
secret
i
on of
 
interferon
-
ɤ
, which 
subsequently
 
upregulates
 
the PD
-
1/PD
-
L1 pathway
.

The
 
synerg
istic effect has
 
been 
demonstrated i

.1
 
Agent Administration
 
 
Treatment will be adm
inistered o
n an outpatient basis.  Dosing d
elays are described in 
Section 5.2
.  Subjects will receive 
two initial treatments 
of combined immunotherapy 
(pembrolizumab and GVAX) 
separated by three weeks after completing 4
-
8 
cycles of 
FOLFIRINOX 
based 
or gem
citabine
/abraxane based therapy and undergoing pre
-
screening for metastatic disease.  After receiving t
he first two cycl
es of combination 
immunotherapy and
 
SBRT, patients will be reevaluated for surgery.  If eligible for 
surgery, they will undergo traditional 
surgery 
or 
N
ano
K
nife resection
 
at Johns Hopkins 
Hospital
.  If they undergo surgery or continue to h
ave LAPC, subjects will be treated 
with two further cycles of FOLFIRINO
X 
based 
or gem/abraxane based therapy.  
Subjects who showed no obvious clinical improvement for persistent LAPC
, developed 
intolerance to their previous chemotherapy regimen,
 
or had no 
evidence of treatment 
effect on surgical resection can be offered gemcitabine/abraxane
 
based therapy
 
if they 
had previously received FOLFIRINOX or vice versa.  After completing chemotherapy, 
subjects will then start
 
on every 3 week cycles of combination im
mu
notherapy for six 
additional cycles (combined up to eight cycles of combined immunotherapy).

Patients who remain free of metastatic disease at the completion of eight cycles of 
combined immunotherapy will be eligible to enroll in the optional 
Extended 
Tr
eatment Phase
 
during which patients will receive every 3 week dosing of 
pembrolizumab for nine additional doses (total 17 doses) and every 6 month 
CY/GVAX for an additional four doses (total 12 doses).

Pe
mbrolizumab
 
(KEYTRUDA®, MK

3475) is a potent and highly
-
selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between 
PD
-
1 and its ligands, PD
-
L1 and PD
-
L2. It is FDA
-
approved for treating 
metast
atic melanoma. The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 mg/kg 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. In this study, 
pembrolizumab will 
be 
administered IV over 30 minutes at 200 mg
.
 
 
Antiemetic medications should not be routine
ly administered
 
prior to dosing 
except as indicated by patient’s prior reaction

and 
Fiducial placement
 
Treatment on this protocol requires placement of 1
-
5 gold (99.9% pure, 1
-
5 mm length, visicoils, or other) fiducials for targeting purposes.  The 
fiducial
s will be used as surrogates for targeting the daily tumor position 
during treatment. The fiducials will be placed directly into the tumor and/or 
periphery under endoscopic ultrasound or CT guidance. Fiducials may be 
implanted prior to enrollment as this i
s an acceptable standard of care 
procedure for any patient receiving radiotherapy for locally advanced 
pancreatic or periampullary cancer. Also, if a patient had an attempted 
surgical resection that was aborted, fiducials may have been implanted 
intraopera
tively, which is also allowable prior to study enrollment.

A research ultrasound (US) may be conducted at the time of 
simulation. In order to monitor the abdominal soft tissue motion, the 
Department of Radiation Oncology has developed a 4D ultrasound 
technique based on an ultrasound probe holder and a continuous 
motion monitoring software. The 4D ultrasound image is acquired by 
using a motorized 3D ultrasound probe and image continuously. 4D 
ultrasound is a new non
-
ionizing and non
-
invasive imaging tec
hnique 
that continuously monitors the tumor motion during the radiation 
treatment in real time.

Radiation dose to the adjacent normal tissue will be minimized. Based 
on an analysis of duodenal toxicity representing pooled data from 3 
previous prospective studies, the following dose constraints must be 
met: V15<9cc, V20<3cc. 
 
The duodenum (duo@PTV) as
 
defined for 
these dosing parameters includes the entire duodenum on the same 
axial plane as the PTV and duodenum 1 cm above and 1 cm below the 
PTV. 
 
 
V15 
 
and V20 are defined as the percent volume receiving 
15 Gy and 20 Gy, respectively. 
 
No more than 1cc
 
of the proximal 
duodenum or proximal stomach may exceed 33 Gy. 
 
The remainder of 
the normal tissues will be limited as follows:
 

 
Liver (excluding tumor): 
 
50% should be limited to <12 Gy
 

 
Kidney: 
 
Combined volume for both should have 75% <12 Gy
 

 
Stomach and 
duodenum: 
 
V15<9cc and V20<3cc. 
 
50% should 
be limited to <12 Gy (no more than 1 cc of proximal stomach 
can receive >33 Gy)
 

 
Spinal Cord: no more than 1cc can receive >8 Gy
 
6)
 
No more than 1cc of the PTV can receive >130% of the prescription 
dose (4290cGy for 
6.6Gy x 5).
 
7)
 
Greater than 90% of the PTV should receive 100% of the prescription 
dose (3300cGy for 6.6Gy x 5; 2500cGy for 5Gyx5).
 
8)
 
If above constraints cannot be achieved, then 100% of the GTV must 
receive at least 25 Gy (an allowed minor deviation, which wi
ll be 
documented).
 
9)
 
When the research 4D ultrasound is used during the simulation, the 
US probe in the CT will be contoured and we will avoid placing any 
radiation beams directly through the ultrasound probe.
 
 
If this constraint cannot be met, the patient s
hould be removed from 
the
 
protocol.

Definition of an Overdose for t
his Protocol
 
 
Overdose
 
of pembrolizumab
 
is defined as:
 
The patient has taken (accidentally or intentionally) a dose exceeding the dose 
prescribed in the protocol by 20%.
 
No specific information is available on the treatment 
of overdose of 
pembrolizumab
. In the event of overdose, 
pembrolizumab
 
should be 
discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.
 
 
If an adverse experience(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of test dr
ug 
or vaccine, the adverse experience(s) is reported as a serious adverse experience, even 
if no other criteria for serious are met.
 
If a dose of test drug or vaccine meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symp
toms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose 
is reported as a non
-
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology 
“accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse experien
ce must be reported within 
24 hours to 
the Sponsor and Merck Global Safety.  Merck Global Safety (GS) contact 
information can be found in

Contraception, Use in Pregnancy, Use in Nursing
 
 
4.6
.1 Contraception
 
 
The investigational agents
 
ma
y have adverse effects on a fetus 
in utero
.  Furthermore, 
it is 
not known if 
the investigational agents have
 
transient adverse effects on the 
composition of sperm.  
Non
-
pregnant, non
-
breast
-
feeding women may be enrolled if 
they are considered highly unlike
ly to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined 
as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is 
≥45 years of age and 
has not had menses for greater than 2 years will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) 
amenorrheaic for <2 years w
ithout a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and with a 
documented FSH value in the postmenopausal range, or 
4) not heterosexually active 
for the duration of the study, or 5) heterosexually active and willing to use 2 methods 
of birth control (which is also requ
ired for the female partners of male patients). The 2 
birth control methods can be 2 barrier methods 
or 
a barrier method plus a hormonal 
method to prevent pregnancy, used throughout the study starting with 
Visit 1
through 
120 days after the last dose of study medication.  
Male patients enrolled in this study 
must also agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with Visit 1 
through 120 days after the last dose of study drug
.
 
 
The following are consider
ed adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, 
condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  
Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed 
contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen
 
and/or a progestational agent (including 
Phase 2 Study of MK

28
oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).
 
 
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown 
risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the s
tudy.  In order 
to participate in the study they 
must adhere to the contraception requirement (described 
above) for the duration of the study.  
If there is any question that a patient will not 
reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that p
atient should not be 
entered into the study.
 
 
4.6.2
 
Use in Pregnancy
 
 
The investigational agents
 
may have adverse effects on a fetus; therefore, women with 
a positive pregnancy test at screening will not be eligible for enrollment.  If a patient 
inadverten
tly becomes pregnant while on treatment with 
combination immunotherapy
, 
the patient will immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the 
patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been 
completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor 
and to Merck Global Safety without delay.  The outcome must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours and to Merck Global Safety if the outcome is a serious adverse 
experience (e.g.
, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life
-
threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  If a male patient’s partner 
becomes pregnant on study the pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor and to 
Merck Global Safety as describ
ed in 
Section 
6.5.1
.  The study Investigator will make 
every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the 
condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety.
 
 
4.6.3
 
Use in Nursing Women
 
 
It is unknown whether 
the investigational agents are
 
excreted in human milk.  Since 
many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast
-
feeding are not eligible fo
r 
enrollment.
 
 
4.7
 
Unacceptable Toxicities
 
 
 
Unacceptable toxicities are defined as:
 

 
Treatment
-
related 
≥ grade 4 AEs, or 
 

 
Treatment
-
related grade 3 AEs that do not improve to 
≤ grade 2 under therapy 
within 2 weeks.
 

 
≥ grade 2 eye pain or reduction of visual
 
acuity that does not respond to topical 
therapy and does not improve to 
≤ grade 1 severity within 2 weeks of starting 
therapy, or requires systemic therapy
 
 
Exceptions include:
 

 
Alopecia
 

 
Asymptomatic amylase/lipase elevation

Unexpected Grade 3 or greater 
laboratory abnormalities should be repeated within 24
-
72 hours if clinically indicated and monitored as necessary to determine if event meets 
toxicity criteria.
 
 
The proportion of unacceptable toxicities will be monitored. If the toxicity levels 
are 
unacce
ptable (high probability that it is >45
% of subjects), then enrollment will be 
suspended until further review and consideration by the IND Sponsor
 
and MEC
. 
 
 
The proportion of treated subjects with unacceptable toxicity will be monitored using 
a Bayesian stopping guideline.  Subjects will initially be 
staggered
 
until 6 subjects h
ave 
been treated 
and followed for 
4 weeks after the completion of SBRT, which trans
lates 
to 7.5
-
8 weeks after the start of treatment and includes 2 cycles of GVAX/pembro plus 
5 days of SBRT. 
A Beta (2, 
5
) prior, re
presenting a toxicity rate of 29
%, a slightly 
conservative estimate, was used in the development of our guidelines.  The ther
apy will 
be re
-
evaluated if the posterior probability that 
the toxicity rate exceeds the 45
% 
boundary is greater than 50%.  Once the initial cohort of 
6
 
subjects has been recruited 
and followed for at least 
fo
u
r weeks after the completion of SBRT
, toxicity
 
will be 
monitored continuously.  
If 
4
 
or more subjects experience unacceptable toxicities 
during the toxicity assessment period in the first 6 subjects, accrual will be suspended 
until the toxicity levels have been determined to be acceptable.  Then, the 
remaining 
participants will be enrolled and monitored routinely.

boundaries for unacceptable toxicities.

Table 5: 
Pembrolizumab Dose Delay and Discontinuation Criteria
 
 
General instructions:
 
1.
 
Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.
 
2.
 
For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 
or 0 and corticosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if 
AE does not resolve within 12 
weeks of las
t dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to 
≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks. 
 
3.
 
For severe and life
-
threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid. Other 
immunosuppressive treatment should b
e initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
 
 
This study will use the descriptions and gradi
ng scales found in the revised National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 for adverse 
event reporting that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by 
investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory 
test or other 
means, will be collected, recorded, a
nd followed as appropriate. 
 
 
The PI has the primary responsibility for continuous internal monitoring for safety, protocol 
compliance, and identification, grading, coding, and required reporting of all an
ticipated and 
unanticipated adverse events and protocol problems. Although this responsibility is usually 
shared among the PI, research nurse, and data manager, the PI is ultimately responsible for 
grading and attribution of all events.

All adverse events experienced by subjects will be collected and reported from the first dose 
of the investigational agent, throughout the study, and will only be followed for 
30
 
days unless 
related to the investigational agent.  
All Serious 
A

E
vents
 
(SAEs) 
will be co
llected for 
90
 
days after the end of treatment
 
or until a new antineoplastic treatment is initiated, whichever 
occurs first
.
 
 
Subjects who have an ongoing adverse event related to the study procedures and/or 
medication(s) may continue to 
be periodically contacted by a member of the study staff until 
the event is resolved or determined to be irreversible by the investigator.
 
 
Patients who experience a Grade 2 or higher irAE should be discussed with 
the IND Sponsor
. 
In addition, 
irAEs listed
 
in 
Section 
6.1.3
 
must be reported as an Event of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety
 
even if no Serious Adverse Event 
Criteria are met.
 
 
Laboratory abnormalities:
 
Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will be 
recorded as pre
-
treatment signs and symptoms. After study treatment administration, 
all grade 
3 and 4 clinical laboratory results that represent an increase in severity from baseline will be 
reported as adverse events. A grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported 
as an adverse event only if it is considered clinically significant by the investigator.

Definitions
 
 
6
.1.1 
Adverse Event (AE)
 
 
Adverse event is defined as 
any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
occurring after starting the study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not 
considered to be related to the study. An undesirable medical condition can be 
symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g.
, 
tachycardia, enlarged liver) or 
the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g.
, 
laboratory findings, 
electrocardiogram). Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the study 
treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the 
study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events
 
occurring before starting the study treatment but after signing the informed 
consent form will 
not 
be recorded. 
Additionally, expected progression of the 
disease being studied will not be recorded as an adverse event. 
Abnormal 
laboratory values or test re
sults constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy.

.1.2
 
Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE)
 
 
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
which: 
 
• Results in death

• Is life threat
ening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe) 
 
•
 
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of 
existing 
hospitalization (see note below for exceptions) 
> 24 hours
 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 
• 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (note: reports of congenital
 
anomalies/birth defects must also be reported on the Pregnancy Supplemental 
Form) 
 
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life
-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based 
upon appropriate
 
medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other 
serious outcomes listed in the definition above.). Examples of such events 
include, but are not limited to, intensi
ve treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization.)
 
•
 
Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)
 
•
 
Is associated with an overdose
 
 
Events 
not 
considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for the: 
 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
or to 
facilitate a procedure
 
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status
 
(eg, routine colonoscopy) 
 
• Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and 
was planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is 
required in these cases 
 
• Admission encountered for another life circums
tance that carries no bearing on 
health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, 
economic inadequacy, care
-
giver respite, family circumstances, 
administrative).

Handli
ng of Expedited Safety Reports
 
 
In accordance with local regulations, the Sponsor will notify investigators of all SAEs 
that are unexpected (i
.e.
 
not previously described in the Investigator Brochure), and 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to
 
pembrolizumab
 
or CY/GVAX
. This 
notification will be in the form of an expedited safety report (ESR) that is to be faxed 
to the investigators and the study coordinators within 48 hours. Upon receiving such 
notices, the investigator must review and retain t
he notice with the Investigator’s 
Brochure and where required by local regulations, the investigator will submit the ESR 
to the appropriate IRB. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent 
requires revision. The investigator should also
 
comply with the IRB procedures for 
reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of ESRs by the 
investigator to Health Authorities should be handled according to local regulations.

.1.2
 
Mode of Action
 
 
CY is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to 
the nitrogen mustards. CY 
is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed 
function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of 
susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. The mecha
nism of action is thought 
to involve cross
-
linking of tumor cell DNA.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Add th
e 
diluent to the vial and shake it vigorously to dissolve. If the powder fails to dissolve 
immediately and completely, it is advisable to allow the vial to stand for a few minutes. 
Use the quantity of diluent shown below to constitute the product:

Stability
 
 
CY 
(prepared for either direct injection or infusion) is chemically and physically stable 
for 24 hours at room temperature or for 6 days in the refrigerator; it does not contain 
any antimicrobial pre
servative and thus care must be taken to assure the sterility of 
prepared solutions.
 
 
7
.1.8
 
Route of Administration
 
 
CY is 
administered by IV injection over 30 minutes.
 
 
7
.1.9
 
Subject
 
Care Implications
 
 
During treatment, the 
subject
’s hematologic profile 
(particularly neutrophils and 
platelets) should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic 
suppression.
 
 
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of CY reportedly are increased by 
chronic administration of high doses of pheno
barbital. The physician should be alert 
for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving CY even 
though CY has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other 
cytotoxic drugs. CY treatment, which causes a marked
 
and persistent inhibition of 
cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of succinylcholine chloride. If a 
subject
 
has been treated with CY within 10 days of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist 
should be alerted.
 
 
CY may interfere with normal wou
nd healing.

Patient Care Implications
 
 
Based on results from the nonclinical studies, there are currently no specific safety 
considerations. 
Pembrolizumab
 
is a humanized monoclonal Ab. Thus far, serious 
infusion reactions have been infrequent and manageable. However, subjects should be 
closely monitored for potential adverse reactions during antibody infusion and potential 
adverse events throughout the stud
y. In the event that a subject experiences an allergic 
reaction to 
pembrolizumab
, treatment (i.e., vasopressors, H2
-
blockers, antihistamines, 
H1
-
blockers, steroids) should be administered, as appropriate, and prophylaxis should 
be considered. Surveillance 
for the appearance of HAH is included in all protocols.
 
 
Pembrolizumab
 
has the same mechanism of action as BMS 936558. Preclinical studies 
have suggested similar potency, and PK modeling has suggested similar human PK. 
Accordingly, the adverse events obser
ved with BMS 936558 may serve as in indicator 
for the adverse events to expect for 
Pembrolizumab
 
in cancer patients. Immune
-
related 
AEs (irAEs) are of special interest because of the mechanism of action of anti
-
PD
-
1 
and prior experience with anti
–
CTLA
-
4 mA
bs. Up to the cut
-
off date for this IB, the 
only possibly irAEs included pneumonitis (Grade 2), arthralgia and myalgia. One case 
of intestinal perforation was not considered immune related.
 
 
Overall, 
pembrolizumab
 
has been safe and well tolerated. However,
 
prompt 
identification of irAEs and appropriate treatment (e.g. withdrawal of study medication 
and treatment with corticosteroids) will be critical to optimizing the therapeutic index. 
Individual protocols outline specific guidance for prompt identificatio
n and treatment 
of irAEs. Timely discussions of how to manage irAEs is also encouraged.

In order to minimize the need for research
-
only in
-
person visits, telemedicine visits may be 
substituted for in
-
person clinical trial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where determined
 
to 
be appropriate and where determined by the investigator not to increase the participants risks. 
Prior to initiating telemedicine for study visits the study team will explain to the participant, what 
a telemedicine visit entails and confirm that the stu
dy participant is in agreement and able to 
proceed with this method. Telemedicine acknowledgement will be obtained in accordance with 
the Guidance for Use of Telemedicine in Research. In the event telemedicine is not deemed 
feasible, the study visit will p
roceed as an in
-
person visit. Telemedicine visits will be conducted 
using HIPAA compliant method approved by the Health System and within licensing 
restrictions.
 
 
After completing two cycles of combination immunotherapy and SBRT, subjects will be 
evaluated
 
for surgical resectability 
at multidisciplinary tumor board (
based upon 
clinical 
health status and resectability as per NCCN guidelines
) 
and presence of distant metastatic 
disease
 
 

 
If subjects are deemed to have developed resectable tumors, they will unde
rgo 
traditional or 
NanoKnife intervention
. If the patient will undergo NanoKnife 
treatment, the post
-
treatment biopsy will be obtained intraoperatively.
*
 
*Note: Surgery date should be determined and posted within 14 days after post
-
immunotherapy/SBRT 
evaluation
 
 

 
If subjects are deemed to still have LAPC, they will 
have
 
a repeat endoscopic 
core biopsy of the remaining tumor
.
 
 

 
If a subject is noted to have developed metastases to the liver
 
or other safely 
biopsiable metastases
, they will be offered biops
y of th
e metastases
.
 
 
Subjects without metastatic disease will then receive two further cycles of FOLFIRINOX 
based 
or gemcitabine/abraxane based chemotherapy either:
 
 

 
Within 14 days after post
-
immunotherapy/SBRT evaluation for LAPC
 
 

 
Within 4
-
10 
weeks posto
peratively for subjects who undergo surgical 
resection
 
 
 
Subjects who up to this point had shown evidence of local progression of disease
, 
developed intolerance to their previous chemotherapy regimen,
 
or showed minimal 
pathologic response who had previousl
y received FOLFIRINOX will be then eligible for 
gemcitabine/abraxane for two cycles, and vice versa.
 
 
After chemotherapy completion, subjects will then undergo repeat examination 
and re
-
screening for eligibility to receive fu
r
ther
 
immunotherapy as per the below schedule:

Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
 
 
 
All measurements should be taken and
 
recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before
 
the beginning of the 
treatment.
  
Subjects will be evaluated for an
ti
-
tumor effect by follow
-
up 
imaging 
(pancreas protocol CT
, CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis,
 
PET
-
CT imaging
, and/or non
-
contrast CT chest and MRI Abd/pelvis
) as outlined above. All subsequent scans 
(post
-
treatment) will be compared to the same pretreatment CT
,
PET/CT
, 
or MRI
 
that was used 
prior to initiating of study treatment
.
 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow
-
up. 
Imaging
-
based evaluation is preferred to
 
evaluation by clinical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
 
 
Conventional CT and MRI:
 
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice the slice thickne
ss.  MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved 
in MRI, which greatly
 
impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  
Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI 
is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be 
optimized for the evaluation 
of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with 
CT, the modality used at follow
-
up should be the same as was used at baseline and 
the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.    Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used
 
and the image acquisition protocol should be 
followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed 
with breath
-
hold scanning techniques, if possible.

Monitoring
 
 
This is a 
low risk
 
study under the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive 
Cancer Center (SKCCC)
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP, 2/21/19)
. Data 
monitoring of this protocol will occur on a regular basis with the frequency dependent 
on the rate of subject accrual and the
 
progress of the study.
 
 
The protocol will be 
monitored internally by the Principal Investigator. The protocol will be monitored 
externally by the SKCCC CRO in accordance with SKCCC guidelines. Additional data 
and safety monitoring oversight will also be p
erformed by the SKCCC Safety 
Monitoring Committee (SMC 
-
 
as defined in the DSMP) and a Medical Expert 
Committee (MEC) as detailed below.
 
 
 
The Medical Expert Committee (MEC) for this clinical study contains three medical 
oncologists from other disciplines 
who are not affiliated with this clinical trial protocol. 
The MEC will review safety data on at least a semi
-
annual basis. The MEC will provide 
a written summary of each assessment to the IND Sponsor after each meeting. In turn, 
the study team will forward
 
these summaries to the JHU and other participating site 
IRBs and JHU SKCCC SMC. The operating plan of the MEC will be as follows: 
 

 
Meetings will be held at least semi
-
annually, and potentially more frequently if 
needed. 
 

 
Meetings will be conducted in
-
pers
on or via video/teleconference, with a 
participant sign
-
in sheet collected at each meeting. 
 

 
Approximately one week prior to each MEC meeting, the study team will submit 
the following items to MEC personnel for review and discussion at the meeting 
(The PI 
may join the MEC meeting in order to answer any questions the MEC might 
have): 
 
o
  
 
A summary of the clinical trial’s progress to date; 
 
o
  
 
The latest IRB
-
approved consent document; 
 
o
  
 
A summary of all adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and
 
withdrawals to date;

Note that the MEC reserves the right to halt trial accrual or all study activity if, after 
review, serious safety concerns warrant this action. If the MEC halts study accrual or 
all study activity, then the study team must notify th
e JHU SKCCC SMC, JHU IRB, 
JHU IBC, RAC, and the FDA immediately.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
All statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS

 
version 9 or higher or R version 3.0 or 
higher. All statements of statistical significance will be based upon a 2
-
tailed test with an 
overall 0.05 level of significance and all confidence intervals will be 95%.  
 
 
Descriptive summaries
 
for categorical variables will include counts and percentages.  
Descriptive summaries of continuous variables will include means, medians, standard 
deviations, and minimum and maximum values.  Where applicable, comparisons between 
groups will be made usin
g a Chi
-
square test or logistic regression for binary variables and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables.  Non
-
parametric alternatives such as 
Fisher’s exact test or Kruskal
-
Wallis tests will be considered as need.  Time to event outcomes 
will be analyzed using Kaplan
-
Meier estimates, log
-
rank tests, and Cox
-
proportional hazards 
models.  Analysis for variables collected repeated over time (e.g. quality of life outcomes) 
will include paired t
-
tests and linear mixed effects models to account 
for the within
-
person 
correlation.
 
 
Additional post hoc statistical analyses not specified in the protocol, such as alternative 
modeling approaches may be completed.

Study Design/Endpoints
 
 
 
This is a single center, open
-
label, phase 2 study to evalu
ate the activity of combination 
pembrolizumab, CY, and GVAX in subjects with locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and possible surgical therapy.
 
 
The primary endpoint is distant metastasis free surviv
al (D
MFS)
, which is defined 
above in 
Section 10.1
.
 
 
Secondary endpoints include overall survival, immune

Sample Size/Accrual Rate
 
 
Distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) is defined as the time from 
start of 
immunotherapy
 
until distant recurrence or death
, whichever occurs first
.  Individuals 
who do not experience an event will be censored at the date of the last scan.  In the 
recent 
Phase II study, the median DMFS was 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.8
-
10.2) based 
upon 46 patients
7
.  Assuming an enrollment period of 12 months and a minimum 
follow
-
up of 24 months (i.e. a total trial period of 3 years), a total of 54 evaluable 
participants in the new study will provide 80% power to detect an increase in median 
DMFS from the 
previous
ly 
observed control rate of 7.7 months to 13.6 months (HR = 
0.60) with a two
-
sided type I error rate of 0.05.  
 
 
P
articipants in the current study will be considered evaluable if they 
have completed 
two doses of combination immunotherapy and have received 
a follow
-
up scan
.  
 
 
Each year, approximately 250 patients with 
newly diagnosed 
locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer 
are
 
seen at JHH. Approximately, 50% of these patients will 
potentially be enrolled in clinical trials.  We estimate 
that we could
 
complete th
e accrual 
goal within one year. 
The expected number of events under the alternative hypothesis 
is 39
.
 
 
 
12
.

Analysis of Primary Endpoints
 
 
The evaluable population includes all subjects who have completed at least two doses 
of combination immunotherapy 
and have received at least one follow
-
up scan.
 
 
Kaplan
-
Meier estimates of the survival function will be used to graphically display 
DMFS
 
over time 
and
 
to provide estimates of the median DMFS plus 1
-
 
and 2
-
year 
proportions.  
The new combination will be cons
idered to have significantly increased 
DMFS if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the median DMFS is above 
the observed control rate of 7.7 months.   The effect of demographic, disease, and 
immunologic risk factors on DMFS will be evaluated 
using Kaplan
-
Meier estimates, 
log
-
rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models.
 
 
Although not powered for direct comparison of the primary outcome, exploratory 
analyses comparing DMFS for the current trial and the recently completed phase II 
study used 
to determine the reference control will be performed.  
Log
-
rank tests and 
Cox proportional hazards models will be used to compare DMFS between studies
.

We will include a preplanned subgroup analysis excluding those patients found to have 
metastatic disea
se intraop
eratively
 
that was not identified on pre
-
surgical imaging as 
they likely had existing metastatic disease and exact DMFS time period is 
indeterminate.

Analysis of Secondary 
and Exploratory 
Endpoints
 
 
As with the primary outcome, the evaluab
le populations includes all subjects who 
completed the initial round of chemotherapy treatment and received at least one follow
-
up scan.  
OS and LPFS (as defined in 
S
ection 10.1
) 
will be analyzed using the 
techniques described for the primary outcome.
  
 
 
S
ubsequent surgical resectability will be determined by review of imaging 
and review 
of the subject’s 
surgical
 
candidacy 
(clinical status and tumor status) 
at our multi
-
disciplinary tumo
r board as per NCCN guidelines
 
after completion of SBRT
.
42
  
Patho
logic response will be grad
ed 
after surgical resection or biopsy w
ith comparisons 
of pre
-
and post
-
immunotherapy core biopsies or surgical samples.
  
For each outcome, 
the proportion will be calculated with an exact 95% confidence interval.   Individuals 
who drop out of the study due 
to treatment toxicity or other causes prior to outcome 
assessment will be counted as not resectable and non
-
responders.  Logistic regression 
will be used to assess the impact of risk factors on each outcome. Time to event 
analyses will be used to assess th
e timing of resection and response.
 
 
Quality of life will be assessed via EORTC QLQ
-
C30
/Pan26
 
(v3.0) questionnaire
.
 
Our 
study population is pancreatic cancer subjects, and the analysis will be focused on 
Global Health Status/QoL scale, symptom scale (fatigue, pain), and functional scale 
(physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning)
 
comparing data from
 
initiation of treatment, with each immunotherapy, and after SBRT
. For each module, 
summary statistics of the score will be reported as baseline and follow up time. Changes 
of quality of life score before and after treatment will be tested via pai
red t
-
tes
t. In 
addition, mixed
 
effect models will be fitted for a
ss
essing 
the pattern 
of 
quality of life 
over time. The frequency 
and proportion 
of patients who reach minimal clinically 
important difference 
(MCID) 
of 10
-
points change from baseline will be tabulated
 
by 
time. 
Logistic mixed effects models will be used to track the proportion over time.  
The 
time to definitive deterior
ation in quality of life, defined as a decline of 10 points or 
more, will be
 
analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method. 
 
 
Genomic 
sequencing library construction, whole genome/exome sequencing, whole 
transcriptome sequencing, microbial sequencing, neoepitope prediction, mutation 
burden, and bioinformatic analysis will be performed either at an on
-
campus laboratory 
or at an off
-
campus
 
sequencing service. All the samples will be de
-
identified before 
sending to any laboratory for sequencing.  The FASTQ files, BAM files and VCF files 
will be generated and analyzed.
 
Results from the sequencing studies will not be 
released to the patients. 
These studies are for research purposes only and are not using

Safety Analysis
 
 
The safety analysis will be performed in all treated subjects. 
A complete list of all AE 
data will be provided along with an assessment of grade and relationship to study drug.  
The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by subgroups of interest (e.g. grade 3 or higher, 
organ class, relationship to study drug).  For analy
ses at the individual level, the highest 
grade and relationship to study drug will be assumed if multiple events have occurred.   
Toxicity will be tabulated by type and grade.
 
Negative binomial regression and Cox 
proportional hazards models will be used to assess the rate and time to first toxicity, 
respectively.
 
 
12.5.1 Post
-
Operative Complications
 
 
The monitoring rule 
will focus on Grade IIIa 
post
-
operative
 
complication
s
 
or a
bove, which 
is beyond what may be expected for chemotherapy or resection without immunotherapy
,
 
and that may be attributable to the immunotherapy drugs (any component of 
Cy/GVAX/
Pembrolizumab). 
The proportion of subjects with 
post
-
operative complications 
(
Grade IIIa or above) 
resulting from immunotherapy will be 
monitored 
using a Bayesian 
stopping guideline.
 
 
A 
post
-
operative complications (Grade IIIa or above) 
level 40% would 
be considered the upper boundary
 
for acceptable toxicity
.
 
 
We expect the actual 
p
ost
-
operative complications (Grade IIIa or above) 
level to be 
approximately 
26%.
 
 
A Beta (2.5, 
5.5) prior, representing a 
post
-
operative complications (Grade IIIa or above) 
rate of 31% 
(sli
ghtly above our expected rate), 
will be used to be conservative.
 
 
A
fter the first 6 patients 
have had surgery treatment, safety will be monitored continuously.
 
 
If th
e posterior 
probability that the percentage of post
-
operative complications (Grade IIIa or above) 
exceeds 40% 
is 
greater than
 
0.5,
 
 
then enrollment will be s
uspended until further 
review 
and consideration by the PI, 
IND Sponsor
, and MEC.
 
 
If the PI, IND sponsor and the 
surgical co
-
investigators determine that it is safe to do so (e.g. unrelated to study treatment, 
reversible/treatable complications), the trial may resume once updated treatment and 
monitoring plans have been developed and ap
proved by the MEC, IRB and other oversite 
agencies. 
 
Table 1
 
shows the number of

The probability of triggering the stopping guidelines was assessed for a range of possible 
true 
unacceptable surgical 
toxicity rates using simulati
ons with 5000 replicates (
Table

)
.
  
The probability 
of stopping to re
-
evaluate was 19.4
% if the true proport
ion with an 
unacceptable 
immunotherapy toxicity was 26
%
, the expected value
.  In comparison, the 
proba
bility of stopping early is 90%
 
if the true proportion with
 
an unacceptable 
immunotherapy toxicity was 45
%
, respectively.

Biomarker Analysis
 
 
Potential relationships between biomarker data and efficacy or safety endpoints will be 
investigated
 
as part of an analysis plan aimed at identifying baseline biomarkers that 
may be used to prospectively identify subjects likely (or not likely) to respond to
 
combination pembrolizumab, CY, and GVAX,
 
and to identify subjects who may be 
predisposed to having adverse reactions to treatment. These exploratory predictive 
biomarker analyses will be completed with biomarkers measured in blood and in tumor 
samples and will focus 
on factors outlined 
in the ex
ploratory objectives. Similar 
analyses will be completed with peripheral blood samples. We will also explore 
standard protein biomarkers such as CA19
-
9 and other exploratory circulating 
biomarkers. 
As with the primary outcome, the evaluable populations inc
ludes all 
subjects who completed the initial two cycles of immunotherapy and received at least 
one follow
-
up scan.
 
 
Comparison in pre
-
 
and post
-
treatment biomarker data will be compared using paired 
t
-
tests (or Wilcoxon signed rank tests if appropriate) an
d McNemar’s tests for 
dichotomous or categorical variables.  Associations between immune parameters will 
be explored graphically (e.g. scatterplots, boxplots) and numerically (e.g. correlations, 
Fisher’s exact tests).  Mixed effects models will be used to 
assess the patterns in 
biomarkers over time.
 
 
Efficacy measures will include OS and standard and immune criteria of response and 
PFS. Demographic and case
-
history factors will be examined to determine whether 
stratification or adjustments should be made wi
thin the subsequent statistical analyses, 
and if necessary, the appropriate stratification or adjustment will be made. Biomarkers 
will be summarized graphically as they relate to efficacy and safety endpoints, as 
applicable. Summary statistics will be tabu
lated. The relationships between binary 
measures (e.g. response) 
and time to event outcomes (e.g. OS) 
and candidate 
biomarkers will be investigated using logistic regression
 
and Cox proportional hazards 
regression, respectively
. Associations will be summar
ized in terms of point and interval 
estimates of hazard ratios, odds ratios, or other statistics, as appropriate for the analyses 
completed. Models to predict clinical activity based on combinations of biomarkers 
may also be investigated.

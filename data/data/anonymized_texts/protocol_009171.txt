TITLE:  A Placebo-Controlled, Double-Bl ind, Randomized, Phase 2 Dose-Finding Study to 
Evaluate the Effect of Obicetrapi b as an Adjunct to High-Intensity Statin Therapy 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  TA-8995-201 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  Obicetrapib 
PHASE:  2 
INDICATION:  Dyslipidemia 
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy  of obicetrapib, compared to placebo,
at Day 56 in decreasing low-dens ity lipoprotein cholesterol (LD L-C) as an adjunct to 
high-intensity statin therapy. The secondary objectives of this study include the following: 
 To evaluate the effect of obicetrapib, compared to placebo, at Day 56 on apolipoprotein B 
(ApoB), non-high-density  lipoprotein choles terol (non-HDL-C), a nd high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), as an adj unct to high-intensity statin the rapy; 
 To assess the mean plasma level s of obicetrapib at steady state  on Days 56, 84, 112, and 161;
and 
 To evaluate the safety and toler ability profile of obicetrapib.  
POPULATION: The population for this study includes men and women 18 to 75 y ears of age, inclusive, with a 
body mass index <40 kg/m
2, fasting LDL-C levels >70 mg/d L, and triglyceride levels <400 mg/dL
at the Screening Visit, who are  currently receiving high-intensity statin therapy. 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: This study will be a placebo-co ntrolled, double-blind, randomiz ed, Phase 2 dose -finding study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of obicetrapib as an adjunct to high-intensity statin 
therapy. This study will take place at approximately 20 sites i n the United States.   
Screening Period 
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), participants will be required  to sign an informed consent form 
(ICF) before any study-related procedures are performed. After signing the ICF, participants will 
be assessed for study eligibility. Treatment Period 
Up to 2 weeks after the Screeni ng Visit, participants will return to the site on Da y 1 (Visit 2) and 
confirm stud y e l i gibilit y before bein grandomize dand be ginnin g treatment.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 Approximately 114 eligibl e participants (38 participants per tr eatment group) wil l be randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 5 mg obicetrapib (one 5 mg obicetr apib tablet + 1 placebo table t); 
 10 mg obicetrapib (two 5 mg obi cetrapib tablets); or 
 Placebo (2 placebo tablets). 
During the 8-week Treatment Period, the assigned study drugs will be administered by the 
participants orally and once daily on Day 1 to Day 56. Participants will return to the site every 4 weeks for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessme nts. Participants, Investigators, 
the Clinical Research Organization, and the Sponsor will be bli nded to all lipid results from Day 1 
(Visit 2) for the first particip ant through database lock in or der to protect blinding to treatment 
assignment. 
Safety Follow-Up Period 
Participants will return to the site for a Safety Follow-up Vis it (Visit 5) approximately 4 weeks 
after the end of the T reatment Period for sa fety and PK assessm ents.  
Pharmacokinetic Period 
Participants will return to the si te for 2 PK Visits (Visits 6 and 7) approximately  8 and 15 weeks, 
respectively, after the end of t he Treatment Period for safety and PK assessments.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: The study drugs used in this study are as follows: 
 5 mg obicetrapib tablet; and 
 Matching placebo tablet. 
The study drugs listed above will be packaged to provide doses of 5 or 10 mg obicetrapib or 
placebo only. Participants will be randomized to receive 1 of t he 2 doses of obicetrapib or placebo
only. Two tablets of study drugs w ill be administered by the pa rticipant orally a nd once daily on 
Day 1 to Day 56 at approximately the same time each morning, wi th food. 
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in LDL-C for each 
obicetrapib group compared to the placebo group.  The key secondary efficacy endpoi nts include the following: 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in ApoB for each obicetrapi b group compared to the 
placebo group; 
 Percent change from Day 1 to D ay 56 in non-HDL-C for each obice trapib group compared to 
the placebo group; and 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in HDL-C for each obicetrap ib group compared to the 
placebo group.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety and tolerability pro file of obicetrapib will be asse ssed by clinical laboratory 
assessments (chemistry and hema tology), vital signs, physical examinations, and the incidence o f 
adverse events. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before data base lock. Any changes to the 
methods described in the SAP will be described and justified as  needed in the Clinical Study 
Report. All study-collected data will be summarized by treatmen t group using descriptive 
statistics, graphs, and/or raw d ata listings. Descriptive stati stics for continuous variables will 
include number of participants (n), mean, standard deviation (S D), median, minimum, and 
maximum values. Analysis of categorical variables will include frequency and percentage. 
Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Popula tion will include all participa nts randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be  based on the randomized treatment.  
The Modified ITT (mITT) Population will include all participant s in the ITT Population who 
receive at least 1 dose of any study drug and have a baseline v alue for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained du ring the Safety Follow-up Visit after a participant permanently 
discontinues the study drug or aft er a participant receives an excluded medication and/or 
procedure will be removed from the mITT analysis. Treatment cla ssification will be based on the 
randomized treatment. The mITT Population will be used for the primary analysis of all efficacy 
endpoints. The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mITT Population who have 
a baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day 56 value for the LDL-C assessment, and 
who did not experience a major pr otocol deviation that potentia lly impacted the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The PP Population, along with the reason for exclusio n, will be finalized prior to study 
unblinding. The PK Population will include all participants in the mITT Pop ulation who have sufficient blood 
samples collected for valid e stimation of PK  parameters. 
The Safety Population will includ e all participants who receive  at least 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. The Safety  Population will 
be the primary population used f or the safety analyses. 
Analysis of Efficacy  
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the effi cacy analyses. Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation and the PP Population as supportive analyses. 
The primary efficacy analysis of the percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures approach. T he analysis will include fixed 
effects for treatment, visit, and  treatment-by-visit interactio n, along with a covariate of the baseline 
value. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation approach wi ll be used with an unstructured 
covariance matrix. The least squares means, standard errors, an d 2-sided 95% confidence intervals 
for each treatment group and for the pairwise comparisons of each dose of obicetrap ib to the

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 placebo group will be provided. Adjustment for multiple compari sons will be made using 
Dunnett’s test in accordance with t he power and sample size calculations utilized  for the study. 
Missing data will be imputed usi ng multiple imputation methodol ogy. Results will be combined 
using Rubin’s method. Full details of the model and imputation will be provided in the SAP.  
Similar models as described for the primary efficacy analyses w ill be used to analyze the 
secondary efficacy endpoints. No adjustment will be made for mu ltiplicity in testing the secondary 
efficacy endpoints. Nominal p-values will be provided when applicable. Any additional sensitivity 
and/or supplemental analyses will be defined in the SAP. 
Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the sa fety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will  be applied to the safety endpoints.
Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations will be summarized with descr iptive statistics based on the 
PK Population. Exploration of a ny relationships with obicetrapi b exposure will be performed, as 
appropriate. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: A sample size of at least 108 eval uable participants (ie, 36 pa rticipants per treatment group) will 
provide >90% power to detect a 30%  difference in LDL-C reductio n at Day 56 (SD of 15%) for 
each of the obicetrapib groups compared to the placebo group at  a  2 - s i d e d  s i g n i f i c a n c e  l e v e l  
of 0.025. The sample size for this study was determined in order to provi de sufficient power for the analyses 
of the primary efficacy endpoint d escribed above. Therefore, as suming an approximately 
5% dropout rate, enrollment of a pproximately 114 participants (ie, 38 participants per treatment 
group) is planned for this study. This sample size will also co ntribute sufficient participant 
exposure and safety data. 
Participants will be stratified according to their Screening Vi sit (Visit 1) LDL-C levels ( 100 or 
<100 mg/dL).

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Dyslipidemias are disorders of lipoprotein metabolism, includin g lipoprotein overproduction or 
deficiency, which may be manifested by elevation of the levels of the serum total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycer ide (TG) concentrations, and a 
decrease in the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles terol (HDL-C) concentration. These 
disorders are generally diagnosed by measuring the serum lipids and classified by the pattern of elevation/reduction in the lipid/lipoprotein fractions. Dyslipi demia itself does not generally cause 
any symptoms, but it can lead to symptomatic vascular disease i ncluding coronary artery disease 
and peripheral arterial disease.  It is acknowledged that while there are a number of genetic and 
lifestyle factors which contribute to the development of vascul ar disease, dyslipidemia is 1 of the 
most prominent risk factors and normalization of the lipid prof i l e  h a s  b e e n  a  m a j o r  t a r g e t  i n  
cardiovascular (CV) protection strategies.
1 
Statins are generally the drug of first choice in treating dysl ipidemia. Statins are considered as the 
most potent, most effective, and best tolerated drugs for reduc ing LDL-C levels. Some patients, 
despite treatment with high-in tensity statin therapy, do not ac hieve acceptable levels of LDL-C 
with statins alone.  
There is a need for chronic therapies which will robustly reduce elevated LDL-C levels when used 
adjunctive to high-inte nsity statin therapy.  
1.1 Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibitors 
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a plasma glycoprot ein produced in the liver and 
adipose tissue. It circulates in the blood, bound primarily to HDL-C, and is involved in the transfer 
of cholesteryl esters and TG between lipoproteins. In particular, it mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containi ng particles, eg, ve ry low-density 
lipoprotein and LDL-C, in exchange  for TG. As a result, cholest eryl ester from HDL can be taken 
up by the liver through scavenger receptor class B type 1; this action also leads to decreased HDL-C and ultimately to increased LDL-C.  
Inhibition of CETP activity reduces ApoB and LDL-C and increase s HDL-C. CETP-inhibiting 
therapies were originally developed based on the premise that i ncreasing HDL-C levels would 
prevent CV events. However, c linical study results and Mendelia n randomization data have 
revealed that these effects are caused by changes in the concen tration of ApoB-containing particles 
(including LDL particles) rather than changes in the HDL-C leve ls.
2,3 Therefore, the LDL-C and 
ApoB-lowering effects, which ari se from CETP inhibition and occ urs through upregul ation of the 
LDL receptor, would lead to large reductions in CV events and w ould be of great clinical 
importance for patients who are  unable to tolerate statins. 
1.2 Obicetrapib  
Obicetrapib has been shown to be a selective CETP inhibitor. In hibition of CETP by obicetrapib 
blocks the transfer of choleste ryl ester from non-atherogenic H DL particles to particles in 
lipoprotein fractions (including LD L) that cause atherosclerosi s and reduces the concentration of 
cholesterol not only in LDL, but  also in other atherogenic lipo proteins. On top of  this, obicetrapib 
has several additional compound-sp ecific activities that are hy pothesized to be beneficial in 
patients. In a recent study, obicetrapib treatment not only reduced the number of ApoB-containing 
particles that constitute LDL-C , it also increased apolipoprote i n  E  ( A p o E ) ,  w h i c h  l e d  t o  t h e

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 removal of cholesterol via the liver and also reduced lipoprote in (a) (Lp[a]).4 Finally, obicetrapib 
not only potently increases HDL-C and the concentration of apol ipoprotein 
A1 (ApoA1)-containing lipoprotei ns but has been demonstrated to be a potent inducer of 
cholesterol efflux, which is the m a i n  d r i v e r  o f  r e v e r s e  c h o l e s t erol transport.5 This effect is 
considered important because it is expected to reduce establish ed atheroma burden. 
1.3 Clinical Development of Obicetrapib  
Both single ascending dose (TA-8995-01) and multiple ascending dose (TA-8995-02) studies have 
been conducted in healthy volunteers. A formal, thorough QT/QTc study (TA-8995-04) has been completed and obicetrapib was s hown to have no effect on QTcF. A drug-drug interaction study 
(TA-8995-05) has also been conducted; this study showed no sign ificant effect of obicetrapib on 
P-glycoprotein activity, but this study showed that obicetrapib  is a mild inducer of cytochrome 
P450 3A4. A mass balance study ( TA-8995-07) in healthy males co ncluded that obicetrapib is 
steadily absorbed, and the princi pal route of excretion was in the feces. Finally, bioequivalence 
between obicetrapib capsule and tablet formulations was investi gated (TA-8995-08) and 
established. 
A Phase 2 patient study (TA-8995-03) was conducted in Denmark a nd the Netherlands to evaluate 
the optimal dose of obicetrapib  alone and in combination with m edium-intensity statins in patients 
with mild dyslipidemia. This study concluded that a daily dose of 10 mg obicetrapib in 
combination with medium-intensity statins resulted in an increm ental LDL-C reduction of up to 
50.2% and a total LDL-C reduction of 63.7%, while statin monot herapy or obicetrapib 
monotherapy achieved an LDL-C reduction of only 46.4%.
4 When compared with statin 
treatment alone at the end of the  12-week Treatment Period, all  treatment groups with obicetrapib 
in combination with medium-intensity statins had significantly higher mean HDL-C levels; had a 
significantly greater increase in ApoA1 and ApoE levels; and a greater decrease in ApoB, Lp(a), 
and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels .4 However, there is a lack of 
data for the safety and efficacy of obicetrapib used as an adju nct to high-intensity statin therapy, 
which is commonly used in pati ents with dyslipidemia.  
Another patient study (TA-8995-06) was conducted where obicetrapib was found to result in a statistically significant reduction in Lp(a) levels following 1 2 weeks of treatment; however, the 
magnitude of the changes (approxi mately a 10% reduction) was no t likely to be clinically relevant. 
1.4 Rationale 
The safety and efficacy data fo llowing 56 days o f single daily dose administrations of obicetrapib 
as an adjunct to high-intensity statin therapy in this study will support dose selection for subsequent studies. 
1.5 Risk/Benefit 
Obicetrapib has undergone extens ive nonclinical testing in the standard battery of tests according 
to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, in cluding repeat-d ose toxicity 
studies of up to 39 weeks duration. In addition, obicetrapib ha s been investigated in 8 completed 
clinical studies, of which 6 studies were in Phase 1 of clinica l development and 2 studies were in 
Phase 2. A total of approximately 500 subjects have been expose d to obicetrapib in these studies. 
In Phase 1, a total of 159 subjects received single oral doses between 5 and 150 mg of obicetrapib, 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-201 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 16 of 47 
Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 and 76 subjects received consecutive doses between 1 and 25 mg of obicetrapib for periods up to 
28 days. In Phase 2, a total  of 268 patients received 1 to 10 m g of obicetrapib for up to 12 weeks. 
In healthy volunteer studies, single doses of obicetrapib up to  150 mg and multiple doses up to 
25 mg/day over 28 days were generally well tolerated. In patien t studies, obicetrapib was also well 
tolerated after daily dosing of 10 mg for 12 weeks, both alone and in combination with 2 different 
statins. There were no dose-rela ted adverse events (AEs) identified and no clinically significant 
changes in vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), hema tology, or biochemistry in any 
clinical trials. Most treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were mild or moderate in severity. None of 
the severe TEAEs were consider ed related to study drug. The num ber of patients experiencing 
TEAEs and their severity were similar across all treatment grou ps. Incidence rate s of drug-related 
TEAEs were also comparable for all treatment groups; the number of TEAEs in the obicetrapib treatment groups did not display a dose-dependent effect. There  were 7 patients, who were 
randomized to receive obicetrapib alone or in combination with statin, with a treatment-emergent 
serious AE (SAE), none of which were suspected to be related to study drug. One patient had a treatment-emergent SAE that r esulted in study discontinuation. 
1.6 Coronavirus Disease 2019 Impacts 
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronaviru s 2, was characterized as a pand emic by the World Health 
Organization. The COVID-19 pande mic has impacted clinical studi es worldwide due to 
quarantines, site closures, trave l limitations, diversion of re sources, and/or general interruptions in 
study-related procedures.  
This study protocol includes contingency measures to manage disruptions due to COVID-19 
control measures, see Section 3.1.5 for details. The impacts of  these implemented contingency 
measures on the outcomes of this study, including any protocol deviations that result from 
COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 control measures, will be disc ussed in the Clinical Study 
Report.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This study will be a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomiz ed, Phase 2 dose-finding study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of obicetrapib as an adjunct to high-intensity statin 
therapy. This study will take place at approximately 20 sites i n the United States.   
3.1.1 Screening Period 
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), participants will be required  to sign an informed consent form 
(ICF) before any study-related pr ocedures are performed. After signing the ICF, participants will 
be assessed for study eligibility. 
3.1.2 Treatment Period 
Up to 2 weeks after the Screening Visit, participants will retu rn to the site on Day 1 (Visit 2) and 
confirm study eligibility befor e being randomized and beginning  treatment. Approximately 
114 eligible participants (38 participants per treatment group)  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 5 mg obicetrapib (one 5 mg obicetr apib tablet + 1 placebo table t); 
 10 mg obicetrapib (two 5 mg obi cetrapib tablets); or 
 Placebo (2 placebo tablets). 
During the 8-week Treatment Period, the assigned study drugs will be administered by the 
participants orally and once daily on Day 1 to Day 56. Participants will return to the site every 
4 weeks for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessme nts. Participants,  Investigators, 
the Clinical Research Organization (CRO), and the Sponsor will be blinded to all lipid results from 
Day 1 (Visit 2) for the first pa rticipant through database lock  in order to protect blinding to 
treatment assignment. 
3.1.3 Safety Follow-Up Period 
Participants will return to the site for a Safety Follow-up Visit (Visit 5) approximately 4 weeks 
after the end of the T reatment Period for sa fety and PK assessm ents.  
3.1.4 Pharmacokinetic Period 
Participants will return to the site for 2 PK Visits (Visits 6 and 7) approximatel y 8 and 15 weeks, 
respectively, after the end of t he Treatment Period for safety and PK assessments.  
3.1.5 Coronavirus Disease 2019 Contingency Measures 
In cases of COVID-19 limitations, it is the Investigator’s resp onsibility to assure the safety of 
participants, including phone or  video contact to assess the participant’s well-being including any 
AE, collection of study samples an d clinical data as best as po ssible, and direct shipment of study 
drug to participant, if necessar y. Where available and appropri ate, home health care may be 
considered to facilitate monito ring of safety and study continu ity. Documentation of these cases 
and the site’s management of participants should be recorded in  the Investigator study files. In the

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 4.4 Rescreening 
A participant who is screened a nd does not meet the study eligi bility criteria may be considered 
for rescreening upon Sponsor and/ or Medical Monitor consultatio n and approval. Rescreened 
participants will be assigned a new participant number. Rescree ning should occur no less than 
5 days after the las t Screening Visit. 
4.5 Withdrawal Criteria 
Participation in this study ma y be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
 The participant withdraws cons ent or requests discontinuation from the study for any reason; 
 Occurrence of any medical conditi on or circumstance that expose s the participant to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the pa rticipant to adhere to the requirements of the protocol; 
 Any SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormali ty, intercurrent illness, or 
other medical condition, which i ndicates to the Investigator th at continued partic ipation is not 
in the best interest  of the participant; 
 Pregnancy; 
 Requirement of prohibited c oncomitant medication; 
 Participant failure to comply wit h protocol requirements or stu dy-related procedures; or 
 Termination of the study by the  Sponsor or the regulatory authority. 
Unless the participant withdraws consent, participants who disc ontinue study drug early should be 
encouraged to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for the Early Termination Visit 
promptly and complete a Safety F ollow-up Visit 4 weeks after th e last dose. If a participant 
withdraws prematurel y from the study due to the above criteria or any other reason, study staff 
should make every effort to complete the full panel of assessme nts scheduled for the Early 
Termination Visit and complete a Safety Follow-up Visit 4 weeks  after the last dose. PK samples 
will not be collected during the Safety Follow-up Visit for par ticipants who discontinue study drug 
early without withdrawing consent or for participants who withd raw prematurely from the study. 
The reason for participant withdrawal must be documented in the  electronic case report form 
(eCRF). 
In the case of participant lost to follow-up, attempts to conta ct the participant must be made and 
documented in the particip ant’s medical records. 
Withdrawn participants will not be replaced.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 5 STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1 Treatment Groups 
Participants will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 5 mg obicetrapib (one 5 mg obicetr apib tablet + 1 placebo table t); 
 10 mg obicetrapib (two 5 mg obi cetrapib tablets); or 
 Placebo (2 placebo tablets). 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
In previous clinical studies of obicetrapib in healthy voluntee rs and patients, near maximal effects 
were observed at the 5 mg obicetrapib dose level with increased  HDL-C levels and decreased 
LDL-C levels. A statistically significant reduction in Lp(a) le vels from baseline was also observed 
at the 10 mg obicetrapib  dose level. Therefo re, the present stu dy will utilize doses of 5 and 10 mg 
obicetrapib in participants currently receiving high-intensity statin therapy. 
5.3 Randomization and Blinding 
Participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomiz ed into the study. Participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 5 mg obicetrapib, 10 mg obic etrapib, or placebo treatment 
groups. At randomization, participants will be stratified accor ding to their Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
LDL-C level ( 100 or <100 mg/dL). An automated interactive response technolog y (IRT) system 
will be used to assign the participant to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. 
Participants, Investigators, the CRO, and the Sponsor will be b linded to all lipid results from Day 1 
(Visit 2) for the firs t participant through database lock in or der to protect blinding to treatment 
assignment. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Unblinding by request of an Investigator should occur only in t he event of an emergency or AE, 
for which it is necessary to know  the study drugs to determine an appropriate course of therapy for 
the participant. If the Investig ator or qualified designee must  identify the treatme nt assignment of 
an individual participant, the Investigator or qualified design ee should request the treatment 
assignment from the IRT system. The Investigator is advised not  to reveal the treatment assignment 
to other sites or Sponsor personnel. 
Prior to unblinding, and if the s ituation allows, the Investiga tor should consult with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor. If this is impractical, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
as soon as possible, without revealing the treatment assignment  of the unblinded participant. The 
Investigator must document the participant identification and t he date and time for breaking the 
blind and must clearl y explain the reasons f or breaking the bli nd. 
Medically necessary care should not be delayed for unblinding information (ie, the Investigator 
should treat the participant based on the participant’s signs/s ymptoms without waiting for the 
unblinding process to be completed).

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 5.5.3 Study Drug Administration 
Two tablets of study drugs will be  administered by the particip ant orally and on ce daily on Day 1 
to Day 56. Study drugs should be administered at approximately the same time each morning, with food. On days with visits scheduled, study drugs should be admi nistered with food following all 
fasted blood samples. If a parti cipant forgets to take study dr ug on a given day, they should take 
the next dose as normal and shoul d not take a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose. 
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance 
Compliance to the study drug regi men will be evaluated by count ing unused tablets. Participants 
will be instructed to bring all unused study drugs to the site at Visits 3 and 4. During the Treatment 
Period, if compliance is not bet ween 80% and 120%, inclusive, the participant will be counselled 
about the importance of compliance to the regimen. If the limit s are exceeded at 2 consecutive 
visits, a decision will be made by the Investigator and Sponsor  as to whether the p articipant should 
be withdrawn from the study. 
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability 
All study drugs must be stored be low 25 °C (77 °F) in a secure area with access limited to the 
Investigator and authoriz ed site personnel. 
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Investigator or  designated site personnel must 
document the amount of study drug dispensed and/or administered  to participants, the amount 
returned by participants, and the amount received from and retu rned to the Sponsor (or 
representative) when applicable. Study drug accountability reco rds must be main tained throughout 
the course of the study. The acc ountability unit for this study  is a tablet. Discrepancies are to be 
reconciled or resolved. Procedures for final disposition of unused study drug will be provided in 
the appropriate study manual. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Participants must not receive treatment with other investigatio nal products or devices within 
30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prio r to screenin g. 
Participants must abstain from taking any PCSK9 inhibitor withi n 10 weeks prior to randomization 
or bempedoic acid within 2 weeks  prior to randomization.   
5.6.2 Allowed Medications and/or Procedures 
Participants must be currently receiving high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg or 
rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg) at a stable dose for 8 weeks prior to  screening and intending to remain 
at the same stable dose th roughout the study duration. 
5.6.3 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication Use 
Medications used within 28 days p rior to the Screening Visit wi ll be recorded. Any medications 
administered in addition to the  study drugs, whether allowed pe r the protocol or not, must be 
documented on the concomitant medication eCRF.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 7 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in LDL-C for each 
obicetrapib group compared to the placebo group.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoi nts include the following: 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day  56 in ApoB for each obicetrapi b group compared to the 
placebo group; 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in non-HDL-C for each obice trapib group compared to 
the placebo group; and 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in HDL-C for each obicetrap ib group compared to the 
placebo group. 
Blood samples for the lipid profi le must be obtained under fast ing conditions (ie, after the 
participant has fasted for appr oximately 10 hours). For the pur poses of this study, fasting will be 
defined as nothing by mouth except water and any essential medi cations. If a participant is not 
fasting, the Investigator should reschedule the visit as soon a s  p o s s i b l e .  L D L - C  l e v e l  w i l l  b e  
calculated using the Friedewald equation unless TG 400 mg/dL or LDL-C 50 mg/dL; in both 
cases, LDL-C level will be measured directly by preparative ult racentrifugation, also referred to 
as beta quantification.7 In addition, for all patients, LDL-C will be measured by prepa rative 
ultracentrifugation, also referre d to as beta quantification, a t baseline (Visit 2) and at the end of 
the 8-week Treatment Period (Visit 4).

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinic al investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical pro duct, which does not necessari ly have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefo re be any unfavorable and/or u nintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally as s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h e  u s e  o f  a n  
investigational medici nal product, whether  or not related to th e investigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical laboratory assessment variables, wi ll be monitored and documented 
from the time of first dose of study treatment until completion  of Visit 7. Participants should be 
instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investi gator, whether or not they think the 
event is due to study drug. Beginni ng at the date of the first dose of study treatment, Investigators 
should make an assessment for AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associ a t e d  s i g n s  a n d  
symptoms should be identified by  the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be record ed as an AE, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already pres ent at the date of the first dose of study treatment should be 
recorded as medical history a nd not be reported as an AE unless  the medical condition or signs or 
symptoms present at baseline changes in severity, frequency, or  seriousness at any time during the 
study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination  findings (eg, ECG) that are 
detected during the study or are present at the date of the first dose of study treatment and 
significantly worsen during the st udy should be reported as AEs , as described below. The 
Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory v alues occurring during the stu dy will be followed until repeat 
tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that 
are determined to be an error should not be reported as an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or other 
abnormal clinical findings (eg, ECG abnormalities) should be re ported as an AE if any of the 
following are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study dr ug is required as a result of the abnormality; or  
 Based on the clinical judgmen t of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious 
and unintended responses to a medicinal product rel ated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal  product means that a causal 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-201 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 29 of 47 
Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 relationship between a medicinal  product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship ca nnot be ruled out. 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse re action, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information .  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Ev ents by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each A E as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship t o study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of severity 
Mild – An event that is easily t olerated and generally not interfering with normal  daily activities. 
Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomforting to inter fere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incap acitating with inability to work  or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study dr ug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, unlik ely to be related) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, thera pies, complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consist ent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc) can be identified. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal rel ationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there  are facts (evidence) or argum ents to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The lengt h of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clin ical context o f the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be evaluated i n the context of the natural h istory and course of the disease 
being treated and any other diseas e the participant may have. 
 Concomitant drug- The other drugs the participant is taking or the treatment the participant receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized t o cause the event in question.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021  Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particu lar response is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the reci pient and provide a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic propertie s (absorption, distribution, m etabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view  of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening ” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it  occurred in a mo re severe for m, might have caused death. 
 Requires hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalizations; 
Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay wil l be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency roo m or urgent care visit without  hospital admission will not 
be recorded as a SAE under this  criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent, or elective trea tment of a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from baselin e. However, unexpected complica tions and/or prolongation of 
hospitalization that occur duri ng elective surgery should be re corded as AEs and assessed for 
seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situationa l reasons (ie, no place to stay, live 
too far away to come for hospital visits, respite care) will no t be considered inpatient 
hospitalizations.  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important m edical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the abov e criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropria te medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 o f the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical event s include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependen cy.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) that a re fatal or life-threatening a s soon as possible to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and in  a n y  c a s e  n o  l a t e r  t h a n  7  d a y s  after knowledge by the 
Sponsor/designee of such a case.  Relevant follow-up information  will subsequently be 
communicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA, applicable compet ent authorities concerned, and 
to the Central Ethics Committee concerned as soon as possible b ut within a maximum of 15 days 
of first knowledge by the  Sponsor/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines out lined in country-specific legi slation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inf orm all Investigators as requ ired per local regulation. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to in vestigational medicinal product. 
8.6 Special Situation Reports 
Special situation reports include  reports of overdose, misuse, abuse, medication error, and reports 
of adverse reactions associa ted with product complaints. 
 Overdose:  Refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal prod uct given per 
administration or cumulatively (a ccidentally or intentionally),  which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the protocol. Clinical judgement should always be applied. In 
cases of a discrepancy in the d rug accountability, overdose wil l be established only when it is 
clear that the participant has taken additional dose(s) or the Investigator has reason to suspect 
that the participant has taken additional dose(s).  
 Misuse:  Refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately 
used not in a way that is not in accordance with the protocol i nstructions or local prescribing 
information and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or p sychological effects.  
 Abuse:  Is defined as persistent or spor adic, intentional excessive us e of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effec ts. 
 Medication error:  Is any unintentional error in the prescri bing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product by a hea lthcare profession al, participan t, or consumer, respectively. The 
administration or consumption of the unassigned treatment and a dministration of an expired 
product are always reportable as medication errors, cases of pa rticipants missing doses of 
investigational product are not c onsidered reportable as medica tion error. 
 Product complaint:  Is defined as any written, elect ronic, or oral communication t hat alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or device after it is released for distri bution. A special situations form 
will only be completed if a comp laint is associated with an adv erse drug reaction.  
All special situation events as described above must be reporte d on the Special Situations Report 
form and faxed/emailed to  (contact info rmation listed below) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. All AEs associated with the se Special Situation reports should 
be reported as AEs or SAEs as well as recorded on the AE eCRF a nd/or the SAE report form.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 9 STATISTICS 
9.1 Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populat ion will include all participants randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be  based on the randomized treatment.  
The Modified ITT (mITT) Populati on will include all participant s in the ITT Population who 
receive at least 1 dose of any study drug and have a baseline v alue for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained during the Safety Follow-up Visit  after a participant permanently 
discontinues the study drug or after a participant receives an excluded medication and/or procedure 
will be removed from the mITT analysis. Treatment classificatio n will be based on the randomized 
treatment. The mITT Population w ill be used for the primary ana lysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mITT Population who have a 
baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day 56 value fo r the LDL-C assessment, and 
who did not experience a major protocol deviation that potentia lly impacted the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The PP Population, along with the reason for exclusion, will be finalized prior to study unblinding. 
The PK Population will include all  participants in the mITT Population who have sufficient blood 
samples collected for valid e stimation of PK  parameters. 
The Safety Population will includ e all participants who receive  at least 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. The Safety Population will 
be the primary population used f or the safety analyses. 
9.2 Statistical Methods 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before data base lock. Any changes to the 
methods described in the SAP will be described and justified as  needed in the Clinical Study 
Report. All study-collected data  will be summarized by treatmen t group using descriptive 
statistics, graphs, and/or raw d ata listings. Descriptive stati stics for continuous variables will 
include number of participants (n), mean, standard deviation (S D), median, minimum, and 
maximum values. Analysis of categorical variables will include frequency and percentage. 
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the effi cacy analyses. Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation and the PP Population as supportive analyses. 
9.2.1.1 Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis of  the percent change from Day 1 to Day 56 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures approach. T he analysis will include fixed 
effects for treatment, visit, a nd treatment-by-visit interactio n, along with a covariate of the baseline 
value. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation approach wi ll be used with an unstructured 
covariance matrix. The least squares means, standard errors, an d 2-sided 95% confidence intervals 
for each treatment group and for the pairwise comparisons of ea ch dose of obicetrapib to the 
placebo group will be provided. Adjustment for multiple compari sons will be made using 
Dunnett’s test in accordance with  the power and sample size cal culations utilized for the study.

Version 2.0, 26 January 2021 Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation methodology. Results will be combined using Rubin’s method. Full details of the model and imputation will be provided in the SAP. 
9.2.1.2 Secondary efficacy analysis 
Similar models as described for the primary efficacy analyses will be used to analyze the secondary 
efficacy endpoints. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity  in testing the secondary efficacy 
endpoints. Nominal p-values will  be provided when applicable. A ny additional sensitivity and/or 
supplemental analyses will be defined in the SAP. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the sa fety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will  be applied to the s afety endpoints. 
AEs will be categorized by primary system organ class and prefe rred term as coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities category designati ons. Summaries of AEs, including 
the number and percentage of par ticipants who experience an AE, will be provided. 
Laboratory values will be summarized descriptively, including t he change from baseline, by 
treatment group, and overall. In addition, shift tables will be  presented to describe the change in 
laboratory parameter values at pos t-baseline visits using norma l range categories (low, normal, 
and high). 9.2.3 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations will be summarized with descriptive statistics based on the 
PK Population. Exploration of any relationships with obicetrapi b exposure will be performed, as 
appropriate. 
9.2.4 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
9.2.5 Sample Size Determination 
A sample size of at least 108 evaluable participants (ie, 36 participants per treatment group) will 
provide >90% power to detect a 30%  difference in LDL-C reductio n at Day 56 (SD of 15%) for 
each of the obicetrapib groups compared to the placebo group at  a 2-sided significance level 
of 0.025. 
The sample size for this study was determined in order to provi de sufficient power for the analyses 
of the primary efficacy endpoint described in Section 7. Theref ore, assuming an approximately 
5% dropout rate, enrollment of approximately 114 participants ( ie, 38 participants per treatment 
group) is planned for this study.  This sample size will also co ntribute suffici ent participant 
exposure and safety data. 
Participants will be stratified according to their Screening Vi sit (Visit 1) LDL-C levels ( 100 or 
<100 mg/dL).

2. Calculated using the Friedewal d equation unless triglycerides 400 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) 50 mg/dL; in both cases, LDL-C level will be measured directly by preparative ultracentrifugation, also 
referred to as beta quantificati on. (Source: LDL calculated. MD Calc. https://www.mdcalc.com /ldl-calculated. Accessed 
09 November 2020.) In addition, for all patients, LDL-C will be  measured by preparative ultracentrifugation, also 
referred to as beta quantification, at baseline (Visit 2) and a t the end of the 8-week Tr eatment Period (Visit 4).

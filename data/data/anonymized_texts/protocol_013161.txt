2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for the CF transmembrane 
conductance regulatory (CFTR) protein, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -regulated anion 
channel expressed primarily at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia.  The F508del 
mutation is the most common mutation globally, with approximately half of the CF patients in the 
United States and Europe having the mutation present on both alleles, meaning that they are 
homozygous for this mutation.  The F508del mutation causes significantly reduced expression and 
function of the CFTR protein in various tissues (e.g., lung, pancreas), which leads to CF disease 
manifestations.
CFTR modulators in this study are compounds designed to increase the cell surface expression and 
restore the function of F508del CFTR.  ABBV -2222 (also known as galicaftor, or referred to as GLPG2222 
or G957389) is a CFT R corrector that improves F508del CFTR expression and ABBV -3067 (also known as 
navocaftor, or referred to as GLPG3067 or G914167) is a CFTR potentiator that restores F508del CFTR 
function.  Results from in vitro studies using cultivated human bronchial epi thelial (HBE) cells 
demonstrated that the combination of ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 significantly restored F508del CFTR 
expression and function to a greater degree than observed for either individual component.  ABBV -3067 
and ABBV -2222 are under development a s an oral treatment for CF.
Clinical Hypothesis
ABBV -3067 alone and in combination with ABBV -2222 given for 28 days is safe and well tolerated in 
adults with CF.
The combination of ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 administered together for 28 days will result in 
significant improvements from baseline in pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of CFTR function (lung 
function and sweat chloride [SwCl]) in individuals with CF who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation.
The decrease in SwCl and improvement of lung function as ass essed by percent predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) will be greater for the ABBV -3067/ABBV -2222 combination than 
for ABBV -3067 monotherapy.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The safety results from Phase 1 studies demonstrated that ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 were generally 
well tolerated in healthy volunteers, either as single agent or combination regimen.
ABBV -2222 treatment in vitro improved CFTR channel expression and function in HBE cells.  The 
completed Phase 2 study (Study GLPG2222 -CL-202) showed that 4 -week treatment of ABBV -2222 
significantly reduced SwCl in CF subjects homozygous for F508del mutation.  Preliminary results from 
the ongoing Phase 1 study (Study GLPG2737 -CL-105) also showed that the dual combination of

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.ABBV -2222 and GLPG 2451 (another potentiator under development with a similar mechanism of action 
as ABBV -3067) reduced SwCl and increased ppFEV 1in patients with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the combination of ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 has 
the potential to improve F508del CFTR function in patients with CF, as well as their lung function 
measured by ppFEV 1.
The following paragraphs describe the main risks that are potentially associated with repeated doses of 
ABBV -2222, in c ombination with potentiator/corrector compounds (GLPG2451, ABBV -3067, and 
).
Rash
Nonserious adverse events (AEs) of rash of mild to moderate severity have been observed following 
multiple -dose treatment with ABBV -2222 in combination with ABBV -3067 or GLPG2451,  
.  Rash was considered possibly 
related to study drug by the investigator and resolved after treatment disco ntinuation.
There were also reports of mild rash occurring among subjects who received ABBV- 2222 alone, but none 
led to study drug discontinuation.
As a result of these rash occurrences, enhanced safety monitoring and specific guidance to the 
investigator is described in the Operations Manual ( Appendix F).  Rash is considered an adverse event of 
special interest (AESI) (see Section 6.1).
Taken together, the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs support further 
development of ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 in Phase 2 studies in subjects with CF.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the ABBV -3067 
and ABBV -2222 Investigator's Brochures.1-2

3.2 E fficacy Endpoints
Primary Endpoint
Absolute change from Baseline through Day 29 in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 
1second (ppFEV 1, a measure of lung function) 
Secondary Endpoints
1.Absolute change from Baseline through Day 29 in SwCl (a biom arker of CFTR activity)
2.Absolute change from Baseline through Day 29 in other spirometric measures (forced vital 
capacity [FVC], forced expiratory flow at mid -lung capacity [FEF 25-75])
3.Relative changes from Baseline through Day 29 in ppFEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25-75
3.3 Safety Endpoints
Safety endpoints will be AEs, AESIs, weight, vital signs, physical exams, clinical laboratory data, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and spirometry throughout the study.
3.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Blood samples for dete rmination of ABBV- 2222 and ABBV -3067 plasma concentrations will be collected 
from subjects at the visits indicated in Appendix D.  A nonlinear mixed -effects modeling approach will be 
used to estimate the population central values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual 
values of ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional 
parameters m ay be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.  Data from this study may be 
combined with data from other studies for the population pharmacokinetic or exposure -response 
analyses.
3.5 Biomarker Research
Optional samples (whole blood) will be coll ected at specific time points as described in the Activity 
Schedule ( Appendix D) to evaluate known and/or novel disease -related or drug -related bio markers.  
Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and/or metabolites.  The objective of this 
research is to analyze samples for biomarkers that will help to understand CF, related conditions, and 
the subject's response to ABBV -2222 and/or ABBV -3067.  Genes of interest may include those 
associated with pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), genes within 
the target pathway, or genes related to CF (e.g., CFTR).  This research is exploratory in nature and the 
results may not be included with the clinical study report.

4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, multi -country, Phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm, 2 -part study 
of ABBV -3067 given alone and in combination with ABBV -2222 for 28 days in adult subjects with CF who 
are homozygous for F508del CFTR mutation.  This study is designed to e valuate the safety and efficacy 
of ABBV -3067 alone and in combination with ABBV -2222, and in a sequential manner that will also allow 
dose selection for these compounds.
This study will enroll subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of CF who are homo zygous for the 
F508del CFTR mutation.  In both Part 1 and Part 2, randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1at 
Screening (< 70% vs ≥ 70%).  See Section 5for detailed information regarding eligibility criteria.
Study drug will be administered in the morning from Day 1 to the day before the Day 29 visit.  In Part 1 
of the study, a fixed 150 mg once daily (QD) dose of ABBV- 3067 will be administered wit h ABBV -2222 in 
a dose range -finding manner to enable a dose selection for ABBV -2222 for Part 2 and future 
combination studies.  In addition, ABBV -3067 will be given alone (i.e., with placebo for ABBV- 2222) to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABBV -3067 a t 2 dose levels.  Differences in endpoint values between 
the dual therapy arms and monotherapy arms, from this study and a previous Phase 2 study 
(Study GLPG2222 -CL-202), will demonstrate the respective contributions of ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 
to the combi nation.
In Part 2 of the study, the dose of ABBV -2222 selected from Part 1 will be administered with ABBV -3067 
in a dose- ranging manner to enable selection of the ABBV- 3067 dose for future combination studies.

Part 2 of the study will initiate after all subjects enrolled in Part 1 complete the 30 -day safety follow -up
period.  The dose of ABBV -2222 in each regimen will be selected based on pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
efficacy data from Part 1 of the study.  The sponsor may also adjust the dose of ABBV -3067 or decide 
not to conduct a dose regimen if it is determined t o be unnecessary.
Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study.  Interim analyses will be 
performed as described in Section 7.6.
To enhance the safety and integrity of the study data, a data monitoring committee (DMC) consisting of 
independent experts will convene periodically to review the accumulating unblinded safety data for the 
study and provide a recommendation on study continuation or early termination.  The DMC charter will

Retesting and Rescreening
Retesting of individual screening assessments that did not meet eligibility criteria is allowed once for the 
following parameters provided results can be obtained and it is possible to randomize the subject within 
the same 30 -day screening period.
If the initial sweat collection has insufficient volume for chloride analysis, then the sweat 
collection may be repeated once.
If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or assessment 
may be permitted.
Exclusionary hepatic function test levels ma y be retested within 14 days of the original screening 
date.
Spirometry may be retested once if the screening spirometry measurement failed to meet the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria for acceptability 
and/or rep eatability.  Spirometry may also be retested once for subjects who usually have a 
baseline ppFEV 1within 40% to 90% of predicted but have a first screening spirometry result just 
outside the eligibility range.
Otherwise, subjects not meeting one or more o f eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures.  
Subjects may be rescreened after approval of the sponsor's study physician or delegate.  If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated, with the exception of CFTR genotypi ng, SwCl,
and follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) (if applicable).  Rescreened subjects will keep the same subject

4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Choice of Control Group
The control group consists of subjects randomly assigned to receive placebo.
The ABBV -3067 single -agent treatment groups (i.e., Regimens A and B) also serve as control groups for 
the dual combination treat ment groups, in order to demonstrate the contribution of ABBV -2222.
Although there are dual combination products that have been approved to treat CF subjects who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation, these products are not yet considered standard of car e in all 
countries where this study will be conducted.  In countries where dual combination products are 
accessible as standard of care, this design will also allow the participation of CF subjects who are not on 
dual combination products due to concerns a bout safety or tolerability, lack of efficacy, or other 
concerns (see Eligibility Criteria #21).
Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  All efficacy 
measurements in this st udy are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with CF.  All clinical 
and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted.
Suitability of Subject Population
This study was designed to enroll subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of CF who are also 
homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation because ABBV- 2222 and ABBV -3067 are CFTR modulators 
designed to restore the expression and function of F508del CFTR.  This population is the most likely to 
demonstrate a significa nt change in sweat chloride and ppFEV 1when given a combination of ABBV- 2222 
and ABBV -3067.
Selection of Doses in the Study
Part 1
ABBV -2222 has been evaluated following multiple doses in healthy volunteers (Study GLPG2222 -CL-101) 
and patients with CF who are homozygous for F508del mutation in a Phase 2 study 
(Study GLPG2222 -CL-202), at dosages ranging from 50 mg QD to 600 mg QD.  ABBV -2222 was safe and 
well tolerated at all dosages tested.  In Study GLPG2222 -CL-202, patients with CF who were dosed with 
ABBV- 2222 for 29 days, there was a trend of dose -dependent decrease in SwCl was observed between 
50 mg and 200 mg doses on Day 15 and Day 29, with maximum decrease in SwCl observed in the 200 mg 
dose group.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Considering the totality of the data from the in vitro HBE studies and Phase 1 and Pha se 2 studies, a 
dose range of 10 mg to 300 mg would provide an opportunity to study and explore the dose range 
finding for ABBV- 2222 in CF subjects homozygous of F508del mutation in Part 1 of the study.
 
 
 
.
Part 2
ABBV -2222 dose will be determined based on the analysis of Part 1 data and will be kept constant across 
all treatment groups in Part 2.
 
 
 
For both Part 1 and Part 2, treatment duration of 4 weeks was selected based on efficacy endpoint 
responses observed in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.  In Phase 1 Study GLPG2737 -CL-105, the 
reduction in SwCl and increase in ppFEV 1were observ ed following 1 week of treatment with the dual 
combination of GLPG2451 and ABBV -2222, with the effects sustained following 2 weeks of treatment.  
In Phase 2 Study GLPG2222 -CL-202, reduction in SwCl was similar following 2 weeks and 4 weeks of 
treatment wit h ABBV -2222.  Therefore, it is expected that the 4 -week treatment duration of ABBV -2222 
and ABBV -3067 dual combination will be sufficient to assess the responses in efficacy endpoints in this 
study.
The maximum dose of the ABBV -2222 administrated in this s tudy will not exceed .  The 
maximum dose of ABBV- 3067 administered in this study will not exceed .
Overall, ABBV -2222 exposure (maximum observed concentration [C max] and area under the 
concentration versus time curve from 0 to τ [AUC 0-τ]) following multiple  
 the highest tolerated 
dose in the multiple ascending dose ; and ABBV -3067 exposure following 
multiple doses up to  
 the highest tolerated dose in the multiple ascending dose 
.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Subjects must follow the following contraceptiv e guidelines as specified:
Females, Non -childbearing Potential
Females do not need to use birth control during or following study drug treatment if considered 
of non -childbearing potential due to meeting any of the following criteria:
Postmenopausal, age > 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an 
alternative medical cause.
Postmenopausal, age ≤ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an 
alternative medical cause and a FSH level > 40 IU/L.
Permanently surgically sterile (bilater al oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or 
hysterectomy).
Females, of Childbearing Potential
Females of childbearing potential must avoid pregnancy during study participation and for 
at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
Females must commit to one of the following methods of birth control:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, and injectable) associated with inhibition of ovulation plus a 
barrier method* initiated at least 30 days prior to study Baseline Day 1.
Progestogen -only hormonal birth control (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with 
inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method* initiated at least 30 days prior to study 
Baseline Day 1.
Intrauterine device (IUD).
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) plus a barrier method.*
Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation (can be via hysteroscopy, provided a 
hysterosalpingogram confirms success of the procedure).
Vasectomized partner (provided the partner has received medi cal confirmation of the 
surgical success of the vasectomy and is the sole sexual partner of the trial subject).
Practice true abstinence, defined as:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when 
this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of t he subject (periodic abstinence 
[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal are 
not acceptable).
* As there are no current clinical data available regarding potential interactions between the study drugs 
and hormonal contraceptives, female subjects who use hormonal contraception should supplement this 
with one of the effective barrier methods described below (preferably male condom):
Male or female condom with or without spermicide.
Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with sperm icide.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The use of topical treatments of CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers would not be expected to impact study 
drug.  Consult with the AbbVie medical contact with questions regarding administration of an excluded
concomitant therapy prior to administration.
5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant CF medications and other long- term medications for other conditions that are not 
expressly prohibited are allowed.  The concomitant medication regimen must be stable fo r at least 
4weeks prior to the first study drug administration (as specified in Section 5.1, Eligibility Criteria) and 
should be continued with min imal variation of dose or frequency for the study duration.  Subjects who 
take inhaled antibiotics for suppression of chronic airway infection must be on a stable regimen for at 
least 8 weeks prior to the first study drug administration and remain on that regimen for the study 
duration.
Examples of therapeutic regimens for pulmonary health include antibiotics; corticosteroids (inhaled or 
oral); inhalation of bronchodilators, hypertonic saline, mannitol or dornase alfa; ibuprofen, and airway 
clearance techni ques.
Inhaled antibiotics:   Subjects who are on cycling inhaled antibiotics (including "on/off" cycling) 
must continue on the same schedule.  The timing of the first dose of study drug should be 
synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of the i nhaled antibiotic in the cycle.  The 
timing of the first dose in a cycle also applies to subjects who are alternating 2 different inhaled 
antibiotics each month.
Bronchodilators and airway clearance:   Bronchodilator medications and airway clearance
techniques are frequently used in CF and may affect lung function measurements in the short 
term.  Since ppFEV 1is the primary endpoint for this study, it is very important that the timing of 
these therapies is kept as consistent as possible relative to s pirometry measurements at each 
research visit, starting with Baseline (Day 1).  In order to minimize disruptions in therapeutic 
regimens, it is recommended that subjects who routinely use bronchodilators be counseled to 
use them consistently according to t heir usual schedule throughout the study.  Further, study 
visits should be planned so that the timing of spirometry following bronchodilator use (if 
applicable) will be similar at each visit (e.g., within 2 hours of each other).  Subjects should also 
be allowed adequate time to complete their inhaled medication/airway clearance regimen (if 
applicable) before coming to the study visits to maintain consistency throughout the study.
If subjects miss their routine bronchodilator dose the morning of the Baseline (Day 1) visit, they 
should also withhold bronchodilators until after spirometry at subsequent visits to maintain 
consistency.  Subjects who use bronchodilators only on an as -needed basis will be asked to 
refrain from using them prior to spirometry on stud y visit days.  At each study visit, subjects will 
be asked about the medication name and timing of their last bronchodilator use (if applicable).  
There are several bronchodilators available, including salbutamol (albuterol), salmeterol, 
formoterol, arform oterol, indacaterol, vilanterol, ipratropium, tiotropium, glycopyrronium, 
umaclidium, and aclidinium.  In some cases, bronchodilators are combined with a second 
bronchodilator, an inhaled corticosteroid, or both into a single inhaler.  If a subject uses a 
combination product, the information captured in the source documents should include the 
combination and not just the bronchodilator component.  On study visit Days 1 and 15,

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.spirometry will be performed twice, before and after taking study medication.  Br onchodilators 
should not be given between the 2 spirometry measurements.
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or 
herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment or recei ves during the study 
must be recorded through the final post -treatment visit (30 days after the last dose of study drug).
Any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy should be raised to the AbbVie medical contact.  
Information regarding potential drug interactions with ABBV -3067 and/or ABBV -2222 can be located in 
the ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 Investigator's Brochures.
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications after at least 5 half -lives or 
4weeks prior to initial study d rug administration, whichever is longer.  Subjects must be consented for 
the study prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications for the purpose of meeting study eligibility.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Vaccination Guidance
Given the ongoing COVID -19 pan demic, selected non -live vaccines (e.g., mRNA, non -replicating viral 
vector, protein subunit, etc.) to prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection may be administered during screening or 
the treatment period.
The decision to receive a locally available vaccine should be based on local guidance and an individual 
discussion between the treating physician and the subject.
The potential impact of study drug(s) on SARS -CoV-2 vaccination is unknown.  Therefore, study drug 
should be administered as follows:
The first dose of stu dy drug(s), when possible, is preferred to be given at least ± 7 days from the 
SARS -CoV-2 vaccine administration.
Note:  The above guidance applies to all SARS -CoV-2 vaccine doses given as part of the complete 
treatment course.
These recommendations may b e subject to change based on the evolving knowledge around the use of 
SARS -CoV-2 vaccines in patients with CF and as more data are collected in real -world scenarios and 
clinical trials.
Any SARS -CoV-2 vaccine information must be documented on the SARS- CoV-2/COVID -19 vaccine eCRF.  
Refer to the Operations Manual for instructions on reporting any adverse events associated with the 
SARS -CoV-2/COVID -19 vaccine.
5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study
A subject may voluntarily withdraw or be withdraw n from the study at any time for reasons including, 
but not limited to, the following:
life-threatening AE or a serious adverse event (SAE) that places the subject at immediate risk; or 
maculopapular rash or other clinical manifestation of allergic drug re action, for which the

Grade 3 or higher 
worsening pulmonary status that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to respond to an 
approved and commerciall y available CFTR modulator therapy or that requires a significant 
change to the existing therapeutic regimen
serious infections (e.g., requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy and/or hospitalization)
fungal infection requiring treatment with a triazole a ntimicrobial (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole)
confirmed pregnancy
arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, including but not limited to prolonged QTcF, where the 
severity is categorized as CTCAE (version 5.0) Grade 3 or higher (QTc ≥501 msec o n at least 
2separate ECGs [at least 2 minutes apart] obtained within 10 minutes of the initial recording)
If any of the following hepatic function test criteria is met, study drug must be discontinued 
immediately, the medical monitor must be notified, and a supplemental hepatic case report 
form must be completed (see Section 6.1):
AST and/or ALT elevations > 8 × ULN
AST and/or ALT elevations > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
AST and/or ALT elevations > 3 × ULN, with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN
AST and/or ALT elevations > 3 × ULN, accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms suggestive 
for hepatic injury (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, 
rash, and/or eosinophilia [> 5%]).
A thorough investigation of potential etiologies for the elevated transaminases should be conducted 
(e.g., trauma, acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion), and the subject should be foll owed 
closely for clinical progression.
Subjects for whom treatment is discontinued for elevated hepatic function tests should have 
transaminases and bilirubin levels repeated by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial 
finding if possibl e, and then monitored closely until levels normalize or return to Baseline.
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subject's final status.  At a minimum, 2 telephone calls must be made and 1 certified 
letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation.
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The investigator may 
also halt the study at his/her site if he/she has safety co ncerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety 
reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator.
5.6 Follow -Up for Subject Withdrawal from Study
To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study d rug treatment should continue to be followed at a Premature Discontinuation visit and 30 -day 
Page 24 of 75

been resolved, unless subjects have decided to discontinue th e study participation entirely (withdrawal 
of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data 
even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early.
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that is 
significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until a 
satisfactory clinical resolution of the AE or laboratory result is achieved.
If a subject prematu rely discontinues study participation, the procedures outlined for the Premature 
Discontinuation visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks .
In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue 
unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped.  A subject may withdraw consent for 
optional biomarker research at any time and remain in the clinical study.  Data generated from optional 
biomarker research, before subject with drawal of consent, will remain part of the study results.
5.7 Study Drug
ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 and their matching placebos manufactured by AbbVie will be taken orally 
once daily beginning on Day 1 (Baseline) and should be taken at approximately the same time in the 
morning each day.  The study drug is to be taken within 1 hour after a meal.  If subjects should forget to 
take their assigned study drug at their regularly scheduled dosing time, they should take the forgotten 
dose as soon as they remember as long as it is at least 8 hours before their next scheduled dose.  
Otherwise they should take the next dose at the next scheduled dosing time.
The subject will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at 
each study visit.  The study site personnel will document compliance.
AbbVie will provide study drug for ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 and their matching placebos.  Study drug 
provided by AbbVie should not be substituted or alternately sourced unless otherwise directed by
AbbVie.
Study drug will be packaged in blister cards with quantities sufficient to accommodate study design.  
Each kit will be labeled per local requirements and this label must remain affixed to the kit.  Upon 
receipt, study drug should be stored as spec ified on the label and kept in a secure location.  Each kit will 
contain a unique kit number.  This kit number is assigned to a subject via interactive response 
technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corres ponding 
study visit.  Site staff will complete all blank spaces on the label before dispensing to subjects.  Study 
drug will only be used for the conduct of this study.
Information about the drug formulations to be used in this study is presented in Table 1for Part 1 and in 
Table 2for Part 2.  Additional IMPD information regarding drug formulations for Part 2 will be provided 
prior to the start of Part 2.

assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the statistics department at AbbVie.
In both Part 1 and Part 2, randomization will be stratified by the Screening visit ppFEV 1(< 70% versus 
≥ 70% of predicted value).
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each su bject's treatment throughout the study.  To maintain the blind, the 
active treatment and placebo formulations ( Table 1and Table 2) provided for the study will be identical 
in appearance.  The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a 
medical emergency.
In addition, to minimize the potential of unblinding, the AbbVie study team will not have access to the 
post -first-dose spirometry or sweat chloride results until after the study is u nblinded for Part 1 or Part 2 
analysis.  Site personnel and subjects will not be informed of the subjects' study -related post -first-dose 
sweat chloride results until the end of the corresponding study part (Part 1 or Part 2).  Subjects will not 
be informed of their study -related spirometry results until the end of the corresponding study Part 
(Part 1 or Part 2).
A limited number of AbbVie personnel who are not directly involved in the conduct of the study may 
receive unblinded data prior to full enrollment of Part 1 and Part 2 to help expedite dose selection of 
ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 for further combination studies.
5.9 Protocol Deviations
The investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, written instructions, and 
applicable laws reg arding protocol deviations.  Protocol deviations are prohibited except when 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is 
identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying independent ethics c ommittee (IEC)/IRB, 
regulatory authorities (as applicable), and AbbVie.
6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 Complaints and Adverse Events
Complaints
A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the 
physical character istics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of a product/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to AbbVie.
Product Complaint
A produc t complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).

STUDY M19 -530  |  Version 3.0 / EudraCT 2019 -000750 -63
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during 
the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adver se Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any un favorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surg ery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
A supplemental case report form should be completed for the following:
Discontinuation or interrup tion of study drug due to a hepatic -related AE, including laboratory 
criteria defined in Section 5.5:
A hepatic -related SAE 
Clinically Significant Assessments
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs will be 
assessed, and those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE.  When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia).  In the absence of a diagnosis, the 
abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine, decreased he moglobin).
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has one or more of the 
following:
Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment
Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention
A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, 
does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria.  The investigator wil l determine whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant.  All study assessments deemed "clinically significant" 
based on the investigator's medical judgment will be managed and followed to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE.  A Grade 4 laboratory value will be 
an SAE if the clinical status of the subject indicates a life -threatening AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following crit eria, it is to be 
reported to AbbVie clinical pharmacovigilance or clinical research organization (CRO) (as appropriate) as 
an SAE within 24 hours after the site became made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.3 of the 
Operations Manual for reporting deta ils and contact information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length 
of time or prolongs the subject's hospi tal stay.  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, inf luenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalizati on, but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, congenita l anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.

STUDY M19 -530  |  Version 3.0 / EudraCT 2019 -000750 -63
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days or 5 half -lives after 
discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously 
reported by the subject.  In addition, SAEs and protocol -related nonserious AEs will be collected from 
the time the subject signs the study -specifi c informed consent.
AbbVie will be responsible for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) reporting for 
the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughou t the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Rash is an AE of special interest (AESI) and will be monitored during the study.
In prior Phase 1 studies, there were isolated instances of nonserious generalized, maculopapular rash 
that occurred when ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 were administered together.  The rashes resolved after 
study drug discontinuation.  Maculopapular rash is a disorder characterized by the presence of macule s 
(flat) and papules (elevated).  Also known as morbilliform rash, maculopapular rash is one of the most 
common cutaneous AEs, frequently affecting the upper trunk, spreading centripetally, and associated 
with pruritus.
Rash is to be graded according to th e CTCAE (adapted) version 5.0.3  All rash cases have to be reported 
within 24 hours from the time of knowledge of the event.  Refer to the Operations Manual ( Appendix F) 
for details about management of these events.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE according to the CTCAE version 5.0.3
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semicolon indicated "or" within the description of the grade)
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADLa
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threa tening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self- care ADLb
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
a. Instrumental A DL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b. Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

STUDY M19 -530  |  Version 3.0 / EudraCT 2019 -000750 -63
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative cause s, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day after 
the site becomes aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  AbbVie will pro vide a 
separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject's partners will be collected from the 
date of the first dose through 90 days following the last dose of study drug.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbi rth, or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
6.2 Toxicity Management
The management of specific AEs (including AE of special interest of rash) and laboratory parameters is 
described in the Operations Manual.  Specific management for elevated hepatic function tests is 
described in this protocol in Section 5.5.
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the interim database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Page 31 of 75 
  
STUDY M19 -530  |  Version 3.0 / EudraCT 2019 -000750 -63
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
The FAS will be used for all efficacy and baseline analyses.  Subjects will be grouped according to 
treatment as randomized.
The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  For the safety 
analysis set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, 
regardless of the treatment randomized.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment as randomized.
For the primary efficacy endpoint in both Part 1 and Part 2, the null hypothesis that the within -group 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1through Day 29 is zero will be tested for each treated group at 
2-sided alpha of 0.05.  The primary analysis will be per formed using a mixed -effect model with repeated 
measures (MMRM) with change from Baseline in ppFEV 1as the dependent variable; treatment group, 
visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects; subject as a random effect; and baseline ppFEV 1
as a covariate.  The estimate for the within -group mean change along with the 95% confidence intervals 
and the corresponding Pvalues will be calculated as the primary analysis.  The treatment effect 
compared to placebo will be estimated using the same model. 
The secondary endpoints of sweat chloride, ppFEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25-75will be analyzed based on an 
MMRM model similarly as the primary endpoint.
Details on the efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
The power calculations are provided for the most potentially efficacious groups with the combination 
treatment for both Part 1 and Part 2 for the primary efficacy endpoint.  Placebo groups from both Part 1 
and Part 2 will be combined in the Part 2 efficacy analysis.  A sample size of 1 8 subjects in a group will 
provide 80% power to detect a 5.3% absolute increase from baseline in ppFEV 1for that group assuming 
a standard deviation of 7.5%.  When comparing to the placebo group, a sample size of 18 subjects in 
both treated group and place bo group will provide 80% power (Part 1), or a sample size of 18 subjects in 
treated group and 27 subjects in placebo group will provide approximately 87% power (Part 2), to detect 
a 7.3% effect size in ppFEV 1change from Baseline assuming the standard dev iation of 7.5% for change in 
ppFEV 1for both groups.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set for both Part 1 and Part 2 based on the 
treatment subjects actually receive.  Safety will be assessed by AEs, AESIs, weight, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory data, 12 -lead ECGs, pulse oximetry and spirometry.  Details on the safety analyses are 
provided in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  A treatment -emer gent 
adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug and 
within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs will be tabulated using MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), as well as by 
severity and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the investigator.  Summaries (i.e., number 
and percentages) of TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AESIs will be provided.
For laboratory test and vital signs variables, mean change from baseline and percentage of subjects with 
evaluations meeting criteria for predefined potentially clinically significant (PCS) values will be 
summarized.
7.5 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response Analyses
Individual ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and 
summarized with appropriate statistical methods.
Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population pharmaco kinetic 
and exposure -response analyses.  Population pharmacokinetic and exposure -response analyses of data 
only from this study may not be conducted.  The following general methodology will be used for the 
population pharmacokinetic and exposure -response a nalyses.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Subjects should be instructed to not to take study drug before coming to the site on the day of the 
Day 15 and Day 29 visits.
At the Day 15 visit, a trough (predose) pharmacokinetic sample should be collected prior to the 
administration of study drug.  Additional pharmacokinetic samples will be taken 2, 4, and 6 hours 
following the dose, as outlined in Section 2.1.  Subjects should take the dose of study drug within an 
hour after eating a meal at the study site.
For all pharmacokinetic samples, the date and accurate time of the pharmacokinetic sample collection 
will be recorded on the lab requisition form. 
At the Day 15 and D ay 29 visits, the date and time of the previous 3 study drug doses before those visits 
will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample collection, processing, 
and shipment.
Measurement Method
Plasma concentrations of ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 will be determined by the Bioanalysis Department 
at AbbVie using a validated method.
3.6 Biomarker Sampling
Optional whole blood samples will be collected for biomarker research as specified in Section 2.  All 
biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific laboratory manual.  
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the samples and data in a secure 
storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while 
research on ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 (or drugs of this class) or cystic fibrosis (CF) and related 
conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirements.
3.7 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Section 2.  The ECG should 
be performed prior to blood collection and after the subject has been resting supine for at least 
5minutes.
The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site ("local reader").  The local 
reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a 
written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –not clinically significant
Abnormal ECG –clinically significant

OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M19- 530 Version 3.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source 
folder.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine -generated measurem ents and interpretation that 
are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.  If an ECG at the Day 29 visit is 
interpreted as abnormal –clinically significant, it should be repeated at the follow -up visit or earlier, per 
the investigator's discretion until satisfactory clinical resolution or stabilization of the finding.
3.8 Height and Weight
Height will be measured at Screening only, with shoes removed.  Body weight will be measured at 
scheduled visits as specified in Section 2.  It is recommended that the subject wear lightweight clothing 
and no shoes during weighing.
3.9 Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of body temperature, respiration rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure will be obtained at visits as specified in Section 2.  Blood pressure, pulse rat e and 
respiratory rate should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 5 minutes.
3.10 Physical Examination
A complete physical examination (excluding genitourinary) will be performed at the Screening visit as 
specified in Section 2.  Subsequent physical examinations will be limited to evaluations of throat, chest, 
and heart.  At any time, a symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed 
necessary by the investigator.  The physical examination performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the 
baseline physical examination for the entire study.  Any significant physical examination findings after 
the first dose will be recorde d as AEs.  All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each subject's 
medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
3.11 Pulse Oximetry
Pulse oximetry is an indirect measurement of oxygen saturation in blood.  It will be performed begin ning 
at Screening and as specified in Section 2.  Pulse oximetry should be measured after the subject has 
been sitting for at least 5 minutes.
3.12 Sweat Collection
Sweat collection will be performed to evaluate sweat chloride (SwCl).  Sweat chloride concentration is a 
biomarker of CFTR ion channel function.  It is a sensitive, standardized and non -invasive measure to 
assess systemic CFTR modulator effec ts.  Chloride concentration will be measured in sweat collected by 
an approved collection device provided to sites by a central provider and according to the 2009 
guidelines issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
To ensure consistency and reproducibility in this multicenter study, trained clinical study centers will 
collect sweat according to procedures as outlined in the lab manual.  Two sweat collections, one from

schedule.  Sweat samples will immediately be frozen and sent to the central laboratory for testing and 
interpretation of results.
The clinical study center should be encouraged to select subjects for the study for which it is kno wn that 
adequate quantities of sweat can be collected.
The sites will be provided with sweat collection equipment and kits, and a central laboratory will act as 
central readers for SwCl.  Sweat collection will be measured beginning at Screening and as spec ified in 
Section 2.  
To prevent the potential unblinding, site personnel and subjects will not be informed of the subjects' 
study -related post -first-dose sweat chloride results until the end of the corresponding study part (Part 1 
or Part 2).  
3.13 Spirometry
Spirometry will be p erformed to assess pulmonary function beginning at Screening and as specified in 
Section 2.  At the Day 1 and Day 15 visits, spirometry must be perf ormed pre -dose and between 3 and 
5hours following dosing.
The spirometry test must meet the criteria for acceptability and repeatability as defined in the 2005 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines on standardization of lung 
function testing.1
Consistency is very important for subjects who take bronchodilators and perform airway clearance on a 
regular basis, sinc e they may have short -term effects on FEV 1, the primary endpoint for this study.  
Please refer to Section 5.4 of the protocol for detailed guidance on the timing of dosing for these 
therapies relative to spirometry.
The following parameters will be measure d as part of the spirometry assessment:
FEV 1(L) and percent predicted FEV 1for age, gender, and height;
Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L) and percent predicted FVC for age, gender, and height;
FEV 1/FVC ratio;
Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of exhaled volume (FEF 25-75).
Predicted values will be estimated using the 2012 Global Lungs Initiative equation.2
The vendor will provide the sites w ith spirometers and will act as the central reader for spirometry 
results.  
To prevent the potential unblinding, subjects will not be informed of their study -related spirometry 
results until the end of the corresponding study Part (Part 1 or Part 2).

Study drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day 1) and as specified in Section 2.  The 
first dose of study dru g will be administered after all other Baseline (Day 1) procedures are completed.  
At the visits specified in Section 2.1, the site personnel will review returned study drug kits, and empty 
study drug packaging to verify compliance.  
Study drug (i.e., ABBV -3067, ABBV -2222, and respective placebos) should be dosed together and taken 
within approximately 1 hour after a meal.  Study drugs will need to be taken at the investigative site at 
the Day 1 and Day 15 visits.  The site will provide meals at those visits.  Subjects should be instructed to 
take their study medications at the same time every day.
3.15 Clinical Laboratory Tests
The blood samples for ser um chemistry tests will be collected prior to study drug dosing on Day 1 and 
Day 15.  Fasting or non -fasting status will be recorded in the source documents and on the laboratory 
requisition.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment fo r a particular test will be 
defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.
Samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1at the time points specified in 
Section 2.

If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and t he investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator will:
repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value using the appropriate Central lab kit;
follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution ; 
if deemed appropriate, discontinue the subject from the study or require the subject to receive 
treatment; in this case, the laboratory result will be recorded as an AE; 
document the result and appropriate follow -up in the subject's source records and applicable 
eCRFs.
Pregnancy Tests (Serum and Urine)
Pregnancy testing should be performed only for women of childbearing potential.
A qualitative serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening for all female subjects of childbearing 
potential.  The s erum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory.  If the 
serum pregnancy test is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the serum pregnancy test 
is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 days later to determine eligibility.
If the repeat serum pregnancy test is:
Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Still borderline, ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a 
positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study (unless prohibited per local 
requirements) in the absence of clinical suspicion of pregnancy and other pathological causes of 
borderline results.
Additional urine pregnancy tests will be perfo rmed at visits indicated in the Activity Schedule 
(Protocol Appendix D) and Section 2.  More frequent pregnancy tests can be performed throughout t he 
study at the investigator's discretion or if required per local/country requirements.
If the baseline urine pregnancy test is negative, then dosing with study drug may begin.
If the baseline or post -baseline urine pregnancy test is positive, dosing with study drug must be 
withheld and a serum pregnancy test is required (as stated above).  If the serum pregnancy test 
is positive, the subject should be discontinued from the study.
Unless a woman is suspected to have become pregnant, additional pregnancy te sting during the 
clinical trial is not necessary.
A serum pregnancy test will also be performed at the post -treatment Day 30 follow -up visit if the urine 
pregnancy test at this visit is positive.
Urinalysis
Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  Specified abnormal 
macroscopic urinalyses defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative, 
or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a microscopic analysis at the ce ntral laboratory.
3.16 Subject Withdrawal from Study
If subjects prematurely discontinue from the study, they should be asked to return for a Premature 
Discontinuation visit and participate in a 30 -day follow -up visit if possible.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for 
discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiat ion of any new 
treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's 
condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
investigator's best clinical judgme nt, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue 
participation in the study.

dispensed in the form of capsules at the visits listed in Section 2.1.  Subjects will be instructed to take 
study drugs once daily at the same time in the morning every day within approximately 1 hour after a 
meal.
Dosing times for the Day 1 and Day 15 visits and f or the 3 doses before the Day 15 and Day 29 visits will 
be captured in the source records and eCRFs, as specified in Section 3.5.
Study drug must no t be dispensed unless the IRT system is contacted.  Study drug may only be 
dispensed to subjects enrolled in the study through the IRT system.  At the end of the Treatment Period 
or at the Premature Discontinuation visit, the site will contact the IRT syst em to provide visit date 
information and study drug return information for each kit.
6.2 Packaging and Labeling
All study drugs will be supplied in blister cards.
Each blister card will be labeled as required per country requirements.
The labels must remain af fixed to the blister cards.  All blank spaces should be completed by site staff 
prior to dispensing to subject.
Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
Study drugs must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).
The investigational p roducts are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context 
of this study.  The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and 
stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed on site as 
appropriate.
6.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study.  Once assigned to a regimen, all eligible 
subjects will receive that same assigned dosage for up to 28 days ( ±2 days).
At the Screening visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the use of the IRT.  
For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must contact the IRT 
system and identify the subject as a screen failure.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the screening visit throughout the 
study.  Upon receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.
User guidelines for IRT use will be made available separately.
6.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject

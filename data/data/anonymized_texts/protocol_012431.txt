Amendment 11, 10 Oct 2023: Current Amendment  
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial because it neither impacts the safety or 
physical/mental integrity of participants nor the scientific value of the study.  
Overall  Rationale for Amendment  11: 
The main purpose of  this amendment is to update the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP)  in 
accordance with the updated FDA guidance on emergency use authorization for vaccines to 
prevent COVID -19 (FDA 2022 ). 
The immunogenicity objectives and endpoints outlined in the CSP amendment 10 are no longer 
applicable. Therefore, these objectives and endpoints were  removed from the CSP. 
The amendment also removes the antibody response comparisons between different vaccines 
because each modified vaccine targets a specific VOC that is no longer in circulation. Hence, 
comparing antibody responses between such vaccines is deemed not clinically meaningful or 
relevant .

Design; Section 7.2: 
Immunogenicity 
Assessments ; Section 8.2:

Determination ; 
Section  8.5.3: 
Immunogenicity Analyses ; 
Section 8. 5.5 Exploratory 
Analyses  for Parts A.1, B, 
C, and D  Removed t he following objectives and 
endpoints , related to immunogenicity : 
• Primary antibody response of a 
single booster dose against 
variants contained in the vaccine 
compared to the  antibody 
response against ancestral 
SARS -CoV -2 after mRNA -1273 
prim ing series (mRNA -1273 -
P301 [COVE]  study ). 
• Secondary  antibody response 
comparisons between  booster 
dose against variants and 
priming series of mRNA -1273 
against ancestral SARS -CoV -2. 
• Exploratory antibody response 
comparisons between  booster 
dose against virus variants and 
priming series of mRNA -1273 
against the same variants . 
• Exploratory antibody response 
comparisons between booster 
vaccine s against same viral 
strains . 
Added the exploratory objectives and 
endpoints related to the immune 
response generated by 
mRNA -1273.211, mRNA -1273, 
mRNA -1273.61 7.2, and 
mRNA -1273.213 booster dose against 
the original SARS -CoV -2 virus and 
different variants, at selected 
timepoints.  
Also removed corresponding sections  
related to these endpoints in  the 
statistical methods, sample size 
calculation, immunogenicity 
assessments and analyses  and 
exploratory analyses . Section 8.5.5 
Subgroup Analyses was added in the 
place of Section 8.5.5 Exploratory 
Analyses.  Remove d the 
immunogenicity objectives 
and endpoints that are no 
longer applicable for the 
immunogenicity assess ment 
based on updated FDA 
guidance on modified 
vaccine.  
 
Remove d the antibody 
response comparisons 
between different vaccines 
because each modified 
vaccine targets a specific 
VOC that is no longer in 
circulation. Hence, 
comparing antibody 
responses between  such 
vaccines is deemed not 
clinically meaningful or

There is no hypothesis testing for Part A.2 . 
For Part A.2 participants, Day 29 and Day 181 immune response after mRNA -1273.214 
(50 µg) as a second booster dose  will be compared with their own Day 29 and Day  181 
immune response of mRNA -1273.211 (50 µg)  received as the first booster dose . GMT ratios 
will be calculated by back transforming the mean of paired differences of antibody titer data 
on the logarithmic scale between Day 29  and Day 181  post mRNA -1273.214 and Day 29 and 
Day 181 of antibody titer data post mRNA -1273.211 . CIs for the GMT ratio will be based on 
t-distribution of the log -transformed values then back -transformed to the original scale for 
presen tation . Seroresponse rates at  Day 29  and Day 181 post mRNA -1273.214  will be 
compared with their seroresponse rates at Day 29 and Day 181 post mRNA -1273.211 . The

Part F:  
Cohort 1:  
50 µg mRNA -1273. 529 booster dose (first booster  dose) will be assessed with respect to 
mRNA -1273  booster dose  (first booster  dose) using an external comparator (details  regarding 
the external historical control  will be included in the SAP) . For the primary immunogenicity 
objective s, there are 3 hypotheses to be tested.  
A. H11: 50 µg mRNA -1273.529, as a single booster dose, against the variant B.1.1.529 is 
non-inferior to the booster dose of (50 µg ) mRNA -1273 against B.1.1.5 29 at Day  29 
compared to mRNA -1273 against the variant B.1.1.529 at Day 29 with a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.5.  
B. H12: 50 µg mRNA -1273. 529, as a single booster dose, against the variant  B.1.1.529  is 
non-inferior to the booster dose of (50 µg) mRNA -1273 against B.1.1.529 based on the 
difference in SRR at Day 29 with a non -inferiority margin of 10%.  
C. H13: 50 µg mRNA -1273. 529, as a single booster dose, against the variant  B.1.1.529  is 
superior to the booster dose of (50 µg) mRNA -1273 against B.1.1.529 based on the 
GMT ratio of mRNA -1273.529 against the variant B.1.1.529 at Day 29 compared to 
mRNA -1273 against the variant B.1.1.529 at Day 29 . 
An ANCOVA model will be performed  to assess the difference in  immune response between 
mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273 (using external comparator) as the first booster dose. For 
immune response against the B.1.1.529 strain, in the ANCOVA model, antibody titers at 
Day 29 postboost er against the B.1.1.529 strain will be a d ependent  variable, and a group 
variable (mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273) will be the fixed effect,  adjusting for age groups 
(< 65, ≥ 65 years) and preboost er antibody titer level, if applicable.  
The GMT will be estimated by the GLSM from the model and its cor responding 95% will be 
provided for each group. The GMR (ratio of GMTs) for mRNA -1273.529 with respect to 
mRNA -1273 will be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model and the corresponding 
95% CIs will be provided. The 95% CI for GMR will be used to ass ess the between group 
difference in immune response against the B.1.1.529 strain for mRNA -1273.529 at Day  29 
compared to the mRNA -1273 . 
The number and percentage (rate) of participants achieving seroresponse at Day 29 will be 
summarized with 95% CI calcula ted using the Clopper -Pearson method for each group. The 
difference of SRR between mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273 will be calculated with 95% CI  
based on Miettinen -Nurminen method . The non -inferiority in SRR of mRNA -1273. 529 
compared to mRNA -1273 will be cons idered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% of 
the SRR difference is > -10% based on the non -inferiority margin of 10%.  
The primary immunogenicity objective (against the B.1.1.529 ) is considered met if 
non-inferiority is demonstrated based on GMR  and SRR  difference , specifically:  
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio between mRNA1273 .529 against the 
variant  (B.1. 1.529 ) at Day 29 as compared to 50 µg mRNA1273  against B.1.1.529  at 
Day 29 is > 0.667  based on the non -inferiority margin of 1.5

Cohort 2:  
The same  analyses methods described in Part F Cohort 1 will be used for Cohort 2.

The analyses method  described in Part F Cohort 1  will be used for Part G . 
The primary immunogenicity objective is considered met if non -inferiority against B.1.1.529 
based on GMR and SRR  difference , and non -inferiority against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 based 
on GMR are  demonstrated at Day 29  or at Day 91 . 
For the primary immunogenicity objective, the non -inferiority of mRNA -1273.214 as 
compared to mRNA -1273 against the B.1.1.529 and the non -inferiority of mRNA -1273.214 as 
compared to mRNA -1273 against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 at Day 29 will be assessed using a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.5 at 2 -sided alpha of 0.025 , and the non -inferiority of 
mRNA -1273.214 as compared to mRNA -1273 against B.1.1.529  based on SRR using a 
non-inferiority margin of 10% at 2 -sided alpha of 0.025 .  
Superiority of mRNA -1273.214 as compared to mRNA -1273 against the B.1.1.529 strain will 
be evaluated at Day 29. Once the non -inferiority of mRNA -1273.214 as compared to 
mRNA -1273 against B.1.1.529 and against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 at Day 29 is demonstrated, 
the 97.5% CI of GMR (mRNA -1273.214 vs mRNA -1273) will be used to assess superiority of 
mRNA -1273.214 as compared to mRNA -1273. If the lower bound of the GMR >  1 at Day  29, 
superiority of mRNA -1273.214 compared to mRNA -1273 against B.1.1.529 will be 
considered demonstrated.  
Hypotheses testing at Day 91  will be performed in the same manner ; first test 3 non-inferiority 
hypotheses ( 2 against  B.1.1.529 and 1 against ancestral SARS -CoV -2) at alpha of 0.025 level

SARS -CoV -2, then superiority testing against B.1.1.529 at alpha of 0.025 level (two -sided) 
will also be performed.  
For the key seconda ry objective, there are 2 hypotheses to be tested  (Day 29 and Day 91 each 
with alpha level of 0.025, 2 -sided) : 
A. H19: 50 µg mRNA -1273.214, as a second booster dose, against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 
is non -inferior to the booster dose of (50 µg) mRNA -1273 against  ancestral SARS -
CoV -2 based on the difference in SRR at Day 29 with a non -inferiority margin of 10%.  
B. H110: 50 µg mRNA -1273.214, as a second booster dose, against ancestral 
SARS -CoV -2 is non -inferior to the booster dose of (50 µg) mRNA -1273 against 
ancestral SARS -CoV -2 based on the difference in SRR at Day 91 with a 
non-inferiority margin of 10%.  
If the lower bound of the 97.5% CI of the SRR difference (50 µg mRNA -1273. 214 against 
ancestral SARS -CoV -2–- 50 µg mRNA -1273 against ancestral SARS -CoV -2) is >-10% at 
Day 29 or Day 91 , then the key secondary objective will be considered met.  
In the event that an early assessment of the 1273.214 data is needed due to public health 
concerns , a two -staged approach might be used. Specifically, a subset of participants’ ( ie, 
50 first enrolled participants) serum samples will first be tested against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 
and variants of concern . For the Day 29 and Day 91  immunogenicity analys es, all participant s’ 
immune data will be used in the formal interim analysis to evaluate the primary 
immunogenicity objective.  
Part H:  
The primary immunogenicity objective will be assessed in the per -protocol immunogenicity, 
SARS -CoV -2 negative set.  
The analyses method s described in Part F Cohort 1 will be used for Part H . 
The primary immunogenicity objective is considered met if non -inferiority against Omicron 
BA.4/5 and ancestral SARS -CoV -2 D614G  based on GMR and SRR difference at Day 29 is 
demonstrated.  
Non-inferiority against Omicron BA.4/5:  
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio between mRNA -1273.222 against 
Omicron BA.4/5 at Day 29 as compared to 50 µg mRNA -1273 against BA.4/5 at 
Day 29 is > 0.667  based on the non -inferiority margin of 1.5 .  
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference (50 µg mRNA -1273. 222 against 
Omicron BA. 4/5 at Day 29 –- 50 µg mRNA -1273 against BA.4/5 at Day 29) is > -5%.  
Non-inferiority against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 D614G : 
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio between mRNA -1273.222 against 
ancestral SARS -CoV -2 D614G  at Day 2 9 as compared to 50 µg mRNA -1273 against 
ancestral SARS -CoV -2 D614G  at Day 29 is > 0.667 based on the non -inferiority 
margin of 1.5.

will be co mpared to 1, and if it is higher than 1 then superiority will also be demonstrated.  
Part J: 
No formal hypothesis testing will be performed for Part J and all safety and immunogenicity 
analyses will be descriptive.  The primary immunogenicity objective will be assessed using the 
Per-Protocol Set for Immunogenicity. Comparisons on immunogenicity response between the 
mRNA -1273.815 and mRNA -1273.231 treatment  arms may be performed.  
Immunogenicity endpoints applicable to all study parts : 
SARS -CoV -2-specific bAb and nAb are assessed at multiple timepoints in each part of this 
study . 
For each of the antibodies of interest, eg, levels of SARS -CoV -2–specific bAb and 
SARS -CoV -2–specific nAb, the GMT or level with corresponding 95% CI at each time point, 
and GMFR of post-baseline/baseline titers or levels with corresponding 95% CI at each 
post-baseline time point will be provided for each arm. The 95% CIs will be calculated based 
on the t -distribution of the log -transformed values then back -transformed to the original  scale 
for presentation. The following descriptive statistics will also be provided at each time point: 
number of participants (n), median, minimum, and maximum.  
The mixed effect model repeated measure (MMRM) will be used to analyze all postboost er 
measure s for between -booster comparison  when applicable , the model will include treatment 
group, analysis visit, treatment by visit interaction, and adjusting for age groups and 
preboost er titer levels. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model t he 
within -participant errors. The GMT will be estimated from the model and its corresponding 
95% CI will be provided for each group at each postboost  timepoint. The GMR (ratio of 
GMTs) will be estimated from the model and the corresponding 95% CI will be p rovided at 
each postboost  timepoint.  
The SRR of each arm against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and variant s, defined as the percentage 
of participants achieving seroresponse against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and variant s 
respectively, will be provided for each arm with the 95% CI calculated using the 
Clopper -Pearson method.  
The primary definition of seroresponse is defined as ≥ 4  × LLOQ for those with pre-dose 1 of 
primary series baseline <  LLOQ; ≥ 4 -foldrise for those with pre-dose 1 of primary series 
baseline ≥ LLOQ. The secondary definition of seroresponse is defined as ≥ 4  × LLOQ for 
those with preboost er baseline <  LLOQ; ≥ 4 -foldrise for those with preboost er ≥ LLOQ.  SRR 
will be summarized using both definition s for all the study parts . 
Efficacy Analysis  
This study is not designed to assess efficacy. Descriptive  summaries of symptomatic 
COVID -19 disease , asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection, as well as SARS -CoV -2 infection  
regardless of symptom s will be provided for each arm.  
Planned  Analyses  
Interim Analyses  
The interim analysis will be conducted based on safety and immunogenicity data collected 
through  Day 15 or  Day 29. The interim analysis may be conducted either after all participant s 
in Part s A.1, A.2, B, C, D, F, G, H, or J  have completed their Day 15 or Day 29 visit 
assessments and/or subsequent timepoint visits (eg , Day 91 for Parts F , G, H, and J ) or

1.1. Study Rationale   
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS). An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID -19, later designated 
SARS -CoV -2) initially emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. The 
World Health  Organization (WHO) declared COVID -19 a pandemic on 11  Mar 2020 with more 
than 157  million cases and 3.2  million deaths by 09 May 2021 ( WHO 2021 ). 
ModernaTX, Inc. (the Sponsor)’s scalable messenger RNA (mRNA)/lipid nanoparticle ( LNP) 
technology platform allowed for a rapid response to the pandemic and was used to develop 
mRNA -1273, a novel LNP -encapsulated mRNA -based vaccine against SARS -CoV -2. 
mRNA -1273 contains a single mRNA (CX -024414) that encodes for the full -length 
SARS -CoV -2 spike (S) protein of the Wuhan -Hu-1 SARS -CoV -2 virus, modified with 2 proline 
substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S -2P) to stabilize the spike protein into a 
prefusion conformation. Having achieved the primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 s tudy 
conducted in persons at high risk for SARS -CoV -2 infection, in December 2020, mRNA -1273 
was granted EUA for the prevention of COVID -19 for individuals 18 years of age and older 
based on the demonstration of efficacy and safety in a Phase 3 pivotal tri al and was subsequently 
licensed in the U S (31 January 2022) (Baden  et al 2021 ). 
Over the course of the pandemic, SARS -CoV -2 variants have emerged and are likely to continue 
to emerge, some of which may prove to have some level of escape from immunity associated 
with previous infection or vaccination. Recently, newer variants have raised concern, due to 
reports of increased infe ctivity or reduction in the ability of convalescent sera or sera from 
vaccinated participant s to neutralize these emergent strain variants. Mutations occurring in the 
receptor -binding domain (RBD) are of particular concern, as this site includes the domina nt 
neutralization epitopes on the S protein and these mutations could impact the effectiveness of 
antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination in neutralizing the virus ( Greaney et al 2021 ). 
These recent evolutionary event s indicate that SARS -CoV -2 has the capacity to develop more 
efficient transmission between human hosts ( Martin et al 2021 ) and vaccination strategies to 
control the virus need to be responsive to this evolution. A SARS -CoV -2 variant, B.1.1.7, rapidly 
spread from southeast England around the globe. Relative to the Wuhan viral isolate, B.1.1.7 
includes 8 mutations located in the S protein, including the N501Y mutation occurring in the 
RBD. Early analyses indicate that B.1.1.7 has a substantial fitness advantage over other currently 
circulating lineages. The B.1.351 variant emerged in South Africa, and the P.1 lineage has 
recently been reported in Brazil. There are at least 11 mutations located in the S protein, 3 of 
which (K417 N, E484K, and N501Y) are found in the RBD.  More recently SARS -CoV -2 variants 
emerged in India, and the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta variant) containing 2 mutations in the RBD 
(L452R and T478K) is currently circulating globally. In vitro characterization of ser a from 
individuals recently vaccinated with the 2 -dose regimen of the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine at 
the 100 µg dose showed that the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine produced neutralizing titers 
against key emerging variants tested, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B. 1.617.2 ( Wang et al 
2021 , Wu et al 2021a , Choi A et al 2021 ). The studies showed no significant reduction in 
neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 relative to the ancestra l Wuhan -Hu-1 strain and a 2.1 -fold 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 55 reduction versus B.1.617.2; however, a greater than six -fold reduction in neutralizing titers was 
observed against the B.1.351 variant relative to the Wuhan -Hu-1. Evidence from adenovirus 
vector SARS -CoV -2 vaccines based on the Wuhan -Hu-1 sequence suggests reduced vaccine 
efficacy against moderate to severe COVID -19 in South Africa where the B.1.351 variant is 
circulating ( Madhi et al 2021 , Sadoff et al 2021 ). 
In November 2021, the SARS -CoV -2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 ; BA.1 ) was detected in South 
Africa and currently epidemiological information about its spread in other regions is being 
evaluated. The Omicron variant has significant antigenic change with a potentia l growth 
advantage. In addition, it contains  potential antibody escape site mutations (such as K417N, 
T478K, E484A, and N501Y) . After the emergency of the BA.1 sublineage, other Omicron 
sublineages (BA.2, BA.4, BA.5 , and XBB.1.5 ) with additional potential antibody escape site 
mutations have been detected in multiple geographies.  
There is an urgent need for vaccination strategies that induce broader protection against variants 
of concern (VOC), to decrease morbidity and mortality.  In addition, it is currentl y not known 
whether breakthrough infections could occur long -term due to waning antibody titers 
(Doria -Rose et al 2021 , Pegu A et al ). Based on the experience of mRNA -1273  and leveraging 
the flexible nature of the mRNA technology, Moderna is evaluating multiple mRNA vaccines to 
address emerging variants.  
Overall, study Part s A.1, B, C, and D will assess antibody response of a single booster dose of 
the mRNA vaccines in each  study part. Study Part F Cohort 1 will assess whether a single 
booster dose of the mRNA -1273.529 as the first booster dose will elicit a similar or superior 
antibody response to the B.1.1.529 compared to a single booster dose of mRNA -1273, using an 
extern al comparator; Study Part F Cohort 2 will assess whether a single booster dose of the 
mRNA -1273.529 as a second booster dose will elicit a similar or superior antibody response to 
the B.1.1.529 compared to a single booster dose of mRNA -1273 as a second boo ster dose. Study 
Part G will assess whether a single booster dose of the mRNA -1273.214 as a second booster 
dose will elicit a similar or superior antibody response to the B.1.1.529 compared to a single

Background and Overview  
The Sponsor has developed a rapid  response, proprietary vaccine platform based on mRNA 
delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells in vivo can 
take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The 
delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact wi th the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently.

The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a novel LNP -encapsulated 
mRNA -based vaccine agai nst SARS -CoV -2 (mRNA -1273 ). mRNA -1273  encodes for the 
full-length S protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce 2 proline residues to stabilize the 
S protein (S -2P) in a prefusion conformation. The CoV -S protein mediates attachment and entry 
of the virus into host cells (by fusion), making it a primary target for neutralizing antibodies 
(nAbs) that prevent infection ( Corbett et al 2020 ). It has been confirmed that the stabilized 
SARS -CoV -2 S2P antigen presents in the correct prefusion conformation ( Wrapp et al 2020 ).

Confidential  Page 57 1.2. Nonclinical Studies   
The Sponsor has conducted preclinical studies to evaluate modified vaccines. The 
immunogenicity of mRNA -1273.351 (a monovalent product containing mRNA CX -027367) and 
a 1:1 mix of mRNA -1273 and mRNA -1273.351 was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Both vaccines 
were evaluated as a 2 -dose primary series in mice, and mRNA -1273.351 was also evaluate d as a 
booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with 2 doses of mRNA -1273. The results 
demonstrated that a primary vaccination series of mRNA -1273.351 was effective at increasing 
nAb titers against the B.1.351 variant, while a 1:1 mix of mRNA -1273 and  mRNA -1273.351 was 
most effective at providing broad cross -variant neutralization. Studies also demonstrated that a 
third dose of mRNA -1273.351 significantly increased both Wuhan -Hu-1 and B.1.351 -specific 
neutralization titers ( Wu et al 2021b ). 
Additional studies are being performed in mice, golden Syrian hamsters, and rhesus macaques to 
further evaluate mRNA -1273, mRNA -1273.351, and mRNA -1273.211 as both a primary series 
vaccine and as a single  booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with a primary 
mRNA -1273 vaccine series. These studies are to determine the immunogenicity of the primary 
series or booster vaccines and to evaluate protection from challenge with wild -type and variant 
viruses. These data will be reported once s tudies have been completed.  A vaccine that contains 
the spike protein sequence of the B.1.617.2 vaccine has been developed, mRNA -1273.617.2. The 
immunogenicity of this vaccine is being evaluated as a monovalent product and as a component 
in a multivalent f ormulation, mixed with mRNA -1273 or mRNA -1273.351.  Additional animal 
studies are currently being conducted with mRNA vaccines that target  different Omicron 
variants.  
1.3. Clinical Studies   
The Sponsor has previously evaluated modified  Beta variant -matched booster  vaccines in the 
completed Phase 2a clinical study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and the Sponsor is currently evaluating 
several modified vaccines (containing spike sequences of the Beta, Delta , and Omicron variants)  
in the present study, mRNA -1273 -P205 .

1.4.2.  Risks from Study Partic ipation and Their Mitigation   
The safety profile of mRNA -1273 is largely based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 Study 
mRNA -1273 -P301 (COVE) . 
Solicited ARs were reported more frequ ently among vaccine participants than among placebo 
participants. The most frequently reported ARs after any dose in the vaccine group were pain at 
the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia and chills. The most common solicited local AR 
was pain. Soli cited systemic ARs were reported more frequently by vaccine participants after 
dose 2 (fatigue, 65.3%, headache, 58.6%, myalgia, 58% and arthralgia, 42.8%) than after dose 1 
(fatigue, 37,2%, headache, 32.7%, myalgia, 22.7% and arthralgia,16.6%). Grade 3 sy stemic ARs 
were also reported more frequently after dose 2 than after dose 1. The majority of local and 
systemic ARs had a median duration of 1 to 3 days.  
Overall, there was a higher reported rate of some ARs in younger age groups: the incidence of 
axillar y swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, and 
fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above.  
Grade 3 solicited local ARs were more frequently reported after dose 2 than after dose 1.  
Unsolicited AEs that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported by 
23.9% of participants who received mRNA -1273 and 21.6% of participants who received 
placebo. Unsolicited AEs that occurred in ≥ 1% of study pa rticipants who received mRNA -1273 
and at a rate at least 1.5 -fold higher rate than placebo, were lymphadenopathy related events 
(1.1% vs. 0.6%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are similar to the axillary 
swelling/tenderness in the injected arm reported as solicited ARs. Several participants reported 
injection site reactions after Day 7 that were characterized by erythema, induration and often 
pruritus. Consultation with a dermatopathologist suggested that these were most likely dermal 
hypersensitivity an d were unlikely to represent a long -term safety concern.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 59 Hypersensitivity AEs were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo 
recipients. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection 
site urticaria , which are likely related to vaccination. There have been no cases of severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions reported immediately after vaccination in the trial to 
date.  
There were 3 reports of Bell’s palsy in the mRNA -1273 vaccine group (one o f which was a n 
SAE ), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after vaccination, and one in the placebo group which 
occurred 17 days after vaccination. Currently available information on Bell’s palsy is insufficient 
to determine a causal relationship with the va ccine.  
SAEs  were reported at the same rates in participants who received mRNA -1273 and placebo 
from the first dose until the last observation. There were 2 SAEs of facial swelling in vaccine 
recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers.  The onset of swelling was reported 
1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination. There was 
1 SAE of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with prior history of severe headache 
and nausea requiring hospital ization. This event occurred 1 day after vaccination and was likely 
related to vaccination.  
There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between study arms for specific 
categories of AEs (including other neurologic, neuro -inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that 
would suggest a causal relationship to mRNA -1273.  
In the Post -Authorization setting, anaphylaxis has been reported following mRNA -1273 
administration.  In addition, there have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis 
occurring  after vaccination with  Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine. Although causality has not been 
established, the majority of the  cases have been reported in young males shortly after the second 
dose of the vaccine. These are  typically mild cases and individuals t end to recover within a short 
time following standard  treatment and rest.  Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs 
and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis . Safety will be monitored throughout the study 
(Section 7.4). 
1.4.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion   
The evolving antigenic variation of SARS -CoV -2 underscores the urgent need for v accination 
strategies that induce broader protection, specifically against VOC with attendant risk of viral 
escape. Moderna TX, Inc. is developing monovalent and multivalent mRNA vaccines ( including  
mRNA -1273. 214, mRNA -1273.222 , mRNA -1273. 815, and mRNA -1273 .231) that are similar to 
the mRNA -1273 vaccine, but in which the mRNA encodes for mutations included in the 
S protein of both ancestral SARS -CoV -2 (Wuhan -Hu-1) and VOC  to enhance protection against 
COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 variants.

leading to withdrawal, SAEs, pregnancies, and information about concomitant medications and 
receipt of non -study vaccinations. For participants who have previously participated in Part H of 
this study, the total nu mber of visits completed in the study overall will be 10 -12 depending on 
whether screening and dosing are performed on the same day.  
At the dosing visit on Day 1, participants will be instructed how to document and report solicited 
ARs within a provided electronic diary (eDiary). Solicited ARs will be assessed for 7 days (the 
day of injection and the following 6 days), and unsolicited A Es will be assessed for 28 days after 
injection; SAEs, MAAEs, A Es leading to withdrawal, pregnancies a nd AESI will be assessed 
throughout the study. All participants will be tested for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies 
at baseline and at Day 29 (primary immunogenicity endpoint).  Participants in Part J will also be 
tested for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies at Day 15  (primary immunogenicity 
endpoint) . Additional blood draws will be collected on  Day 9 1 (Part s A.2, F, G, H, and J  only) , 
Day 181 , and Day  366 (Part s A.1, B, C, D, F, and G only) . In addition, active surveillance for 
intercurrent or breakthrough SARS -CoV -2 infection will occur throughout the study and 
reported as AEs (confirmed symptomatic infections will be reported as MAAEs if not SAEs). 
Participants with signs and symptoms meeting the CDC case definition for COVID -19 
(21 February 2 021 or most recent [ CDC 2020 ]) will be asked to contact the site and undergo 
prompt assessment which will include RT -PCR testing (of a respiratory sample) to assess 
symptomatic COVID -19. Participants with any clinical or radio graphic evidence of pneumonia 
will also undergo RT -PCR testing. Suspected COVID -19 cases will also be tested using a 
multiplex assay to assess for non –SARS -CoV -2 causes of upper or lower respiratory tract 
infection  (Table  12 and Table  13). Participants will have blood samples collected at scheduled  
study site visits during the study for immunogenicity assessments or other medical concerns 
according to the investigator’s judgment.  
Participants may experience A Es, to include symptoms of COVID -19, that necessitate an 
unscheduled visit. There may also b e situations in which the investigator asks a participant to 
report for an unscheduled visit following the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be 
conducted at these visits as necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of participants during 
the study. Electronic case report forms should be completed for each unscheduled visit. In 
addition, participants may have blood samples collected at unscheduled visits for acute 
respiratory symptoms.  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may be collecte d for a subset of participants at 
selected sites at baseline (Day 1) and  at Days 15, 29, and 91 to characterize the T -cell and B -cell 
responses against SARS -CoV -2 and variants.  
Participants will be enrolled to receive 50 or 100 µg dose of mRNA -1273.211 (Pa rt A.1), 100  µg 
mRNA -1273 (Part B), 50 µg or 100 µg mRNA -1273.617.2 (Part C) , 50 µg or 100 µg

mRNA -1273. 815 or 50 µg mRNA -1273.231 (Part J).  The interim  analysis will be conducted 
based on safety and immunogenicity data collected through  Day 15 or  Day 29. The interim  
analysis may be conducted either after all participant s in Part s A.1, A.2, B, C , D, F, G, H, or J  
have completed their Day 15 or Day 29 visit assessments and/or subsequent timepoint visits (eg, 
Day 91 for Parts F  and G , and H ) or combined after the last participant  in any of the study parts

completed their Day 15 or Day 29 visit assessments. The final study analysis after 12 months of 
follow -up will be completed for all participants  in Parts A.1 , B, C, D, F , and G . The final study 
analysis  after 6 mont hs of follow -up will be completed for all participants in Parts  A.2, H, and J . 
3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design   
This study is designed as an open -label study.  
With SARS -CoV -2 expected to be circulating in the general population during the study, all 
participants will provide pre -injection and post -injection blood samples for analysis of antibodies 
to non -vaccine antigens through 12 months after study injection , or 6 months af ter study 
injection for Part s A.2, H, and J . In addition, participants will have NP swab samples collected 
before vaccination on Day 1, on Day 29, and also on Day 91 (Part s A.2, F, G, H, and J  only), 
Day 181, and Day  366 (EoS)  (Parts A.1, B, C, D, F , and G  only) . Furthermore, in case of any 
signs or symptoms or MAAEs suggesting SARS -CoV -2 infection in a participant, an additional 
NP swab sample and blood sample will be collected to confirm the diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 
via serology and RT -PCR. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
Since it is possible that participants are naturally exposed to SARS -CoV -2 through community 
exposure, the NP swab samples collected before study injection and the serologic assays 
performed for antibody responses to non -vaccine antigen(s), may help to discriminate between 
natural infection and vaccine -induced antibody responses, should such discrimination be needed.  
3.3. Justification for Dose, Control Product, and C hoice of Study 
Population   
The dose of the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 vaccine (mRNA -1273) was clinically evaluated at dose 
levels of 25, 50, 100, and 250 µg in a 2 -dose series in a Phas e 1 dose -ranging study, with the 
100-µg dose level selected for the pivotal Phase 3 trial. Therefore, the dose of 100 µg will be 
used as the booste r dose in Part B of this study (monovalent mRNA1273 booster). In addition, 
the dose of 50 µg and 100 µg will b e used for the monovalent mRNA1273.617.2 booster ( Part C).  
In Part D, the bivalent mRNA -1273 -213 50 µg and 100µg dose will be used as a booster.  In 
Part F, the monovalent mRNA -1273.529 50  µg will be used as a first booster  dose after 
mRNA -1273 primary series at least 6 months post -second dose, or as a second booster dose at 
least 3 months after  mRNA -1273 50  µg booster . In Part G and Part A.2, the multivalent 
mRNA -1273.214 booster candidate will be administered at the 50 -µg dose level as a second 
booster  dose. In Part H the multivalent mRNA -1273.222 booster candidate will be administered 
at the 50 -µg dose level as a second booster dose. In Part J, the multivalent booster candidates 
mRNA -1273. 815 and mRNA -1273.231  will be administered at a dose of  50 µg. 
In the mRNA -1273 -P201 study, mRNA -1273 administered as a single booster dose of 50  µg was 
well-tolerated and demonstrated significant boosting of neutralizing antibody responses to 
SARS -CoV -2 in a pseudovirus neutralization assay ( Wu et al 2021b ). 
This study will screen and enroll healthy adults, 18 years of age and above, who have previously 
received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in the mRNA -1273 -P301 (COVE) study  or under EUA  (Parts 
A.1, B, C, and D) ; or who have previously received  2 doses of mRNA -1273 and a booster dose

records in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IP, site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition  of used and unused IP vials.  
A site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during site visits and at the 
completion of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA -1273 -P205 Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.3.7.  Study Vaccine Handling and Disposal   
A site monitor will reconcile the IP inventory during the conduct and at the end of the study for 
compliance. Once fully reconciled at the site at the end of the study, the IP should be destroyed 
on site, if site procedures allow, or returned to a destruct ion depot per instruction of the Sponsor. 
Additional details are found in the mRNA -1273 -P205 Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3.8.  Unblinding   
This is an open -label study.  
5.4. Study Intervention Complianc e  
All doses of IP will be administered at the study site under direct observation of medically 
qualified study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Quali fied staff will 
confirm that the participant has received the entire dose of IP. If a participant does not receive IP 
or does not receive all of the planned dose, the reason for the missed dose will be recorded. Data 
will be reconciled with site accountabi lity records to assess compliance.  
The study site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
participant and complete a visit  within the defined visit window specified in the SoE ( Table  17, 
Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). If a participant does not complete a visit within the time 
window, that visit will be classified as a missed visit and the participant will continue with 
subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requireme nts of the missed visit will be captured 
and included in the subsequent visit.  
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications   
5.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapies   
Information about prior medications (including any prescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant within the 28 days before providing 
informed consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in 
the participant’s eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 91 5.5.2.  Concomitant Medications and Therapies   
At study s ite, study staff must question the participant regarding any medications taken and 
non-study vaccinations received by the participant and record the following information in the 
eCRF:  
• All non -study vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 da ys before the 
study injection.  
• Seasonal influenza vaccine administered for the current influenza season (typically 
October through April in the Northern Hemisphere).  
• All concomitant medications and non -study vaccinations  taken through 28 days after 
vaccina tion. Antipyretics and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the 
absence of any symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as 
such.  
• Any concomitant medications used to prevent or treat COVID -19 or its symptoms.  
• Any concom itant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or an 
MAAE . 
• The participant will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or 
analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7 days after vaccination, including 
the day of inj ection. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should be recorded 
in the source document by the study site staff during the post -injection study visits or 
via other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including v accinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary. If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the contract 
research organization (CRO)’s medical monitor will make a joint decision about continuing or 
withholding further i njection of the participant based on the time the medication was 
administered, the drug’s pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication 
will compromise the participant’s safety or interpretation of the data. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that details regarding the concomitant medications are adequately 
recorded in the eCRF.  
5.5.3.  Concomitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the Elimination of a 
Participant from Per -Protocol Analyses   
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the per -protocol 
(PP) analysis  (analysis sets are described in Section  8.4): 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the IP used 
during the study  period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs administered chronically (ie, 
more than 14  days in total) during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean 
that prednisone ≥ 10  mg/day or the equivalent is not permitted. Inhaled, nasa l, and 
topical steroids are allowed.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 92 • Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the study 
period (eg, infliximab).  
• An authorized or licensed vaccine administered during the period from 28  days before 
through 28  days after vaccinatio n, except for any licensed influenza vaccine that was 
administered 14  days before or after vaccination.  
• Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered during the study period.  
In addition, any participant confirmed to have received or plans to rece ive a non -study  
COVID -19 vaccine, either licensed or under EUA, may also not be included in the PP analysis . 
5.6. Intervention After the End of the Study

for delay of injection, and, if either of these events occur at the time scheduled for dosing, the 
participant may be injected at a later date  within the time window specified in the SoE ( Table  17, 
Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20), or the participant may be discontinued from dosing at the 
discretion of the investigator ( Section  6.2): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing . 
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) at  the time of dosing . 
Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator. 
Participants with a fever of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher will be contacted within the time window 
acceptable for participation and re -evaluated for eligibility. If the investigator determines that the 
participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug  therapy, an injection could be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
6.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study   
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
A participant who chooses not to receive the  second booster dose of mRNA -1273.214  in 
Part A.2 of the study will NOT be considered to have discontinued treatment  and can remain in 
the study in Part A.1  and will complete all scheduled visits and assessments.  
Participants receiving a second or subsequent non -study COVID -19 booster vaccine can remain 
in the  study for safety evaluation . The investigator will request that the participant complete all 
scheduled study visits . Blood and NP samples  will not be collect ed in participants who have 
received subsequent non -study COVID -19 booster vaccines . If a participant meets the criteria for 
an illness visit (Section  7.1.6 ), NP samples will be collected during the illness visit  per protocol.  
If participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will attempt 
to obtain agreement to f ollow -up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or 
stable and will then complete the EoS eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a part icipant from the study was made by the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 94 participant or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• AESI (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (speci fy) 
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs and AESI) must 
be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators 
will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE or AE 
until resolution of the event.  
A parti cipant withdrawing from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may ret ain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  10.2.6 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all rese arch results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted  by local regulations).  
6.3. Lost to Follow -up  
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the part icipant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 95 necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unreachab le or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 96 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES   
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) (as detailed in Section 10.2.6 ). Participants will undergo study procedures at the time 
points specified in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). A participant can also 
be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An unscheduled visit may be 
prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness vi sit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. 
The site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform 
the participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow -up on ongoing or outstanding 
issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 202 3), investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the app roval of the Sponsor. Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of participants and study site staff or to comply with 
state or municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be followed as presented in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and 
Table  20). Adherence to the study design requirements is essential and required for 
study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue participation 
in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedure s conducted as a part of the participant’s routine clinical management and 
obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes 
provided that the procedures meet the protocol -specified criteria and are performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and 
Table  20). 
• The Screening Visit and Day 1 visit may be completed on the same day.  
7.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures   
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant, 
according to the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs (Section 7.4.3 ) that occur during the 7 days 
following vaccination (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs 
will be recorded daily using eDiaries ( Section 7.1.1 ). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 97 • Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following vaccination (ie, 
the day of injection and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are defined in 
Section  7.4.1 . 
• AEs leading to withdrawal from Day 1 through EoS.  
• MAAEs from vaccination on Day 1 through EoS or withdrawal from the study . 
• AESI from vaccination on Day 1 through EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• SAEs from vaccination on Day 1 through EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• Vital sign measurements before and after vaccination ( Section 7.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings (if performed) ( Section 7.1.5 ). 
• Assessments for SARS -CoV 2 infection from Day 1 through study completion.  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study treatment and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section 7.4.6 ). 
The incidence and severity of the above events will be monitored by an IST on a regular basis.  
Participants who receive a non -study second booster dose (or any subsequent doses, if available 
in the future), after having received all prior booster doses in the study, can remain in the study 
for safety follow -up. 
7.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries   
At the time of consent, the participants must confirm they will be willing to complete an eDiary 
using either an application downloaded to their smartphone or using a device that will be 
provided at the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, the p articipant will be instructed 
to download the eDiary application or will be provided an eDiary device to record solicited ARs 
(Section  7.4.3 ) on Day  1. 
On Day 1 (dosing day), participants will be instructed on thermometer usage to measure body 
temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), 
and self -assessment for localized axillary swelling or tenderness  on the same side as the injection 
arm. 
On Day 1 (dosing day), participants will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 
30 minutes after the injection under supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry 
of assessments. The stud y site staff will perform any retraining as necessary. Participants will 
continue to record data in the eDiary after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening and 
at the same time each day, on the day of injection and for 6 days following inject ion. 
Participants will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity A Rs, as defined in Section  7.4.3 , that 
occur on the day of vaccination and during the 7 days after vaccination (ie, the day of 
injection and 6 subsequent days). Any solicited AR that is ongoing beyond Day  7 will 
be reported in the eDiary until it has resolved, and not to exceed 28 days after 
vaccination. A Rs recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 98 study site staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site 
visit.  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by the study site. If body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
• Other measurements, as applicable, for solicited local A Rs (injection site erythema 
and swelling/induration) will be performed using the ruler provided by the study site.  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on Day 1 or for the next 
6 days.  
The eDiary will be the only source document allowed for solicited systemic or local A Rs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. The participant will have a limited window on the following day to complete 
assessments for the previous day; quantitative te mperature recordings and measurement of any 
injection site erythema or swelling/induration reported on the following day may be excluded 
from the analyses of solicited A Rs. 
Any new safety information reported during safety telephone calls or at site visits  (including a 
solicited AR) that is not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the source documents 
as a verbally reported event. Any AR reported in this manner must be described as an unsolicited 
event and therefore entered on the AE eCRF.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants during the safety call 7  days after 
vaccination.  
The eDiary will also be used every 2 weeks from Day  36 to Day  162, and from Day  202 to 
Day 342 (Parts A.1, B, C, D, F , and G  only) or every 2 weeks fr om Day 36 to Day 162 
(Parts  A.2, H, and J  only), to capture the occurrence of MAAEs, AESI, SAEs, and AEs leading 
to withdrawal. The eDiary will prompt the participant to complete an eDiary questionnaire that 
collects the following data:  
• Changes in health since last completing the questionnaire or since in contact with the 
study site . 
• Known exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
• Any experience of symptoms of COVID -19. 
• Any MAAEs, AESI, or SAEs . 
If an eDiary record results in identification of relevant safety events or of symptoms of 
COVID -19, a follow -up safety call will be triggered.  
Apart from the safety telephone calls described in Section  7.1.2 , each participant will complete a 
questionnaire in an eDiary as shown in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). 
The eDiary responses will be reviewed by study site personnel and may result in a follow -up 
safety call by the site to the participant.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 99 7.1.1.1.  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use   
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants 
to assess body temperature and injection site reactions, respect ively, for recording solicited ARs 
in the eDiaries. Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants 
who do not have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
7.1.2.  Safety Telephone Call   
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by a trained site personnel. 
This call will follow an approved script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety 
information. There wil l be a safety telephone call on Day 8 for each participant to discuss their 
health and review their eDiary. Subsequent s afety calls by the site to each participant will occur 
every 2 weeks from Day 43 to Day 169, and from Day 209 to Day 349 (Parts A.1, B, C, D, F, 
and G  only)  (Table  17) and every 2 weeks from Day 43 to Day 169  for Parts A.2  (Table  18), 
H (Table  19), and J ( Table  20). The participant will be interviewed according to the script about 
the occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, AESI, SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, concomitant 
medications associated with those events, and any non -study vaccinations ( Section 7.4.7 ). In 
addition, study personnel will collect information on known participant exposure to someone 
with COVID -19 or SA RS-CoV -2 infection and on the participant’s experience of COVID -19 
symptoms. All safety information collected from the telephone call must be documented in the 
source documents as described by the participant and not documented on the script used for the 
safety telephone contact. As noted in Section 7.1.1 , an unscheduled follow -up safety call may be 
triggered if an eDiary record results in identificati on of a relevant safety event.  
7.1.3.  Laboratory Assessments   
No routine safety laboratory assessments are planned for this study.  
A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at Day 1 before vaccination. At any time, 
a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the 
investigator. If not documented in a female participant’s medical records, an FSH test may be 
performed at the Scr eening Visit, as necessary and at the discretion of the investigator, to 
confirm postmenopausal status.  
7.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements   
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points 
indicated in th e SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). Vital signs are to be collected 
pre- and post -dosing on the day of injection (Day 1) only. When applicable, vital sign 
measurements should be performed before blood collection.  
Participants who are febrile (bo dy temperature ≥ 38.0°C  [100.4°F ]) before injection on Day  1 
must be rescheduled within the relevant window period to receive the injection. Afebrile 
participants with minor illnesses may be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 100 7.1.5.  Physical Examinations   
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at Day 1 as 
indicated in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). The full examination will 
include assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, 
cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system an d extremities. Any 
clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion 
of the investigator. On the day of vaccination, before injection, the arm receiving the injection 
should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated.  
7.1.6.  Assessment for SARS -CoV -2 Infection   
Participants will hav e NP samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing at time points specified in 
the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). 
A study illness visit or a consultation will be arranged within 24  hours or as soon as possible to 
collect an NP swab ( Table  12 and Table  13) to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via 
RT-PCR if a participant experiences any of the following (the presence of  any one of these  
symptoms lasting at least 48  hours [except for fever an d/or respiratory symptoms]):  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection as defined by the CDC ( CDC 2020 ), 
including:  
- Fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]) or chills (of any duration, including 
≤ 48 hours)  
- Cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
- Shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including 
≤ 48 hours)  
- Fatigue  
- Muscle or body aches  
- Headache  
- New loss of taste and/or smell  
- Sore throat, congestion, or runny nose  
- Nausea or vomiting  
- Diarrhea  
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection  
• Clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia  
Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case. All findings will be recorded in the eCRF.  
It is important  to note that some of the symptoms of COVID -19 overlap with solicited systemic 
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and 
chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common , 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 101 investigators should use their clinical judgment to decide whether an NP swab should be 
collected. The collection of an NP swab prior to the Day 1 and Day 29 vaccination can help 
ensure that cases of COVID -19 are not overlooked. Any study participant rep orting respiratory 
symptoms during the 7 -day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
If scheduled, a study site illness visit may include additional assessments such as medical 
history, physical examination, and blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing. The NP swab 
sample may be tested by multiplex RT -PCR for respiratory viruses besides SARS -CoV -2 to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. Blood 
samples will be collected at all illness visits for potential future immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for 
COVID -19 and on RT -PCR detection of SARS -CoV -2 from samples collected within 72 hours  
of the study participant reporting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID -19. Participants 
who are hospitalized for COVID -19 without the opportunity for a clinic visit will also be 
considered cases, assuming that the symptomology criteria for COVID -19 are met and a 
respiratory sample is positive for SARS -CoV -2 by PCR at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA) -certified or CLIA -certified waiver laboratory. Investigators are encouraged 
to try to obtain a respiratory sample during the course of hospitalization for submission to the 
study central laboratory, if feasible.  
Symptomatic COVID -19 is defined by the presence of one of the CDC -listed symptoms 
(CDC  2020 ) and a positive RT -PCR test on a respiratory sample. Asympto matic SARS -CoV -2 
infection is defined as a positive RT -PCR test on a respiratory sample in the absence of 
symptoms or a positive serologic test for antinucleocapsid antibody after a negative test result at 
the time of enrollment, with the serologic assay d etecting previously resolved SARS -CoV -2 
infections that may have occurred between visits, and the RT -PCR to detect active viral infection 
at the time of a visit. If participants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection and are 
symptomatic or asymptomatic , the investigator will notify the participants’ primary care 
physicians of the diagnosis and the local public health authorities as required per local 
regulations.  
If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, exposure to someone with a confirmed  
case of COVID -19), it will be captured in the COVID -19 exposure form, and the participant will 
continue to follow all remaining study assessments as scheduled. Likewise, participants with a 
confirmed case of COVID -19 will continue to follow all remaining study assessments as 
scheduled.  
Any confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 infection occurring in participants will be captured as 
an MAAE along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, 
and outcome.  
7.2. Immunogenicity Assessments   
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20). 
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vial 
volumes are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 102 sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF. Handling and preparation of the samples for 
analysis, as well as shipping and storage requirements, will be provided in a separate study 
manual.  
Measurement of bAb and nAb levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by the 
Sponsor.  
According to the ICF ( Section 10.2.6 ), excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used 
for future research, which may be performed at th e discretion of the Sponsor to further 
characterize the immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the 
immune response across CoV.  
Nasopharyngeal swab samples to be collected are also shown  (Table  12 and Table  13).

7.3. Efficacy Assessments   
Vaccine efficacy will not be formally assessed in this study, but active surveillance for 
COVID -19 and SARS -CoV -2 infection through weekly contact and blood draws (see Table  17, 
Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20), will be performed.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 103 7.4. Safety Definitions and Related Procedures   
7.4.1.  Adverse Event   
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definit ion 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition . 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after vaccination even though they may have 
been present before the start  of the study . 
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospitalization for preplanned surgical 
procedure).  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  7.4.3 ). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship be tween the vaccine and 
the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after vaccination). Any unsolicited AE which began during 
mRNA -1273 -P301 (COVE) but is ongoing at the time of enrollment in this study, should be 
documented as medical history.  
7.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events   
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the i nvestigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, 
whether or not it is considered related to the IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor , its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 104 hospital or emergency ward for at least one overnight stay for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. The hospital or emergency ward admission should be considered an SAE 
regardless of whether opinions differ as to the necessity of the admission. 
Complications that occur during inpatient hospitalization will be recorded as an AE; 
however, if a complication/AE prolongs hos pitalization or otherwise fulfills SAE 
criteria, the complication/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event   
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious. Ex amples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
7.4.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions   
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will s olicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  7.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an 
eDiary durin g the 7 days after vaccination (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days).  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table  14 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). 
If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond 7 days after dosing, the participant will be 
prompted daily to capture solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until resolution. ARs 
recorded in eDiaries beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by the st udy staff either via phone call or 
at the next study visit. All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered causally related 
to dosing.

Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the participant’s 
source document and must also be recorded by the study site staff on the solicited AR page of the 
participant’s eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to a healthcare provider  (HCP), to 
be recorded as an MAAE ( Section  7.4.4 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study 
or the participant being withdrawn from the study by the investigator (AE leading to 
withdrawal) . 
• Solicit ed local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days post -injection . 
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE . 
7.4.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events   
An M AAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to a n HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory follow -up, COVID -19 
[Section  7.1.6 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary care 
physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on the AE page of  the eCRF . 
All confirmed COVID -19 cases will be recorded as MAAEs.  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As 
an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours per Section  7.4.11. The investigator will submit any updated 
anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 107 purposes, a participant who displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as follows) 
should be reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance for 
investigat ors and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition ( Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a sev ere life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by the following:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal: urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, and red and itchy eyes.  
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated 
shock, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, and evidence of 
reduced peripheral circulation.  
− Respiratory:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, 
upper airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress, 
persistent dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, and 
rhinorrhea.  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  
7.4.5.  Adverse Event of Spe cial Interest   
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program for which ongoing monitoring and immediate n otification by the 
investigator to the Sponsor is required  and documentation is in the form of a case narrative . Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Section 10.4 
(Appendix 4) provides a list of AESI pertinent to this study. All AESI will be collected through 
the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported AESI and the eCRF has been taken  offline, then the site 
can report this information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, or the SAE Fax line 
(Section 7.4.11 ). 
Myocarditis and/ or Pericarditis   
Very rare events of myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported after vaccination with the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine. All suspected cases of probable and confirmed  myocarditis, pericarditis , or 
myopericarditis should be reported  as an AESI even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case 
definition. The event should also  be reported as an SAE, if it meets seriousness criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be report ed to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours as per Section 7.4.2 . The investigator will submit any updated 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 108 myocarditis, pericarditis , or myopericarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being 
available. For reporting purposes, any events suspicious for myocarditis, pericarditis, or 
myopericarditis should be reported as an AESI. The CDC case defini tion is displayed below as 
guidance  (Gargano et al, 2021 ). These definitions are intended to serve as a guide to help 
reporting of suspected cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis, but the diagnosis of 
suspect ed cases are left to the investigator ’s clinical judg ment . 
Acute Myocarditis Case Definition   
Presence of ≥ 1 new or worsening of the following clinical symptoms  (persons who lack  the 
listed symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as subclinical myocarditis 
[probabl e or confirmed]) : 
• Chest pain/pressure/discomfort  
• Dyspnea/shortness of breath/pain with breathing  
• Palpitations  
• Syncope  
AND  
For probable case:  
≥ 1 new findi ng of:  
• Troponin level above upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
• Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG ) or rhythm monitoring findings 
consistent with myocarditis  
− To meet the ECG or rhythm monitoring criterion,  a probable case  must include at 
least one of:  
o ST segment or T -wave abnormalities  
o Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular arrhythmias  
o AV nodal conduction delays or intraventricular conduction defects  
• Abnormal cardiac function or wall motion abnorm alities on echocardiogram  
• cMRI finding consistent with myocarditis ( Ferreira et al, 2018 ) 
AND  
• No other ident ifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
For confirmed case : 
• Histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis (using Dallas criteria [Aretz et al, 1987 ]) 
OR 
• cMRI findings consistent with myocarditis in the pre sence of t roponin level above 
upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
AND  
• No ot her identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 109 Acute Pericarditis Case Definition   
Presence of ≥ 2 new or worsening of the following clinical features  (Adler  et al, 2015 ): 
• Acute chest pain  (Typically described as pain made worse by lying down, deep 
inspiration, or cough; and relieved by sitting up or leaning forward, although other 
types of chest pain may occur)  
• Pericardial rub on exam  
• New ST -elevation or PR -depression on EKG  
• New or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or MRI  
Case Definition of Myopericarditis   
Participants who meet criteria for both myocarditis and pericarditis may be described under 
myopericarditis.  
An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and 
adult cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determin e if 
they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events, and to assess severity 
(Gargano  et al 2021 ). Any cases that the CEAC assesses as representing probably or confirmed 
cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be  referred to the Sponsor, who will then make a final 
decision on whether to suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on assessment of 
the overall potential risk to study participants . 
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter  that will be written and reviewed 
at the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter . 
7.4.6.  Recording and Follow -up of Pregnancy   
Female participants who have a positive pregnancy test at screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test at any time during the study should receive no 
further dosing with IP but should be asked to remain in the study and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
conge nital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered as SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the site learning of its occurrence, using the SAE Mailbox, or the SAE Fax 
line (Section  7.4.11 ). If the participant agrees to submit this information, the pregnancy must be 
followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of 
the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if intended duration of the 
safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be distributed to the study 
site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately (within 24  hours of 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 110 awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome accordi ng to 
the procedures described for SAEs.  
7.4.7.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after vaccination. Other (unsolicited) 
AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after vaccination.  
The MAAEs, AESI, AE leading to withdrawal, AESI, and SAEs will be collected from 
participants as specified in the SoE ( Table  17, Table  18, Table  19, and Table  20) until the end of 
their participation in the study. Any AEs occurring before receipt of IP will be analyzed 
separately from AEs occurring after receipt of the study vaccine.  
At every study site visit or telephon e contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including COVID -19 symptoms) 
according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been hospitalized, 
had any a ccidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any non -study vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings, or other documents 
relevant to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the 
eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be t reated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is 
LTFU (as defined in Section  6.3). 
7.4.8.  Assessment of Intensity   
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  7.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ) will be used to categorize local and 
systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign 
measurements observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity 
events are presented in Section  7.4.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the investigator based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s d aily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 111 Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s 
source documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset 
and duration of each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
7.4.9.  Assessment of Causality   
The investigator’s assessment of  an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the documentation process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event)  for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the 
following classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant did not 
receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relati ve to administration of the IP is not 
reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the IP.  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the IP 
is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than by another cause.  
7.4.10.  Reporting Adverse Events   
The investigator is res ponsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All uns olicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes type of event, time of onset, investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and rela tionship to IP, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and 
outcome. The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be 
reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by the investigator 
to be not clinically significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will 
be used to code all unsolicited AEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time of screening but does not deteriorate should not 
be reported as an unsoli cited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study, it 
should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
7.4.11.  Reporting SAEs   
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 112 Any AE considered serious by the investigator or that meets  SAE criteria ( Section  7.4.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the 
EDC system. The inve stigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in 21 US CFR Parts 312 and 320. The investigator is responsi ble for 
notifying the IRB directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE Mailbox: Drugsafety@modernatx.com   
• SAE Fax Line (USA and Canada): +1-617-649-3910  
Regulatory repor ting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  7.4.15 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to IP or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the  study.  
7.4.12.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, AESI, and SAE Information   
Medical occurrences that begin before IP dosing but after obtaining informed consent will be 
recorded in the Medical Histor y/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF and not in the 
AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the study, it will be recorded 
and reported as an AE.  
AEs may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner.  
Solicited AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after vaccination. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day  of injection through 28  days after vaccination.  
Serious AEs (including AESI) will be collected from the start of IP dosing until the last day of 
study participation.  
All SAEs and AESI will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately an d 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC 
system. If a site receives a report of a new SAE or AESI from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported SAE or AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then 
the site can report this information on a paper SAE or AESI form using the SAE Mailbox or the 
SAE Fax line ( Section  7.4.11 ). 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by the investigator to be clinically significant (eg, leads to study drug 
discontinuation, or meets any serious criteria). If this is the case,  it must be recorded in the 
source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that produced the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 113 value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is stabilized and 
the participant’s safety is not at  risk. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EoS participation. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has 
withdrawn from or completed the study, and the investigator considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
7.4.13.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs   
Electronic diar ies have specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomita nt 
medications/vaccinations.  
The investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of study arm or 
suspected causal relationship to IP. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
7.4.14.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigato r is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, stabilization, 
the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU, as  defined in Section  6.3. 
7.4.15.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory autho rity 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigator s. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious ARs 
according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report descr ibing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.

No safety monitoring committee or data safety monitoring board is planned for this study.  
Safety monitoring for this study will include study team members, inclusive of, at a minimum, 
the Sponsor medical monitor, Sponsor safety physician (from Pharmacovigilance), and CRO 
medical monitor. The study team will conduct ongoing safety reviews during the study and will 
be responsible to monitor for safety concerns during the study as described in the Saf ety 
Management Plan.  
An Independent CEAC  that includes pediatric and adult cardiologists will review suspected cases 
of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or 
“confirmed” events, and to assess severity . 
7.6. Treatment of Overdose   
As the study treatment is to be administered by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely that an 
overdose will occur. Dose deviations will be tracked as pr otocol deviations ( Section  10.2.8 ). 
7.7. Pharmacokinetics   
Pharmacokinetic par ameters are not evaluated in this study . 
7.8. Pharmacodynamics   
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.  
7.9. Biomarkers   
Immunogenicity assessments are described in Section  7.2. Biomarkers ar e not evaluated in this 
study.

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. 
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the 
clinical database lock for the study . If changes are made to primary and/or secondary objectives 
or the related statistical methods after the study has begun, then the protocol will be amended 
(consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory analyses made 
after t he protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they 
occurred, will be listed in the SAP or CSR  for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, 
will be clearly identified in the CSR.  
8.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses   
This is an open -label study . For Part J, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive  
one of 2 treatments. Randomization will not be blinded.  
8.2. Statistical Hypotheses   
Part s A.1, A.2, B, C, and D : 
There is no hypothesis testing for Part s A.1, A.2, B, C, and D.  
Part F (Cohort 1):  
50 µg mRNA -1273.529 booster dose (as a first booster dose) will be assessed with respect to

mRNA -1273 (external comparator)  in the PP Set for Immunogenicity -SARS -CoV -2 negative, 
there is approximately 89% global power for the primary immunogenicity objectives with alpha 
level of 0.05 (2 -sided) . The assumptions are: the true GMR (mRNA -1273.529 booster vs. 50  µg 
mRNA -1273 booster ) against the variant (B.1.1.529) is 1.5, the standard deviation of the 
log-transformed titer is 1.5, and the non -inferiority margin for GMR is 1.5 ; the true SRR against 
B.1.1.529 after a single booster dose of 50 µg mRNA -1273 .529 is 90% (same assumption for

Immune response of each booster arm against  ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and SARS -CoV -2 
variants, the GMT, geometric mean fold rise and seroresponse rate will be calculated at the time 
points where the immune response is assessed.

There is no hypothesis testing for Part A.2 . 
For Part A.2 participants,  Day 29 and Day 181 immune response after mRNA -1273.214 (50  µg) 
as a second booster dose will be compared with their own Day 29 and Day 181 immune response 
of mRNA -1273.211 (50 µg) received as the first booster dose. GMT ratios will be calculated by 
back t ransforming the mean of paired differences of antibody titer data on the logarithmic scale 
between Day 29 and Day 181 post mRNA -1273.214 and Day 29 and Day 181 of antibody titer 
data post mRNA -1273.211. CIs for the GMT ratio will be based on t -distribution  of the 
log-transformed values then back -transformed to the original scale for presentation. 
Seroresponse rates at Day 29 and Day 181 post mRNA -1273.214 will be compared with their 
seroresponse rates at Day 29 and Day 181 post mRNA -1273.211. The difference  in serore sponse

Confidential  Page 123 An ANCOVA model will be performed to assess the difference in  immune response between 
mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273 (using external comparator) as  the first booster dose. For 
immune response against the B.1.1.529 strain, in the ANCOVA model, antibody titers at Day  29 
postboost er against the B.1.1.529 strain will be a dependent  variable, and a group variable 
(mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273) will be the fixed effect,  adjusting for age groups (< 65, 
≥ 65 years) and preboost er antibody titer level, if applicable.  
The GMT will be estimated by the GLSM  from the model and its corresponding 95% will be 
provided for each group. The GMR (ratio of GMTs) for mRNA -1273.529 with respect to 
mRNA -1273 will be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model and the corresponding 95% 
CIs will be provided. The 95% CI for GMR will be used to assess the between group difference 
in immune response against the B.1.1.529 strain f or mRNA -1273.529 at Day 29 compared to the 
mRNA -1273.  
The number and percentage (rate) of participants achieving seroresponse at Day 29 will be 
summarized with 95% CI calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method for each group. The 
difference of SRR between  mRNA -1273.529 and mRNA -1273 will be calculated with 95% CI  
based on Miettinen -Nurminen method . The non -inferiority in SRR of mRNA -1273.529 
compared to mRNA -1273 will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% of the 
SRR difference is > -10% based on the non -inferiority margin of 10% . 
The primary immunogenicity objective (against the B.1.1.529) is considered met if non -
inferiority is demonstrated based on GMR  and SRR difference , specifically:  
• The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio between mRNA1273 .529 against 
the variant (B.1.1.529) at Day 29 as compared to 50 µg mRNA1273  against B.1.1.529

• If non -inferiority is demonstrated  (based on GMT ratio and SRR  difference ), the 
lower bound of 95% CI of the GMT ratio wi ll be compared to 1, if it’s greater than 1, 
then superiority is demonstrated.

be compared to 1, if it’s greate r than 1, then superiority against B.1.1.529  is 
demonstrated . 
Day 91 : alpha=0.025 (2 -sided)  
Hypotheses testing at Day 91  will be performed in the same manner, first test 2 non-inferiority 
hypotheses ( 2 against the B.1.1.529 strain and one against ancestral  SARS -CoV -2) at alpha of 
0.025 level (two -sided) . Once non-inferiority is demonstrated for both B.1.1529 and ancestral

will be performed.  
For the key secondary o bjective, there are 2 hypotheses to be tested (Day 29 and Day 91 each 
with alpha level of 0.025, 2 -sided):  
A. H19: 50 µg mRNA -1273.214, as a second booster dose, against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 is 
non-inferior to the booster dose of (50 µg) mRNA -1273 against anc estral SARS -CoV -2

ancestral SARS -CoV -2–- 50 µg mRNA -1273 against ancestral SARS -CoV -2) is > -10% at  
Day 29 or Day 91, then the key secondary objective will be considered met.  
In the event that an early assessment of the 1273.214 data is needed due to public health 
concerns , a two -staged approach will be used. Specifically, a subset of participants’ (ie , 50 first 
enrolled participants) serum samples will first be tested against ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and 
various VOCs . For the Day 29 and Day 91  immunogenicity analys es, all participant s’ immune

The MMRM will be used to analyze all postboost er measures for between bo oster comparison  
when applicable , the model will include treatment group, analysis visit, treatment by visit 
interaction, and adjusting for age groups and preboost er titer levels. An unstructured covariance 
structure will be used to model the within -partic ipant errors. The GMT will be estimated from 
the model and its corresponding 95% CI will be provided for each group at each postboost  
timepoint. The GMR (ratio of GMTs) will be estimated from the model and the corresponding

investigators may convert study site visits to telemedicine visits with th e approval of the Sponsor.  
1. The Screening Visit and Day 1 (vaccination) visit can be combined and occur on the same day.  
2. Safety follow -up via eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 2 weeks from at Day 36 to Day 162, and from Day 202 to Day 342. These study days are 
relative to Day  1 vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond Day 7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either during  the next 
scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
3. Physical examination: A full phy sical examination, including height and weight, will be performed on Day 1. Symptom -directed physical examinations may 
be performed at other time points at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during  a study vis it should be reported as 
an MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected pre - and post -dosing on the day of injection (Day 1) only. When applicable, vital sign measurements should be 
performed before blood collection. For participants who are febrile (body temper ature ≥  38.0°C [100.4°F]) before injection on Day  1, the visit must be

at the discretion of the i nvestigator.  
4. The NP swab sample, collected prior to vaccination on Day 1, will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR. The NP swab sample will 
also be collected within 24 hours if participant experience signs and symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection. It is important to note that some of the symptoms 
of COVID -19 overlap with solicited local and systemic  reactogenicity  ARs, that are e xpected after vaccination with mRNA -1273.211 (eg, myalgia, 
headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7  days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, investigators should use their clinical judgment 
to decide if an NP swab should be coll ected. The collection of an NP swab prior to the Day 1 vaccination can help ensure that cases of COVID -19 are not 
overlooked. Any study participant reporting respiratory symptoms during the 7 -day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
5. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected  during the unscheduled/illness visit  for testing for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR and for assessing non -
SARS -CoV -2 causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infection.  
6. Trained site personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, information on 
concomitant medications associated with those events,  AESI,  and any non -study vaccinations. In addition, st udy personnel will collect information on 
known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms. Sites will 
collect this information for eDiary days only if eDiary responses ind icate the need for follow -up via telephone.  
7. All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through the end of study visit (Day  366).  
8. All concomitant medications and non-study  vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days following injection.

judgment to decide if an NP swab should be collected. The collection of a NP swab prior to the Day 1 vaccination can help ensure that cases of COVID -19 
are not overlooked. Any study participant reporting respiratory symptoms during the 7 -day period after injection should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
5. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected during the unscheduled/illness visit for testing for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR and for assessing non -
SARS -CoV -2 causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infection . 
6. Trained site personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, information on 
concomitant medications associated with those events,  AESI,  and any non -study vaccinations. In addition, study personnel will collect information on 
known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV-2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms. Sites will 
collect this information for eDiary days only if eDiary responses indicate the need for follow  up via telephone.  
7. All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an  SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through the end of study visit (Day  181). 
8. All concomitant medications and non -study vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days following injection.

Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at the discretion of the 
investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE. 
Vital signs are to be collected pre - and post -dosing on the day of injection (Day 1) only. When applicable, vital 
sign measurements should be performed before blood collection. For participants who are febrile (body 
temperature ≥  38.0°C [100.4°F]) before injection on Day  1, the visit must be rescheduled within the relevant 
window period to receive the injection.  Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be administered 
investigational product at the discretion of the investigator.  
4. The NP swab sample, collected prior to injection on Day 1, will be used to ascertain the presence of 
SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR. The NP swab sample will also be collected within 24 hours if a participant 
experiences signs and symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection. It is important to note that some of the symptoms 
of COVID -19 overlap with solicited local and systemic reactogenicity  ARs, which are expected after 
vaccination with mRNA -1273.222 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, chills). During the first 7 days after 
vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, investigators should use their clinical judgment to decide if 
an NP swab should be col lected. The collection of a NP swab prior to the Day 1 vaccination can help ensure

• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration  of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant docume nts (eg, 
advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by the investigator and reviewed and 
approved by the IRB before the study is initiated.  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design,  except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB annually or 
more frequently in accordance with t he requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by the IRB . 
− Notifying the IRB of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB 
procedures . 
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB, European regulation 536/2014 
for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations . 
10.2.2.  Study Monitoring   
Before an investigat ional site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of the 
Sponsor or its representatives will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor, the 
designated CRO, and the investigator.  
According to ICH GCP gu ideline, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the 
eCRFs. The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Sponsor in the mainte nance 
of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will 
advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB  
review, and inspection by providing direct access to the  source data and/or documents. In 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 148 addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the investigator all regulations 
applicable to the clinical evaluation of an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to ins pect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; 
to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct to any loc al regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During 
the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the i nvestigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perform source da ta verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant ( eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Mailbox , and those SAEs  that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
10.2.3.  Audits and Inspections   
The Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct site 
visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any aspect of the 
study. The investigator agrees t o allow the Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory 
authorities to inspect the IP storage area, IP stocks, IP records, participant charts and study 
source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and the IRB may visit the site 
to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a Sponsor 
audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities a nd 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP (R2), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact the Sponsor im mediately if contacted 
by a regulatory agency about an inspection.  
The principal investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation. Initial IRB approval 
and all materials approved by the IRB for this study including the participant consent form and 
recruitment materials must be maintained by the investigator and made available for inspection.

A participant who is rescreened is not required to sign another ICF if the rescreening occurs 
within 28  days from  the previous ICF signature date (within the initial screening period).  
The ICF will also explain that excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize  the 
immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the immune response 
across CoV.  
10.2.7.  Protocol Amendments   
No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by t he investigator or the Sponsor after 
the protocol has been agreed to and signed by all parties unless such change(s) or amendment(s) 
has (have) been agreed upon by the investigator or the Sponsor. Any change agreed upon will be 
recorded in writing, and the  written amendment will be signed by the investigator and the 
Sponsor. Institutional review board approval is required prior to the implementation of an 
amendment, unless overriding safety reasons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s) 
will be promptly notified.  
Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, 
potential benefit of the study, or may affect participant safety, including changes of study 
objectives, study design, participant population, sampl e sizes, study procedures, or significant 
administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be 
released by the Sponsor, agreed by the investigator(s), and approved by the relevant IRB(s) prior 
to implementation. A signed and dated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant 
amended documents and the ICF have been approved by relevant IRB(s) must be provided to the 
Sponsor before the study is initiated.  
Administrative changes to the protocol are minor correc tions and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be released by 
the Sponsor, agreed by the investigators, and notified to the IRB(s).  
10.2.8.  Protocol Deviations   
Noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and 
implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations to the Sponsor or its designee. All deviations must be addressed in study source 
documents and reported to the study monitor. Protocol deviatio ns must be sent to the reviewing 
IRB per their policies. The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the 
reviewing IRB requirements.

datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or 
any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant.  
The participant must be i nformed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by 
appropriate IRB members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Individual participant medical in formation obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential, and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Information will be accessible to 
authorized parties or personnel only. Medical information may be given to the participant’s 
physician or to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant’s well -being. 
Each participant will be asked to complete a form allowing the investigator to notify the 
participant’s primary health care provider of his/her participation in this st udy. 
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner designed to maintain participant confidentiality. All records will be kept in a secure 
storage area with limited access. Clinical information will no t be released without the written 
permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, its 
designee, the relevant regulatory authority, or the IRB.  
The investigator and all employees and coworkers involved with this study may not disclose or 
use for any purpose other than performance of the study, any data, record, or other unpublished, 
confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of the study. Prior written 
agreement from the Sponsor o r its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any 
confidential information to other parties.  
10.2.10.  Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research   
The retention period of labor atory samples will be 20 years, or as permitted by local regulations, 
to address further scientific questions related to mRNA -1273.211 or anti -respiratory virus 
immune response. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of 
the participant. During the study, or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis 
outlined in the study endpoints, exploratory analysis may be conducted using other measures of 
adaptive immunity to SARS -CoV -2 to include humoral and cellular  immune assay 
methodologies on any remaining blood or serum samples, including samples from participants 
who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled. These analyses will extend the search for 
other potentially relevant biomarkers to investigate the effect of mRNA -1273.211 as well as to 
determine how changes in biomarkers may relate to exposure and clinical outcomes. A decision 
to perform such exploratory research may arise from new scientific findings related to the drug 
class or disease, as well as reagent and assay availability.  
10.2.11.  Safety Oversight   
Safety monitoring for the study is described in Section 7.5.

Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision of 
the si te investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded in the eCRF unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee  electronically (eg, laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
physically or electronically signing the eCRF.  
- The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that 
supports the information entered in the eCRF.  
- The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, 
and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data 
documents.  
- Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk -based initiatives in operations 
and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and 
Analytical Risk -Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and 
requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring 
techniques (central, remote, or onsite monitoring) are provided in the clinical 
monitoring plan.  
- The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study 
including quality checking of the data.  
- The Sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to oth er individuals 
(eg, CROs).  
- Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that 
data entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, 
complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of 
participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in 
accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
- Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertai ning to the conduct of 
this study must be retained by the investigator for a period of at least 2 years 
after the last marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years 
following the discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If this

without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure 
that the clinical study is performed and the data are generated,  documented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A quality assurance representative from Sponsor or qualified designee , who is independent of 
and separated from routine monitoring, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the 
clinical study by reviewing the data obtained and procedural aspects. These inspections may 
include onsite inspections/audits and source data c hecks. Direct access to source documents is 
required for the purpose of these periodic inspections/audits.  
10.2.14.  Data Collection and Management   
This study will be conducted in complian ce with ICH CGP guidelines. This study will also be 
conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
This study will use electronic data collection to collect data directly from the study site using 
eCRFs. The investigat or is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed 
promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data.  
Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between 
the eC RFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the 
principles of GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the clinical monitoring 
plan.  
AEs will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using  WHO  – Drug 
Reference List.  
10.2.15.  Source Documents   
Source documents are original documents or certified copies, and include, but are not limited to, 
eDiaries, medical and hospital reco rds, screening logs, ICFs, telephone contact logs, and 
worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s 
site. 
Data repo rted on the case report form or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer re cords, depending on 
the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
The Sponsor or its designee requires that the investigator prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the IP. Source documents such as  any hospital, 
clinic, or office charts and the signed ICFs are to be included in the investigator’s files with the 
participant’s study records.  
10.2.16.  Retention of Records   
The principa l investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of at 
least 2 years after the last marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 154 the discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If this req uirement differs from any local 
regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local retention policy is less 
than 2 years.  
If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the regulatory authority to review any documentation 
relating to the study, the investigator must permit access to such records. No records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be  retained.  
10.2.17.  Study and Site Closure

Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential  
Women of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cann ot be confirmed before 
vaccination at Day 1, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing potential:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal,  surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:  
a. Documented complete hysterectomy  
b. Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 m onths without an alternative 
medical cause. The following age -specific requirements apply:  
− Women < 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal 
treatments a nd if they have luteinizing hormone and FSH levels in the 
postmenopausal range for the institution.  
− Women ≥ 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more, had radiation -induced menopause with last 
menses >  1 year ago, had chemotherapy -induced menopause with last menses 
> 1 year ago.  
• A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal s tatus before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contraceptive method in accordance with the product label. For example:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction 
with spermicide  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P205 Protocol Amendment  11 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 157 • Intrauterine device  
• Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pill), transdermal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route  
• Sterilization of a female participant’s monogamous ma le partner prior to entry into 
the study  
Note that periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

(Primary Objectives and 
Endpoints)  The primary and secondary objectives 
and endpoints were updated. K ey 
secondary objectives and endpoints 
were added before the secondary 
endpoint.  Primary and secondary 
objectives and endpoints were 
updated to reflect 
considerations discussed with 
regulatory guidance.  
The updated primary 
endpoints will enable a 
comparison between the 
immune responses elicited 
from mRNA -1273.211 and 
mRNA -1273 (historical 
cohort) using the prototype 
strain as basis for 
comparison.  
The key secondary objective 
and endpoint will enable a 
comparison of immune 
response to booster dose of 
mRNA -1273 .211 against the 
B1.1.351 variant  with the 
immune response to priming 
doses of the prototype 
vaccine (historical control) 
against prototype strain.  
Synopsis and Section 2 
(Objectives and Endpoints)  Secondary objectives and endpoints 
were modified to inclu de comparisons 
of the immune response to a booster 
dose of mRNA -1273.211 with the 
response to priming doses of 
mRNA -1273 (historical control) against 
other variants of interest and concern 
(including B.1.1617.2). These 
objectives and endpoints were moved 
from exploratory and modified.  
 
Exploratory Endpoint language was 
also updated for clarity.  Secondary endpoints were 
updated to perform a 
comparison of the immune 
response to the booster dose 
of mRNA -1273.211 against 
other viral variants of interest 
or concern, compared to the 
immune response to priming 
doses of the prototype 
vaccine (historical control) 
against the prototype strains.

 4 1. Protocol Title:   
Pilot Study Evaluating the Efficacy of a Topical PDE4 Inhibitor for Morphea 
 
2. Purpose of the Study:   
To determine the clinical efficacy of crisaborole 2% ointment in the treatment of 
morphea. Specifically, to: 
a. Compare the difference in dermal thickness and fibrosis as measured by histology 
at baseline and after 12 weeks of crisaborole 2% ointment, applied 2 times a day . 
b. Compare changes in physician and patient reported outcomes at baseline, 4, 8 
and 12 weeks of treatment. 
  
3. Background & Significance:   
Morphea is an autoimmune fibrosing skin disorder of still unknown etiology. It can be associated with significant morbidity, and effective topical and systemic therapies are still lacking. cAMP is known have an anti -fibrotic effect in skin models as well as other 
organs. It is therefore not surprising that p hosphodiesterase-4(PDE4), which degrades 
cAMP, has been implicated in the pathogenesis in both animal and human studies. 
Preclinical studies have suggested that PDE4 inhibition may attenuate the oxidative 
processes that mediate fibrosis
1.  Systemic PDE4 inhibitors demonstrated anti -fibrotic 
effects in multiple murine skin fibrosis models, including the bleomycin-induced 
skin fibrosis  models, the topoisomerase I mouse model and in murine sclerodermatous 
chronic graft -versus -host disease2. This anti -fibrotic effect was mediated though the 
blockage of cytokines and other immune mediated mechanisms. Dermal fibroblasts and 
myofibroblasts in an inflammatory disease such as psoriasis have increased expression 
of PDE43. Furthermore, PDE4 inhibition reduced TGFβ medi ated fibroblast migration 
and myofibroblast transformation3. 
 
PDE4  facilitates proinflammatory signals by degrading cAMP in inflammatory cells, 
smooth muscle cells, and keratinocytes. In mouse models, the anti -fibrotic effect of 
PDE4 inhibition was mediated though the blockage of cytokines and other immune 
mediated mechanisms2. Keratinocytes play an active part in the modulation of 
inflammation in a variety of cutaneous inflammatory and immune disorders. Our group 
has a particular interest in the role of the keratinocyte mediated inflammation and 
biology4. Cross talk exists between cAMP and the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal -regulated kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway5. 
MEK/ERK has been implicated in the development of fibrosis, and inhibition of this 
pathway interferes with the profibrotic response to TGFβ6.  
 
 
4. Design & Procedures:   
A Phase 2, pilot, proof-of -concept, open label, single arm prospective study to assess 
the safety, tolerability and efficac y of using crisaborole 2% ointment for adult morphea. 
We will recruit 20 adult (>=18 years of age) patients with morphea.  
 
Patients will be recruited from the Duke University Dermatology Autoimmune Disease 
Clinic. In addition, patients will also be recrui ted from the entire Duke System, and from  
community and academic dermatology practices .  
 
Pro00086947

Version 8/3/2018  
 5 Patients will be identified by their physician, nurse, or other member of their clinical care 
team. Upon notification by the primary team, the study team will approac h patients to 
discuss the study, treatment protocol, associated procedures and obtain informed consent. Patients who are referred from outside of Duke will have to obtain a Duke 
Medical Record Number (MRN).  
 
Treatment:  
 
Patients will be asked to apply crisaborole 2% ointment, twice daily, on affected plaques 
for 12 weeks.  
 
Medication will be provided free of charge by Pfizer, as part of the grant that is funding 
this study. These will be dispensed by the study group at baseline and during the 
subsequent clinic visits.   Skin punch biopsy of sentinel plaque:  
 A sentinel plaque will be selected at baseline. A 4 mm skin punch biopsy will be 
performed at baseline and at 12 weeks, on the same affected plaque.  
 
If a biopsy has been previously taken of the affected plaque and is available for review, 
this will be used as the baseline biopsy. Patients who drop out of the study because of 
progression of their disease or adverse effects will undergo a skin punch biopsy at the 
time of drop out.  
 
Histologic and genomic assessment of skin biopsy specimen:  
 
Each biopsy specimen will be bisected. Half will be formalin fixed and sent for histologic 
evaluation. Histologic assessment will be performed by an experienced academic  
dermatopathologist, who will be blinded to the study design. This will be performed within the Duke Dermatology Skin Disease Research Center (SDRC).   
 Dermal thickness will be measured and compared before and at the end of treatment. 
 
The other half will undergo processing for Nanostring gene expression analysis. 
Specimens will be sent to the Nanostring Core Facility at the University of North Carolina 
(UNC)  , de-identified except for study subject number . Gene expression analysis is 
included for future research purposes only. A Material Transfer Agreement will be completed and executed between Duke and UNC. MTA will be fully executed and 
uploaded into eIRB prior to any samples being sent outside of Duke. 
 
The Lineberger Cancer Center Translational Genomics Laboratory (TGL) at UNC 
provides an assortment of analysis services employing the Nanostring
TM nCounter 
platform. These include gene expression, miRNA expression and miRNA gene 
expression copy number variation analysis, single gene expression, incRNA expression, 
Chip-String and RNA -Protein profiling. NanostringTM supplies custom and off-the-shelf 
assays for various groups of target genes including immunology, inflammation, and pan 
cancer panels offering pathway, immune and progression profiling. TGL maintai ns 2 
nCounter Prep Stations which can process 12 post-hybridization samples every 3 hours. A generation 2 nCounter digital analyzer can sequentially scan up to 6 cartridges of 12 
samples each with a maximum resolution scan requiring approximately 5 hours per 
Pro00086947 
Version 8/3/2018   
 
Version 8/3/2018  
 6 cartridge. Data is provided to the client electronically for analysis using the NSolver v. 
3.0 software provided by NanostringTM. LCCC Bioinformatics can also provide Nano 
NanostringTM string analysis services. TGL employs 4 trained specialists experienced in 
assorted types of NanostringTM assays.  
 
All sample information and metrics are recorded and maintained in the gPATH Lab 
Information Management System (LIMS) designed and maintained by LCCC 
Bioinformatics.  
 
To distinguish gene expression profiles in a sample enriched for keratinocytes, the 
epidermis and dermis will be separated using a previously described protocol that allows 
for high quality RNA extraction7. Total RNA will be isolated from epidermal and dermal 
portions of each biopsy specimen. RNA w ill be hybridized to a custom made kit based 
on the nCounter Human Kinase Gene Expression Code Kit (which includes 519 color -
barcoded human kinase genes) with additional genes that screen for innate and 
adaptive immune response. After washing and cleaning, the sample cartridges will be 
read in the nCounter SPRINT analyzer which allows automated data collection for up to 24 samples in one day.  
 Skin sections from the unaffected individuals will be used as control. These are obtained 
from an IRB exempt protocol that allows us to utilize normal skin from unidentified, 
healthy donors (Pro00012656, Access to anonymous and de-identified samples).  
 Genes that show m ore than 3-fold differences between lesional and non-lesional or 
normal skin, and between baseline and at 12 weeks, will be analyzed using gene 
function-based analysis tools such as GeneSpring, and grouped into the categories of 
cell signaling, structure, cell cycle, survival, and inflammation, as described in our 
previous studies

Retention of data and samples for future research:  
 
With subject agreement, subject samples and data obtained during this research study 
will be retained for future research under previously established bio and data 
repositories. This retention of samples will require separate subject consent to 
Pro00006230 and Pro00006313. 
 
Clinical assessment

Version 8/3/2018  
 7  
Patients will  have a clinical assessment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 and 12. After 
week 12, patients who need further treatment will undergo standard of care treatment as determined by their primary dermatologist. An optional post treatment follow -up will be 
performed at week 20.   
Physician and patient reported assessment and skin imaging will be performed at 
baseline, week 4, 8 and 12, and at week 20. Photography will also be performed at 
baseline and week 12.  
 
Physician assessment will utilize two previously described and validated scoring metrics. 
The sentinel plaque will be evaluated using Dyspigmentation, Induration, Erythema, and 
Telangiectasias (DIET) score9. Overall disease severity will be evaluated using the 
Localized Scleroderma Cutaneous  Assessment  Tool (LoSCAT)10.    
 
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured using Skindex -2911 which has 
previously been applied to morphea12, and has a pruritus component.  
 
Photographs will be taken using a standardized clinic camera. 
 
B-Mode ultrasonographic imaging will be utilized to measure dermal thickness of the 
sentinel plaque at baseline, week 4, 8 and 12 and post-treatment at week 20.

7.  Consent Process – see Section 14 of the e -IRB submission form. 
 
8.  Subject’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent:  
Subjects must be able to provide consent. Legal representatives will not be used.  
 
9.  Study Interventions:  
Subjects will be asked to apply crisaborole 2% ointment, twice daily, on affected plaques 
for 12 weeks. 
 
10. Risk/Benefit Assessment  and Safety Considerations: 
If a subject agrees to take part in this study, there may not be a direct medical benefit to 
them. The subject’s morphea may improve from using the investigation al drug in this 
study. It is also possible that a subject’s condition will not improve on the investigational 
drug. 
 
The pharmacokinetics of crisaborole as a topical medication have previously been 
studied13. Crisaborole is metabolized to inactive metabolites upon absorption, making it 
both a safe option for therapy even in relatively extensive disease. There was minimal 
systemic effect of crisaborole ointment when applied twice daily for 28 days, over up to 
35% body surface area, in children 2-17 years or age. Long term studies in adults and 
children with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis for as long as 48 weeks have also shown a low frequency of side effects
14. The most frequently reported treatment-related 
AEs (overall, 10.2%) were worsening of pre-existing atopic d ermatitis (3.1%), 
application- site pain (2.3%), and application- site infection (1.2%). The FDA monograph 
of crisaborole does not state any requirement for monitoring.  
 
The risks for obtaining ski n biopsy samples include a mild amount of pain, bruising, 
bleeding, or infection at the site of the puncture. Subjects will be instructed in proper 
wound care to minimize these risks. Subjects may experience scarring at the site of 
biopsy.   
 
 
11. Costs to the Subject:  
There will be no additional costs to the subjects as a result of being in this study. However, 
routine medical care for their disease will be charged to them or their insurance company.  
 12. Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations:  
We will aim to recruit 20 patients in the study. We anticipate to see a 30% decrease in 
dermal thickness at 12 weeks compared to baseline, using histologic evaluation of skin 
punch biopsy specimens.  Using measurements of dermal thickness that we obtained 
from our archived morphea skin biopsies, we estimated that we need 11 patients to 
detect 30% change in dermal thickness with a power of 0.80 and an alpha of 0.05. The 
goal to recruit 20 patients allows for possible drop-outs, while still allowing us to per form 
statistically significant analysis.

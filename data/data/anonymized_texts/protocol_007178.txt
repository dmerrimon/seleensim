Investigation
of
Pupillometry
as
Guide
for
Extubation
Readiness
in
Anesthetized
Children
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
07/01/2024
Aims/Objectives
1/
Increase
the
safety
of
tracheal
extubation
in
pediatric
anesthesia.
2/
Define
an
objective,
quantitative
metric
to
guide
extubation
in
anesthetized
pediatric
patients.
3/
Demonstrate
a
method
to
decrease
anesthetic
vapor
requirements
for
extubation
and
thereby
decrease
the
time
interval
that
patients
are
subject
to
the
risks
of
anesthetic
vapor.
4/
Compare
pupillometry
method
to
a
traditional
extubation
method.
Study
Protocol
In
pediatric
patients
undergoing
general
anesthesia
for
surgery,
subjects
will
be
randomized
to
two
groups:
Group
1/
Deep
vapor
extubation
group,
and
Group
2/
Pupillometry
group.
For
subjects
randomized
to
Group
1,
the
protocol
is
as
follows:
At
the
conclusion
of
surgery
and
in
preparation
for
tracheal
extubation,
spontaneous
ventilation
will
be
reinitiated
and
a
deep
plane
of
anesthesia
will
be
established
with
anesthetic
vapor
set
at
1.5
MAC
(sevoflurane
~3.75%)
for
8
minutes.
This
follows
a
traditional
method
for
deep
extubation.
The
subject
will
then
be
extubated.
Immediately
following
extubation,
100%
O
2
will
be
given
via
an
anesthesia
mask
together
with
5
cm
H
2
O
CPAP
and
a
gentle
jaw
thrust,
which
is
the
standard
practice
of
the
authors.
Following
standard
practice,
anesthetics
and
equipment
necessary
to
manage
any
extubation
issue
will
be
prepared
and
immediately
available.
Ventilation
will
be
monitored
in
a
standard
manner,
using
chest
wall
movement,
capnography,
reservoir
bag
movement,
condensation
of
anesthetic
mask
and
auscultation.
Oxygenation
will
be
monitored
by
continuous
pulse
oximetry
and
skin
color.
For
subjects
randomized
to
Group
2,
the
protocol
is
as
follows:
1/
At
the
conclusion
of
surgery
and
in
preparation
for
tracheal
extubation,
spontaneous
ventilation
will
be
reinitiated
and
a
deep
plane
of
anesthesia
will
be
established
with
anesthetic
vapor
set
at
<
0.5
MAC
together
with
titrated
increments
of
propofol
and
fentanyl
as
appropriate
at
discretion
of
anesthesiologist.
2/
Pre-stimulus
pupillometry:
Measure
pupil
with
portable
infrared
pupillometer.
2
measurements
will
be
made
to
establish
a
stable
baseline.
3/
Perform
standardized
laryngeal
stimulus
(deflate
ETT
cuff,
withdraw
ETT
1
cm,
readvance
ETT
1cm,
reinflate
ETT
cuff).
4/
Post-stimulus
pupillometry.
Measure
pupil
size.
2
measurements
will
be
made,
the
first
within
30
seconds
of
laryngeal
stimulus,
the
second
within
30
seconds
of
the
1st
measurement.
PRD
=
Post-stimulus
pupil
size
-
pre-stimulus
pupil
size.
5/
Decision
analysis.
If
PRD
<
or
=
0.10
mm,
extubate.
If
PRD
>
0.10
mm,
deepen
patient
with
increments
of
propofol
and/or
fentanyl
at
anesthesiologist
discretion,
then
repeat
sequence
of
pre-stimulus
pupillometry,
standardized
laryngeal
stimulus,
post-stimulus
pupillometry,
decision
analysis.
6/
If
protocol
iterates
3
times,
the
anesthesiologist
will
extubate
when
clinically
appropriate
irrespective
of
PRD.
7/
Immediately
following
extubation,
100%
O
2
will
be
given
via
an
anesthesia
mask

with

and

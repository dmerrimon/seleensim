 Initiation	of	Continuous	Glucose	Monitoring	at	Diagnosis	of	Type	1	Diabetes	Version	1.3	(Version	that	Received	FDA	Approval)	December	22,	2015															
 
1  CHAPTER	1:	INTRODUCTION		1.1.		Purpose			The	primary	objective	of	this	pilot	project	is	to	examine	the	impact	of	continuous	glucose	monitoring	(CGM)	on	families	with	newly	diagnosed	children	with	type	1	diabetes	(T1D).	This	randomized	clinical	trial	compares	newly	diagnosed	T1D	youth	who	are	started	on	CGM	(the	intervention	group)	versus	those	who	are	not	(the	control	group).	We	will	examine	group	differences	over	a	6-month	period	(Phase	1)	on	two	sets	of	outcomes.	The	first	set	of	outcomes	includes	psychosocial	variables	such	as	parents’	diabetes-related	distress,	hypoglycemic	concerns,	broad	markers	of	parent	stress,	anxiety	and	sleep	quality,	and	health-related	quality	of	life.	In	this	set	of	psychosocial	outcomes,	health-related	quality	of	life	is	the	identified	primary	endpoint.	The	second	set	of	outcomes	includes	glycemic	variables	such	as	time	spent	in	range,	hemoglobin	A1c,	and	C-peptide.	In	this	set	of	glycemic	outcomes,	time	spent	in	target	range	is	the	identified	primary	endpoint.	After	the	initial	comparison	of	intervention	to	control	across	the	first	six	months	after	diagnosis,	we	will	conduct	a	longitudinal	follow-up	(Phase	2)	of	glycemic	and	psychosocial	variables	for	an	additional	18	months.		1.2.		Background	1.2.1.		Current	landscape	of	type	1	diabetes	management.		Type	1	diabetes	management	is	complex	and	demanding.		The	T1D	regimen	requires	frequent	blood	glucose	monitoring,	precise	timing	and	dosing	of	insulin	administration,	and	consideration	of	dietary	intake	and	physical	activity.	Each	individual	task	by	itself	is	demanding,	but	the	integration	of	them	all	adds	a	high	degree	of	complexity.	Achieving	optimal	diabetes	control	remains	elusive	for	many	families	with	children	with	T1D	1,2.				1.2.2.		Current	approaches	to	diabetes	treatment	in	newly	diagnosed	youth.		There	is	some	variability	with	treatment	approaches	in	the	United	States.	However,	most	diabetes	centers	base	their	standards	of	care	on	the	Clinical	Practice	Guidelines	published	annually	by	the	American	Diabetes	Association	in	Diabetes	Care.	That	is	the	case	for	both	clinical	sites	in	this	study.	A	general	framework	of	diabetes	care	initiated	at	diagnosis	of	type	1	diabetes	is	depicted	in	Figure	1	using	a	swim	lane	diagram.	While	this	is	specific	to	care	delivered	at	Stanford,	this	is	the	same	approach	to	care	delivered	at	the	Barbara	Davis	Center.

		The	diabetes	clinics	at	Stanford	and	Barbara	Davis	Center	both	initiate	treatment	with	multiple	daily	injections	of	rapid	acting	insulin	analogs	and	1-2	injections	per	day	of	long	acting	insulin	(glargine	or	detemir).	At	both	sites,	basal-bolus	regimens	are	the	first	line	of	insulin	treatment	and	frequent	monitoring	(over	the	phone	or	email)	and	face-to-face	visits	with	the	clinical	care	team	will	help	to	fine-tune	dosages.	Parents	and	youth	(typically	starting	at	age	10)	are	taught	procedures	for	injecting	insulin	as	well	as	time	periods	to	check	blood	sugar	to	understand	insulin	action.	They	are	discouraged	from	administering	rapid	acting	insulin	unless	three	hours	have	passed	(i.e.,	avoid	insulin	stacking).	In	addition	to	nutrition	therapy	via	carbohydrate	counting,	families	are	recommended	to	do	6-10	fingersticks	per	day	to	monitor	blood	sugars.	Substantial	education	is	provided	through	additional	materials	including	Understanding	Diabetes	(known	to	many	as	the	Pink	Panther	book)	written	by	Drs.	Peter	Chase	and	David	Maahs	at	the	Barbara	Davis	Center.	The	13th	edition	of	this	book	is	given	to	new	onset	families	and	also	accessible	online	at	the	Barbara	Davis	Center	website	(www.barbaradaviscenter.org)	under	online	books.	Both	sites	give	this	book	to	new	onset	families.	In	addition,	supplemental	education	handouts	are	typically	provided	as	well	by	the	diabetes	education.	As	an	example,	the	supplemental	education	materials	from	the	Stanford	site	are	included	in	the	Appendix.			With	CGM	and	insulin	pump	use	becoming	more	common,	more	families	are	interested	in	adding	these	technologies	to	the	treatment	regimen	sooner.	Many	providers	do	not	start	using	CGM	or	insulin	pumps	until	at	least	3-6	months	after	diagnosis	and	previous	wisdom	was	to	wait	until	at	least	12	months	from	diagnosis	to	move	to	the	insulin	pump.	Even	if	a	family	with	experience	in	treating	type	1	diabetes	(such	as	a	parent	or	sibling	with	

 
3  T1D),	insurance	may	reject	coverage	for	insulin	pumps	and	CGM	prior	to	6	months	of	T1D	diagnosis.	Research	data	on	the	initiation	of	CGM	use	soon	after	diagnosis	would	be	helpful	to	update	and	possibly	improve	on	the	treatment	of	newly	diagnosed	youth	with	T1D.			1.2.3.	Evidence	of	safety	and	efficacy	of	CGM.		Recent	data	suggest	that	youth	with	T1D	using	CGM	can	achieve	lower	hemoglobin	A1c	values	and	experience	fewer	hypoglycemic	events	than	non-CGM-using	youth	3,4.	Even	with	relatively	older	and	less	reliable	CGM	systems,	parents	of	youth	with	T1D	often	reported	relatively	high	levels	of	satisfaction.	However,	little	else	is	known	about	parents’	responses	to	CGM.	We	do	know	that	parents	of	youth	with	T1D	are	often	highly	distressed	at	diagnosis	and	over	the	course	of	many	years,	partly	due	to	their	sense	of	powerlessness	in	the	face	of	often	wild	swings	in	their	child’s	mood	and	glucose	levels	as	well	as	their	fears	and	worries	concerning	the	ever	present	danger	of	hypoglycemia	5-7.	A	goal	of	this	project	is	to	better	understand	whether	the	introduction	of	CGM	in	youth	with	T1D	at	diagnosis	might	allay	parents’	fears,	more	broadly	ease	their	sense	of	diabetes-related	distress	and	foreboding,	and	impact	glycemic	variables	measured	during	the	first	year	of	T1D.		1.3.		Preliminary	studies		We	have	extensive	experience	using	sensors,	pumps,	and	new	technology.	Both	the	Stanford	and	University	of	Colorado	groups	participated	in	the	NIH	sponsored	metabolic	control	at	the	onset	of	diabetes	study	where	newly-diagnosed	children	received	three	days	of	closed-loop	therapy	within	a	week	of	diagnosis	and	then	were	maintained	on	sensor	augmented	pump	therapy	for	one	year	8.	Stanford	and	University	of	Colorado	were	two	of	the	three	centers	conducting	the	predictive	low	glucose	suspend	(PLGS)	in-home	studies	9	and	have	worked	together	on	DirecNet	studies	and	the	JDRF	randomized	clinical	trial	of	CGM,	as	well	as	full	day	and	night	closed-loop	studies	using	automated	delivery	systems.		 All	of	the	investigators	involved	in	these	studies	have	extensive	experience	in	continuous	glucose	monitoring	and	artificial	pancreas	development.		Our	study	groups	have	worked	well	together	since	the	onset	of	the		NIH-funded	Diabetes	Research	in	Children	Network	(DirecNet).		Since	2001	DirecNet	has	conducted	numerous	protocols	involving	CGM	in	which	both	centers	participated	in	equally.		Both	centers	also	were	leaders	in	the	JDRF-funded	CGM	Randomized	Clinical	Trial	(RCT)	comparing	CGM	to	standard	care	10.	Dr.	Buckingham	was	the	PI	at	Stanford	on	the	STAR-1	randomized	trial	of	continuous	glucose	monitoring	11.	Drs.	Chase	and	Slover	at	the	University	of	Colorado	were	major	participants	in	the	STAR-3	trial	of	sensor	augmented	pumps.		Dr.	David	Maahs	was	the	PI	for	the	recent	treat-to-range	studies	at	the	University	of	Colorado.	As	part	of	these	studies,	we	all	have	gained	extensive	experience	using	the	Medtronic	Paradigm	REAL-Time	Insulin	Pump	and	CGM	System.			 The	Metabolic	Control	study	(IDE	G080204)	was	an	NIH-sponsored	study	to	determine	if	tight	glucose	control	beginning	within	the	first	week	of	diagnosis	of	diabetes	will	be	of	benefit	in	maintaining	endogenous	insulin	production.	We	have	over	700	hours	of	experience	using	this	system	at	Stanford,	and	two	of	the	centers	doing	this	study	(Stanford	and	University	of	Colorado)	have	amassed	over	1,400	hours	of	inpatient	data	without	any	severe	adverse	events.			In	a	recent	pilot	study	conducted	at	Stanford,	Barbara	Davis	Center,	and	Indiana	University	(PIs	Buckingham	&	Hood)	called	Using	Behavioral	Supports	for	Diabetes	Devices	in	Young	Children	with	Type	1	Diabetes,	17	families	with	a	child	under	the	age	of	6	with	type	1	diabetes	were	enrolled.	All	participants	were	on	CGM	and	as	part	of	assessment	procedures,	parents	completed	food,	insulin,	and	meter	blood	glucose	logs	(7	days	pre-intervention	and	7	days	post-intervention).	On	those	logs,	8	noted	they	were	using	non-adjunctive	CGM	data	to	make	diabetes	treatment	decisions.	Logging	of	this	information	was	not	required	as	part	of	the	study	and	it	is	not	known	if	the	9	participants	who	did	not	indicate	so	had	used	non-adjunctive	CGM	data	to	make	treatment	decisions.	The	age	range	of	the	8	participants	who	had	indicated	non-adjunctive	CGM	use	at	the	time	of	enrollment	was	2	to	5	years.	Duration	of	diabetes	was	between	1.08	and	4.67	years	(mean	2.25,	SD	1.13	years).	Frequency	of	CGM	use	prior	to	study	enrollment	ranged	from	7	to	30	days	per	month	(mean	26	days,	SD	8.39	days).	Over	90%	were	using	the	Dexcom	G4	system,	some	with	active	Share	remote	monitoring.	
 
4  	In	sum,	our	research	teams	have	a	great	deal	of	experience	utilizing	diabetes	devices	and	technologies,	including	CGM,	in	young	people	with	T1Dand	we	have	collaborated	extensively	in	the	past.			
 
5  	CHAPTER	2:	STUDY	PROTOCOL		2.1.		Synopsis	of	study	protocol		This	pilot	randomized	clinical	trial	compares	newly	diagnosed	T1D	youth	who	are	started	on	CGM	(the	intervention	group)	versus	those	who	are	not	(the	control	group).	We	will	examine	group	differences	over	a	6-month	period	(Phase	1)	on	two	sets	of	outcomes:	psychosocial	variables	and	glycemic	variables.	After	the	initial	comparison	of	intervention	to	control	across	the	first	six	months	after	diagnosis,	we	will	conduct	a	longitudinal	follow-up	(Phase	2)	of	glycemic	and	psychosocial	variables	for	an	additional	18	months.	The	CGM	system	used	in	this	study	is	the	Dexcom	G5	System	with	the	Share	function	(FDA	Approved).	An	IDE	will	be	obtained	to	use	this	system	in	a	non-adjunctive	manner.	Participants	will	complete	Phase	1	in	six	months.	Phase	2	includes	3	more	assessments	conducted	every	six	months	until	participants	are	two	years	post-diagnosis.		2.2.		Study	Procedures		Participants	will	be	recruited	at	two	centers:	Stanford	University	and	the	Barbara	Davis	Center	for	Diabetes,	University	of	Colorado.	Participants	will	be	enrolled	while	inpatient	or	within	1	month	of	diagnosis.	Based	on	data	over	the	past	year,	we	anticipate	at	least	15	new	diagnoses	each	month	at	these	two	centers,	with	at	least	10	in	the	eligible	age	range.	Once	identified,	study	staff	will	approach	potential	participants	to	explain	the	study,	determine	eligibility,	and	obtain	informed	consent.	Once	enrolled	in	the	study,	participants	will	be	randomized.	We	will	randomize	at	a	2:1	ratio,	intervention	to	control.	We	will	also	stratify	by	age	group	to	ensure	equal	representation	of	ages	across	groups.	The	age	groups	(in	years)	are	2-6,	7-11,	and	12-17.	To	ensure	safety	in	the	youngest	group,	recruitment	of	participants	in	the	age	2-6	years	group	will	not	begin	until	we	have	at	least	2	weeks	of	non-adjunctive	CGM	use	data	in	at	least	3	participants	aged	7-17	years.	Data	will	be	reviewed	by	the	DSMB	on	these	3	participants	and	if	deemed	safe	by	the	DSMB,	we	will	start	enrolling	participants	in	the	youngest	age	group.		2.3.		Study	Groups		There	are	two	groups	in	this	pilot	study:	intervention	and	control.	After	randomization,	participants	in	the	intervention	group	(CGM)	will	receive	standardized	education	about	CGM	and	its	use.	This	session	can	take	up	to	120	minutes	and	will	focus	largely	on	adjunctive	use	and	other	foundational	aspects	of	education	about	CGM	use.	After	a	two-week	period	of	adjunctive	use,	families	will	receive	another	training	(up	to	120	minutes)	that	will	reinforce	some	of	the	content	on	CGM	use	and	introduce	and	train	on	non-adjunctive	use	of	the	Dexcom	G5	system.	The	procedures	for	non-adjunctive	use	are	detailed	below	in	section	2.5.	and	families	will	be	informed	that	they	have	the	freedom	to	check	and	rely	on	blood	glucose	via	fingerstick	any	time	the	child	or	parent	notices	a	potential	discrepancy	between	CGM	and	fingerstick	values.	Families	will	be	given	handouts	that	contain	information	in	sections	2.5.	Families	will	also	be	provided	with	accuracy	tables	3-D,	11-B,	and	12-B	from	the	Dexcom	manual	and	will	be	instructed	on	the	accuracy	of	sensor	values	at	different	readings.	This	information,	along	with	all	that	is	given	as	handouts	to	study	participants,	will	also	be	given	to	the	healthcare	team.	A	person	trained	in	delivering	education	about	CGM	will	deliver	the	education	about	CGM	use	and	will	insert	the	first	sensor	at	the	first	training.	This	individual	will	be	available	to	assist	with	questions	from	participating	families.	In	addition,	Dexcom	representatives	are	available	to	the	family	for	technical	questions	or	issues	with	the	system,	just	like	the	access	any	Dexcom	user	has.	Families	randomized	to	the	intervention	group	will	be	required	to	actively	use	CGM	for	6	months.	After	six	months,	they	can	continue	or	discontinue	use	of	CGM.	If	they	decide	to	continue,	the	study	team	will	work	with	the	diabetes	care	team	to	assist	them	with	obtaining	CGM	via	the	standard	clinic	and	insurance	procedures.		Families	randomized	to	the	control	group	will	receive	usual	care	for	T1D	and	take	part	in	blinded	CGM	one	week	per	month.	Blinded	CGM	use	entails	insertion	of	a	Dexcom	sensor	and	calibration	of	the	system	using	blood	glucose	meter	values	at	system	start	up,	every	12	hours	thereafter,	and	any	time	the	system	requests	a	calibration	value.	At	six	months,	they	will	receive	training	and	supplies	for	the	next	six	months	to	start	non-adjunctive	use	of	CGM.	They	will	receive	the	exact	training,	education,	and	monitoring	delivered	to	the	intervention	group	and	described	earlier	in	this	section.	At	12	months,	if	they	decide	to	continue	to	use	CGM,	the	study	team	will	work	with	the	diabetes	care	team	to	assist	them	with	obtaining	supplies	via	the	standard	clinic	and	insurance	procedures.	
 
6  		2.4.		Rationale	for	non-adjunctive	use	of	CGM	in	this	study		The	use	of	CGM	in	newly	diagnosed	youth	with	T1D	offers	a	unique	opportunity	to	teach	diabetes	management	in	the	manner	that	is	expected	to	be	more	common	in	several	years.	Increasingly,	individuals	with	T1D	who	use	CGM	make	treatment	decisions	based	on	the	information	obtained	from	CGM	instead	of	fingerstick	glucose	values	done	by	blood	glucose	meters.	Further,	as	the	safety	and	accuracy	of	these	CGM	systems	has	improved	and	can	actually	surpass	the	accuracy	of	many	meters,	more	treatment	decisions	are	made	in	a	non-adjunctive	manner.		The	Dexcom	G5	System	with	Share	is	FDA	approved	and	this	Dexcom	system	and	all	other	CGM	systems	approved	by	the	FDA	are	indicated	for	use	as	adjunctive	devices.	The	Dexcom	G5	Mobile	system	is	approved	via	a	CE	mark	for	non-adjunctive	use	and	can	be	used	as	the	primary	source	of	glucose	information	for	diabetes	management.	In	other	words,	information	about	glucose	levels	provided	by	CGM	can	be	used	to	make	diabetes	treatment	decisions.	Thus,	there	are	trends	toward	non-adjunctive	use	of	CGM	in	both	patient	populations	and	from	industry.	This	study	will	provide	data	on	non-adjunctive	use	and	provides	a	unique	group	to	test	this	in	–	individuals	who	do	not	have	working	knowledge	of	adjunctive	use	or	blood	glucose	meter	treatment	decisions.		2.5.		Procedures	for	non-adjunctive	Use	of	CGM		Participants	in	this	study	will	be	taught	to	use	CGM	in	a	non-adjunctive	manner	that	is	consistent	with	the	language	included	in	Dexcom’s	CE	mark.	Participants	–	youth	with	T1D	and	their	caregivers	–	will	be	taught	the	following	in	their	initial	education	session	with	CDE	and	will	be	provided	with	this	information	in	a	handout.	Of	note,	participating	families	are	able	to	seek	out	other	devices	(e.g.,	insulin	pump)	and	start	them	during	the	course	of	the	study.	We	will	track	this	information,	but	neither	encourage	or	discourage	use.	The	study-specific	CGM	education	and	informational	handout	will	be	provided	by	the	research	team.	The	study	team	(CDE	in	particular)	will	review	the	following	guidelines	and	note	that	alert	and	alarm	settings	on	the	CGM	system	should	be	set	in	consultation	with	the	diabetes	care	team.		Instructions	for	non-adjunctive	CGM	use	with	Dexcom	G5	Share		1. If	your	glucose	alerts	and	readings	from	your	Dexcom	G5	do	not	match	your	symptoms	or	expectations,	use	a	fingerstick	blood	glucose	value	from	your	blood	glucose	meter	to	make	diabetes	treatment	decisions.		2. Discuss	with	a		healthcare	provider	on	your	study	team		how	you	should	use	the	information	displayed	on	the	Dexcom	G5	to	help	manage	your	diabetes.		3. Taking	medications	with	acetaminophen	while	wearing	the	Dexcom	G5	may	lead	to	inaccurate	glucose	readings	generated	by	the	Dexcom	G5.	The	level	of	inaccuracy	depends	on	the	amount	of	acetaminophen	active	in	your	body	and	is	different	for	each	person.		Do	not	rely	on	CGM	data	produced	by	the	Dexcom	G5	if	you	have	recently	taken	acetaminophen.	Keep	in	mind	that	some	cold	medicines	contain	acetaminophen.	If	you	are	not	sure	if	your	medication	contains	acetaminophen,	contact	your	health	care	provider	before	taking	the	medication.		4. If	your	Dexcom	G5	does	not	display	a	sensor	glucose	reading	or	if	you	are	getting	inconsistent	readings,	use	a	fingerstick	blood	glucose	value	from	your	blood	glucose	meter	to	make	diabetes	treatment	decisions.		5. Do	not	ignore	symptoms	of	low	or	high	glucose.	If	your	glucose	alerts	and	readings	do	not	match	your	symptoms	or	expectations,	you	should	obtain	a	fingerstick	blood	glucose	value	from	your	blood	glucose	
 
7  meter	to	make	diabetes	treatment	decisions	or	seek	immediate	medical	attention.		6. Calibrate	the	Dexcom	G5	at	least	once	every	12	hours.	The	Dexcom	G5	needs	to	be	calibrated	in	order	to	provide	accurate	readings.	Do	not	use	the	Dexcom	G5	for	diabetes	treatment	decisions	unless	you	have	followed	the	prompts	from	the	device	and	calibrated	every	12	hours	after	the	initial	calibration.			7. Make	diabetes	treatment	decisions	based	on	the	combination	of	the	sensor	glucose	reading,	trend	arrow,	trend	graph,	and/or	actionable	alerts	generated	by	the	Dexcom	G5.	If	you	plan	to	administer	insulin	for	a	sensor	glucose	reading	over	300	mg/dl,	you	should	be	conservative	with	dosing	and	possibly	double-check	sensor	value	with	fingerstick	blood	glucose	before	administering	a	correction	dose.		8. If	your	sensor	glucose	is	below	40	mg/dl,	you	get	a	“LOW”	on	your	display	device.	You	may	have	very	low	blood	sugar	requiring	immediate	treatment	based	on	your	health	care	professional’s	guidance.		To	be	safe,	treat	first.	After	treating,	make	sure	your	glucose	is	very	low	by	doing	a	fingerstick	for	a	BG	measurement.		9. If	your	sensor	glucose	is	above	400	mg/dl,	you	get	a	“HIGH”	on	your	display	device.	You	may	have	very	high	blood	sugar	requiring	immediate	treatment	based	on	your	health	care	professional’s	guidance.	To	be	safe,	first	make	sure	your	glucose	is	very	high	and	do	a	fingerstick	for	a	BG	measurement.	Treat	based	on	your	BG	measurement.		There	are	three	keys	when	making	decisions	based	on	your	Dexcom	G5.	Without	all	three,	you	won’t	have	all	the	needed	information	to	make	a	correct	treatment	decision.		To	help	you	remember	the	three	key	pieces,	think	of	TAG:		T-Trend:	Trend	Dots		Make	sure	trend	graph	has	three	back-to-back	readings	within	the	last	15	minutes		A-Arrow:	Trend	Arrow		Your	trend	arrow	telling	you	the	speed	and	direction	of	your	glucose		G-Glucose:	Sensor	Glucose	Readings		If	you	do	not	have	TAG	do	not	make	any	treatment	decisions	using	your	Dexcom	G5		Possible	Scenarios	to	use	TAG:		Scenario	1:		You	have	consistent	trend	dots	for	the	past	hour	(T),	the	arrow	is	to	the	right		(A),	and	the	glucose	reading	is	243	mg/dl.	In	this	situation,	you	first	consider	whether	you	need	to	administer	a	correction	insulin	dose	because	you	have	consistent	information	and	a	flat	arrow	to	the	right	showing	steady	sensor	values.	In	this	situation,	you	would	check	to	see	if	any	rapid	acting	insulin	has	been	administered	in	the	past	3	hours.	If	so,	you	will	wait	until	the	three	hours	is	up	and	then	re-assess	using	TAG.	If	it	has	been	3	hours	or	longer	since	the	last	rapid	acting	insulin	injection	(or	bolus),	you	will	plug	the	sensor	value	in	to	the	equation	you	came	up	with	your	clinical	care	team	and	decide	on	the	appropriate	insulin	dose.		

 
8  Scenario	2:		You	do	not	have	all	three	pieces	of	information	for	TAG	and	want	to	administer	insulin.	In	this	case,	you	will	resort	back	to	blood	glucose	readings	and	make	treatment	decision	based	on	rules	provided	by	your	clinical	care	team.		Scenario	3:		You	have	consistent	trend	dots	for	at	least	the	past	15	minutes	(T)	and	your	glucose	reading	is	174	mg/dl	(G).	Your	trend	arrow	is	straight	down			(A).	Before	administering	insulin	or	taking	fast-acting	carbohydrates,	you	should	“watch	and	wait”	for	15	minutes	and	re-assess	TAG	at	that	time.	Do	not	administer	insulin	until	you	no	longer	have	a	down	arrow.

Coordination	of	Study	Procedures	with	Clinical	Care		All	study	participants	will	receive	clinical	care	by	staff	in	their	respective	diabetes	centers.	Staff	at	both	sites	include	pediatric	endocrinologists,	nurses,	nurse	practitioners,	certified	diabetes	educators,	social	workers,	psychologists,	and	dietitians.	As	noted	and	depicted	earlier	in	section	1.2.2.,	care	for	newly	diagnosed	youth	with	type	1	diabetes	and	their	families	includes	frequent	contact,	extensive	education,	and	materials	and	guides	provided	to	all	families.	Clinical	care	teams	will	teach	families	who	enroll	in	this	study	about	insulin	administration,	nutrition	therapy	(e.g.,	carbohydrate	counting),	and	blood	glucose	monitoring.	If	families	start	on	an	insulin	pump	during	the	course	of	the	study,	that	will	be	coordinated	by	the	clinical	care	team	and	study	staff	will	not	be	part	of	that	decision	making	or	training.	In	sum,	care	for	new	onset	type	1	diabetes	will	be	delivered	by	the	clinical	care	team	and	this	care	is	consistent	with	clinical	practice	guidelines	and	clinician	expertise.		The	study	staff	has	the	primary	role	of	initiating	CGM	(at	the	start	of	the	study	with	intervention	participants	and	after	six	months	with	control	participants)	and	training	participants	on	non-adjunctive	use.	Clinical	care	staff	will	be	informed	about	which	of	their	clinic	patients	are	study	participants	and	which	are	actively	engaged	in	non-adjunctive	use	of	CGM.	The	clinical	care	team	will	also	be	provided	with	the	educational	materials	given	to	study	participants.	The	clinical	care	team	will	be	informed	about	use	of	Dexcom	software	so	that	they	may	review	study	

 
11  participant	CGM	data.	Further,	the	following	scenarios	may	be	encountered	and	if	they	occur,	they	will	be	reported	to	the	clinical	care	team:	• Upon	review	of	CGM,	more	than	5%	of	values	fall	below	the	threshold	for	hypoglycemia	(<60	mg/dl).	• Upon	review	of	blood	glucose	meter	downloads	(all	participants),	more	than	10%	of	values	fall	below	the	threshold	for	hypoglycemia	(<60	mg/dl).	• Any	evidence	of	insulin	stacking	reported	by	participants	to	study	staff	or	apparent	on	a	download	(if	download	includes	any	insulin	administration	details).	2.7.	Study	Visits	and	Measurements				Study	visits	for	both	groups	will	occur	at	baseline,	13	weeks,	and	26	weeks	post	randomization	in	Phase	1.	Baseline	is	the	date	they	complete	the	first	assessment,	which	will	have	to	be	within	the	first	month	since	diagnosis	of	T1D.	These	visits	should	be	within	±2	weeks	of	the	scheduled	visit	and	will	typically	be	done	before	or	after	a	scheduled	diabetes	center	outpatient	visit.	All	participants	receive	these	3	comprehensive	assessments.			After	the	initial	six-months	of	the	study,	we	will	obtain	data	from	participants	at	12,	18,	and	24	months	post-diagnosis	(Phase	2).	We	will	conduct	these	assessments	to	examine	changes	over	time	in	glycemic	and	psychosocial	variables.			Assessment	components	are	included	in	Table	2	for	Parents	and	Table	3	for	Youth.

Youth	11	years	of	age	and	older	will	provide	assent	for	their	own	participation.	In	order	to	have	at	least	60	subjects	complete	the	protocol,	we	will	enroll		up	to	75	youth	with	newly	diagnosed	T1D	and	randomize	them	to	either	the	intervention	(CGM,	n=50)	or	control	group	(no	CGM,	n=25).		2.8.1.		Eligibility	criteria		To	be	eligible	for	the	study,	a	child	must	meet	the	following	criteria:		1. Diagnosis	of	type	1	diabetes	according	to	ADA	diagnostic	criteria	2. Time	since	diagnosis	of	no	longer	than	one	month		3. Age	between	2	and	17	years			4. Parental	consent	(and	assent	from	the	child	where	applicable)	to	participate	in	the	study		5. No	severe	medical	conditions,	which	in	the	opinion	of	the	investigators	are	likely	to	hinder	participation	in	this	clinical	trial.		To	be	eligible	for	the	study,	a	parent	must	meet	the	following	criteria:		1. Parent	or	legal	guardian	of	a	child	with	type	1	diabetes	meeting	the	“child”	criteria	outlined	above	2. Age	of	18.0	years	or	older	3. Parent	comprehends	written	English	4. Parent	understands	the	study	protocol	and	signs	the	informed	consent	document			2.8.2.		Exclusion	criteria		The	presence	of	any	of	the	following	is	an	exclusion	for	the	study:		1. Child	has	a	medical	disorder	that	in	the	judgment	of	the	investigator	will	interfere	with	completion	of	any	aspect	of	the	protocol	(e.g.,	pregnancy,	kidney	disease,	adrenal	insufficiency,	skin	condition	that	may	hinder	sensor	application).	
 
17  2. Child	has	a	neurologic	disorder	that	in	the	judgment	of	the	investigator	will	affect	completion	of	the	protocol	3. Current	use	of	oral	glucocorticoids	or	other	medications,	which	in	the	judgment	of	the	investigator	would	be	a	contraindication	to	participation	in	the	study	4. Child	is	unable	to	completely	avoid	acetaminophen	for	duration	of	study			2.9.	Data	Analysis	Plan	Our	team	has	extensive	experience	in	database	design	and	implementation,	use	of	web-based	assessment,	data	management,	and	data	analysis.	We	will	utilize	the	RedCap	survey	system	to	format	all	measures	in	to	electronic	form	for	completion	online	or	in-person	via	computer	or	iPads.	Data	collected	from	participants	will	be	housed	on	the	RedCap	server,	which	is	encrypted	and	HIPAA-compliant,	with	secure	access	for	unique	study	IDs	assigned	to	each	participant.	RedCap	survey	data	is	then	ready	for	download	by	study	staff	and	will	be	imported	to	SAS	9.3	for	data	cleaning	and	analysis.		First,	we	will	document	uptake	of	the	study	with	a	review	of	descriptive	statistics	for	all	relevant	metrics	(e.g.,	recruitment	rate,	proportion	enrolled	relative	to	patient	population)	as	well	as	indicators	of	the	acceptance	of	randomization	and	overall	intervention	components	(i.e.,	is	there	variability	in	retention	and	satisfaction	between	treatment	arms?).	When	needed,	data	will	be	displayed	graphically	using	spaghetti	plots	for	individual	as	well	as	grouped	data.		Second,	in	order	to	determine	the	preliminary	efficacy	of	the	intervention	condition	(CGM)	compared	to	the	control	condition	(standard	care),	linear	mixed	effects	models	will	be	used.	A	model	will	be	run	for	each	of	the	main	endpoints,	psychosocial	distress	and	glycemic	indices.	The	testable	covariate	in	both	cases	will	be	treatment	status	(intervention	or	control).	Linear	mixed	effects	models	were	deemed	most	appropriate	for	these	analyses	due	to	the	continuous	nature	of	the	variables,	the	longitudinal	nature	of	the	design,	and	our	interest	in	testing	within-individual	change	over	time.	PROC	MIXED	in	SAS	will	be	used	for	the	linear	modeling.		In	general,	if	missing	data	are	realized,	these	linear	models	allow	for	data	that	are	missing	at	random	to	be	handled	appropriately	by	incorporating	relevant	variables	in	the	statistical	model.	We	will	also	assess	the	degree	of	non-ignorable	missingness	present	through	investigating	and	reporting	the	impact	of	sensitivity	analyses	(e.g.,	pattern	mixture	models8)	that	allow	for	plausible	non-ignorable	missing	data	patterns	on	the	model	results.	A	total	of	60	participants	with	newly	diagnosed	T1D	will	be	enrolled.	This	sample	size	is	based	on	our	projections	of	ease	in	recruiting	in	the	two	clinical	centers	across	the	study	time	frame,	the	pilot	nature	of	the	proposed	research,	and	sufficient	sample	size	to	project	effect	sizes	for	the	larger	efficacy	trial.	We	are	mindful	of	caution	raised	by	biostatisticians	in	underestimating	sample	size	for	pilot	clinical	trials9	and	thus	have	been	conservative	in	our	estimates.	The	estimate	of	60	participants	is	predicated	upon	a	longitudinal	two-group	test	of	significance	with	4	time	points,	an	effect	size	of	1σ	on	psychological	distress	and	glycemic	indices,	up	to	10%	attrition	at	follow-up,	and	80%	power.	Recognizing	that	estimates	from	small	samples	are	imprecise,	we	will	cautiously	use	summary	measures	from	the	pilot	study	to	help	determine	the	appropriate	sample	size	for	a	larger	trial,	including	effect	sizes	and	the	standard	deviations	of	continuous	outcome	measures.			2.10.		Expected	duration	of	study	participation		Duration	of	study	participation	is	expected	to	be	2	years.			
 
18  CHAPTER	3:	ADVERSE	EVENT	REPORTING	AND	SAFETY	MONITORING		3.1.		Overview	of	Safety	Monitoring		Study	procedures	are	in	place	to	monitor	safety	of	participants	and	reduce	risk	for	adverse	events.	These	procedures	come	in	two	forms:	those	conducted	by	the	study	staff	and	conveyed	to	study	participants,	and	those	conducted	by	the	study	staff	and	conveyed	to	their	diabetes	care	team.	All	participants	will	have	glucose	data	reviewed	at	planned	intervals	and	based	on	pre-determined	cut	points	to	determine	safety.		All	participants,	intervention	and	control,	will	have	their	glucose	data	reviewed	weekly	by	study	staff	for	the	first	month	of	study	participation.	All	participants	in	the	intervention	group	will	have	their	CGM	data	reviewed	daily	in	their	first	week	of	non-adjunctive	CGM	use	(week	3	of	the	study).	Those	on	CGM	will	be	monitored	via	Dexcom	Clarity	download	and	those	using	only	meters	(control	group)	will	be	done	via	meter	download	(or	review	of	faxed	or	emailed	logbooks	if	family	is	not	able	to	download	meter	at	home).	After	the	first	month,	this	occurs	once	monthly,	starting	on	week	6	of	the	study,for	the	remaining	5	months.	The	control	group	also	wears	a	blinded	CGM	for	one	week	each	month	and	this	data	will	be	reviewed	as	well.	We	are	examining	these	reports	for	adverse	events	and	the	potential	of	adverse	events	(e.g.,	hypoglycemia).	When	the	control	group	starts	use	of	CGM	non-adjunctively	(month	7),	they	will	follow	the	same	pattern	of	data	review	that	the	intervention	group	did.		3.2.	Definition	of	Adverse	Event		Reportable	adverse	events	in	this	study	include	any	untoward	medical	occurrence	that	meets	criteria	for	a	serious	adverse	event	or	any	medical	occurrence	(expected	or	unexpected)	in	a	study	participant	that	is	study	or	device-related.			Hypoglycemic	events	are	recorded	as	adverse	events	if	the	event	required	assistance	of	another	person	due	to	altered	consciousness	and	required	another	person	to	actively	administer	carbohydrate,	glucagon,	or	other	resuscitative	actions.	This	means	that	the	subject	was	impaired	cognitively	to	the	point	that	he/she	was	unable	to	treat	his	or	herself,	was	unable	to	verbalize	his	or	her	needs,	was	incoherent,	disoriented,	and/or	combative,	or	experienced	seizure	or	coma.	These	episodes	may	be	associated	with	sufficient	neuroglycopenia	to	induce	seizure	or	coma.		If	plasma	glucose	measurements	are	not	available	during	such	an	event,	neurological	recovery	attributable	to	the	restoration	of	plasma	glucose	to	normal	is	considered	sufficient	evidence	that	the	event	was	induced	by	a	low	plasma	glucose	concentration.				On	each	daily	download	(week	1	of	non-adjunctive	CGM	use)	and	weekly	download	and	review	(within	the	first	month),	we	will	also	document	the	percent	time	spent	at	or	below	60	mg/dL.	If	this	value	is	greater	than	or	equal	to	5%	(>1.2	hours	per	day),	we	will	notify	the	participant’s	caregiver	and	diabetes	care	provider	in	order	to	prevent	future	hypoglycemia.	These	criteria	will	also	apply	to	the	CGM	data	obtained	from	monthly	blinded	CGM	use	in	the	control	group.		Hyperglycemic	events	are	recorded	as	adverse	events	if	the	event	involved	diabetic	ketoacidosis	(DKA),	as	defined	by	the	DCCT,	and	had	all	of	the	following:			⋅ Symptoms	such	as	polyuria,	polydipsia,	nausea,	or	vomiting;		⋅ Serum	ketones	>	1.0	mmol/L	or	large/moderate	urine	ketones;		⋅ Either	arterial	blood	pH	<7.30	or	venous	pH	<7.24	or	serum	bicarbonate	<15;	and		⋅ Treatment	provided	in	a	health	care	facility							Skin	irritation	from	sensor	wear	will	be	recorded	in	specific	sections	of	the	case	report	forms.		An	adverse	event	form	is	only	completed	if	skin	irritation	is	severe.				
 
19  Distress	or	discomfort	experienced	by	participants	as	they	complete	surveys	is	not	considered	an	adverse	event.	However,	we	have	trained	psychologists	on	staff	who	will	be	available	to	address	any	distress	or	discomfort	and	initiate	referrals	if	requested.			3.2.		Recording	of	adverse	events		Throughout	the	course	of	this	study,	all	efforts	will	be	made	to	remain	alert	to	possible	adverse	events	or	untoward	findings.		The	first	concern	will	be	the	safety	of	the	participant,	and	appropriate	medical	intervention	will	be	made.		The	investigator	will	elicit	reports	of	adverse	events	from	the	participant	at	each	visit	and	phone	call	and	complete	all	adverse	event	forms	online.	The	medical	monitor	will	review	each	adverse	event	form	to	verify	required	coding	and	reporting.							The	study	investigator	will	assess	whether	an	adverse	event	is	related	or	unrelated	to	the	study	by	determining	if	there	is	a	reasonable	possibility	that	the	adverse	event	may	have	been	caused	by	the	study	device	or	by	study	procedures.					The	intensity	of	adverse	events	will	be	rated	on	a	three-point	scale:	(1)	mild,	(2)	moderate,	or	(3)	severe.		It	is	emphasized	that	the	term	severe	is	a	measure	of	intensity:	thus	a	severe	adverse	event	is	not	necessarily	serious.	For	example,	itching	for	several	days	may	be	rated	as	severe,	but	may	not	be	clinically	serious.				Adverse	events	that	continue	after	the	participant’s	discontinuation	or	completion	of	the	study	will	be	followed	until	their	medical	outcome	is	determined	or	until	no	further	change	in	the	condition	is	expected.				3.3.		Reporting	serious	or	unexpected	device-related	adverse	events		A	serious	adverse	event	is	any	untoward	occurrence	that:	⋅ Results	in	death	⋅ Is	life-threatening;	(a	non	life-threatening	event	which,	had	it	been	more	severe,	might	have	become	life-threatening,	is	not	necessarily	considered	a	serious	adverse	event)	⋅ Requires	inpatient	hospitalization	or	prolongation	of	existing	hospitalization	⋅ Results	in	significant	disability/incapacity		⋅ Is	a	congenital	anomaly/birth	defect		3.4.		Unanticipated	adverse	device	event			An	unanticipated	adverse	device	event	is	defined	as	an	adverse	event	caused	by,	or	associated	with,	a	device,	if	that	effect	or	problem	was	not	previously	identified	in	nature,	severity,	or	degree	of	incidence.		Serious	or	unexpected	adverse	events	must	be	reported	to	the	coordinating	center	immediately	via	completion	of	the	online	serious	adverse	event	form.		The	principal	investigator	will	notify	all	participating	investigators	of	any	adverse	device	event	that	is	both	serious	and	unexpected.		Notification	will	be	made	within	10	days	after	the	PI	becomes	aware	of	the	event.		Such	events	will	be	reported	to	the	FDA	according	to	regulatory	requirements.		Each	principal	investigator	is	responsible	for	informing	his/her	IRB	of	serious	study-related	adverse	events	and	abiding	by	any	other	reporting	requirements	specific	to	their	IRB.		
 
20  3.5.		Data	and	safety	monitoring	board			An	independent	Data	and	Safety	Monitoring	Board	will	be	informed	of	all	serious	adverse	events	and	any	unanticipated	adverse	device	events	that	occur	during	the	study	and	will	review	compiled	adverse	event	data	at	the	completion	of	the	study.					3.6.		Potential	risks	and	side	effects		Loss	of	confidentiality	is	a	potential	risk,	and	is	protected	by	the	safeguards	discussed	above.	Hypoglycemia,	hyperglycemia,	and	ketone	formation	are	always	a	risk	in	subjects	with	type	1	diabetes.	Subjects	will	be	closely	monitored	for	this.		When	wearing	CGM	sensors	there	are	risks	of	skin	rashes,	allergic	reactions	to	tape,	infections	at	the	insertion	site,	or	small	pieces	of	the	sensor	breaking	off	or	remaining	under	the	skin.	These	risks	will	be	monitored,	but	study	staff	will	not	oversee	insertions,	tracking	of	sensor	information,	and	other	diabetes	device	information.		3.6.1.			Lancing	risks		A	small	drop	of	blood	will	be	obtained	by	finger	stick	to	measure	blood	glucose	and	HbA1c.	This	is	a	standard	method	to	obtain	blood	for	routine	hospital	laboratory	tests.	Pain	is	common	at	the	time	of	lancing.	In	about	1	in	10	cases,	a	small	amount	of	bleeding	under	the	skin	will	produce	a	bruise.	A	small	scar	may	persist	for	several	weeks.	The	risk	of	local	infection	is	less	than	1	in	1000.	We	recommend	children	with	diabetes	check	their	blood	sugar	at	least	4	times	daily.	This	should	not	be	a	significant	contributor	to	risks	in	this	study	as	finger	lancing	is	part	of	the	usual	care	for	people	with	diabetes.			3.6.2.		Sensor	site	risks		Whenever	the	skin	is	broken	there	is	the	possibility	of	an	infection.	CGM	sensors	are	inserted	under	the	skin.	There	may	be	bleeding	where	the	sensor	is	inserted,	which	can	cause	bruising.	CGM	site	infections	occur	very	infrequently,	but,	if	an	infection	was	to	occur,	oral	and/or	topical	antibiotics	can	be	used.	The	risk	of	skin	problems	could	be	greater	if	a	sensor	is	left	in	longer	than	recommended.	Participants	will	be	carefully	instructed	about	proper	use	of	sensors.			3.7.		Risk	of	hypoglycemia		There	is	always	a	risk	of	hypoglycemia	for	patients	with	insulin-dependent	diabetes.	The	frequency	of	hypoglycemia	during	this	study	is	not	expected	to	be	greater	than	the	risk	incurred	during	daily	living.	If	severe	hypoglycemia	occurs,	it	is	readily	treated	with	either	oral	glucose	or	glucagon	injection.	To	minimize	the	risk	of	hypoglycemia	due	to	“stacking”	insulin	doses,	study	participants	will	be	instructed	in	their	initial	education	(face-to-face	and	in	educational	materials)	not	to	take	rapid	acting	insulin	injections	to	correct	hyperglycemia	more	than	once	every	3	hours.	Further,	the	low	glucose	alert	on	the	Dexcom	G5	system	will	be	set	at	70	mg/dl	for	all	participants	on	CGM.				3.8.		Risk	of	hyperglycemia		Hyperglycemia	and	ketonemia	can	occur	if	insulin	delivery	is	attenuated	or	suspended	for	an	extended	period.	This	is	a	risk	of	type	1	diabetes	that	is	not	expected	to	be	greater	during	the	study	period	than	it	is	during	daily	living.	If	severe	hyperglycemia	occurs,	participants	will	be	advised	to	treat	with	insulin	therapy	or	to	seek	medical	attention	from	the	child’s	diabetes	care	team.					3.9.		Other	risks		
 
21  Subjects	may	develop	skin	irritation	or	allergic	reactions	to	the	adhesives	used	to	secure	the	CGM.	If	these	reactions	occur,	different	adhesives	(such	as	with	IV	3000,	Tegaderm,	etc.)	will	be	tried,	sites	will	be	rotated	frequently,	and	a	mild	topical	steroid	cream	or	other	medication	may	be	required.		Data	downloaded	from	the	CGM	and	the	home	glucose	meter	will	be	collected	for	the	study	as	measures	of	diabetes	self-management	behaviors.		Some	people	may	be	uncomfortable	with	the	researchers'	having	such	detailed	information	about	their	daily	diabetes	habits.		Psychological	and	human	factors	testing	and	focus	groups	may	make	study	participants	uncomfortable.	Subjects	are	free	to	withdraw	from	the	study	at	any	time.	A	psychologist	or	a	health	care	professional	will	be	available	to	help	them	with	their	stress	or	anxieties.				3.10.		Adequacy	of	protection	against	risks		3.10.1.		Recruitment	and	informed	consent		All	minorities	will	be	encouraged	to	participate.		Economically	and	educationally	disadvantaged	people,	parents	who	are	employed	at	the	clinical	center	(Stanford	or	the	University	of	Colorado)	will	be	eligible	to	enroll	their	child	in	this	study	if	they	meet	all	the	study	criteria.	Subjects	will	be	recruited	from	our	clinics,	chart	review,	and	IRB	approved	patient	recruitment	lists.	We	will	also	use	IRB	approved	recruitment	materials	to	post	the	study	on	clinicaltrials.gov	and	the	local	universities’	research	and	department	websites.	Participants	may	self-select	to	join	the	research	by	responding	to	advertisements	on	social	media.	These	posts	will	provide	contact	information	for	the	research	staff	at	each	site.	We	will	not	interact	with	potential	participants	or	enrolled	participants	through	these	media.	We	will	actively	work	to	prevent	harm	to	all	subjects	enrolled	in	the	study.	We	will	work	to	avoid	coercion	by	allowing	equal	enrollment	opportunities	for	employees,	as	well	as	non-university	affiliated	subjects.	We	will	ensure	that	all	families	are	informed	that	their	participation	is	voluntary,	that	they	will	receive	no	ill	treatment	should	they	decide	to	not	participate,	and	that	they	will	receive	no	special	advantages,	aside	from	those	mentioned	in	the	"benefits"	section	of	the	consent,	for	participating	in	the	study.			Participation	will	be	voluntary	and	all	participants	must	provide	consent	prior	to	inclusion	in	this	research	study.		The	primary	investigator	at	each	of	the	participating	clinical	sites,	or	one	of	their	designees,	will	explain	the	nature,	purpose,	expected	duration,	and	risks	of	study	participation	to	each	eligible	family.		The	primary	investigator	at	each	site,	or	one	of	their	designees,	will	also	obtain	consent	and	authorization	for	the	release	of	personal	information.			For	children	<	18	years	of	age	we	will	follow	the	federal	guideline	21	CFR	50.52	for	clinical	investigations	involving	greater	than	minimal	risk	and	no	prospect	of	direct	benefit	to	individual	subjects,	but	likely	to	yield	generalizable	knowledge	about	the	subjects’	disorder	or	condition.	In	accordance	with	federal	guideline	21	CFR	50.55	we	will	require	that	the	permission	of	two	parents	is	required,	unless	one	parent	is	deceased,	unknown,	incompetent,	not	reasonably	available,	or	only	one	parent	has	legal	responsibility	for	the	care	and	custody	of	the	child.		After	speaking	with	the	subject	and	their	parent	and/or	legal	guardian,	questions	will	be	answered	about	the	study,	and	the	participant	and/or	parent	and/or	legal	guardian	will	be	asked	to	explain	what	they	understand	about	the	study	in	order	to	assess	the	autonomy	of	the	subject	and	caregiver	and	their	comprehension	of	the	explanations	provided.		A	copy	of	the	consent	form	will	be	provided	to	the	adult	subjects	or	parent	or	guardian	of	subjects	<	18	years	of	age,	and	a	copy	will	be	placed	in	the	subject’s	medical	file	at	the	participating	institution.				3.10.2.		Protections	against	risk		All	protocols	and	consent	documents	will	be	approved	by	the	local	IRB	at	each	clinical	site.			All	of	the	participating	clinical	centers	have	an	endocrinologist	on	call	24/7	for	any	severe	events	that	should	occur.		Likewise,	a	licensed	clinical	psychologist	is	available	for	any	concerns	on	the	psychological	side.	Severe	events	are	not	anticipated	but	will	be	monitored.	Study	personnel	are	always	available	for	questions.		
 
22  Hyperglycemia	and	ketone	formation	are	always	a	risk	in	subjects	with	type	1	diabetes	and	subjects	will	be	closely	monitored	for	this.		Subjects	will	have	blood	ketone	meters	provided	through	routine	clinical	care.	Insulin	can	be	given	as	a	subcutaneous	injection	to	treat	hyperglycemia.	Participants	will	have	access	to	phone	numbers	for	the	study	physician	and	endocrinologist	on	call.		Participants	in	the	intervention	group	will	receive	standardized	education	about	CGM	and	its	use	after	randomization.	Participants	in	the	control	group	who	wish	to	start	CGM	at	six	months	will	receive	standardized	education	about	CGM	and	its	use.	Both	groups	will	be	instructed	on	inserting	and	calibrating	the	sensor.	Participants	are	free	to	check	blood	glucose	via	fingerstick	at	any	time	and	encouraged	to	do	so	if/when	the	child	or	parent	notices	a	potential	discrepancy	between	CGM	and	fingerstick	values.	A	person	trained	in	delivering	education	about	CGM	will	deliver	the	education	about	CGM	use	and	will	assist	with	inserting	the	first	sensor.	This	individual	will	be	available	to	assist	with	questions	from	participating	families.	In	addition,	Dexcom	representatives	are	available	to	the	family	for	technical	questions	or	issues	with	the	system,	just	like	the	access	any	Dexcom	user	has.				3.11.		Study	stopping	criteria		Individual	subjects	will	be	removed	from	the	study	for	the	following	reasons:		pregnancy,	study-related	adverse	events	(i.e.	severe	hypoglycemia,	loss	of	consciousness,	hypoglycemia	related	seizure,	DKA	related	to	non-adjunctive	CGM	use	or	study-related	event	requiring	hospitalization),	severe	skin	infection	requiring	systemic	antibiotics,	severe	reaction	to	sensor	tape,	or	other	reasons	that	develop	during	the	study	that	in	the	judgment	of	the	investigator	make	it	unadvisable	for	the	subject	to	continue	with	the	study.
 
23  CHAPTER	4:	MISCELLANEOUS	CONSIDERATIONS		4.1.		Benefits		It	is	expected	that	this	protocol	will	yield	knowledge	about	the	impact	of	continuous	glucose	monitoring	on	families	with	newly	diagnosed	children	with	type	1	diabetes.	The	introduction	of	CGM	in	youth	with	T1D	at	diagnosis	might	allay	parents’	fears,	ease	their	sense	of	diabetes-related	distress	and	foreboding,	and	impact	glycemic	variables	measured	during	the	first	year	of	T1D,	however	there	is	no	guarantee	of	any	benefit	from	participating	in	this	research	study.		4.2.		Subject	compensation		There	will	be	no	cost	to	the	subjects	to	participate	in	this	research	study.	Parents	will	receive	$40	for	the	completion	of	each	of	three	assessments.	Youth	11-17	years	of	age	will	receive	$25	for	the	completion	of	each	of	three	assessments.	In	total,	a	family	can	receive	$195	for	completion	of	the	study	and	keep	the	CGM	system.	All	CGM	sensors	and	required	equipment	for	the	protocol	will	be	provided	for	study	participants	free	of	charge.				4.3.		Subject	withdrawal		Participation	in	the	study	is	voluntary,	and	a	subject	may	withdraw	at	any	time.		The	investigator	may	withdraw	a	subject	who	is	not	complying	with	the	protocol.	For	subjects	who	withdraw,	their	data	will	be	used	up	until	the	time	of	withdrawal.		4.4.		Confidentiality		For	security	and	confidentiality	purposes,	subjects	will	be	assigned	an	identifier	that	will	be	used	instead	of	their	name.	De-identified	subject	information	may	also	be	provided	to	research	sites	involved	in	the	study.		4.5.		Level	of	risk		This	research	proposal	in	children	is	consistent	with	21	CFR	50.53	-	Clinical	investigations	involving	greater	than	minimal	risk	and	no	prospect	of	direct	benefit	to	individual	subjects,	but	likely	to	yield	generalizable	knowledge	about	the	subjects'	disorder	or	condition.

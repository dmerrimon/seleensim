General Statistical  
Methods and Types  
of Analyses: 
 Efficacy Analysi s: 
Primary efficacy analyses will first test the 
difference in proportion of study eyes with a grade 
of ‘0’ in anterior chamber cells between the 1.0% 
concentration of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension 
and placebo  and between the 0.5% concentration of 
RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension      Reata Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: 408 -C-1307      Amendment 1 : 10-Feb-2014 
 
Confidential   Page 11 of 77 General Considerations:  
The unit of analysis in this study will be the study 
eye for all efficacy and safety summaries.  
Additionally, non- ocular adverse events will be 
presented at the patient  level. Non- study eye safety 
summaries will also be presented as appropriate.  
The primary analyses of all efficacy data will use 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) to impute missing data; data for visits after a patient  is 
discontinued for lack of efficacy will be imputed as 
failures for success/failure endpoints and will be 
imputed using LOCF for other endpoints. To check 
robustness of results, sensitivity analyses of the 
primary efficacy data will include analyses of 
observed data only, imputing data from patient  visits 
after discontinuation for lack of efficacy as failures.  
Other imputation methods may be applied as 
additional sensitivity analyses.  
Per protocol analyses will use observed data only, 
with the exception  of patient s who have missing data 
due to discontinuation for lack of efficacy; for these patient
s, missing data after discontinuation will be 
imputed as failures for success/failure endpoints and will be imputed using LOCF for other endpoints. 
Summaries f or continuous variables will include the 
sample size (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. Summaries for discrete 
variables will include frequencies and percentages. 
Differences between treatment groups will be 
calculated as Test – Placebo  and change from 
baseline will be calculated as follow -up visit – 
baseline. The baseline visit will be defined as the 
last non- missing measure prior to initiation of 
investigational treatment. All efficacy analyses wi ll 
use a one -sided alpha=0.10 tes t unless otherwise 
stated.  
The secondary efficacy variables, study eyes with absence of anterior chamber cells (Visits 3, 4 or 6), 
study eyes with absence of pain (Visits 4, 5  or 6) and 
study eyes with absence of flare (Visits 3, 4, 5 or 6) 
will be summarized similarly to the primary efficacy summaries. Additionally, anterior chamber cells and 
flare as well as pain at each visit and change from

Confidential   Page 12 of 77 baseline will be summarized using continuous and 
discrete summary statistics.  
The sum of anterior chamber cells and flare grade 
will be summarized similarly to anterior chamber 
cells and flare separately.  
Safety Analysis: 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular 
treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the study eye 
for all treated patient s using discrete summaries at 
the patient  and event level by system organ class and 
preferred term for each treatment group.  A TEAE 
will be defined as any AE that occurs after the 
treatment is initiated. An additional analysis will 
examine ocular AEs for the non -study eye. Non-
ocular TEAEs will be summarized using discrete 
summaries at the patient  and event level by system 
organ class and preferred term for each treatment group. Treatment related ocular and non-ocular TEAEs will be summarized similarly. Oc
ular and 
non-ocular TEAEs will also be summarized by 
severity.  
The IOP data will be summarized at each visit using both continuous summaries (including change from 
baseline) and discrete summaries (including the 
proportion of patient s with change in IOP fr om 
baseline ≥ 10 mm Hg and the proportion of patient s 
with an IOP ≥ 30 mm Hg that occurs at any time following initiation 
of study treatment) as well as 
shift tables.  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect 
ophthalmoscopic exami nation measures will be  
summarized at each visit using discrete summary 
statistics.  
Visual Acuity data will be summarized at each visit, 
using discrete summaries including change from 
baseline in the number of lines and the proportion of patient s with worsening from previous vis it of ≥ 2 
lines.  
Summary of Known 
and Potential Risks and  This study is the first clinical study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of RTA 408  Ophthalmic 
Suspension.

Confidential   Page 13 of 77 Benefits to Human Patient s 
 The ocular tolerability of RTA 408 was evaluated in 
multiple  nonclinical studies in rats, guinea pigs, 
rabbits, and monkeys. No ocular  or systemic toxicity 
was observed and systemic exposure was very low 
in all species tested.  Conjunctival irritation was 
observed in the rabbit ocular GLP toxicity study 
with frequen t dosing (4x/day); however, this was 
reversible, was not observed in a non- GLP study in 
rabbits, was not observed in the monkey ocular GLP 
toxicity study, and is readily monitorable in the 
clinic.  In vitro  and in vivo  studies conducted to date 
demonstrate that RTA 408 is a potent activator of 
the Nrf2 pathway and an inhibitor of the NF -κB 
pathway, and should thus be an effective anti -
inflammatory agent for ophthalmic indications of 
inflammation and pain.

RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension      Reata Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: 408 -C-1307      Amendment 1 : 10-Feb-2014 
 
Confidential   Page 20 of 77 administered 4x/day for 28 days in rabbits and monkeys.  The conjunctival irritation 
observed in the rabbit ocular GLP toxicity study was reversible, was not observed in a non-GLP study in rabbits, was not observed in the monkey ocular GLP toxicity study, 
and is readily monitorable in the clinic. 
Although it is highly unlikely that meaningf ul systemic exposure will result following 
topical ocular administration in humans, the systemic toxicity potential of RTA  408 has 
been extensively investigated in rats and monkeys, with daily oral administration for up 
to 6 months in rats and 9 months in monkeys. 
Based on an integrated assessment of the nonclinical data, it is concluded that RTA 408 
has an acceptable safety profile for topical ophthalmic use as indicated in the proposed 
topical ocular study in patient s following uncomplicated cataract surg ery at 
concentrations of 0.5% and 1.0% with a BID dosage regimen .  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension in two 
concentrations versus placebo in the treatment of patient s with inflammation and pain 
following uncomplicated cataract surgery . 
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES  
It is hypothesized that RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension will be more effective than 
placebo  in the alleviation of inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. 
4 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
This trial will be a  multi- center, double -masked, randomized, dose- ranging , placebo -
controlled study consisting of 6 visits over approximately 7 weeks ( 49 days). 
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of patient s to treatment, to 
increase the likelihood that known and unknown patient  attributes (e.g., demographics 
and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment grou ps. Mask ed treatment will be 
used to reduce potential of bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.    
At Visit 1  (Day -1 to Day -28), patient s will be screened to ensure that they meet all 
initial inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria . Medical and medication 
histories will be taken,  the patient s will subjectively grade ocular pain using the scales 
provided, and pin- hole visual acuity will be assessed . The Investigator will then perform 
a slit lamp biomicroscop ic exami nation with intraocular pressure ( IOP) measurement , 
and grading of  anterior chamber inflammation . A dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic 
examination will also  be performed . Female patient s of childbearing potential will be 
given a urine pregnancy test.   
At Visit 2 (Day 1 , 24 ± 6 hours post- surgery ), patient s’ medical and medication histories 
will be updated, patient s will be queried for ocular pain, pin- hole visual acuity will be 
assessed, and the Investigator will perform a slit lamp biomicroscopic evaluation, IOP

Confidential   Page 21 of 77 measurement, and grading of anterior chamber inflammation. Qualifying patient s  will 
then be randomized to one of the following treatment groups (in a 1:1:1  ratio): RTA 408 
Ophthalmic Suspension 0.5% (N= 35), RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension 1.0% (N =35), or 
placebo  for RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension (N=35). Study drug will be dispensed 
along with the Study Drug Compliance Diary.  A trained unmasked technician will 
instruct patient s on how to instill the study drug twice  daily in the morning and evening  
(approximately  12 hours apart ) for 14 days  on the eye that underwent surgery . The first 
dose of study drug will be instilled in -office.  
At Visits 3  (Day 4± 1 ), 4 (Day 8 ± 1), and 5 ( Day 15 + 1), patient s’ medical and 
medication histories will be updated, patient s will be queried for ocular pain, pin-hole 
visual acuity will be assessed, and  the Investigator  will perform a slit lamp 
biomicroscopic evaluation , IOP measurement , and grading of  anterior chamber 
inflammation.  AEs will be noted, and the Study Drug Compliance D iary will be 
reviewed. Day 14 will be the last day of study drug treatment at home . On Visit 5 ( Day 
15+ 1) , the study drug  and Study Drug Compliance D iary will be collected . 
At Visit 6 (Day 21 ± 1), patient s’ medical and medication histories will be updated, 
patient s will be queried for ocular pain, pin- hole visual acuity will be assessed, and the 
Investigator will perform a slit lamp biomicroscopic evaluation, IOP assessment, and 
gradin g of anterior chamber inflammation. A dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic 
examination will also be performed. AEs will be noted , and a urine pregnancy test will be 
given to females of childbearing potential. Patient s will then exit the study.

Confidential   Page 36 of 77 Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility ” means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the stu dy drug and 
the AE.  Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between 
the study drug  and the AE include: the event follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from the time of study drug administration, and/or, follows a known 
response pattern to the study drug, but could have been produced by other factors; a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with study drug administration e xists and, based upon the known pharmacologic action of the 
drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of drugs, or judgment based on the investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event  with study drug administration seems likely; a single 
occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure ( e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated  with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population 
exposed to the drug ( e.g., tendon rupture);  an aggregate analysis of specific 
events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An AE  is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , it 
results in any of the following regulatory outcome definition s: 
1. Death ; 
2. A life -threatening AE; 
 Note:  An AE  is considered “li fe-threatening” if, in the view  of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the patient or patient  
at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
 Note:  The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission  (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term 
inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/ intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does not 
include: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory 
procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or clinical research/P hase 1 units. 
 Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or

Confidential   Page 37 of 77 required for the reason for the initial admission as determined by the 
Investigator or treating physician.  
4. A per sistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions; 
 Note: An SAE  specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted 
as any potential impairment or damage to the patient ’s eyes ( e.g., 
hemorrha ge, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the 
optic nerve). 
5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
6. Import ant medical event.  
 Note: Important medical events  that may not result in death, ar e life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be co nsidered serious 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
9.3 Procedures for Reporting AEs 
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to the study Sponsor or designee , and 
the IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state , or local regulations and 
governing health authorities and recorded on the appropriate eCRF . AEs should be 
reported from the fi rst instillation of study drug until the final study visit.  
9.3.1 Reporting a Suspected U nexpected Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to CRO , the 
study Sponsor and the IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or 
local  regulations and governing health authorities. 
9.3.2 Reporting an SAE  
To ensure patient  safety, all SAE s, regardless of relationship to the study drug, 
must be immediately reported (i.e. no later than 24 hours after the site’s 
awareness of the event) .  All information relevant to the serious AE must be 
recorded on the appropriate CRFs. The Investigator is obligated to pursue and 
obtain information requested by CRO  and the Sponsor in addition to that 
information reported on the eCRF . All patient s experiencing an SAE  must be 
followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a n SAE , the Investigator must notify the Sponsor or designee  
immediately  (i.e. no later than 24 hours after t he site’s awareness of the 
event) ; obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information , and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the 
treatment and follow -up of the patient ; provide CRO  and the study Sponsor 
with a complete case history , which includes a statement as to whether the

Form must be completed and faxed to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours  of 
the site’s awareness of the event . The original SAE form is not to be altered. The 
report should describe whether the event has resolved or continues and how the 
event was treated.  
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES 
10.1 Study Populations 
10.1.1 Intent- to-Treat Population 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population consists of al l patient s who a re 
randomized. All data will be included and no patient s will be excluded 
because of protocol violations. The ITT population will be analyzed as 
randomized and will be used for the efficacy analyses.   
10.1.2 Safety Population 
The Safety population includes all r andomized patient s who received at least 
one dose  of investigational treatment. The Safety population will be analyzed 
as treated and will be used for the safety analyses.  No data will be excluded 
for any reason.  
10.1.3 Per Protocol Population 
The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the ITT population and includes patient s who remain in the study through Visit 5 (Day 15) with no 
major protocol violations that would affect the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoints  of the study. Patient s without majo r protocol violations 
thought to affect the primary efficacy outcome who discontinue the study due to lack of efficacy will be analyzed in the PP analysis with missing data after discontinuation imputed as failures for success/failure endpoints and will be  
imputed using last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) for other endpoints. 
Otherwise, this population will be analyzed as treated using observed data only for confirmatory analyses.  
10.2 Unit of Analysis 
The unit of analysis in this study will be the study eye for all efficacy and safety 
summaries.  Additionally, non- ocular AEs will be presented at the patient  level. Non-
study eye safety summaries will also be presented as appropriate.   
10.3 General Imputation Methods  
The primary analyses of all efficacy data will use LOCF to impute missing data; data for visits after a patient  is discontinued for lack of efficacy will be imputed as

Confidential   Page 43 of 77 10.9 Demographics and Baseline Medical History 
Patient  demographics: gender, race, ethnicity, and age will be presented using 
discrete summary statistics. Age will also be presented using continuous summary 
statistics.  
Non-ocular and ocular (study eye and fellow eye) medical history will be 
summarized by treatment group using discrete summaries.  
10.10  Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy variables, study eyes with absence of anterior chamber cells at Visit 5 (Day 15) and study eyes with absence of pain at Visit 3 (Day 4), will be 
summariz ed using discrete summary statistics, including 90% asymptotic normal 
confidence intervals for each treatment group. The primary efficacy analyses will first test the difference in proportion of study eyes with a grade of ‘0’ in anterior chamber cells betw een the 1.0% concentration of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension 
and placebo  and between the 0.5% concentration of RTA 408 Ophthalmic 
Suspension and placebo  at Visit 5 (Day 15) using the Pearson chi- squared statistic.  
If the proportion of patients with a grade of ‘0’ for anterior chamber cells is 
statistically significantly higher  for the 1.0% concentration versus placebo at a 1 -
sided alpha=0.10, then the hierarchical hypothesis testing will compare the proportion of patients with absence of ocular pain at Visi t 3 (Day 4) between the 
1.0% concentration of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension and placebo  using the 
Pearson chi -squared statistic at a 1 -sided alpha=0.10.   
If the proportion of patients with a grade of ‘0’ for anterior chamber cells is 
statistically significantly higher for the 0.5% concentration versus placebo at a 1 -
sided alpha=0.10, then the hierarchical hypothesis will compare  the proportion of 
patient s with absence of ocular pain at Visit 3 (Day 4) between the 0.5% 
concentration of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension and placebo  using the Pearson 
chi-squared statistic at a one-sided alpha=0.10.   
Additionally, 95% confidence intervals will be constructed around the difference in proportions for each primary outcome using asymptotic normal approximations. Fishe r’s exact tests will be employed in cases of expected counts less than five.  
If the test of the difference in the proportion of study eyes with absence of anterior chamber cells is statistically significant in favor of the 1.0% or 0.5% concentration 
of RTA  408 Ophthalmic Suspension versus placebo , then the study will be 
considered a success and the concentration (s) of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension 
showing statistical significance will be declared to be superior to placebo  in the 
proportion of study eyes with absence of anterior chamber cells at Visit 5 (Day 1 5). 
Additionally, a Cochran- Armitage test will be used to test for trend separately in the 
proportion of study eyes with absence of anterior chamber cells and the proportion of study eyes with absence of pain with increasing active concentration, using all three treatment groups.

The secondary efficacy variables will be summarized at Days 4, 8, and 21 for 
absence of anterior chamber cells and  at Days 8, 15 and 21 for absence of ocular 
pain, similarly to the primary efficacy summaries. Additionally, anterior chamber 
cell grade and ocular pain score at each visit and change from baseline will be summarized using continuous and discrete summary s tatistics.  
Absence of anterior chamber flare and anterior chamber flare grade and the sum of anterior chamber cell and flare grade, including absence of both anterior chamber cell and flare will be summarized similarly to anterior chamber cells and pain at each 
visit.  
10.12  Safety Analyses 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular treatment- emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) in the study eye for all treated patient s using discrete summaries at the 
patient - and event -level by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment 
group. A TEAE will be defined as occurring on or after the day that treatment is initiated.  An additional analysis will investigate ocular AEs for the non -study eye. 
Non-ocular TEAEs will be summarized using discrete summaries at the patient - and 
event -level by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group. 
Treatment -related ocular and non -ocular TEAEs will be summarized similarly. 
Ocular and non- ocular TEAEs will also be summarized by severity.  
The IOP data will be summarized  at each visit using both continuous summaries 
(including change from baseline) and discrete summaries (including the proportion of patient s with change in IOP from baseline ≥ 10 mm Hg and the proportion of 
patient s with an IOP ≥ 30 mm Hg that occurs at an y time following instillation of 
study treatment) as well as shift tables.  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic examination  measures 
will be summarized at each visit using discrete summary statistics.  
Visual acuity data will be summarized at each visit, using discrete summaries, including change from baseline in the number of lines and the proportion of patient s 
with change from previous visit of ≥ 2 lines.

OCULAR PAIN GRADING SCALE (STUDY EYE)  
Ocular Pain will be assessed by the patient  at screening and at each follow -up visit, 
utilizing a Numerical Pain Rating Scale1 graded from 0 to 10. Patient s will assess the 
level of pain they are experiencing in the study eye at the time of the assessment.  Patients 
may only select whole numbers on the scale.  
The examiner will ask the patient  the following question related to Figure 1 :On a 
scale of 0 to 10, in which 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible or unbearable 
pain, please mark on the scale the whole number that best describes the pain or 
discomfort you are feeling in the operated eye at this time. The middle of the scale (around 5) can be used to describe “moderate pain”.

PIN-HOLE VISUAL ACUITY PROCEDURES (EACH EYE)  
Pin-hole, LogMAR visual acuity must be assessed using an ETDRS chart. The procedure 
used will be consistent with the recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye 
chart. Pin -hole visual acuity should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit in the 
study (i.e., prior to slit lamp examination). Pin -hole visual acuity testing should be done 
with a pin -hole occluder. 
Equipment 
The visual acuity chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18" by 
18", e.g., from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are used, the patient  viewing distance 
should be exactly 10 feet (or as specified by the manufacturer). In ALL cases, for purposes of standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only 
the 'R' charts, and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be placed frontally and well- illuminated.  
Measurement Techniqu e 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. A pin- hole occluder should be 
applied to the right eye which should be tested first. The patient  should attempt to read 
each letter, line- by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 at the top of the chart. The 
patient  should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the patient  reads a 
number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number.  
The patient  should be asked to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each 
letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response. If the patient  changes a response (e.g., “that was a ‘C’ not an ‘O’”) before he has read 
aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the patient  changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change is not accepted. The examiner should never 
point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test.  
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the patient  
says he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. If the patient  
identifies a letter as one of two letters, he or she should be asked t o choose one letter and, 
if necessary, to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despite encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted.

PIN-HOLE VISUAL ACUITY PROCEDURES (cont.)  
LogMAR Visual Acuity Calculations  
The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR reading. 
To this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number of letters missed up to and included in the last line read. This total sum r epresents the 
logMAR visual acuity for that eye.  
For example: Patient correctly reads 4 of 5 letters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 
0.1 line. 
Base LogMAR  = 0.1  
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as well as 0.1)  
  
= 4 
N x T (T=0.02)  = 0.08  
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08  
logMAR VA  = 0.18  
Repeat the procedure for the left eye.  
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during 
the study, all visual acuity assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting conditions and pin- hole during the entire study. If the sam e conditions and 
use of pin- hole cannot be used, the reason for the change in condition and pin hole should 
be documented.

The slit beam observations should be assessed in a dark room using a slit beam of 1.0 mm 
height and 1.0 mm width with maximum luminance, with 16x magnifica tion, 1x1mm 
oblique high intensity beam fluorescein dye is to be instilled into the ocular cul -de-sac, or 
alternatively, fluorescein strips may be used to facilitate this examination.   
Anterior Chamber Cells and Flare  
The anterior chamber cell count will be recorded as the actual number of cells observed if 
fewer than 10 cells are seen (only white blood cells should be counted; red blood cells and pigment cells should not be counted). Flare will be graded using the SUN* Working Group grading scheme.

Ocular Pain 
Grading Scale 
(Study Eye)  Administrative 
update  Ocular Pain will be assessed by the patient at 
screening and at each follow -up visit, utilizing a 
Numerical Pain Rating Scale1 graded from 0 to 10. 
Patients will assess the level of pain they are experiencing in the  study eye at the time of the 
assessment.  
The examiner will ask the patient the following question: 
On a scale of 0 to 10, in which 0 is no pain 
and 10 is the worst possible or unbearable 
pain, please mark on the scale the number that 
best describes the pain or discomfort you are 
feeling in the operated* eye at this time. The middle of the scale (around 5) can be used to describe “moderate pain”.  
*At the screening assessment visit, the patient will 
be asked about the eye scheduled for surgery.  Ocular Pain will be assessed by the patient at screening and at each follow -up visit, utilizing a 
Numer ical Pain Rating Scale
1 graded from 0 to 
10. Patients will assess the level of pain they are experiencing in the study eye at the time of the 
assessment. Patients may only select whole 
numbers on the scale.   
The examiner will ask the patient the following question related to Figure 1: 
On a scale of 0 to 10, in which 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible or unbearable 
pain, please mark on the scale the whole  
number that best describes the pain or discomfort you are feeling in the operated* 
eye at this time. The middle of the scale 
(around 5) can be used to describe 
“moderate pain”.

 1. SYNOPSIS 
Study Title A Randomized, Phase 2, Open-Labe l, Multicenter Study to Evaluat e the 
Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of KD025 in Subjects with Id iopathic 
Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)  
Clinical Phase 2 
Number of Study 
Centers/Sites Approximately 10-15 
Study Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, irreve rsible, and 
often fatal lung disease of unknow n cause. With a prevalence of  2 to 
29 per 100,000 people and an inc idence of approximately 10 per 
100,000/per year, IPF meets the criteria for classification as an orphan 
disease. It affects older adults with peak prevalence around 65  years of 
age.  
The natural history for patien ts with IPF varies. While most pa tients 
progress slowly and gradually ove r many years, others have an 
accelerated decline often associat ed with episodes of acute res piratory 
worsening. The median survival time is 2 to 4 years from diagno sis and 
the 5-year survival rate ranges between 30% and 50%. Its mortal ity rate 
is higher than that of most cancers.  
The commonly accepted method of determining disease progression  is to 
identify a decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Functionally  stable 
patients show a FVC decline of a  maximum of 5% of the baseline value 
over 6 to 12 months. A decline in FVC of 5% to 10% indicates 
prognostically relevant progressi on, while a decline of ≥ 10% i n 
6 months is associated with a 4- to 8-fold increase in the risk  of death in 
the subsequent 12 months. Regul ar lung function checks to measu re FVC 
and diffusing capacity are recomm ended at intervals of 3 to 6 m onths.  
Acute exacerbations are an important aspect of clinical progres sion. 
These are defined by a subacute or acute increase in shortness of breath 
over a period of 30 days and a hi gh-resolution computed tomogra phy 
([HRCT] slice thickness ≤ 2.0 mm, no contrast media) showing ne w 
infiltration of the lungs with no identifiable cause. Acute exa cerbation 
frequency is 5% to 15% per year  and acute exacerbations are ass ociated 
with high mortality. After an acu te exacerbation of IPF, approx imately 
50% of patients die within 3 mont hs, and approximately 80% to 9 0% 
within 12 months. 
There is no cure for IPF and treatment options are limited. His torically, 
available pharmacological therapi es have had limited efficacy/a ctivity 
and potential serious side eff ects. However, recently both nint edanib and 
pirfenidone have been shown to slow decline in FVC in separate Phase 3

 clinical trials, and both received Food and Drug Administration  approval 
in October 2014.  
Study Rationale This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerabil ity, and 
activity of 400 mg of KD025 once-daily (QD) compared to best supportive care (BSC) in subjects with IPF.  
Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK) are members of the 
serine/threonine kinase family, oft en studied for their role in  cell 
morphology, motility, and shape through effects on the cytoskel eton. 
Two isoforms of ROCK have been  identified, ROCK1 and ROCK2. 
Early work with nonspecific ROCK inhibitors (eg, fasudil) sugge sted that 
both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are involve d in Rho-mediated changes in th e 
actin/myosin cytoskele tal network. However more recent research  has 
uncovered additional relevant rol es for ROCK signaling, particu larly 
ROCK2, in conditions including  IPF. Matrix stiffening and 
myofibroblast resistance to apopt osis are cardinal features of chronic 
fibrosis. The ROCK pathway, which is necessary for contraction and 
force generation in fibroblasts a nd for downstream actin polyme rization, 
may therefore be a molecular dr iver for the formation and progr ession of 
pulmonary fibrosis 
The possibility that pulmonary f ibrosis could be directly treat ed by 
inhibitors of ROCK has been investigated in mouse models. In a 
bleomycin-induced model of lung fibrosis, intratracheal (IT) 
administration of bleomycin in mice induces changes similar to those of 
diffuse pulmonary fibrosis or f ibrosing alveolitis in humans, m aking this 
a good model of pulmonary fibrosis for testing of new IPF thera pies. In 
particular, bleomycin causes increased deposition and net synth esis of 
collagen in the lungs. A study cond ucted in bleomycin-treated m ice, 
showed that fasudil reduced pulm onary fibrosis even when admini stered 
14 days after IT bleomycin when f ibrosis was presumably already  
present. Treatment with fasudil, an inhibitor of ROCK1 and ROCK 2, 
significantly reduced the levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin a nd 
collagen content of the lungs. Thi s study in bleomycin-treated mice also 
demonstrated that ROCK inhibitors  may be effective for treating  
pulmonary fibrosis through more than 1 mechanism. Fasudil block ed 
actin cytoskeletal reorganizati on, fibroblast acquisition of co ntractile 
activity, and megakaryoblastic l eukemia (translocation) 1 (MKL1) 
nuclear translocation, preventing the differentiation of fibrob lasts into 
matrix/collagen depositing myofibroblasts in vitro.  
Kadmon Corporation has interna lly evaluated the efficacy/activi ty of 
13 days of therapy with KD025 in  a bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
fibrosis model in mice. C57Bl/6 m ice were treated with KD025 or  
vehicle (0.4% carboxymethyl cellulose) beginning 8 days after I T 
KD025 
IND Number 128024 Protocol Number KD025-207
Amendment No. 9

 treatment with 2.25 U/kg of bleom ycin. At the initiation of tre atment, 
pulmonary fibrosis was already established. Unlike vehicle cont rol 
therapy, oral QD treatment with 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg of KD02 5 
significantly reduced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. 
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) have been found to be increased  in the 
lung and bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) fluid of patients with IP F. A 
matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) previously implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF, is significantly increased in plasma, seru m, BAL 
fluid, and lung tissue of IPF patients, suggesting that MMP7 ma y be a 
biomarker for IPF disease progression or mortality. The MMP7 le vels 
will therefore be studied in this clinical trial, in addition t o other potential 
future biomarkers for patient selection and pharmacodynamic res ponse; 
chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) and surfactant protein-D (SPD). 
Dose Rationale This study will evaluate KD025 at  a dose of 400 mg QD.  Prelimi nary 
data from an ongoing study of KD 025 in patients with moderate t o severe 
psoriasis suggests that the do se of 400 mg QD for 12 weeks is a ssociated 
with clinical efficacy/activity a nd is well tolerated. This stu dy will 
examine the safety and clinical  efficacy/activity of the 400 mg  QD dose 
in subjects with IPF as compared to BSC. 
The administration of this dose to subjects with IPF who have d isease 
progression after receiving both nintedanib and pirfenidone is supported 
by the data from a previous KD025 trial in subjects with psoria sis as well 
as by the clinical situation of s ubjects to be enrolled into th is study. The 
safety data from KD025 psoriasis study indicate that the dose o f 400 mg 
QD for 12 weeks was tolerable w ith an acceptable safety profile .  Finally, 
subjects with IPF who have disease progression after receiving both 
nintedanib and pirfenidone have a poor clinical prognosis, as p oor as 
some types of aggressive cancer. Thus the risk to benefit ratio  in these 
subjects favors the use of the 400 mg QD dose level which has 
demonstrated tolerability and clinical activity in previous cli nical studies.

Trial Design Phase 2, randomized (2:1), open-label, multicenter in subjects with IPF 
Methodology Approximately 81 eligible subject s will be enrolled and randomi zed to 
treatment with KD025 400 mg QD for 24 weeks (Treatment Group 1)  or 
BSC for 24 weeks (Treatment Group 2) in a 2:1 ratio (KD025 to B SC). 
Subjects in Treatment Group 1 who complete 24 weeks of treatmen t with 
KD025 400 mg QD will have the op tion of continuing therapy with  
KD025 400 mg QD up to an additiona l 72 weeks if there are no sa fety 
signals and if clinical progress continues.  No subject in Trea tment 
Group 1 will be permitted to recei ve therapy with KD025 greater  than a 
total of 96 weeks. 
Subjects in Treatment Group 2 who complete 24 weeks of BSC will  have 
the option of crossing over to therapy with KD025 400 mg QD for  up to 
96 weeks if there are no safety  signals and if clinical progres s continues.  
No subject in Treatment Group 2 will be permitted to receive KD 025 
400 mg QD therapy greater than 96 weeks. 
For subjects from Treatment Group 2 who switch to KD025, prior to 
receiving their first dose of KD025, Investigators should perfo rm the 
Week 1, Day 1 assessmen ts (except for safety labs [hematology a nd 
chemistry] if performed within 1 week of this visit and PFTs if

 performed within 4 weeks) and a ll subsequent visits as outlined  in Table 
1, Study Assessments.   
All subjects will receive the same assessments. 
Subjects will undergo medical history evaluations, physical exa minations 
(PEs), vital sign measurements, w eight measurements, adverse ev ent 
(AE) assessments, concomitant med ication and procedures assessm ents, 
blood sample collection for hema tology (including coagulation) and 
chemistry, urinalysis, thyroid function assessment (TSH), HRCT,  and 
electrocardiogram (ECG), as ou tlined in the Study Assessments t able 
(Table 1).  
Additionally, FVC, residual volume (RV), diffusing capacity of the lungs 
for carbon monoxide (DL CO), 6MWD, and MMP7, CCL18, and SPD 
serum levels will be measured. T he 6MWD, weight, heart rate, bl ood 
pressure, and pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO 2) will be recorded 
before and after the walk. 
Occurrence of acute exacerbati on (frequency and severity) of IP F will be 
assessed throughout the study.  
Follow-up visits will occur 30 days  (± 3 days) after the last d ose of 
KD025. (A Follow-up visit is not necessary for subjects receivi ng BSC.)  
Subjects will undergo the followi ng safety assessments: Complet e PEs, 
vital signs measurements, weight measurements, AE assessments, 
concomitant medication and proce dures assessments, blood sample  
collection for hematology (incl uding coagulation), chemistry an d thyroid 
function (TSH), PFTs, and urinalys is. If another therapy is sta rted within 
30 days after the last dose of study drug, the Follow-up visit will be 
conducted before the start  of the other therapy.

Subjects should take KD025 within 5 minutes of completing a mea l.   
Reference Therapy  Best supportive care (BSC) as deem ed appropriate by the Investi gator.  
Subjects randomized to BSC will undergo the same procedures and  
assessments as subjects on KD025.  
Concomitant Treatment 
 Subjects will be counseled to avoid non-prescribed medicines or  
complementary alternative medicines excluded by the study.  All  
medications and procedures a subject receives/undergoes from th e date 
that the ICF is signed until 30 days after last dose of study d rug will be 
documented.  
All subjects who receive KD025 therapy, that is, all subjects i n 
Treatment Group 1 and subjects in Treatment Group 2 who crossov er to 
KD025 therapy, are not to take d rugs that are sensitive substra tes of CYP 
enzymes from first dose until 14 d ays after last dose of study drug.  
Additionally, use of strong CYP3A4 inducers are prohibited.  Ot her 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should be used with caution.  Her bal 
medications (eg, St. John’s Wort) or grapefruit/grapefruit juic e should 
not be consumed 14 days prior to first dose of study drug until  the end of 
study treatment. 
Safety Evaluation The primary safety outcome will be the percent of subjects in e ach 
treatment group experiencing AEs. 
Safety assessments include AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), PEs, vital sign 
measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations, and ECGs.  Reaso ns for

 treatment discontinuation becau se of toxicity will be documente d.  Safety 
assessments will be performed at specified time points and befo re 
discharge from the clinic. 
The AE reporting period for a s ubject enrolled in the study beg ins when 
the subject signs the informed consent and is continued through  30 days 
after their last dose of study d rug.  All AEs that occur in enr olled subjects 
during the AE reporting period must be reported to the sponsor (Kadmon 
Corporation), regardless of the r elationship of the AE to study  drug.  Any 
known untoward event that occurs beyond the AE reporting period  that 
the Investigator assesses as at least possibly related to study  drug also 
should be reported to the sponsor. 
Subjects with ongoing AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolutio n or a 
new treatment for IPF is started. 
Vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory 
rate, and temperature will be m onitored throughout the study. 
Efficacy/Activity 
Evaluation Pulmonary function testing (PFT) will be performed at screening, 
baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, a nd at a 30-day Follow-up visit ( for 
subjects continuing, PFTs will be p erformed every 12 weeks). Pu lmonary 
function testing will include FVC, RV, and DL CO. The same equipment 
and tester should be used during the course of the study to the  extent 
possible.    The person responsib le for conducting the pulmonar y 
function tests will be required to  comply with the study guidel ines and 
the American Thoracic Society/Eu ropean Respiratory Society join t 
criteria on lung function testing. 
The 6MWD  will be assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks and 
24 weeks (for subjects continuing , 6MWD will be performed every  
12 weeks).  The distance traveled during 6 minutes (meters) wil l be 
measured in accordance with publis hed guidelines.  The total di stance 
ambulated in meters during the 6-minute walk test and the numbe r of rest 
stops is recorded.  The 6MWD, weight, heart rate, blood pressur e, and 
pulse oximeter oxygen saturation  (Sp0 2) are recorded before and after the 
walk. 
Occurrence of acute exacerbation  (frequency and severity) of IPF will 
be assessed throughout the study.  The following clinical deter ioration 
symptoms within a month that cannot be explained by other reaso ns will 
be assessed as acute exacerbation: 
1. Aggravated dyspnea; 
2. Newly discovered chest int erstitial lung abnormality by 
radiograph/HRCT, without pneumothorax or pleural effusion; 
KD025

 3. SpO 2 decreases to < 88% (heart fa ilure or pulmonary embolism 
excluded). 
Acute exacerbation can be diagno sed if Items 1 and 2 are presen t or if 
Items 1 and 3 are present.  Inf ection, pulmonary embolism, 
pneumothorax, or heart failure must be ruled out.   
The change in severity of lung fibrosis will be determined usin g 
measurements from quantitative HRCT. 
Time to progression of IPF  is defined as time from the Week 1, Day 1 
visit to any 1 of the following:  
1. First respiratory-related hospitalization. 
2. Respiratory-related death. 
3. Absolute decline in FVC percent of predicted value of ≥ 10% 
versus FVC percent of predicted  value recorded at baseline.   
4. Absolute decline in DLCO, adjus ted for hemoglobin, percent of 
predicted value  of ≥ 15% versus DL CO recorded at baseline.  
Pharmacodynamics Serum levels for MMP7, CCL18,  and SPD will be as sessed at baseline, 
12 weeks, and 24 weeks (For subjects continuing, biomarkers wil l be 
assessed at End of Week 36, End of Week 48 and EOT).  Serum MMP 7 
concentrations in peripheral bl ood are easily measureable and r eflect 
changes in the alveolar microe nvironment.  Thus, mean serum MMP 7 
concentrations after 24 weeks of KD025 treatment will be studie d as a 
potential surrogate biomarker of the effect of KD025 administra tion on 
disease progression.  
Statistical Analysis Study Populations 
Three populations will be employed in the analysis of study dat a: 
 The Safety Population will cons ist of all subjects who are 
randomized and receive at least 1 dose of KD025 (Treatment 
Group 1) or have week 1 assessme nt for BSC subjects. All safety  
analyses will be performed on the safety population 
 The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population will consist of 
all subjects in the safety popula tion who have evaluable baseli ne 
and at least 1 evaluable post baseline FVC assessment. Only 
evaluable FVC will be used in efficacy analyses. 
 The Per Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all subjects i n 
the safety population who have eva luable baseline and evaluable  
Week 24 FVC assessment. For any analysis on the per-protocol 
population, for patients assigned to treatment and actually

 received treatment, re-calculated baseline value should be used  
for cross over patients. 
Primary Endpoints 
 The primary efficacy/activity e ndpoint is the change in FVC 
from baseline to 24 weeks.  
 The primary safety endpoint is a subject experiencing one or 
more AEs during the treatment period.  
Secondary Endpoints: 
 The change in 6MWD from baseline to 24 weeks  
 Acute exacerbation of IPF throughout treatment with KD025  
 The change in severity of lung fibrosis as measured by 
quantitative HRCT at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment  
 To evaluate the percentage of subjects with  disease progressio n 
before or at 24 weeks 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
 The change in MMP7, CCL18, and SPD serum levels from 
baseline at 24 weeks. 
Data Presentations/Descriptive Statistics 
Demographics, subject disposition,  and baseline characteristics  will be 
summarized for the safety, m ITT and PP, where appropriate. 
The  primary analysis will be c onducted with a data cutoff of 
approximately 24 weeks after last patient enrolled has received  KD025 or 
when all subjects can be evaluated for primary endpoints. 
AEs will be coded using the MedD RA dictionary (Version 20.0 or 
greater.)  The number and percentages of subjects experiencing treatment-emergent AEs will be t abulated by System Organ Class and 
preferred term and will be pr esented by treatment group.  The n umber of 
events by preferred term will al so be summarized. Tabulation by  
maximum severity and relationshi p to KD025/BSC treatment will a lso be 
included by treatment group.  Summary subject listing will be p rovided 
for SAEs, AEs resulting in study discontinuation, and deaths.  All AEs 
(including SAEs) will be graded using a 5-point scale (mild, mo derate, 
severe, life threatening, or death; see Appendix B ).  
Adverse events, SAEs, related AEs , related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs,  
related ≥ Grade 3 AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal and treatm ent

 discontinuation will be summarized  according to treatment group ; SOC; 
and preferred terms.  AEs will also be presented in Listings.  Duration of 
AEs will be determined and included in listings, along with act ion taken 
and outcome. 
Laboratory results will be classified using the Toxicity Gradin g Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Trials (see Appendix A ) and summarized by treatment 
group.  Incidence of laboratory abnormalities will be summarize d by 
treatment group. The worst on-study grade during the treatment period 
after the first dose of KD025 w ill be summarized (or after Week  1, Day 1 
visit for BSC cohort). The incid ence of ≥ Grade 3 laboratory 
abnormalities under treatment and sh ifts in toxicity grading fr om baseline 
to highest grade post-base line will be displayed.  
Vital sign measurements and ECGs  will be summarized by treatmen t 
group at each scheduled time poi nt using descriptive statistics  and 
included in data listings.  
Sample Size  
With 54 subjects in the KD025 Treatment Group and 27 in the BSC  
Treatment Group, the study has over 90% power at the 2-sided 
0.05 significance level to detect a 20% difference between trea tment 
groups at 24 weeks in percent cha nge from baseline in FVC assum ing a 
standard deviation (SD) in percen t change from baseline in FVC of 17%. 
The sample size of 54 subjects receiving KD025 will provide ove r 
90% probability of 1 or more subjects in the study experiencing  an AE 
that has an underlying rate of ≥ 5%.

 4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IP F) is a chronic, progressive, irreversible, and often fatal lung disease 
of unknown cause. With a prevalence of 2 to 29 per 100,000 and an incidence of approximately 
10 per 100,000/year, IPF meets the criteria for classification as an orphan disease.1  It affects older 
adults with peak prevale nce around 65 years-of-age.1   
The natural history for patient s with IPF varies. While most pa tients progress slowly and gradually 
over many years, others have an accelerated decline often assoc iated with episodes of acute 
respiratory worsening.2,3,4,5  The median survival time is 2  to 4 years from diagnosis and t he 5-year 
survival rate ranges between 30% and 50%.1,4,6,7  Its mortality rate is higher than that of most cancers.  
The commonly accepted method of d etermining disease progression  is to identify a decline in forced 
vital capacity (FVC).  Functionall y stable patients show a FVC decline of a maximum of 5% of the 
baseline value over 6 to 12 months.1,7,8  A decline in FVC of 5% to 10%  in any subject indicates 
prognostically relevant progress ion, while a decline of ≥ 10% i n 6 months is associated with a 4-to 
8-fold increase in the risk of d eath in the subsequent 12 month s.8,9,10  Regular lung function checks to 
measure FVC and diffusing capaci ty are recommended at intervals  of at least 3 to 6 months.1,3 
Acute exacerbations are an import ant aspect of clinical progres sion. These are defined by a subacute 
or acute increase in shortness of breath over a period of 30 da ys and a high-resolution computed 
tomography ([HRCT] slice thickness  ≤ 2.0 mm, no contrast media)  showing new infiltration of the 
lungs with no identifiable cau se. Acute exacerbation frequency is 5% to 15% per year and acute 
exacerbations are associated with high mortality. After an acut e exacerbation of IPF, approximately 
50% of patients die within 3 mont hs, and approximately 80% to 9 0% within 12 months.1,3,4,6,7 
There is no cure for IPF and tr eatment options are limited. His torically, available pharmacological 
therapies have had limited efficacy/activity and potential seri ous side effects.  However, recently both 
nintedanib and pirfenidone have been shown to slow decline in F VC in separate Phase 3 clinical 
trials9,10 and both received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2014.  
4.1. Study Rationale 
This study is being conducted to  evaluate the safety, tolerabil ity, and activity of 400 mg of KD025 
orally administered once-daily ( QD) compared to best supportive  care (BSC) in subjects with IPF. 
Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK) are members of the serine /threonine kinase family, often 
studied for their role in cel l morphology, motility, and shape through effects on the cytoskeleton.11,12  
Two isoforms of ROCK have been i dentified, ROCK1 and ROCK2. Ear ly work with nonspecific

 ROCK inhibitors (eg, fasudil) sugg ested that both ROCK1 and ROC K2 are involved in 
Rho-mediated changes in  the actin/myosin cytoskeletal network.  However, more recent research has 
uncovered additional relevant rol es for ROCK signaling, particu larly ROCK2, in conditions 
including IPF.  Matrix stiffening and myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis are cardinal features of 
chronic fibrosis. The ROCK path way, which is necessary for cont raction and force generation in 
fibroblasts and for downstream actin polymerization, may theref ore be a molecular driver for in the 
formation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. 
The possibility that pulmonary f ibrosis could be directly treat ed by inhibitors of ROCK has been 
investigated in mouse models. I n a bleomycin-induced model of l ung fibrosis, intratracheal (IT) 
administration of bleomycin in mice induces changes similar to those of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis 
or fibrosing alveolitis in human s, making this a good model of pulmonary fibrosis for testing of new 
IPF therapies. In particular, bleomycin causes increased deposi tion and net synthesis of collagen in 
the lungs. A study conducted in bleomycin-treated mice, showed that fasudil reduced pulmonary 
fibrosis even when administered 14 days after IT bleomycin when  fibrosis was presumably already 
present.13  Treatment with fasudil, an inhi bitor of ROCK1 and ROCK2, sign ificantly reduced the 
levels of alpha-smooth muscle a ctin and collagen content of the  lungs.  This study in 
bleomycin-treated mice also dem onstrated that ROCK inhibitors m ay be effective for treating 
pulmonary fibrosis through more t han 1 mechanism. Fasudil block ed actin cytoskeletal 
reorganization, fibroblast acqui sition of contractile activity,  and megakaryoblastic leukemia 
(translocation) 1 MKL1 nuclear t ranslocation, preventing the di fferentiation of fibroblasts into 
matrix/collagen depositing myofibroblasts in vitro.  
Kadmon Corporation has internally  evaluated the efficacy/activi ty of 13 days of therapy with KD025 
in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary  fibrosis model in mice. C57Bl/ 6 mice were treated with KD025 
or vehicle (0.4% carboxymethyl cel lulose) beginning 8 days afte r IT treatment with 2.25 U/kg of 
bleomycin.  At the initiation of  treatment, pulmonary fibrosis was already established. Unlike vehicle 
control therapy, oral QD treatment with 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg  of KD025 significantly reduced 
pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation.  
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) have been found to be increased  in the lung and bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with IPF.  A matrix metalloprote inase-7 (MMP7) previously 
implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF,14,15 is significantly increased in  plasma, serum, BAL fluid, and 
lung tissue of IPF patients, sugge sting that MMP7 may be a biom arker for IPF disease progression or 
mortality.  The MMP7 levels will therefore be studied in this c linical trial, in addition to  other

4.2. Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human 
Subjects 
All the possible side effects r elated to KD025 are not known.  The KD025 Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) contains data on risks asso ciated with KD025.  Other risks  to subjects involve side effects from 
study procedures.  There  are also other risks associated with t aking part in this study, such as the 
risks associated with a loss of privacy or confidentiality beca use of improper disclosure.   
There may be no direct benefit to  subjects enrolled into this s tudy.  Subjects may receive a clinical 
benefit from KD025, and some subj ects may progress.  The inform ation from this study may help 
other subjects with IPF and mor e may be learned about the study  drug as a possible new treatment for 
IPF.   
4.3. Selection of Doses  in this Study  
This study will evaluate KD025 at  a dose of 400 mg QD.  Prelimi nary data from an ongoing study of 
KD025 in patients with moderate t o severe psoriasis suggests th at the dose of 400 mg QD for 
12 weeks is associated with clinical efficacy/activity and is w ell-tolerated.  This study will examine 
the safety and clinical efficac y/activity of the 400 mg QD dose  compared to BSC in patients with 
IPF.    
The administration of KD025 400 mg QD to subjects with IPF who have disease progression after 
receiving both nintedanib and pi rfenidone is supported by the d ata from a previous  KD025 trial in 
subjects with psoriasis as well as by the clinical situation of  subjects to be enrolled into this study.  
The safety data from KD025 psor iasis study indicate that the do se of 400 mg daily for 12 weeks was 
tolerable with an acceptable safety.  Finally, subjects with IP F who have disease  progression after 
receiving both nintedanib and pirfenidone have a poor clinical prognosis, as poor as some types of 
aggressive cancer.  Thus  the risk to benefit ratio in these sub jects favors the use of the 400 mg QD 
dose level which has demonstrated  tolerability and clinical act ivity in previous clinical studies. 
The IB includes additional noncli nical and clinical information  about KD025.  
4.4. Previous Clinical Experience with KD025 
To date, there have been 5 Pha se 1 trials conducted with KD025 in normal healthy subjects: a 
single-ascending dose (SAD) tr ial (Study 2119-09-01), a combine d single- and multiple-ascending 
dose (SAD/MAD) trial (Study KD025 -101), a MAD trial with QD and  BID dosing

 (Study KD025-102), a placebo-contro lled safety and pharmacokine tic (PK) study 
(Study KD025-103), and a food effe ct study (Study KD025-105).  A Phase 2a, open-label study in 
8 adult subjects with moderately severe psoriasis vulgaris who have failed first-line therapy was 
recently completed (Study KD025- 205).  Additionally, a Phase 2 open-label, safety, and tolerability 
study in subjects with psoriasis  vulgaris who have disease prog ression after 1 systemic therapy is 
currently on-going (Study KD025-206).  
The SAD trial (Study SLx-2119-09- 01) assessed the safety, toler ability, and PK of KD025.  The dose 
levels of KD025 that were tested included 20, 40, 80, and 160 m g.  Thirty-two subjects were 
randomized in 4 cohorts of 8 subj ects with 6 receiving drug and  2 receiving placebo.  No treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal, deaths, or serious adverse events (SAEs) 
were reported in this trial.  T here were 14 TEAEs reported, 9 o f which were determined by the 
Investigator to be related to study drug and were mild in sever ity.  One subject at the 160-mg KD025 
dose level experienced joint sw elling and arthralgia occurring after the follow-up visit.  No subject 
had laboratory abnormalities duri ng the dosing period or within  1 week after dosing.  There were no 
changes in blood pressure or he art rate and no clinically signi ficant QTcB or corrected QT interval 
using Fridericia’s formula (QTc[F]) parameters.  
KD025 was readily absorbed and wa s measured out to 24 hours in plasma.  KD025 was the main 
analyte (> 90% parent derived area under the curve  [AUC]) and KD025m2 was present at about 5%, 
with KD025m1 < 1%.  The half-life (t 1/2) of KD025 was approximately 5–6 hours, supporting 
once- or twice-daily dosing. 
A combined SAD/MAD (Study KD025-101)  trial assessed the safety,  tolerability, and PK of KD025 
in healthy males with single dos es followed by 1 week of rest a nd then 7 consecutive days of dosing.  
There were 8 cohorts with 8 subj ects in each cohort.  For each dosing cohort, 6 subjects received 
KD025 and 2 subjects received pla cebo.  The dose levels studied  were 40, 80, 120, 160, 240, 320, 
400, and 500 mg.  Few TEAEs were reported and of those reported , the majority were determined by 
the Investigator to be mild in severity.  There were no SAEs re ported during the study.  One subject 
(Subject No. 50008) was withdrawn because of a TEAE that was co nsidered not related to KD025 
(elevated blood creatinine phosphoki nase [CPK] levels of modera te intensity). 
No clinically relevant clinical c hemistry (apart from elevated CPK discussed above), hematology, 
coagulation, or urinalysis abnor malities were reported for any of the subjects.  No clinically 
significant abnormaliti es were reported for any vital signs (sy stolic or diastolic blood pressure, or

examination (PE) finding of concern. 
A MAD trial (Study KD025-102) was  a single-center, placebo-cont rolled, double-blind, randomized 
(6:2) study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025  administered for 7 days in up to 
32 healthy male and postmenopaus al female subjects.  This study  enrolled 4 cohorts with 8 subjects 
in each cohort (6 subjects rece ived KD025 and 2 subjects receiv ed placebo).  The dose regimens 
studied were 500, 800, and 1000 mg  administered QD, and 500 mg administered BID.  All 
32 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 31 subj ects completed the study; all 
24 subjects completed all doses  of study drug at 500 and 800 mg  QD, and 500 mg BID.  Seven of 
8 subjects completed all doses o f study drug at 1000 mg QD.  On e subject randomized to active study 
drug 1000 mg QD received 6 days of study drug before being disc ontinued because of a positive 
urine drug test.  
Multiple escalating doses of KD025 ranging from 500 mg to 800 m g to 1000 mg QD and 500 mg 
BID for 7 days were generally well tolerated and no dose-limiti ng toxicities were reported in this 
study.  Five TEAEs were reported in 4 subjects (16.7%) receivin g KD025, including upper 
abdominal pain and diarrhea in 1 subject receiving 500 mg QD, n ausea in 2 subjects receiving 
500 mg BID, and diarrhea in 1 subject receiving 1000 mg QD.  Th ere was 1 treatment-related AE of 
diarrhea in 1 subject (12.5%) re ceiving placebo.  There were no  TEAEs in subjects receiving KD025 
800 mg QD.  No subjects discontinue d study participation becaus e of AEs.  There were no clinically 
relevant changes and no clinical ly meaningful trends in hematol ogy, chemistry, a nd urinalysis 
laboratory results attributable to study drug during this study .  There were no SAEs or deaths. 
The following are PK conc lusions from this study: 
 KD025 was rapidly absorbed after  QD oral dose administration wi th median observed time to 
reach peak plasma concentration (T max) values ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 hours post-dose. 
 Median T max values after BID dosi ng were more variable and ranged from 4.0  hours after the 
first dose to 12.0 hours after the second dose. 
 Mean half-life (t 1/2) values were similar across dos e levels for each day, with val ues ranging 
from 4.55 to 5.76 hours for Day 1 and from 7.68 to 9.73 hours f or Day 7. 
 Mean KD025 maximum concentration observed (C max) and AUC 0-24hr values generally 
increased in a less than dose proportional manner  with the incr ease in QD dose level from 
500 to 1000 mg.

Study KD025-103 was a Phase 1, placebo-controlled study examini ng the safety, tolerability, and PK 
of 500 mg of KD025 administered B ID for 28 days in healthy male  and postmenopausal female 
subjects.  KD025 500 mg, administe red BID for up to 28 days was  generally well-tolerated.  A total 
of 6 AEs were reported in 4 of  the 6 subjects receiving KD025; there were no AEs reported in the 
2 subjects receiving placebo.  The  most common TEAEs were hepat ic enzyme elevation reported in 
3 of 6 (50%) subjects receiving KD025 (of which 2 were determin ed to be possibly related to 
KD025).  The AEs of increased liver  enzymes were Grades 1 or 2 in severity (1 was because of 
alcohol ingestion), and all reso lved within 15 days of disconti nuation with KD025.  Other AEs 
reported in subjects receiving KD 025 included nasopharyngitis i n 1 subject and upper abdominal 
pain (stomach cramping) in 1 s ubject.  All AEs, except nasophar yngitis, were considered at least 
possibly related to study drug.  A ll AEs were mild in intensity , except for the alanine

  A high fat meal given 30 minutes  prior to KD025 oral administra tion had a significant effect 
on the PK of KD025.  
 Plasma systemic exposure (C max and AUCs) of KD025 was approximately 3–fold higher 
under the fed state co mpared with the fasted state, and the med ian T max value was delayed by 
2 hours with food. 
 Similar food effects were obser ved for metabolites KD025m1 and KD025m2 as for the parent 
drug.  
 The high fat meal increased  systemic exposure (mean C max and AUC 0-t values) by 
approximately 1.7- to 2.3-fold f or metabolite KD025m1 and appro ximately 3.1- to 4.4-fold

Recently completed, Study KD025- 205 was a Phase 2a, open-label study in 8 adult subjects with 
moderately severe psoriasis vulga ris who had failed first-line therapy.  The study evaluated the safety 
and tolerability of 200 mg KD025 daily for 28 days.  Efficacy a nd activity measures included the 
evaluation of any decreases in Ps oriasis Area and Severity Inde x in at least 50% of the subjects after 
4 weeks of dosing with 200 mg of KD025 and improvement in the P hysicians Global Assessment for 
psoriasis.  Cytokine levels and expression associated with psor iasis were evaluated in 
pharmacodynamic whole blood sample s and punch biopsies of selec ted lesions, respectively, 
collected at baseline and at t he end of treatment.  Eight subje cts began treatment with KD025.  Five 
SAEs were reported in this study and all 5 occurred in the same  subject:  Subject 001-008 
experienced Grade 2 vomiting (2 e vents), Grade 2 nausea (2 even ts), Grade 3 ana stomotic ulcer 
(related to the subject’s previous  gastric bypass surgery), and  Grade 3 kidney stones, none of which 
were assessed to be related to  study drug (she w as subsequently  discontinued after 20 days of 
dosing).  Another subject experien ced reversible Grade 1 elevat ed ALT and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) on Day 22 with no known etiology and per manently discontinued treatment 
with KD025.  The ALT/AST returned to normal levels 13 days afte r the last dose of KD025.  No 
other TEAEs or SAEs were reported. 
Follow-up for efficacy and activit y measures in this study has completed.  The following PK 
conclusions can be made for this study: 
 KD025 was rapidly absorbed after  oral dose administration with median T max values of 2.0 
hours and 4.0 hours post-dose on Da ys 1 and 28, respectively. 
 Mean t 1/2 for KD025 was 6.08 hours and 5.27 hours on Days 1 and 28, resp ectively.

  Two metabolites (KD025m1 and KD0 25m2) rapidly appeared in plasm a and were readily 
eliminated.  No accumulation of either metabolite was apparent after multiple doses.  
Exposure of daily dosing of KD025 at 200 mg for 28 days was com parable to or slightly lower than 
that observed in study KD025-101, f or daily dosing at similar d ose levels. 
Study KD025-206 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, safety and t olerability study of KD025 in 
subjects with psoriasis vulgaris  who have disease progression a fter at least 1 systemic therapy.  The 
primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of  3 daily dosing regimens (200 mg BID, 
400 mg QD, and 400 mg BID) of KD02 5 in subjects with psoriasis vulgaris who have progressed 
despite first-line therapy.  To d ate, preliminary safety data a re available on 10 subjects who received 
KD025 at a dose of 200 mg BID, a nd 10 subjects who received KD0 25 at a dose of 400 mg QD.  All 
subjects had normal ALT and AST values during screening.  Four subjects (3 subjects receiving 
200 mg BID and 1 subject receiving 400 mg QD) had TEAEs of elev ation of ALT or AST.  Bilirubin 
levels remained normal, and all A LT or AST increases were asymp tomatic and reversible.  The ALT 
and AST elevations first occurre d from study Day 16 to study Da y 36.  The ALT/AST elevations 
were mild or moderate in intens ity, except in 1 subject who had  severe (Grade 3) ALT elevation to a 
maximum of 377 U/L.  KD025 admini stration was discontinued in 3  subjects, and ALT and AST 
levels decreased.  One subject, w ho was receiving KD025 400 mg QD, had peak ALT of 121 U/L 
and AST of 127 U/L which then ret urned to the normal range desp ite continuing to receive KD025 
400 mg QD.  The data from these subjects suggest that increases  in ALT and AST are modest and 
may be reversible despite the continuation of KD025.  
4.5. KD025 Nonclinical Toxicology  
To date, Good Laboratory Practice  compliant general toxicology/ toxicokinetic studies of acute, 
subchronic (1 and 3 month), and chronic (6-month rat and 9-mont h dog) duration have been 
completed in rats and dogs.  In a ddition, safety pharmacology s tudies have been completed 
evaluating central nervous syste m (rat), respiratory (rat), and  cardiovascular (dog) function.  
Furthermore, KD025 is not consid ered genotoxic or mutagenic bas ed on a panel of studies.  Fertility 
(rat [segment 1] and Reproductive  toxicology studies (rat and r abbit embryo-fetal [segment 2]) are 
completed.  
Study details and potential clinic ally-relevant findings from t hese studies are summarized in the IB.

 6. STUDY DESIGN 
6.1. Study Sites 
This study will be conducted at a pproximately 10-15 sites in th e United States. 
6.2. Study Endpoints 
For Study Endpoints, refer to Section 5 .  Further details on the statis tical and analytical plan for t hese 
endpoints are available in Section 14 , Statistical Considerations. 
6.3. Overview of Study Design 
Approximately 81 eligible subject s will be enrolled and randomi zed to treatment with KD025 
400 mg QD for 24 weeks (Treatment  Group 1) or BSC for 24 weeks (Treatment Group 2) in a 2:1 
ratio (KD025 to BSC). 
Subjects in Treatment Group 1 who complete 24 weeks of treatmen t with KD025 400 mg QD will 
have the option of continuing therapy with KD025 400 mg QD up t o an additional 72 weeks if there 
are no safety signals and if clin ical progress continues.  No s ubject in Treatment Group 1 will be 
permitted to receive  therapy with KD025 greater than a total of  96 weeks. 
Subjects in Treatment Group 2 who complete 24 weeks of BSC will  have the option of crossing over 
to therapy with KD025 400 mg QD for up to 96 weeks if there are  no safety signals and if clinical 
progress continues.  No subject in  Treatment Group 2 will be pe rmitted to receive KD025 400 mg 
QD therapy greater  than 96 weeks. 
All subjects will receive the same assessments. Subjects will undergo medical hi story evaluations, physical exa minations (PEs); vital sign 
measurements; collection of weight; adverse event (AE) assessme nts; concomitant medication and 
procedures assessments; blood sa mple collection for hematology (including coagulat ion), chemistry, 
and thyroid function (TSH); uri nalysis; HRCT; and ECG as outlin ed in the Study Events (Table 1). 
Additionally, FVC, residual volum e (RV), diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide 
(DL
CO), and MMP7, CCL18, and SPD serum levels will be measured as ou tlined in the Study Events 
(Table 1).  For the 6MWD, weight , heart rate, blood pressure, a nd pulse oximeter oxygen saturation 
(SPO 2) will be recorded before and after the walk. 
The occurrence of acute exacerb ation (frequency and severity) o f IPF will be asse ssed throughout the 
study.

 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
8.1. Overview 
The timing for these study assessments is presented in Table 1 , while a listing of clinical laboratory 
parameters to be measured in presented in Table 2.   
8.2. Procedures to be Performed 
All screening assessments ar e to be performed within 29 days  before the Week 1, Day visit, unless 
otherwise specified. 
Study Day 1 is defined as the da te the subject takes the first dose of study drug ( or the Week 1, Day 1 
visit for the BSC treatment group) , with subsequent study days numbe red sequentially thereafter.  
If significant changes from baselin e are noted during the course of the study, additional unscheduled 
clinic visits may be undertaken by the Investigato r, or requested by the sponsor, in order to 
determine both the relevance of the findi ng(s) and the duration of the event(s). 
Informed Consent 
All subjects must take part in the informed consent process.  A dequate time must be allowed for the 
subject to ask questions and ma ke a voluntary decision.  No pro tocol-specific procedures, including 
screening procedures are to be p erformed until the subject has signed and dated an 
IRB/IEC-approved ICF.   
Demographics and Medical History 
A complete medical history will be taken.  Information to be do cumented includes demographic 
information, prior medical ill nesses and conditi ons, surgical p rocedures, and smoking history.  
Medical history should include exacerbation of IPF, such as pre sence of dyspnea, chest interstitial 
lung abnormalities, or SpO 2 <88%), within 6 months prior to screening visit. 
IPF history should include: 
 When diagnosis was made  
 Previous treatments with dates a nd reasons for discontinuation 
 History of PFTs for at least 1 year prior to enrollment 
Physical Examination  Complete PEs will be performed.  All PEs will include assessmen t of cardiac (including heart rate, 
vital sign, and CPK measurements), musculoskeletal (ie, muscle aches) and neurological (ie, gait)

 body systems. A complete PE is to  include documentation of heig ht (screening onl y), weight, body 
temperature, and vital signs ( blood pressure [sitting], pulse r ate [sitting], and respiratory rate) and 
will be performed by a physicia n or staff member who is qualifi ed to perform such examinations (eg, 
physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner).     
Any abnormal or clinically signi ficant findings from the PE mus t be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case repor t form (eCRF) page.   
Vital Sign Measurements Vital sign measurements will be c ollected after the subject has  been sitting for 5 minutes.  Vital sign 
assessments will include measure ments of sitting blood pressure  (mm Hg), heart rate (beats per 
minute), respiration rate (breath s per minute), and temperature  (Celsius). 
Please note that blood pressure m easurements are to be performe d using appropriate technique (per 
guidelines of the American Heart Association).  Specifically, s ubjects should be sea ted quietly for at 
least 5 minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their fe et flat on floor (legs uncrossed), and their 
arms bared on a hard surface, w ith the arm slightly abducted an d bent, with palm up and the midpoint 
of upper arm at heart level.  Co rrect cuff and bladder size sho uld be utilized.  Two or more readings 
separated by 1 to 2 minutes shoul d be averaged.  If the first 2  readings differ by more than 5 mm Hg, 
an additional 2 readings should be obtained and averaged.  Reco rd cuff size, arm used, and subject’s 
position (if not seated). 
Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory samples (hematology, c hemistry, and urinalysis) are to be collected as outlined in 
Section 8.9 . Coagulation parameter assessme nts are to include measurements  of PT, PTT, and INR.  
Thyroid function assessments are  to include measurements of TSH  
Safety laboratory analyses will be performed. Laboratory results will be classi fied using the Toxicity Gradin g Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers E nrolled in Preventiv e Vaccine Clinical T rials (see Appendix C ).  
If significant increases in live r enzymes (ALT, A ST, and biliru bin) are observed at any time, study 
drug may be held for that subject at the discretion of the Inve stigator.  Refer to Section 12.4   
additional information and recommended procedures.

 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms will be perfo rmed with the subject in a supi ne position having rested in this 
position for at least 5 minut es before each reading. See Section 8.10  for additional ECG procedure 
information and Table 1  for timing allowances.  At the Week 1 Day 1 and End of Week 4 v isits, an 
ECG is to be performed predos e and 4 hours post-dose (T max) in subjects receiving KD025. 
Blood Sampling for Pharmacodynamics  
All subjects will have serum blood samples drawn for MMP7, CCL1 8, and SPD at baseline, end of 
Week 12, and end of Week 24.  
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
The St George’s Respiratory Ques tionnaire (SGRQ) is a standardi zed self-completed  questionnaire to 
measure and quantify health-rela ted health status in subjects w ith impaired health and perceived 
well-being (‘quality of life’); see Appendix E .  The SGRQ will be administered prior to all other 
scheduled procedures. Subjects will complete the SGRQ at Weeks 1, 12, 24, and continuation visits 
end of Week 28 and end of Week 48 (and every 12 weeks thereafte r).  
The St George’s Respiratory Que stionnaire is a standardized sel f-completed questionnaire for 
measuring impaired health and pe rceived well-bei ng (‘quality of  life’) in airways disease.21  It has 
been designed to allow comparati ve measurements of health betwe en patient populations and 
quantify changes in health following therapy.  
KD025 Administration Subjects in Treatment Group 1 wi ll receive their first dose of study drug in the clinic on Week 1, 
Day 1, and then study drug will b e dispensed for home administr ation.  These subjects also will take 
their dose of study drug at the cl inic at the End of Week 4 vis it. 
Subjects in Treatment Group 1 wi ll receive 400 mg KD025 QD for 24 weeks. Subjects should take 
two 200-mg tablets within 5 mi nutes of completing a meal.   
Subjects may continue to receive  therapy with KD025 as long as there is no safety signal and clinical 
progress continues.   
See Section 12.1  for dosing schedule and Section 12.2 for missed doses.   
Best Supportive Care

 Subjects who switch to KD025 may receive 24 weeks of dosing wit h KD025, with the potential to 
continue as long as there is no safety signal and clinical prog ress continues.  For subjects who switch, 
prior to their first dose of K D025, Investigators should perfor m the Week 1, Day 1 assessments 
(except for safety labs [hematol ogy and chemistry] if performed  within 1 week of this visit and PFTs 
if performed within 4 weeks) and all subsequent visits as outli ned Table 1 .   
Study Drug Diary 
Subjects will be supplied study dr ug diaries in which they are to record the amount, date and time of 
each dose of study drug.  In add ition, subjects are to bring th eir diary to each study visit. 
Prior and Concomitant Medi cations and Procedures 
All concomitant medications and procedures will be collected fr om time the subject signs the ICF 
until 30 days after last dose of KD025.  For BSC subjects, conc omitant medications and procedures 
will be recorded through the end of Week 24 visit.   
Adverse Event Assessments 
Information regarding the occurr ence of AEs will be collected f rom the time the sub ject signs the ICF 
throughout their participation in  the study, including a period  of 30 days after last dose of KD025. 
For BSC subjects, AE informatio n will be recorded through the e nd of Week 24 visit. Subjects with 
ongoing AE/SAE(s) will be followed until resolution of the AE/S AE(s) or until a new treatment for 
IPF is started.  
Note :   Adverse events resulting in a subject’s permanent discontinu ation from the 
study, regardless of seriousness  or relationship to study drug,  MUST  be 
promptly reported to the sponsor.

 8.10. Electrocardiogram Assessments 
Digital 12-lead ECGs will be obtained during the study (see Tab le 1 for timing of ECG assessments).  
Note that at the Week 1 Day 1 and End of Week 4 visits, an ECG is to be performed predose and 4 
hours post-dose (T max) for subjects in Treatment Group 1. 
Digital 12-lead ECG recordings a re to be made with the subject in a supine position having rested in 
this position for at least 5 mi nutes before each reading.  The ECG is to be  repeated 3 times 
consecutively within 30 minutes (m ust have an interval of at le ast 1–2 minutes between ECGs).  At 
each visit, the ECG is to be perfo rmed immediately before any b lood sample collection. 
The following ECG parameters wil l be collected:  PR interval, Q RS interval, and QTc or QTc(F); 
Fridericia’s correction (see Appendix D  for formula).  The ECG fi ndings will be evaluated by a 
qualified physician for the pre sence of abnormalities (qualitat ive assessment).  The physician will 
assess each ECG as normal, abnor mal/not clinically significant,  or abnormal/clini cally significant.   
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead  to a change in subject manag ement (eg, dose reduction or delay, 
requirement for additional medic ation or monitoring) or result in clinical signs a nd symptoms are 
considered clinically significan t for the purposes of this stud y and will be recorded in the AE eCRF.  
If ECG abnormalities meet crite ria defining them as serious, th ey must be reported as an SAE (see 
Section 13.1 ). 
8.11. Pulmonary Function Tests (i ncluding FVC, RV, and DLCO) 
Pulmonary function testing will b e performed during the study ( see Table 1  for timing of 
assessments). Pulmonary function testing will include FVC, RV, and DL CO. The same equipment and 
tester should be used during the course of the study. For each subject, PFT shoul d be done at 
approximately the same time of the day. The test will be conduc ted while the subject is in a seated 
position and will be done in triplicate.  
8.12. 6-Minute Walking Distance 
The 6MWD will be measured duri ng the study (see Table 1 for tim ing of assessment).  The distance 
travelled during 6 minutes (meter s) will be measured in accorda nce with published guidelines.  The 
total distance ambulated in meters  during the 6MWD test and the  number of rest stops is recorded. 
The 6MWD, weight, heart rate, blo od pressure, and Sp02 will be recorded before and after the walk.

 8.13. High Resolution Computed Tomography 
The change in severity of lung fi brosis as measured by Quantita tive HRCT during the study (see 
Table 1  for timing of assessment) wil l be read via a central reader.  Optimal HRCT technique for 
evaluation is listed in Table 3  below .  
Table 3: Clinical Optimal HRCT Technique for Evaluation of Inte rstitial Lung Disease17 
The scans should be without cont rast and include at a minimum: 
 
1. Scans obtained on full inspiration without respiratory motion 
2. Contiguous or noncontiguous axial s cans with thin sections, rec onstructed at ≤ 2 cm 
intervals 
3. Reconstructed slice collimation ≤ 2 mm 
4. High-resolution reconstruction algorithm 
5. Field of view to i nclude lungs only 
6. Expiratory scans are helpful to  exclude lobular air trapping su ggestive of hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis 
7. Prone scans if dependent density obscures detail on supine imag es 
8. Optional coronal and sagittal re constructions if volumetric ima ges are obtained 
8.14. Occurrence of Acute Exacerbation  
Occurrence of acute exacerbation (frequency and severity) of IP F will be assessed throughout 
treatment (see Table 1  for timing of assessment).  The  following clinical deteriorati on symptoms 
within a month that cannot be e xplained by other reasons will b e assessed as acute exacerbation. 
1. Aggravated dyspnea; 
2. Newly discovered chest  interstitial lung abnormality by radiogr aph/HRCT, without 
pneumothorax or pleural effusion; 
3. SpO 2 decreases to < 88% (heart failu re or pulmonary embolism exclud ed). 
Acute exacerbation can be diagnosed if items 1 and 2 are presen t or if items 1 and 3 are present. Per 
the 2011 IPF Diagnosis Manag ement and Guidelines,1 criteria for acute ex acerbations should include 
an absence of an alternative exp lanation such as infection, pul monary embolism, pneumothorax, or 
heart failure.

The MMP7, CCL18, and SPD serum lev els will be assessed during t he study (see Table 1  for 
sampling times).  Serum MMP7 conc entrations in peripheral blood  are easily measurable and reflect 
changes in the alveolar microenvironment.  Thus, mean serum MMP 7 concentrations after 24 weeks 
of KD025 treatment will be studi ed as a potential surrogate bio marker of the effect of KD025 
administration on disease progression.  
Detailed instructions for sample collection and preparation wil l be provided in a  separate manual.

 11. REMOVING SUBJECTS FROM STUDY 
Every reasonable effort will be m ade to keep the subject in the  study; however, in the event that a 
subject is withdrawn from the st udy, every effort will be made by the Investigator to complete and 
report the reasons for withdraw al as thoroughly as possible.  T his evaluation should include final 
observations, as required by the protocol at the time of the su bject’s withdrawal.  T he reason(s) for 
termination must be clearly doc umented on the appropriate eCRF.   A termination eCRF page must be 
completed for any subject w ho is enrolled in the study.  
11.1. Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdr aw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice 
to their future medical care by the physician or at the institu tion.  
Subjects can decline to continue r eceiving study drug and/or ot her protocol-required therapies or 
procedures at any time during the study.  If this occurs, the I nvestigator is to discuss with the subject 
the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug o r other protocol-required therapies 
and must discuss with the subject  the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and AEs.   
Withdrawal of consent for a stu dy means that the subject does n ot wish to receive further 
protocol-required therapies or p rocedures, and the subject does  not wish to or is unable to continue 
further study participation.  Subj ect data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis 
of the study, and where permitte d, publically available data ca n be included after withdrawal of 
consent.  The Investigator is to d iscuss with the subject appro priate procedures for  withdrawal from 
the study.   
11.1.1  Treatment Discontinuation   
Treatment discontinuation reaso ns include any of the following:  
 An AE requires permanent discontinuation of study drug or BSC 
 Investigator decision 
 Voluntary withdrawal by subject 
 Noncompliance to protocol 
 Subject lost to follow-up 
 Termination of the study by sponsor 
 Subject death 
 Disease progression

 11.1.2  Study Termination 
Reasons for study termination include:  
 Completion of Follow-up Period 
 Voluntary withdrawal by subject 
 Subject lost to follow-up 
 Termination of the study by sponsor 
 Subject death 
In the event of premature disc ontinuation, every effort should be made to have the subject come to 
the clinic for an End of Treatme nt visit in order for the Inves tigator to perform study follow-up 
procedures.  Refer to Table 1 , Study Assessments for a complet e list of procedures to be per formed at 
the End of Treatment visit.    
Subjects who are withdrawn from this study because of toxicity are to be followed until there is 
either: 
 Resolution or stabilization of toxicity 
 The subject is lost to follow-up 
 The event is otherwise explained 
If there is an ongoing toxicity because of KD025, subjects must  be followed with appropriate medical 
management until resolution or stabilization. 
A reasonable effort should be made  to contact any subject lost to follow-up during the course of the 
study in order to complete assess ments and retrieve any outstan ding data.  If the subjects are 
unreachable by telephone after 3 a ttempts, a certi fied register ed return receipt letter should be sent 
requesting that contact be made with the Investigator to report  survival information. 
Once a subject discontinues from the study for any reason, ever y effort will be made to collect all 
clinical and laboratory data as scheduled for the follow-up. 
11.2. Stopping Rules 
Stopping criteria will be assesse d using the Clinical Symptom A dverse Event Grading scale (see 
Appendix B) and will include clin ically significant changes wit h respect to blood pressure, dyspepsia, 
nausea or vomiting, or other TEA Es that are Grade 2 (moderate) or higher.   
11.2.1  Adverse Events Stopping Criteria

meeting stopping criteria should be repeated once, to confirm t he measurement.  The repeat 
measurement will be used to determine whether the subject meets  the stopping criteria. 
Clinically significant blood pr essure decreases will be defined  as follows: 
 An absolute systolic blood press ure < 85 mm Hg at any time poin t, or a decrease > 30 mm 
Hg in systolic blood pressure fro m baseline with accompanying s ymptoms of hypotension 
at any time point, or an asympto matic decrease > 30 mm Hg from baseline on any 
2 consecutive time points; or 
 An absolute diastolic blood pressure < 45 mm Hg at any time poi nt, or a decrease 
> 20 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure from baseline with accom panying symptoms of 
hypotension at any time point, or an asymptomatic decrease > 20  mm Hg in diastolic 
blood pressure from baseline on 2 consecutive time points. 
Clinically significant blood pre ssure increases are defined as:  
 An absolute systolic blood pre ssure > 180 mm Hg at any time poi nt, or an increase 
> 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pres sure from baseline with accomp anying symptoms 
of hypertension at any time point , or an asymptomatic increase > 30 mm Hg from baseline 
on any 2 consecutive time points; or 
 An absolute diastolic blood pressure > 110 mm Hg at any time po int, or an increase

Assessments.   
12.1.3  Continuation of KD025 Dosing  
Subjects in Treatment Group 1 ma y receive additional therapy wi th KD025 as long as there is no 
safety signal and clinical progress continues.    
No subject will receive more than 96 weeks of study drug treatm ent in this study. 
12.2. Missed Doses 
Subjects should make every effort to take the study drug at the  same scheduled time daily.  In the 
event that the subject misses th e planned dose of study drug, t he following protocol should be 
followed: 
 If less than 12 hours of time have  elapsed after the scheduled dose, the drug should be 
taken.  The subject should then resume the regular planned dail y dosing schedule the 
following day. 
 If more than 12 hours of time have elapsed after the scheduled dose, the drug should be 
skipped for that day.  The subject  should then resume the regul ar planned dosing schedule 
the following day. 
If the subject skips more than 7  consecutive days of drug, the subject should be discontinued from the 
study. 
12.3. Dose Reduction for KD025 
Every effort should be made to keep the subject on the full dos e of drug.  However, in the event that 
the Investigator feels that an AE requires dose modification, t he drug may be decreased as shown in 
Table 4  and Table 5.  Once a subject has their dose decreased, an incre ase back to 400 mg QD is not 
allowed. 
Table 4: Dose Reductions for T oxicity Related to Study Drug 
Study Drug Starting Dose Dose Reduction 
KD025 400 mg KD025 QD 200 mg QD 
No more than 1 dose reduction is permitted.  Subjects who requi re more than 1 dose reduction will 
have study drug discontinued and enter the Follow-up Period.  L iver function test risk management is 
treated separately; see Section 12.4 , below.

12.4. Evaluation of Liver-Related Blood Tests 
If ALT or AST > 2.0 × ULN subject should remain on study drug w ith close observation  which 
includes: 
1. Immediately contacting the medical monitor. 
2. Repeating liver enzyme, serum bi lirubin, and PT/INR once a week .  
(Frequency of retesting can decr ease if abnormalities stabilize  or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic.)  
3.  Obtaining a more detailed histor y of symptoms and prior or con current diseases.  
4.  Obtaining a history of concomit ant drug use (including nonpres cription medications and 
herbal and dietary supplement pr eparations), alcohol use, recre ational drug use, and special 
diets.  
5. Ruling out acute viral hepatitis  types A, B, C; autoimmune or a lcoholic hepatitis; nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic h epatopathy; and biliary trac t disease.  
6. Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agent s.  
If close observation is not possi ble, the subject should be dis continued from the study at the 
Investigators discretion.

 Subjects with ALT or AST > 3 × ULN, who do not have clinically significant elevations of 
liver-related blood tests as des cribed below, should have KD025  administration halted for 2 to 
3 weeks with weekly evaluation of ALT and AST.  If ALT and AST return to normal within 3 weeks, 
then KD025 can be restarted at a lower dose.  If ALT and AST do  not return to normal within 
3 weeks, then KD025 administrati on should be terminated (Table 6). 
Clinically significant elevati ons of liver-related blood tests as defined below require immediate drug 
termination. 
1. ALT or AST > 5 × ULN  
2. ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and total b ilirubin > 2 ×ULN or INR > 1.5  
3. ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the a ppearance of fatigue, nausea, vo miting, right upper

  Lot Number identification  
 Bottle number 
 Name of protocol sponsor 
 The statement, “Caution: New Dru g – Limited by Federal Law to I nvestigational Use.”  
 The statement, “Keep out of the reach of children and pets.”  
12.7. Dispensing of Study Drug and Dosing Compliance 
Subjects will be dispensed study drug to self-administer while on an outpatient basi s.  Subjects will 
return to the clinic as outlin ed in the Study Assessments table  (Table 1 ), and will receive that day’s 
dose of study drug while at the clinic. 
The amount of study drug dispensed to the subject at the beginn ing of each dosing month should be 
sufficient to allow for 1 month of dosing with KD025. 
The Investigator (or designee)  will be responsible for recordin g this information on the appropriate 
study drug inventory.  This inventory will be maintained throug hout the duration of  the trial and will 
be periodically reviewed by a representative of the sponsor. 
The Investigator (or designee) w ill instruct the subject that a ll dispensed bottles must be returned at 
each follow-up visit, at which time a capsule or tablet count w ill be conducted to assure subject 
dosing compliance. 
Additionally, subjects will be r equired to keep study drug diar ies in which they will record the 
amount, date and time of study drug administrations.  These dia ries will be dispensed and/or 
reviewed/collected at each visit. 
12.8. Study Drug Storage 
All supplies of study drug are t o be stored at USP controlled r oom temperature of 25°C (77°F) with 
excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).  At  the clinic, the s tudy drugs are to 
be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized p ersons only, until needed for dosing. 
12.9. Study Drug Accountability 
The US FDA and other regulatory agencies require accounting for  the disposition of all 
investigational drugs received by each clinical site.  Informat ion on drug disposition required by law 
consists of the date received, d ate administered, quantity admi nistered, and the subject to whom the 
drug was administered.  The prin cipal Investigator is responsib le for the accounting for all unused

 study drugs and all used study dr ug containers.  The Investigat or must maintain a complete and 
current dispensing and inventor y record that has been supplied by the sponsor. 
12.10.  Study Drug Handli ng and Disposal 
At the termination of t he study, a final drug accountability re view and reconciliation must be 
completed and any discrepancies must be investigated and their resolution documented. 
12.10.1  Disposition of Used Supplies 
At the completion of a  subject’s participa tion in the trial, al l partially used and empty pill bottles 
must be returned to the Investig ator (or designee) so that a fi nal subject-dosing inventory may be 
conducted.  This information will  be recorded on the Drug Dispe nsing Log.  
12.10.2  Inventory of Unused Supplies 
Periodically throughout and at the  conclusion of the study, an inventory of unused  bottles of study 
drug will be conducted by a rep resentative of the sponsor.

 13. CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ON AND PROCEDURES 
If the subject must use a concom itant medication or concomitant  procedures during the study, it is the 
responsibility of the Investigator  to ensure that details regar ding the medication or procedures are 
recorded on the eCRF. 
A reasonable effort is to be ma de to document any medications o r procedures the subject receives 
from the date that the ICF is si gned until 30 days after last d ose of KD025.  For BSC subjects, 
concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded through  the End-of-Week 24 visit.  
The concomitant medication names will be coded by the sponsor a ccording to the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD) and classified by anatomi cal therapeutic chemical 
categories. 
13.1. Prohibited Medications for Subjects Receiving KD025 
All subjects who receive KD025 t herapy, that is, all subjects i n Treatment Group 1 and subjects in 
Treatment Group 2 who crossover to KD025 therapy are not to tak e drugs that are sensitive 
substrates of CYP enzymes from fi rst dose until 14 days after l ast dose of study drug.  Additionally, 
use of strong CYP3A4 inducers ar e prohibited.  Other CYP3A4 inh ibitors or inducers should be used 
with caution.  Herbal medications  (eg, St. John’s Wort) or grap efruit/grapefruit juice should not be 
consumed 14 days prior to first dose of study drug until the en d of treatment.  Please refer to 
Appendix F  for drugs that induce and inhibit CYP3A4 and Appendix G  for drug that induce and 
inhibit CYP1A2. 
 
SAFETY Safety Parameters 
The Clinical Symptom and Adverse Event Grading Scale will be us ed for grading toxicities (see 
Appendix B).  Laboratory results will be classified using the T oxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers E nrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (see Appendix A ).  
Subjects will be monitored thr oughout the treatment and follow- up period for occurrence of AEs 
(acute, delayed, and/or cumulativ e), as well as for changes in clinical status, vital sign measurements, 
and laboratory data.  Safety para meters to be mea sured/assessed  include vital sign measurements, PE 
findings, hematology, serum chemi stries, coagulation, and urina lysis results, and ECG recordings. 
Adverse Event Definition 
KD025 
IND Number 128024 Protocol Number KD025-207
Amendment No. 9 
 
   
Kadmon Corporation Page 72 of 112  
Confidential and Proprietary 03 March 2020 
 An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinic al trial subject associated with the 
use of a drug, whether or not c onsidered drug related.  An AE c an be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory value finding), a symptom, or a disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without judgment as to causality.  An AE can  arise from use of the drug (eg, use in 
combination with another drug) a nd from any route of administra tion, formulation or dose, including 
an overdose.  An AE also includes, but is not limited to, any c linically significant worsening of a 
pre-existing condition.  Examples include: 
 Any sign, symptom, phy sical finding, or laboratory result that has worsened in nature, 
severity or frequency compared to baseline; 
 Reactions from an investigationa l drug, including those occurri ng as a result of an 
overdose, abuse of the study drug , withdrawal phenomena, sensit ivity or toxicity; 
 Concurrent illness that was not p resent or worsens in nature, s everity, or frequency 
compared to baseline;  
 Injury or accident; and/or 
 Exacerbation of a pre-existing condition 
For the purpose of data collectio n, all untoward events that oc cur after informed consent through 
30 days after last dose of KD025 are to be recorded on eCRFs by  the investigationa l site.   For BSC 
subjects, AEs will be recorded t hrough the End-of-Week 24 visit . 
Evaluating Adverse Events 
The Investigator will determin e the seriousness, intensity, and  causality of an AE associated with the 
use of the study drug (i e, events where there is a reasonable p ossibility that the event may have been 
caused by the study drug) based on the definitions that follow.  
Serious Adverse Events (Notify sponsor or designee wi thin 24 hours; document on eCRF) 
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance  with Title 21 Part  Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and the Guidance for Industry and Inve stigators Safety Reporting 
Requirements for Investigationa l New Drug (INDs) and Bioavailab ility /Bioequivalence Studies. 
SAE:  An AE is considered "seriou s" if, in the view of either t he Investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
Death:   This includes any death that occurs while the subject is “on study” as well as any death that 
occurs within 30 days after  study drug administration.  
KD025 
IND Number 128024 Protocol Number KD025-207
Amendment No. 9 
 
   
Kadmon Corporation Page 73 of 112  
Confidential and Proprietary 03 March 2020 
 Note : Death is an outcome of an AE , and not an AE in itself.  The e vent(s) that caused death (eg, 
illness, accident) is the SAE.  D eath due to any other cause(s)  must also be reported as an outcome of 
the reportable SAE. 
Life-threatening adverse event:   An AE or suspected advers e reaction is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the vi ew of either the Investigator o r sponsor, its occurrence places the patient 
or subject at immediate risk of d eath. It does not include an A E or suspected adve rse reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death.   
Inpatient hospitalization or pro longation of existing hospitali zation: 
In the absence of an AE, the Investigator should not report hos pitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization.  This is the cas e in the following situations:  
 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed fo r a procedure required by 
the protocol 
 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of r outine procedure followed by 
study center 
 Hospitalization for survey  visits or annual physicals 
In addition, a hospitalization pl anned before the start of the study for a pre-exis ting condition which 
has not worsened does not count as an SAE.  
Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical event:   An event that may not result in death, be life threatening, o r require 
hospitalization may be considered  serious when, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the subject and may re quire medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.   
Suspected Unexpected Serious  Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
(Notify sponsor or designee with in 24 hours of first awareness) 
A suspected unexpected serious a dverse reaction is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity 
of which is not consistent with those noted in the current prot ocol and/or IB.  This refers to any AE 
that has not been previously obs erved (eg, included in the Inve stigator Brochure), rather than from 
the perspective of such an event  not being anticipated from the  pharmacological properties of the 
product.

 Unexpected Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee by the next business day) 
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed;  or, if an IB is not required o r available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the Gen eral Investigational Plan or el sewhere in the current application. 
Also refers to AEs that are ment ioned in the IB as occurring wi th a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological propertie s of the drug, but are not sp ecifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation. 
Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All other AEs, not fulfilling th e previous definitions, are cla ssified as nonserious. 
Protocol-Related Adverse Events 
AEs that are not study drug relate d may nevertheless be conside red by the Investigator or the medical 
monitor to be related to the c onduct of the clinical study.  Th at is, the event may b e related to the fact 
that a subject is participating in the study.  For example, a p rotocol-related AE may be an event that 
occurs during a washout period or  that is related to a procedur e required by the protocol. 
Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will attempt to  assess the relationship of the  event to study drug using a 5-point 
scale (not related, unlikely-rela ted, possibly related, probabl y related, or definitely related; see 
Appendix C). 
Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the A dverse Event page of the subject’s 
eCRF during the subjec t’s participation in the study.  The seve rity of each AE will be graded using a 
5-point scale (mild, moderate, sever e, life threatening, or dea th; see Appendix B).  The date of onset 
as well as the end date of the e vent also should be recorded or  the event should be entered as 
“ongoing”.  In addition, the method used to treat the AE and th e outcome of the AE also will be 
noted.  The Investigator will asse ss the relationship of the ev ent to study drug.  Note:  All SAEs also 
are to be entered onto an SAE form and sent to sponsor or desig nee.    
Hospitalization 
In the absence of an AE, the Investigator should not report hos pitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization.  This is the cas e in the following situations:  
KD025 
IND Number 128024 Protocol Number KD025-207
Amendment No. 9 
 
   
Kadmon Corporation Page 75 of 112

 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed fo r a procedure required by the protocol. 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of r outine procedure followed by study 
center. 
Hospitalization for survey visits or annual physicals 
In addition, a hospitalization pl anned before the start of the study for a pre-existing condition that has 
not worsened does not count as an SAE. 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Governing Regulatory Requirements 
Compliance with this request for prompt reporting is essential in that the sponsor is responsible for 
informing the US FDA as well as all other participating Investi gators of the event.  
Under FDA ruling (US Code of Fe deral Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the Guidance for 
Industry and Investigators Safety  Reporting Requirements for IN Ds and BA/BE Studies, the sponsor 
is required to submit written doc umentation, in the form of an IND safety report, detailing: 
Any event associated with the use of the drug, that is both ser ious and unexpected, or  
any findings from clinical, epi demiological, or pooled analysis  of multiple studies or any findings 
from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk  in humans exposed to the drug.  
Written submission must be made b y the sponsor to the FDA and t he IRBs as soon as possible and in 
no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initia l notification of the event.  Any 
unexpected death or life-threatening suspected adverse drug rea ction must be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after  the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information . The sponsor shall also 
inform all Investigators. 
13.1.1.1.  Time-Frame for Reporting 
Any death, SAE, pregnancy (incl uding pregnancy of a partner), o r unexpected (and severe) AE 
experienced by a subject while receiving or within 30 days of r eceiving study drug, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, or a ny death that occurs more than 30 days after recei ving study drug, and 
is believed to be study drug-rela ted, must be promptly reported  (within 24 hours of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the event) by e -mail to the sponsor (or desig nee).

13.1.1.2.  Information to be Provided by the Investigator 
SAEs for all enrolled subjects mu st be recorded on both the SAE  form and the AE eCRF page 
(during study participation).  Thi s requirement includes all SA Es that occur after informed consent 
and through 30 days after last dos e of study drug, and in addit ion, any SAEs that are assessed as 
possibly related to study drug by the Investigator, even if the  SAE occurs more than 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug must be reported to the Kadmon Corporat ion Pharmacovigila nce Department 
or designee. 
The minimum information required for SAE reporting includes ide ntity of Investigator, site number, 
subject number, an event descript ion, SAE term(s), onset date, the reason why the event is considered 
to be serious (ie, the seriousness criteria) and the Investigat or’s assessment of the  relationship of the 
event to study drug.  Additional SAE information including medi cations or other therapeutic 
measures used to treat the event , action taken with the study d rug due to the event, and the 
outcome/resolution of the event w ill be recorded on the SAE for m.  Forms for reporting SAE will be 
provided to the study sites. 
In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the c linical situation and report all material 
facts relating to the progressi on or outcome of the SAE.  Furth ermore, the Investigator may be 
required to provide supp lementary information as requested by t he Kadmon Corporation Drug Safety 
personnel or designee. 
When reporting SAE, the followi ng additional points should be n oted: 
 When the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the Investi gator should report the 
diagnosis or syndrome as the prima ry SAE term, rather than as s igns or symptoms.  Signs 
KD025 
IND Number 128024 Protocol Number KD025-207
Amendment No. 9 
 
   
Kadmon Corporation Page 77 of 112  
Confidential and Proprietary 03 March 2020 
 and symptoms may then be describ ed in the event description.  F or example, dyspnea 
should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which caused  the dyspnea is known to 
be malignant pleural effusion.   
 Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown.  In the exceptional case where the events leading to 
death are unknown, then death ma y be used as an event term.  If  an autopsy was 
performed, the autopsy report should be provided.  
 While most hospitalizations nece ssitate reporting of an SAE, so me hospitalizations do not 
require SAE reporting, as follows:  
o Elective or previously scheduled  surgery (eg, a previously sche duled ventral 
hernia repair) 
o Procedures for pre-existing cond itions that have not worsened a fter initiation of 
treatment 
o Pre-specified study hospita lizations for observation 
o Events that result in hospital st ays of less than 24 hours and that do not require 
admission (eg, an emergency room  visit for hematuria that resul ts in a diagnosis of 
cystitis and discharge to h ome on oral antibiotics) 
 SAEs must, however, be reported fo r any surgical or procedural complication resulting in 
prolongation of the hospitalization. 
13.1.1.3.  Regulatory Reporting 
Kadmon Corporation Drug Safety ( or designee) will process and e valuate all SAEs as soon as the 
reports are received.  For each S AE received, Kadmon Corporatio n will make a determination as to 
whether the criteria for exped ited reporting have been met. 
Kadmon Corporation (or designee)  will submit SAEs that meet the  criteria for expedited reporting to 
the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local regulations  governing safety reporting.  
Reporting of SAEs by the Investig ator to his or her IRB will be  done in accordance with the standard 
operating procedures and policie s of the IRB.  Adequate documen tation must be maintained showing 
that the IRB was properly notified. 
13.2. Other Safety Considerations 
13.2.1  Laboratory Data 
All laboratory data obtained dur ing the course of the study sho uld be reviewed.  Any abnormal value 
that leads to a change in subjec t management (eg, dose reductio n or delay, requirement for additional 
medication or monitoring) or is c onsidered to be of clinical si gnificance by the Investigator should be

 reported as an AE and/or SAE as appropriate, unless this value is consistent with the subject’s present 
disease state or is consistent w ith values obtained before entr y into the study. 
Laboratory results will be classi fied using the Toxicity Gradin g Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers E nrolled in Preventiv e Vaccine Clinical T rials (see Appendix A). 
13.2.2  Medication Errors 
Any medication error that results  in an AE, even if it does not  meet the definition of serious, requires 
reporting within 24 hours to the safety monitor. 
13.2.3  Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
Any SAE or AE assessed as possibl y related that led to treatmen t discontinuation (including 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory values that meet the se criteria) and is ongoing 30 days after 
last dose of study drug must be followed until either resolutio n of the event or determination by the 
Investigator that the event has become stable or irreversible.  This follow-up guidance also applies to 
possibly related SAEs that occur more than 30 days after last dose  of study drug.  The status of all 
other continuing AEs will be docu mented as of 30 days after las t dose of study drug.

 14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical analyses wi ll be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, Cary, Nor th Carolina) statistical 
software Version 9.3 or highe r, unless otherwise noted.   
The primary  analysis will be conducted with a data cutoff of a pproximately 24 weeks after last 
patient enrolled has received K D025 or when all subjects can be  evaluated for primary endpoints.  
Ongoing monitoring of safety data  will be conducted in accordan ce with study stopping rules. 
14.1. General Design  
All data for randomized subjects w ill be presented in data list ings by subject number.  For those 
summary tables in which baseline  and change from baseline measu rements will be presented, the last 
observed measurement prior to t he initial dose of KD025 will be  considered the baseline 
measurement.   
Continuous data will be described  using descriptive statistics:  number of observations (n), mean, 
standard deviation, median, min imum and maximum.  Frequencies a nd percentages will be used for 
summarizing discrete (categori cal) data.  When categorical data  are presented, the percent will be 
suppressed when the co unt is zero in order to draw attention to  the nonzero counts.  The denominator 
for all percentages, unless otherwise specified, will be the nu mber of subjects in the specified 
analysis population.   
Hypothesis testing, if appropria te, will be carried out at the 5% (2-sided) significance level.  Because 
of the exploratory nature of the  study, no adjustments will be made for the multiplicity of endpoints.  
Nonparametric tests may be used i n preference to parametric tes ts if parametric assumptions are 
notably violated.  Missing values will not be imputed.  If a su bject does not have sufficient data for a 
particular analysis, they will b e excluded from that analysis.  Endpoints defined as an average of 
multiple measurements will be use d those data points that are n on-missing, and the denominator was 
adjusted accordingly. 
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
With 54 subjects in the KD025 Treatment Group and 27 in the BSC  Treatment Group, the study has 
over 90% power at the two-sided 0.05 significance level to dete ct a 20% difference between 
treatment groups at 24 weeks in p ercent change from baseline in  FVC assuming a standard deviation 
in percent change from baseline in FVC of 17%. 
The sample size of 54 subjects receiving KD025 will provide ove r 90% probability of 1 or more 
subjects in the study experienci ng an AE that has an underlying  rate of ≥ 5%.

 14.3. Statistical Considerations  
The statistical methodology will b e further described in a Stat istical Analysis Plan which will be 
finalized prior to database lock. 
14.3.1  Study Populations  
Three populations will be employed in the analysis of study dat a: 
 The Safety Population will cons ist of all subjects who are rand omized and receive at least 
1 dose of KD025 (Treatment Group  1) or have Week 1 assessment f or BSC subjects. All 
safety analyses will be performed on the safety population 
 The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population will consist of all subjects in the Safety 
Population who have evaluable bas eline and at least one evaluab le post baseline FVC 
assessment. Only evaluable FVC will be used in efficacy. 
 The Per Protocol (PP) Populati on will consist of all subjects i n the safety population who 
have evaluable baseline and evaluable Week 24 FVC assessment. F or any analysis on the PP 
Population, for subjects assigned to treatment and actually rec eived treatment, re-calculated 
baseline value should be use d for cross over patients. 
The primary and secondary efficac y/activity endpoints will be a nalyzed using both the mITT and PP 
Populations.  
14.3.2  Subject Accountability , Demographics, and Bas eline Characterist ics  
Demographics, subject dispositi on, and screening and baseline c haracteristics will be summarized for 
the mITT Population, where appropriate.    
14.3.3  KD025 Exposure  
For the KD025 Treatment Group, t he amount of KD025 administered  by visit and overall will be 
tabulated and presented by subjec t in data listings.  In additi on, delays and all other alterations in 
KD025 administration will be presented.  
14.3.4  Concomitant Medicati ons and Procedures 
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary  and the data will be 
summarized by treatment group and presented in tables and listi ngs. Concomitant procedures 
performed during the study will also be collected and presented  in listings.

 14.4. Activity/Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy/activity e ndpoint is the change in FVC fro m baseline to 24 weeks. A mixed 
model (if numeric stable) or anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) mo del will be used for the between 
treatment groups comparison of t he Week 24 change from baseline  in FVC with treatment group as a 
fixed effect and baselin e FVC as a covariate.  
The primary safety endpoint is a subject experiencing one or mo re AEs during the treatment period.  
The percentage of subjects experi encing an AE will be summarize d for the KD025 and BSC 
treatment groups (descriptive st atistics only). Primary safety analyses will be performed on the safety 
population.    
Secondary Endpoints  
 The change in 6MWD from baseline to 24 weeks  
 Acute exacerbation of IPF thr oughout the treatment period  
 The change in occurrence, frequ ency and severity of lung fibros is as measured by 
quantitative HRCT at baseline a nd after 24 weeks of treatment  
 To evaluate the percentage of subjects with disease progression  before or at 24 weeks 
Treatment group differences in t he Week 24 change from baseline  to 24 weeks in 6MWD and 
Week 24 change from baseline in severity of lung fibrosis as me asured by quantitative HRCT will be 
analyzed by a mixed or ANCOVA m odel with treatment group as a f ixed effect and the 
corresponding baseline value as a covariate.   
The percentage of subjects in e ach treatment group who experien ce acute exacerbation of IPF 
throughout the treatment period wi ll be compared by a Fisher’s Exact test.  
Exploratory Endpoints 
 The change in MMP7, CCL18 and SPD  serum levels from baseline to  24 weeks  
For each of these exploratory endpoints, a mixed or ANCOVA mode l will be used to assess treatment 
differences with treatment as a fi xed effect and the correspond ing baseline value as a covariate. 
14.5. Safety Data  
Safety assessments include AEs, S AEs, PEs, vital s ign measureme nts, clinical laboratory evaluations, 
ECGs, and reasons for t reatment discontinuation due to toxicity .  
AEs will be coded using the MedD RA dictionary (Version 20.0 or greater.)  The number and 
percentages of subject s experiencing treatment-emergent AEs wil l be tabulated by SOC and preferred 
term and will be presented by treatment group.  The number of e vents by preferred term will also be

 summarized. Tabulation by maximu m severity and relationship to KD025 will also be included by 
treatment group.  Summary subject  listing will be provided for SAEs, AEs resulting in study 
discontinuation and de aths.  All AEs (including SAEs will be gr aded using a 5-point scale (mild, 
moderate, severe, life threaten ing, or death; see Appendix B).  
AEs, SAEs, related AEs, related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, related ≥ Grade 3 AEs, and AEs leading to 
withdrawal and treatment discon tinuation will be summarized acc ording to treatment group, SOC, 
and preferred terms.  AEs will also be presented in listings.  Duration of AEs will be determined and 
included in listings, along with  action taken and outcome. 
Laboratory results will be classi fied using the Toxicity Gradin g Scale for Healthy Adult and 
summarized by treatment group.  Incidence of laboratory abnorma lities will be summarized by 
treatment group. The worst on-study grade after the first dose of study drug will be summarized (or 
after Week 1, Day 1 visit for BSC cohort). The incidence of ≥ G rade 3 laboratory abnormalities 
under treatment and shifts in to xicity grading from baseline to  highest grade post-baseline will be 
displayed.  
Vital sign measurements and EC Gs will be summarized by treatmen t group at each scheduled time 
point using descriptive statis tics and included in data listing s.

 16. ETHICAL ASPECTS 
16.1. Local Regulations 
The study must fully adhere to t he principles outlined in “Guid eline for Good Clinical Practice” ICH 
E6 Tripartite Guideline (Janua ry 1997), and in general, be cond ucted in a manner consistent with the 
most recent version of the Decla ration of Helsinki.  The Invest igator will ensure that the conduct of 
the study complies with the basic  principles of GCP as outlined  in the current version of 21 CFR, 
subpart D, Part 312, “Responsibiliti es of Sponsors and Investig ators”, Part 50, “Protection of Human 
Subjects”, and Part 56, “Instituti onal Review Boards” or applic able local equivalent. 
16.2. Informed Consent 
Sample ICFs will be supplied to each site.  Kadmon Corporation or its designee must review any ICF 
prior to submission for review by the IRB.  The final IRB-appro ved document must be provided to 
Kadmon Corporation for regulatory purposes. 
It is the responsibility of the  Investigator, or a person desig nated by the Investiga tor, to obtain written 
informed consent from each subject  (or the subject’s legally au thorized representative) participating 
in this study after adequate e xplanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benef its, and potential 
hazards of the study in accordanc e with federal and state regul ations.  In the case where the subject is 
unable to read, an impartial witn ess should be present during t he entire informed consent discussion.  
After the subject has orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ si gnature on the form 
will attest that the information in the consent form was accura tely explained and understood.  A copy 
of the ICF must be provided to t he subject or to the subject’s legally authorized representative.  If 
applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of t he local language. 
The eCRF for this study contains  a section for documenting info rmed subject consent, and this must 
be completed appropria tely.  Signed ICFs mus t remain in each su bject’s study file and must be 
available for verification by study monitors at any time.  If n ew safety information results in changes 
in the risk/benefit assessment,  the consent form should be revi ewed and updated as necessary.  All 
subjects (including those alread y being treated) should be info rmed of the new information, should be 
given a copy of the revised for m, and should give their consent  to continue in the study. 
16.3. Institutional Review Board 
This study is being conducted unde r a United States IND applica tion.  This protocol (and any 
modifications) and appropriate c onsent procedures must be revie wed and approved by an IRB.  This 
board must operate in accordance w ith the current federal or lo cal regulations.  The Investigator will

 send a letter or certificate of I RB approval to Kadmon Corporat ion (or designee) before subject 
enrollment and whenever subseque nt modifications to the protoco l are made. 
16.4. Future Use of Subject Samples 
Not all of the tissue and blood components obtained during this  study may be required for the tests 
that are part of the clinical t rial.  Following the conclusion of the study, the samples may be used for 
additional research.  This resear ch will help to understand dis ease subtypes, drug response and 
toxicity, and possibly identify new drug targets or biomarkers that predict subject response to 
treatment.  The use o f the samples for in ternal research will b e done according to the guidelines 
defined by the FDA guidance for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Stud ies Using Leftover Human 
Specimens that are Not Individual Identifiable (issued 25 April  25 2006) and the European Medicines 
Agency Reflection Paper on Phar macogenetic Sampl es, Testing and  Data Handling 
(EMEA/CHMP/PGxWP/201914/2006).  If a subject requests destructi on of their tissue and blood 
samples and the samples have not  yet been de-identified, Kadmon  Corporation will destroy the 
samples as described in this FDA  guidance.  Kadmon Corporation will notify the Investigator in 
writing that the samples have b een destroyed. Samples will be h eld no longer than 10 years from time 
of collection.  No genomic r esearch will be conducted.

 19. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, CR FS, AND RECORD KEEPING 
19.1. Investigator’s Files and Retention of Documents 
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to  enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the stu dy data to be subsequently verif ied.  These documents should be 
classified into 2 separate cate gories as follows: (1) Investiga tor’s study files; and (2) subject clinical 
source documents. 
The Investigator’s study file wil l contain the protocol and pro tocol amendments, eCRFs, query 
forms, IRB, and governmental appr oval with correspondence, samp le informed consent, drug 
records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and ot her appropriate documents and 
correspondence. 
Subject clinical source documents (usually predefined by the pr oject to record key efficacy/activity 
and safety parameters independen t of the eCRFs) may include sub ject hospital/clinic records, 
physician’s and nurse’s notes, a ppointment book, original labor atory reports, ECG, 
electroencephalogram, X-ray, pat hology and special assessment r eports, signed ICFs, consultant 
letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs.  The Invest igator must keep these 2 categories of 
documents on file for at least 2 years following the marketing application approval date for the study 
drug and for the indication being investigated or for 2 years a fter the investigation is discontinued 
and the FDA notified.  After that  period of time, the documents  may be destroyed subject to local 
regulations with prior written permission from Kadmon Corporati on.  If the Investigator wants to 
assign the study records to anothe r party or move them to anoth er location, Kadmon Corporation 
must be notified in advance. 
If the Investigator cannot guara ntee the archiving requirement at the study site for  any or all of the 
documents, special arrangements must be made between the Invest igator and Kadmon Corporation.  
When source documents are require d for the continued care of th e subject, appropriate copies should 
be made for storing outside of the study site. 
19.2. Source Documents and Background Data 
Upon request, the Investigator wi ll supply Kadmon Corporation w ith any required background data 
from the study documentation or clinic records.  In case of spe cial problems or governmental queries 
or requests for audit inspections , it is also necessary to have  access to the complete study records, 
provided that subject confidentiality is protected.

 19.3. Audits and Inspections 
The Investigator should understa nd that source documents for th is study should be made available to 
appropriately qualified personnel  from the Kadmon Corporation Q uality Assurance Unit (or 
designee), or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification.  The verification of the 
eCRF data must be by direct ins pection of source documents. 
19.4. Electronic Case Report Forms 
Clinical trial data for this s tudy will be captured on eCRF.  T he Investigator agrees to provide all 
information requested on the eC RF in an accurate manner accordi ng to instructions provided.  
Electronic CRFs are designed for computer processing and analys is.  The Investigat or should ensure 
the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported  to Kadmon Corporation (or designee) 
in the eCRF and in all  required reports. 
An eCRF is required to be submitt ed for every subject who recei ves any amount of study drug.  This 
includes submission of retrievable  data on subjects who withdra w before completi on of the study.  
eCRFs must be reviewed for completeness and accuracy, and elect ronically signed where indicated, 
by the Principal Investigator or authorized delegate from the s tudy staff.  If a subject stops treatment 
or terminates from the study, the  dates and reasons must be not ed on the eCRF.

 20. MONITORING THE STUDY 
It is understood that the responsib le Kadmon Corporation monito r (or designee) will contact and visit 
the Investigator regularly and wi ll be allowed on request to in spect the various records of the trial 
(eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confiden tiality is maintained in accordance 
with local requirements. 
It will be the monitor’ s responsibility to i nspect the eCRFs at  regular intervals t hroughout the study, 
to verify the adherence to the p rotocol and the completeness, c onsistency, and accuracy of the data 
being entered on them.  The mon itor should have access to labor atory test reports and other subject 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The Investig ator (or designee) must agree to 
cooperate with the monitor to ens ure that any problems detected  in the course of these monitoring 
visits are resolved.

 21. CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL D OCUMENTS AND SUBJECT 
RECORDS 
The Investigator must ensure tha t subjects’ anonymity will be m aintained and that their identities are 
protected from unauthorized part ies.  On eCRFs or other documen ts submitted to Kadmon 
Corporation, subjects should be identified by an identification  number and not by their names.  The 
subjects’ personal information s hould be redacted on all source  documents prior to submission to 
Kadmon Corporation. The Investig ator should keep  a subject enro llment log showing subject 
numbers, names, and addresses.  The  Investigator should maintai n documents not f or submission to 
Kadmon Corporation (eg, subjects’ written consent forms) in str ict confidence.

parameters.  Institutional normal reference ranges should be pr ovided to demonstrate that they are appropriate. 
** The clinical signs or symptoms associated with laboratory ab normalities might result in characterization of the 
laboratory abnormalities  as Potentially Life Threatening (Grade  4). For example, a low sodium value that falls 
within a Grade 3 parameter (125-129 mEq/L) should be recorded a s a Grade 4 hyponatremia event if the 
subject had a new seizure associated with the low sodium value.

 APPENDIX C: CLINICAL ADV ERSE EVENTS: DETERMINING 
RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY DRUG 
 
1 NOT RELATED 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are c learly felt to be 
due to extraneous causes (eg, disease, environment, etc.) that are unrelated to the  administration of 
study drug. 
 
2 UNLIKELY RELATED  (must have first 2) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are f elt unlikely to be 
related to the adminis tration of the study  drug.  The relations hip of an AE to the study drug can be 
considered unlikely if: 
 
 It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administ ration of the drug. 
 It could readily have been a re sult of the subject’s clinical s tate, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy adm inistered to the subject. 
 It does not follow a known response pattern to the suspected dr ug. 
 It does not reappear or worsen w hen the drug is re-administered . 
 
3 POSSIBLY RELATED  (must have first 2) 
 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are f elt unlikely to be 
related to the administration of the study drug, but the possib ility cannot be ruled o ut with certainty.  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered p ossible if: 
 
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the drug. 
 It could readily have been a re sult of the subject’s clinical s tate, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy adm inistered to the subject. 
 It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
 
4 PROBABLY RELATED  (must have first 3) 
 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are felt with a high degree 
of certainty to be related to th e administration of the study d rug.  The relationship of an AE to the study 
drug can be considered probable if: 
 
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the drug.  
 It could not be reasonably expla ined by the known characteristi cs of the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy admini stered to the subject. 
 It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction in dose.* 
 It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
 
5 DEFINITELY RELATED  (must have first 3) 
 
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medica l consideration, are f elt to be related to 
the administration of the study drug.  The relationship of an A E to the study drug can be considered 
related if: 
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the drug or drug levels have been 
established in body fluids or tissues. 
 It could not be reasonably expla ined by the known characteristi cs of the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy admini stered to the subject.

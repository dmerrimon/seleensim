Study design
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to 
evaluate efficacy and safety of a fixed 300 mg dose of tralokinumab administered subcutaneously in subjects with uncontrolled asthma on inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β
2-agonist and having a history of asthma exacerbations.
Approximately 1140 subjects will be randomized globally.  Subjects will be stratified at 
randomization by serum periostin level (<16.44 ng/mL or ≥16.44 ng/mL) sampled during run-
in, geographical region, and age group (adults versus adolescents). 
Subjects will receive either of the following regimens of tralokinumab, or placebo, 
administered via subcutaneous injection to subjects at the study site, over a 52-week treatment 
period:
!Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, every 2 weeks or,
!Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, every 4 weeks
After initial enrolment and confirmation of entry criteria, subjects will proceed to a run-in 
period of 4 to 6 weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility criteria to be evaluated. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to a 52-week treatment period.

acting β2-agonist and any additional asthma controller medication, without change, from 
enrolment throughout the run-in and treatment period.
Follow-up visits will be conducted at Weeks 56 and 72. The extended follow-up period is to 
ensure that adequate determination of immunogenicity can be determined.
Objectives
Primary Objective: Outcome Measures:
To evaluate the effect of tralokinumab 300 
mg administered every 2 weeks compared with placebo on the annualised asthma exacerbation rate in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma that is inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β
2-agonistPrimary outcome variable: The annualised 
asthma exacerbation rate up to Week 52    
Primary outcome measure: Asthma 
exacerbation rate reduction
An asthma exacerbation is defined by a 
worsening of asthma requiring:
• Use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 
days; a single depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids
• An emergency room or urgent care visit 
(defined as evaluation and treatment for <24 hours in an emergency room or urgent care center) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids (as per the above)
• An inpatient hospitalization due to asthma 
(defined as an admission to an inpatient facility and/or evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥24 hours)

Target subject population
Male and female adults and adolescents, 12-75 years of age inclusive, with asthma 
inadequately controlled by treatment with inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonist.
Duration of treatment
Following an initial enrolment at Week -4 to -6, subjects will enter a 4 to 6-week run-in period 
which will be followed by a 52-week treatment period.  The first dose of tralokinumab/placebo will be administered at Week 0. For subjects receiving the bi-weekly 
treatment regimen, subsequent doses will be administered every 2 weeks up until Week 50 
(for a total of 26 doses) with an end of treatment visit occurring at Week 52.  For subjects receiving the treatment regimen every 4 weeks, subsequent doses will be administered every 4 
weeks up until Week 48 (for a total of 13 doses) with an end of treatment visit occurring at 
Week 52. For both dosing regimen, investigational product (IP) cannot be administered within 7 days from the last dosing visit. Post-treatment safety follow up visits will be performed at 
Weeks 56 and 72.

Date 
9(127)Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration
Tralokinumab 300 mg (150 mg/mL), or placebo, will be administered to subjects via 
subcutaneous injection using 2 pre-filled syringes at the study site.
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of the efficacy endpoints will include all data captured during the double 
blind treatment period. The statistical analyses will compare both dosing regimens of tralokinumab to placebo. Efficacy and safety comparisons of tralokinumab versus placebo will 
be done using the pooled placebo cohorts, if not otherwise specified.
A hierarchical testing strategy will be applied for the confirmatory testing of primary and key 
secondary endpoints in the two dosing regimens to allow for control of type I error. 
The primary efficacy objective will be evaluated trough the null hypothesis test H
0: rate ratio 
(tralokinumab/placebo) equals 1 vs. H 1: rate ration not equals 1. The test will be based on a 
negative binomial model. Covariates and factors included in the model will include at least treatment group and stratifying variables. 
Key secondary outcome variables will be analyzed using a repeated measures analysis 
approach including at least treatment and stratifying variables as the explanatory variables. 
A total of 1,140 subjects (380 per treatment group) are considered sufficient to show a 
reduction in annualised asthma exacerbation rate for tralokinumab compared to placebo in the 
overall study population.  
The sample size calculations are based on an assumed annual exacerbation rate in the placebo 
group of 0.8 and shape parameter of 0.95 (over-dispersion). The methodology used is 
described in Keene et al 2007 . A power of at least 90% using a two-sided test at 5% 
significance level is required for the primary objective.
Assuming a uniform loss to follow-up of 15% during the study, 1,140 randomized subjects are 
expected to provide approximately 350 subject years at risk per treatment group. This is expected to provide at least 90% power for showing superiority with effects of down to 32% 
asthma exacerbation reduction rate in the all-comer population.
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively.  The safety analyses will be based on the 
safety analysis data set, defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product
.

1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Asthma is a syndrome characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction 
and airway hyperresponsiveness, with a global prevalence of approximately 300 million 
patients ( GINA 2012 ). 
Approximately 5% to 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, many of whom may be 
inadequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) 
in combination with additional controller therapies ( Bateman et al 2010 ). These patients are at 
risk of asthma exacerbations, have a large medical need, and represent the greatest economic burden ( Accordini et al 2006 ).
The observed variability in clinical response to currently available asthma therapies appears to 
be related, in part, to distinctive inflammatory phenotypes ( Wenzel 2012 ). There is 
considerable evidence that interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of 
asthmatic disease. IL-13 is secreted predominantly by CD4+ T-helper 2 (Th2) cells and IL-13 
receptors are expressed on a number of cell types including those involved in the pathogenesis of asthma ( Hershey 2003 ). There is evidence to support that IL-13 can increase development 
of airway hyperresponsiveness ( Wardlaw et al 1988 ), potentiate bronchoconstriction 
(Grunstein et al 2002 ), increase the number of mucus-secreting cells and promote airway 
fibrosis in asthma ( Wills-Karp et al 1998 ).
Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody (MAb) of the immunoglobulin 
G4 subclass that specifically binds human IL-13, blocking interactions with the IL-13 receptor. Tralokinumab is in development for the treatment of severe asthma. A phase 2a 
study (MI-CP199) provided evidence of improvement of lung function (forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV
1)), following the addition of subcutaneous (SC) tralokinumab to 
standard asthma controller medications. Doses of 300 and 600 mg every 2 weeks of 
tralokinumab both resulted in comparable effects in FEV 1that were greater than that observed 
with a 150 mg dose ( Piper et al 2013 ). Since low pre-bronchodilator (BD) FEV 1has been 
identified as a strong independent predictor of subsequent asthma exacerbations, it is plausible 
that the addition of tralokinumab will reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations in this 
population ( Reddel et al 2009 ). 
In a phase 2b (CD-RI-CAT-354-1049) study with tralokinumab in adults with uncontrolled, 
severe asthma requiring high dose ICS and LABA, the efficacy and safety of the 2 regimens 
(300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or, 300 mg Q2W for 12 weeks, followed by a 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) maintenance dosing [Q2/4W]) vs. placebo, was evaluated over a treatment 
period of 52 weeks. The primary endpoint for this study was the annualised asthma 
exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks, with secondary endpoints including pulmonary function, patient reported outcomes, including asthma symptoms. In the overall intent-to-treat 
(ITT) phase 2b population, an increase from baseline in pre-BD FEV
1to the end of treatment 
was seen with the Q2W dosing regime, but not with the Q2/4W dosing regime.

Date 
22(127)In this phase 2b study, a subpopulation reversible on entry (FEV 1reversibility ≥12% and 
≥200ml in FEV 1) an AAER reduction that was greater for the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W 
cohort versus the Q2/4W cohort was seen. A further reduction of AAER was observed in a subgroup of reversible subjects with - (> median) serum periostin, a biomarker induced by IL-
13.  This is the population to be studied in phase 3. The safety profile of all doses studied so 
far has been acceptable (for further details see the investigators brochure (IB)).
The purpose of this phase 3 study is to provide confirmatory evidence of the efficacy and 
safety of tralokinumab in the treatment of subjects with severe uncontrolled asthma despite 
treatment with ICS-LABA and any other additional controller medication. The study will evaluate the AAER and other aspects of lung function, asthma control, and safety to further 
characterize the benefit-risk profile of the drug and understand how best to position it in the 
treatment pathway. The study will also address the potential identification of a target population with an enhanced response rate based on the presence of high serum periostin as an 
indicator of IL-13 driven asthma. Periostin levels will be determined in this study using an 
investigational use only (IUO)/performance evaluation only (PEO) assay being specifically 
developed and validated as a companion d iagnostic for tralokinumab. The utility of alternative 
biomarkers, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), for determining efficacy will also be 
investigated.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
This is a global study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the fixed dose 
Tralokinumab (300mg) administered via SC injection every 2 or 4 weeks throughout a 52-week treatment period as follows:
!Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, Q2W (26 doses) or,
!Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, Q4W (13 doses)
Exacerbation-prone asthma subjects who remain uncontrolled on ICS-LABA, and who 
demonstrate a reversibility ≥12% and ≥200 mL in FEV
1at either visit 2 (run-in) or Visit 3 
(randomization), will be randomized into the study. Primary efficacy will be determined based on reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks for tralokinumab versus placebo. Subjects will be stratified at randomization by serum periostin level (<16.44 ng/mL or ≥16.44 ng/mL) sampled during run-in, geographical region, and age group (adults versus 
adolescents). 
Previous efficacy studies of tralokinumab, including a phase 2b study with subjects on high 
dose ICS-LABA with or without additional asthma controller medications, have been conducted in adult subjects (18-75 years of age), and provide the basis for this pivotal phase 3 study. Pharmacokinetic evaluations in adolescents with asthma confirm that the same dose as for adults is applicable and since it is expected that adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) will respond similarly to adults, and are therefore to be included as part of the study population. Adolescents will therefore be recruited in the pivotal phase 3 studies.

Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
23(127)Analysis of data from both phase 2 studies MI-CP199 and the phase 2b study, has 
demonstrated a clinically relevant effect on FEV 1from tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W.  In 
contrast, only limited, if any, improvement was observed with 150 mg Q2W (in study MI-CP199) or 300 mg Q2/4W (in study CD-RI-CAT-354-1049).  Furthermore, an effect on AAER was observed with the 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen, but not with the Q2/4W dosing regimen in study CD-RI-CAT-354-1049. Since the safety profile in the CD-RI-CAT-354-1049 study was acceptable in both treatment cohorts, and no clear safety related dose-response pattern was identified, the doses of 300 mg Q2W, and 300 mg Q4W, have been selected for evaluation in this phase 3 study. The 300 mg Q4W dosing regimen has been selected to characterize the dose response in the target phase III population.
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling using all data obtained to date has 
also confirmed that a dose of 300 mg Q2W will result in near maximal increase in pre-BD FEV
1 in the phase 3 subject population.
Subjects on placebo will receive maintenance therapy that includes their usual dose of ICS/ 
LABA (see section 7.7.2 ).
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
There are few treatment options for subjects whose asthma remains uncontrolled on ICS-
LABA ( GINA 2012 ). The evidence base for oral add-on therapies (i.e. oral corticosteroids 
(OCS), leukotriene inhibitors (LTRAs), and xanthenes) is limited. Anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy (i.e., omalizumab) improves control in a subset of subjects with severe asthma 
associated with IgE-mediated allergy to a perennial allergen. Hence, new therapies are needed 
for asthma management in subjects who remain uncontrolled on standard of care.
IL-13 is targeted as it plays a role in the allergic/Th2 type response which is a signature of 
asthma. An anti-IL-13 treatment may therefore be useful in treatment of asthma. Data from 
phase 2 studies support this notion. Thus, in a 24 week phase 2a study (MI-CP199) tralokinumab at a dose of 300 mg SC every 2 weeks (the dose proposed for the phase 3 
programme) provided improvement of lung function (FEV
1), when added to standard asthma 
controller medications.  In addition the efficacy of tralokinumab has been studied in a 1 year long phase 2b study (CD-RI-CAT-354-1049) targeting adult subjects whose asthma was 
poorly controlled by high dose ICS-LABA. In this study, tralokinumab at a fixed dose of ≥
300 mg SC every other week produced improvements in multiple metrics of asthma control, including the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER), lung function, Asthma Control 
Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) scores, and symptoms, in a subpopulation who demonstrated 
reversibility of FEV
1upon study entry.
Approximately 520 subjects with asthma have so far been exposed to tralokinumab at various 
doses and for different periods of time. The 1 year long phase 2b study has contributed 301 of 
these subjects with 140 of them receiving 300 mg every other week. In all studies conducted so far, tralokinumab has been well tolerated, and no safety concerns have been identified.

24(127)However, because it is believed that the Th2 response may be of importance in the defense 
against helminthic parasitic infections, a theoretical risk for such infestations exists. IL-13 
may also play a role in regulating tumours ( Hallett et al 2012 ), and although evidence for this 
is scarce and inconclusive, this theoretical risk needs to be considered. In conjunction with the 
performance of routine pharmacovigilance activities risk minimization measures therefore 
include exclusion of subjects with untreated parasitic infection and active or recent malignancy. 
As with all biologics therapies, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), including neutralizing antibodies 
nAb), may develop. Development of ADA to tralokinumab has been rare in the phase 1 and 2 studies conducted thus far (<1% overall). Theoretical risks due to development of ADA 
include decreased drug efficacy and hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or immune 
complex disease) and observation following administration of tralokinumab is therefore mandated.
Pharmacokinetic modelling suggests that exposure to tralokinumab is slightly higher in 
adolescents (12-17 years of age) than that in adults; however, considering the overall variability of tralokinumab PK, and the absence of safety findings at doses at or above than 
300 mg every other week in the phase 2 studies, dose adjustment is not considered to be 
required for subjects in this age group. 
In summary, the efficacy and safety data obtained to date support the continued clinical 
development of tralokinumab in adult and adolescent subjects with uncontrolled asthma
A detailed assessment of the risk/benefit of tralokinumab in subjects with asthma is given in 
the IB.
1.4 Study Design 
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of a fixed 300 mg dose of tralokinumab administered SC in subjects with uncontrolled asthma receiving ICS ( ≥500μg fluticasone propionate dry powder 
formulation equivalents total daily dose) and a LABA, and having a history of asthma exacerbations.
Two regimens of tralokinumab, or placebo, will be administered via SC injection to subjects 
at the study site over a 52 week treatment period as follows:
!Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, Q2W (26 doses) or,
!Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, Q4W (13 doses)
Approximately 1140 subjects will be randomized at approximately 305 sites globally. 
Subjects will be stratified at randomization by serum periostin level (<16.44 ng/mL or ≥16.44 
ng/mL) sampled during run-in, geographical region, and age group (i.e. adults versus adolescents).

Date 
25(127)After initial enrolment and confirmation of entry criteria, subjects will enter a run-in period of 
4 to 6 weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility criteria to be evaluated. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to a 52-week treatment period. The first dose of tralokinumab/placebo will be administered at Week 0. For subjects receiving the Q2W treatment regimen, subsequent doses will be administered every 2 weeks up until Week 50 (for a total of 26 doses) with an end of treatment (EOT) visit occurring at Week 52.  For subjects receiving the Q4W treatment regimen, subsequent doses will be administered every 4 weeks up until Week 48 (for a total of 13 doses) with an EOT visit occurring at Week 52. Subjects will be maintained on their currently prescribed ICS-LABA and any additional maintenance asthma controller medications, without change, from enrolment throughout the run-in and treatment period.  All subjects will have site visits every 2 weeks.  
Follow-up visits will be conducted at Weeks 56 and 72. The extended follow-up period is to 
ensure that adequate determination of immunogenicity can be determined.
An independent Adjudication Committee, blinded to the treatment of the subjects, will 
evaluate cases of ER or urgent care visits and hospitalizations, as well as all deaths, to 
determine whether they are due to asthma or not. For completeness, the adjudication 
committee will also be tasked with reviewing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and malignant adverse events occurring after randomization. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) will safeguard the interest of adolescent subjects by assessing the safety of the 
intervention.

3. SUBJECT SELECTION, ENROLMENT, RANDOMIZATION, 
RESTRICTIONS, DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL 
Each subject should meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for this 
study.  Under no circumstances can there be exceptions to this rule.
3.1 Inclusion criteria
For inclusion in the study, subjects should fulfil the following criteria:
1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures for subjects 
who are at, or over the age of majority (as per local law). For subjects less than the 
age of majority, in addition to the subject providing informed assent, the subject’s 
legal guardian must also provide their informed consent.
2. Female and male aged from 12 to 75 years, inclusively at time of enrolment (Visit 
1).  For those countries where local regulations permit enrolment of adults only, 
subject recruitment will be restricted to those who are ≥18 years.
3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) (after menarche), including adolescent 
females, must use a highly effective form of birth control (confirmed by the 
investigator). Highly effective forms of birth control includes: true sexual abstinence, a vasectomised sexual partner, Implanon, female sterilization by tubal 
occlusion, any effective intrauterine device/system (IUD/IUS), Depo-Provera™ 
injections, oral contraceptive, and Evra Patch ™ or Nuvaring™. WOCBP must agree to use highly effective method of birth control, as defined above, from 
enrolment, throughout the study duration and within 16 weeks after last dose of 
investigational product (IP), and have negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1.
Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either 
permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered 
postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned 
date of randomization without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
33(127)!Women <50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of 
exogenous hormonal treatment and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
levels in the postmenopausal range.
!Women ≥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all 
exogenous hormonal treatment.
4. Weight of ≥40 and <150 kg at enrolment (Visit 1).  
5. Documented physician-diagnosed asthma for at least 12 months prior to enrolment 
with the subject having received an asthma controller regimen requiring treatment 
with medium-to-high dose ICS for at least 6 of the 12 months prior to enrolment 
(Visit 1). In addition, subjects must have used physician prescribed ICS (at a total daily dose ≥500μg fluticasone propionate via dry powder inhaler or equivalent 
delivered dose) that has been taken at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to 
enrolment. 
6. Documented treatment with ICS at a total daily dose corresponding to ≥500μg 
fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation equivalents and a LABA for at least 
3 months prior to Visit 1. The ICS and LABA can be parts of a combination product, or given by separate inhalers.  For ICS-LABA combination preparations, 
the highest strength approved maintenance dose in the local country will be 
acceptable to meet this ICS criterion.
!In order to aid the assessment, ICS equivalents for high-dose and 
moderate-dose fluticasone propionate dry powder, as published by the 
Global Initiative for Asthma ( GINA 2012 ) guidelines, are presented in 
Appendix F.  The Investigator will assess the subject’s total daily ICS 
dose and determine that it corresponds to ≥500μg fluticasone propionate 
dry powder formulation equivalents. If the subject is on two or more 
different types of ICS, these can form parts of an addition, and the sum, 
however approximate, will be assessed.
The below defines the minimally acceptable documentation for subject inclusion:
1. Signed and dated notes from a referring physician, including name and dose 
of the ICS-LABA inhaler (or names and dosages, if used as separate inhalers).  
2. Evidence of prescriptions for ICS-LABA medications that demonstrate 
coverage for the duration specified in Inclusion criteria 6 and 7.  
3. Documented communication (e.g. phone conversation) clarifying that the 
subject received treatment with ICS-LABA for asthma.  The name, dosage,

34(127)and duration of use for each medication must be recorded.  This option 
should be used only if reasonable attempts to procure subject records have 
been unsuccessful.
7. Additional maintenance asthma controller medications are allowed according to 
standard practice of care.  These medications must be stable for 3 months prior to 
enrolment (Visit 1). Furthermore, after randomization, the subject's background maintenance medication for asthma shall remain unchanged throughout the study.
8. At Visit 1 the subject must have a morning pre-BD FEV
1value <80% (<90% for 
subjects 12 to 17 years of age) of their predicted normal value (PNV). At Visit 2 the subject must have a morning pre-BD FEV
1 value of ≥40 and <80% value (<90% for 
subjects 12 to 17 years of age) of their PNV.  If this is not met at Visit 2, it must be 
met at Visit 3.  Prior to the lung function measurement, the subject should withhold their BD for the effect duration specific to that BD.
9. A post-BD reversibility of ≥12% and ≥200 mL in FEV
1at Visit 2. If not met at Visit 
2, it must be met at Visit 3 (randomization). Before reversibility testing, the subject should withhold their BD for the effect duration specific to that BD.
10. At least 2 documented asthma exacerbations in the 12 months prior to the date 
informed consent is obtained that required use of a systemic corticosteroid. In case of subjects who are re-screened within 30 days of their screen failure date; the 12 
months can be calculated from the date that the first informed consent was obtained.
The below defines what is acceptable to document exacerbations in this Program:
1. Discharge summaries from a hospital, emergency room, or an urgent care 
facility indicating that a subject was hospitalized/treated with systemic 
steroids for an asthma exacerbation.  
2. Signed and dated notes from a referring physician, including information 
regarding diagnosis and treatment of an exacerbation with systemic steroids.  
3. Subjects can provide evidence of prescriptions for systemic steroids used 
during an exacerbation.  
4. A documented conversation between the treating/referral physician or 
nurse/nurse practitioner certifying that a subject was treated for an exacerbation with steroids at their clinic or under their supervision.  The 
dates (month/year) of the exacerbations and verbal confirmation that 
appropriate prescriptions were provided is necessary.  This option should be used only if reasonable attempts to procure patient records have been 
unsuccessful.

Date 
35(127)A combination of the above is acceptable to document the two required 
exacerbations. However, it is necessary for the Investigator to document how they 
obtained confirmation of the subject’s asthma exacerbations.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure subject eligibility into the clinical study.  In cases where the 
Investigator feels that alternative records to the above constitutes acceptable 
documentation, the Study Physician will be contacted for their assessment of eligibility prior to enrolment.  Every attempt should be made to obtain appropriate 
source documentation of medical records.  
11. ACQ-6 score ≥1.5 at Visit 1 (Week - 6)
Prior to randomization at Visit 3, subjects should fulfil the following inclusion criteria:
12. For WOCBP (including all adolescents) only: have a negative urine pregnancy test 
prior to administration of the IP.
13. No requirement for additional asthma controller medication including an increase in 
ICS dose during run-in.
14. Fulfilment of at least one of the following conditions over the 7 days prior to 
randomization:
!2 days with a daytime or night-time symptoms score ≥1
!Reliever SABA use on > 2 days 
!≥1 awakening due to asthma
15. A morning pre-BD FEV1 of ≥40% and <80% (<90% for subjects 12 to 17 years of 
age) of the subject’s PNV at the day of the randomization visit, if not met at Visit 2.
16. If not previously achieved at Visit 2, a post-BD reversibility in FEV1 of ≥12% and 
≥200 mL must be met at Visit 3.  Note that theophylline and BDs must be withheld 
prior to reversibility testing to avoid interference with this assessment; the minimum 
period for withholding each medication is specified in Appendix H.
17. Ability to perform acceptable inhaler, peak flow meter, and spirometry techniques.18. Show at least 70% compliance with both the usual asthma controller (i.e. ICS-
LABA and any other asthma controller medications) as evidenced by the subject 
having a minimum of 10 fully compliant dosing days in the 14 days prior to Visit 3 (randomization) as reported by the subject in the eDiary.
19. Compliance with eDiary assessment schedule
!At least 10 of the 14 days prior to Visit 3 must have complete (morning 
and evening) eDiary assessments.

For procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled subjects see Section 3.4.
3.3 Subject enrolment and randomization
Investigator(s) should keep a record (i.e., a subject screening log) of subjects who entered pre-
study screening. The pre-screening/screening log will be evaluated periodically by AstraZeneca and/or its delegates during routine monitoring visits.
The Investigator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent or assent from the potential subject, or their 
guardian/legal representative, before any study specific procedures are performed.
2. Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’).
3. Determine subject eligibility. See Section 3 .
4. Assign the eligible subject unique randomization code via the Interactive Web 
Response System/ Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS).
5. Subjects will be allocated to receive tralokinumab or placebo in a 2:1:2:1 ratio (i.e. 
380 subjects on active vs. 190 subjects on placebo, in each of the Q2W and Q4 
week regimens).  Randomization numbers will be grouped in blocks.  Randomized 
subjects who discontinue will not be replaced. If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/ randomization code cannot be 
reused.
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in a separate 
instruction manual.
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized 
subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be 
randomized or receive study medication.  There can be no exceptions to this rule.  Subjects 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
40(127)who are enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria must not be 
randomized or initiated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study.
Where a subject does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the AstraZeneca study 
physician immediately, and a discussion should occur between the AstraZeneca study 
physician and the investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the subject from treatment. The AstraZeneca study physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately 
documented.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially in each stratum as subjects become 
eligible for randomization.
The randomization code will be assigned from a randomization list prepared by an internal 
AstraZeneca computerized system (Grand). The randomization will be stratified by baseline 
serum periostin ((<16.44 ng/mL or ≥16.44 ng/mL) sampled during run-in, age and 
geographical region (i.e. Asia Pacific, North America, South America, Central/Eastern 
Europe, and Western Europe/Rest of World.  Stratified randomization is used to allow for 
evaluation within sub-groups and/or to allow for heterogeneity in placebo exacerbations rates (regions). Randomization will be done in blocks.
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
This is a double-blind study in which tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct from each 
other. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct, IP will be handled by an unblinded IP manager at the site and will be administered by an unblinded investigational site study team member who will not be involved in the management of study subjects. (This could be the same person). 
Should an issue arise with the IP (e.g. damaged kit or syringe that has been assigned to a 
subject prior to administration, or any other unexpected event with the kit or syringe (e.g. a malfunction during IP administration) the unblinded IP manager at the site will contact a predetermined unblinded AstraZeneca site monitor (who is not otherwise involved in the 
project) to determine whether any specific actions are required.
A blinded AstraZeneca site monitor will perform IP accountability. In the event that the 
treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, or needs to be known to treat an individual subject for an AE, the sponsor must be notified immediately by the investigator and if 
possible, before unblinding. 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
41(127)All packaging and labelling of IP will be done in such way as to ensure blinding for all 
sponsor and investigational site staff (other than the unblinded IP manager who will directly 
handle the pre-filled syringes).
The following personnel will have access to the randomization list:
!those carrying out the packaging and labelling of IP
!those generating the randomization list
The information in the randomization list will be kept from other personnel involved in the 
conduct of the study, and in a secure location until the end of the study.
No member of the extended study team at AstraZeneca, or any CRO handling data, will have 
access to the randomization scheme during the conduct of the study, with the exception of the 
Supply Chain Study Management department and the Patient Safety department at 
AstraZeneca and personnel at the bioanalytical lab performing the PK sample analysis.
A DSMB will review safety data by assessing the safety of the interventions for adolescents 
only. The DSMB will have access to the individual treatment codes and will be able to merge 
these with the collected study data while the study is ongoing (see Section 6.8.2 ), if and as 
required. The personnel involved in the clinical study at AstraZeneca will remain blinded to 
these analyses and will have no knowledge of the results presented to the DSMB.
3.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized 
subject, will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists at the study sites from the IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be 
provided to each site.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomization. The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment 
given to subject to the AstraZeneca staff.
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to 
regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual subject have been made 
and documented.
3.8 Restrictions during and after the study
(a) Fertile and sexually active female subjects (including adolescent females) should 
use highly effective contraceptive methods throughout the study and at least for 16 
weeks (5 half-lives) after last administration of the IP. 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)

Date 
42(127)(b) Subjects must abstain from donating blood, plasma from the time of informed 
consent or assent and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after last dose of IP.
3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product
At any time, subjects are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A subject that decides 
to discontinue the IP will always be asked about the reason(s) for their decision to withdrawal 
and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be seen and assessed by an Investigator(s).  
Adverse events will be followed up (as described in Section 6 ); the enrolment/randomization 
code of the withdrawn subject cannot be reused.
3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a subject from investigational product 
Subjects will be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
1. Subject decision.  The subject is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment
2. The subject experiences an AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates 
further dosing
3. The development of any risk to the subject as judged by the Investigator or AstraZeneca4. Severe non-compliance with the study protocol
5. Pregnancy 
6. Lost to follow-up
1
7. Development of any study specific criteria for discontinuation, including:
a) An anaphylactic reaction to the IP requiring administration of epinephrine
b) A helminth parasitic infestation requiring hospitalization
c) An asthma-related event requiring intubation
d) Any malignancy
8. Development of one or more of the following:
a) Confirmed ALT or AST increase of ≥8 x ULN
b) Confirmed ALT or AST increase of ≥5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks
c) Confirmed ALT or AST increase of ≥3 x ULN and total bilirubin of ≥2 x ULN
d) ALT or AST of ≥3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia ( ≥5%)
                                                
1A subject is considered lost to follow up when any of the following attempts of contact are failed: 3 attempts of 
either phone calls, faxes or emails; having sent 1 registered letter/certified mail; or one unsuccessful effort to check the status of the subject using publicly available sources, if allowed by local regulations.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
43(127)Subjects who discontinue IP or the study will always be asked about the reason(s) for 
discontinuation and the presence of any AEs. The Principal Investigator will perform the best 
possible observation(s), test(s) and evaluation(s) as well as give appropriate medication and all possible measures for the safety of the subject. They will also immediately inform 
AstraZeneca of the withdrawal. Adverse events will be followed up (see Section 6 ) and any 
questionnaires (e.g., for patient reported outcomes) are to be completed.
Discontinuation of IP does not necessarily mean discontinuation of follow-up or termination 
of study participation. Compliant subjects who are discontinued from the IP should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo all study related visits/procedures for the full 52-week study period in order to support the final efficacy and safety analysis for tralokinumab (see 
Section 8 ). The reason for premature discontinuation of IP will be documented in the source 
documentation and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
It is essential to collect as much data as possible for all subjects throughout the study and 
especially all potential endpoint events. Complete withdrawal from the study (i.e., withdrawal 
of consent) has a direct negative impact on the potential validity of all study data and should be avoided wherever possible.
If the subject permanently discontinues IP prior to their completion of the study and wishes to 
continue with the study assessments, they may choose from 3 different follow-up options, as 
described in Section 4.2.
For subjects who wish to withdraw from the study completely, refer to Section 3.10
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
3.10.1 Screen failures 
Screen failures are subjects who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria for the study, and therefore 
must not be randomized.  These subjects should have the reason for study withdrawal 
recorded as ‘Incorrect Enrolment’ (i.e., subject does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion 
criteria).  This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures, and not randomized subjects.
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent or assent
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time (i.e., from receiving IP and/or having 
assessments performed), without prejudice to further treatment.
A subject who withdraws their consent or assent will always be asked about the reason(s) for 
their decision to withdrawal, and the presence of any AE.  The Investigator will follow up 
AEs outside of the clinical study. The subject must return the ePRO and ePEF devices.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomization 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
44(127)If the subject only withdraws consent for the retention of blood samples for future exploratory 
use (e.g., DNA, study of markers of asthma, identifying potential new drug targets for asthma, 
or for assay development purposes), the subject will not be withdrawn from the study.
Withdrawal of consent from the study must be ascertained and documented by the Investigator 
and recorded in the eCRF as well as in the Informed Consent Form (ICF) or assent form. The 
ICF or assent form must be re-signed and dated by both the subject and the investigator.

1At unscheduled visits for assessing an asthma exacerbation, at a minimum, these assessments need to be performed. Other unsched uled visits may be initiated as needed, and 
the assessments performed as per investigator’s judgement.
2Visit 1 can be performed over a period of 3-working days, with the exception of documentation of informed consent and assent (i f applicable), which can be completed up to 
30 days prior to Visit 1. 
3The run-in period can be 28 to 45 days in duration.  Visit 1 should be completed within days -45 to -28.  V2 should occur within  days -17 to -14, which includes a 3 day 
window.  V3 is considered day 0.
4All visits are to be scheduled from the date of randomization but not from the date of previous visit

Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
53(127)4.1 Enrolment/run-in period
4.1.1 Enrolment (Visit 1)
Each potential subject who is at, or over the age of majority (as per local law) will provide 
informed consent prior to any study specific procedures being and undergo assessments 
applicable for the visit (see Table 1 ).
For subjects less than the age of majority, in addition to the subject providing informed assent, 
the subject’s legal guardian must also provide their informed consent.
Subjects may sign the ICF, or assent form, prior to the performance of Visit 1 procedures. 
With the exception of documentation of informed consent and assent (if applicable), which can be completed up to 30 days prior to Visit 1, all other Visit 1 procedures should be 
completed within a 1 to 3-working day window.  The 3-day window is to enable subjects to 
return if necessary for the spirometry assessments on a morning when they have had their BD medications withheld in accordance with the spirometry instructions (see section 5.1.2 ).  The 
registration of the subject’s enrollment via IWRS/IVRS should occur on the day when the 
Visit 1 procedures are performed.
Visit 1 assessments are primarily concerned with assessing the subject’s eligibility 
(inclusion/exclusion) criteria, including their asthma disease state, the requisite level of 
severity based on maintenance medications, exacerbation history, and the current level of control based on an initial ACQ-6 score.
Spirometry will also be performed at Visit 1.  Subjects must have a pre-BD FEV
1value <80% 
of their PNV (<90% for subjects 12 to 17 years of age) in order to proceed in the study as per (Section 3.1, criterion 8).  If not, the subject will be screen failed.
Other study assessments and procedures to be performed at this visit include the recording of 
the subject’s demographics, a complete physical examination (including height and weight), vital signs, a dECG, recording the subject’s medical/surgical history and concomitant 
medications, collection of blood samples for haematology/clinical chemistry, serology and 
biomarkers, collection of a urine sample for dipstick and urinalysis (where applicable), and a pregnancy test for WOCBP.
A record of physician-diagnosed asthma, ICS-LABA use, use of other asthma controllers  
(Section 3.1, criteria 4, 6and 7), and asthma exacerbations over the prior year (Section 3.1, 
criterion 10) is required source documentation. A subject’s verbal history suggestive of 
asthma symptoms and/or prior asthma exacerbations, but without supporting documentation, 
is not sufficient to satisfy these inclusion criteria.
4.1.2 Run-in (Visit 2)
The run-in period (i.e., from Visit 1 to Visit 3) should be 4 to 6 weeks (- 3 days) in duration. 
The subject should remain on their current asthma treatment with no changes throughout the entire run-in period. Assessments applicable for the run-in period are listed in Table 1 .
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
54(127)Visit 2 is primarily concerned with evaluating whether lung function meets the respective 
study eligibility criteria, to collect AE and concomitant medication information, as well as a blood sample for periostin (to be used for  stratification at randomization).  
The protocol specified reversibility criterion (i.e. inclusion criterion 9) will be assessed at this 
visit.  Should this criterion not be met at Visit 2, subjects must fulfill it at Visit 3 in order to be randomized. 
The subject will be supplied with an electronic hand-held spirometer (peak flow meter) to 
measure the subject’s PEF at home, and an ePRO device to record asthma symptoms and complete relevant questionnaires throughout the study (see section 5.2.2 for further details).
Visit 2 may be performed as a telephone visit (for collection of SAE information only) if the 
subject is confirmed as ineligible for the study (e.g., based on laboratory results from Visit 1, or medical history). 
The subject’s eligibility should be evaluated at each visit during the run-in period with the 
relevant documentation entered in the source and eCRF.
4.1.3 Randomization (Visit 3)
Lung function with measurement of morning pre-dose, pre-BD and post-BD FEV
1will be 
performed on Visit 3 prior to randomization. Subjects should have a morning pre-BD FEV 1 of 
≥40% and <80% (<90% for subjects 12 to 17 years of age) of the subject’s PNV, and fulfil the 
protocol-specified reversibility criterion ( ≥12% FEV 1 and ≥200 mL), if either is not met at 
visit 2. Other inclusion criteria at randomization will be confirmed at Visit 3. 
Before randomization the subject’s compliance with their usual asthma controller (ICS-
LABA), and any other asthma controller medication, and ePRO completion must be confirmed (see section 3.1, inclusion criteria 18and 19).  The subject should bring the ePRO 
device to this visit where they will complete the ACQ-6, AQLQ(S)+12, EQ-5D-5L, and the WPAI + CIQ.
If the periostin value measured at Visit 2 is missing at randomization (Visit 3), the subject 
should not be randomized, nor should any Visit 3 assessments be performed. A new blood sample for periostin should be taken at this visit and a new Visit 3 visit should be re-scheduled 
to occur 2 weeks later, along with all other Visit 3 assessments.  
4.1.4 Re-screening
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbation within 30 days prior to ICF date or during 
the screening/run-in phase should be screen failed.  They may be re-screened no sooner than 
30 days after their last dose of systemic steroids.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
55(127)Subjects with respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication within 30 
days prior to the date informed consent is obtained or during the screening/run-in period may 
also be re-screened.
Re-screening for the above mentioned reasons is allowed only once for the subject. Subjects 
should be re-screened no later than 3 months failing initial enrolment.
If the reason for screen failure was transient (including but not limited to study-supplied 
equipment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visits), subjects 
may potentially be re-screened. These cases should be discussed with the AstraZeneca Study 
Physician and documented approval for re-screening should be filed in the Investigator Study File (ISF).
IMPORTANT! Re-screening for subjects who have screen-failed due to an ACQ-6 score 
<1.5 is not allowed.
Any re-screened subject will be re-enrolled and reassigned their originally assigned enrolment 
number after signing a new Informed Consent Form (ICF), or assent form, and after all run-in 
assessments have been performed as listed in Table 1 (with the exception of testing for HIV1 
and HIV2, hepatitis B and C, and FSH). 
Re-enrolment is only allowed once for any subject, regardless of whether this is due to an 
exacerbation or infection. The subject may not be re-screened if any other eligibility criteria are failed.
4.2 Treatment period
Inclusion criteria at randomization will be confirmed at Visit 3. Before randomization the 
subject’s compliance with their usual asthma controller ICS-LABA and other asthma 
controller medication, and ePRO completion must be confirmed (see section 3.1, inclusion 
criteria 18and 19).
Subjects confirmed as eligible will be randomized at Visit 3 (Week 0) in a 2:1:2:1 ratio (i.e. 
380 subjects on active, and 190 subjects on placebo, in both the Q2W and Q4W dosing regimen groups) to receive either:
! Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, Q2W (26 doses) or,
! Tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo, Q4W (13 doses)
The first dose of the IP will be administered following randomization through IWRS/IVRS at 
Visit 3.
Following randomization the subject will receive 52 weeks of double-blind treatment, with the 
last dose of tralokinumab/placebo administered at Visit 28 (Week 50) for the Q2W dosing 
regimen, and Visit 27 (Week 48) for the Q4W dosing regimen.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
56(127)Subjects will have scheduled visits at 2-week intervals to complete protocol-specific 
assessments and IP administration, as listed in Table 1 . Restrictions as set out in section 7.7.2
will continue to apply throughout the treatment period. In case of an asthma worsening/exacerbation (see section 5.1.1 ), subjects should be evaluated at the study site, 
when feasible, at an unscheduled visit, or ordinary visit if the worsening happens to fall within 
a scheduled visit window.
Subjects will continue to measure their PEF at home, as well as record asthma symptoms and 
responses to questionnaires in the Asthma Daily Diary throughout the 52-week treatment 
period (see section 5.2.2 for details).
Subjects will have brief physical exams performed at times listed in Table 1 .  A complete 
physical exam will be performed at Visit 29 (Week 52).
Additional blood samples will be obtained from the subjects at Visits 3, 9, 16 and 29 to 
further explore the relationship between the clinical response to 2 dosing regimens of tralokinumab and biomarkers.
The subject’s adherence for completing all questionnaires in the ePRO will be assessed at all 
visits during the treatment period, with retraining provided as required.
At Week 52 subjects will come to the site for the End of Treatment (EOT) visit. The subject 
should bring the ePRO device to the EOT visit and complete the ACQ-6, AQLQ(S)+12, EQ-
5D-5L, and the WPAI + CIQ, unless they have been completed at home prior to the visit.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue IP (see section 3.9) should return to the study site and 
complete procedures described for the IP Discontinuation Visit (IPD visit), see Table 1 . At the 
IP Discontinuation visit, the subject will be given three options as to how they will be followed up as follows:
1. Ideally, the subject should be encouraged to return for all regular clinic visits and 
perform all scheduled assessments until he/she completes a total of 52 weeks in the study, or,
2. The subject will be offered to be followed up on a monthly basis via telephone 
calls while continuing eDiary completion, until the subject completes 52 weeks in the study. No further procedures will be performed. Or, 
3. If the subject cannot comply or does not wish to comply with the options above, 
the Investigator will only contact the subject at 52 weeks post randomization. No other study assessments will be performed prior to this contact.
After this period, the subjects will perform the EOT visit as described above.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
57(127)The key elements to be collected at these follow up visits or telephone contacts for options 2 
and 3 are AEs/SAEs, changes in concomitant medications, and asthma exacerbation 
information.  For option 1, all procedures will be done at each visit as indicated in Table 1 .
The subject’s decision needs to be documented in the eCRF and the specific section in the 
ICF/assent form addendum needs to be signed by the subject.
Should the subject choose option 3 above, they will complete the IP Discontinuation visit
immediately and then a follow up telephone call at week 52.  If the subject chooses either 
option 1 or 2, they will complete the IP Discontinuation visit immediately and then the EOT 
visit at week 52.  The EOT visit will be completed immediately in the case of subsequent early withdrawal from option 1 or 2.
Subjects who initially chose options 1 or 2 and subsequently cannot or do not wish to comply 
with the requirements of the chosen option, can choose to continue with a less invasive option (i.e.: Subject initially choosing option 1 can continue with 2 or 3, subjects initially choosing 
option 2 can continue with 3).
The final follow up visits (i.e., 30 and 31) are to occur 4 weeks (+7 days) and 20 weeks (+7 
days) from the date of the EOT visit, respectively. 
Subjects who do not wish to have any follow up contacts at all, will be discontinued from the 
study. All discontinued subjects must return the ePRO and ePEF devices at the EOT visit.
Completion, or early termination of IP treatment, will be registered via the IWRS/IVRS for 
each subject.
4.3 Follow-up period
Subjects will have follow-up visits (30 and 31) at Weeks 56 and 72, respectively.

58(127)5.1 Efficacy assessments
5.1.1 Assessment of asthma exacerbations
For the purpose of the protocol, an asthma exacerbation will be defined as a worsening of 
asthma that leads to any of the following:
! Use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days; a single depo-injectable dose of 
corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic 
corticosteroids
! An ER or urgent care visit (defined as evaluation and treatment for <24 hours in an 
ER or urgent care center) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids (as per above)
! An inpatient hospitalization (defined as admission to an inpatient facility and/or 
evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥24 hours) due to asthma. 
The ePRO device will be programmed to alert both the subject and study site when certain 
pre-specified worsening thresholds are crossed as follows: 
! Decrease in morning peak flow ≥30% on at least 2 of 3 successive days compared 
with baseline (last 10 days of run-in), and/or 
! A ≥50% increase in rescue medication or one new or additional nebulized β2-
agonist on at least 2 of 3 successive days compared with the average use for the 
previous week, and/or 
! Nocturnal awakening due to asthma requiring rescue medication use for at least 2 of 
3 successive nights, and/or; 
! An increase in total asthma symptom score (the sum of day time [evening 
assessment] and night-time [morning assessment] of at least 2 units above the run-in average (last 10 days of run-in), or the highest possible score (daily score of 6), on at least 2 of 3 successive days.
For the purpose of the protocol, worsening of asthma is defined as new or increased symptoms 
and/or signs (i.e., physical examination or lung function) that can be either concerning to the 
subject (subject-driven) or related to an Asthma Daily Diary alert (diary-driven).
If an exacerbation event is not associated with deterioration in at least one of the pre-specified 
subject –driven and/or diary-driven objective measurements, the Investigator will have to 
justify the decision for defining the event as an exacerbation. Events that are not supported by any objective assessment will be deemed not to be a protocol-defined exacerbation.
In order to calculate the number of exacerbations experienced by a subject during the 52-week 
treatment period, the following rule will be applied: 
! The start of an exacerbation is defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids, 
ER or urgent care visit requiring systemic corticosteroids, or hospital admission due 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
59(127)to asthma, whichever occurs earlier, and the end date is defined as the last day of 
systemic corticosteroids, ER or urgent care visit, or hospital discharge, whichever occurs later. 
Additional systemic corticosteroid treatments, ER or urgent care visits requiring use of 
systemic corticosteroids, or inpatient hospitalization due to asthma occurring during an 
exacerbation should not be regarded as a new exacerbation. In order to be counted as a new exacerbation it must be preceded by at least 7 days in which neither criterion is fulfilled. 
The subject may remain in the study after an exacerbation and continue to receive IP if the 
Investigator judges that it is medically appropriate for the subject to do so.
Reasonable attempts should be made by the Investigator to bring the subject into the study site 
for evaluation of a diary alert or subject initiated asthma worsening, particularly when it 
results in additional treatment being prescribed. Study site evaluations for asthma worsening may occur as an unscheduled visit or as part of an ordinary site visit if the worsening happens 
to be coincident with a scheduled visit window. 
A copy of the medical record should be obtained for exacerbations evaluated and treated at 
non-study sites (e.g., by the primary care health care provider or at an ER/hospital) and details 
entered into the exacerbation eCRF module in a timely fashion. Changes in concomitant 
medication due to exacerbation must be recorded in the appropriate module of the eCRF.
Maximum follow-up time for a subject is approximately 52 weeks; defined as the time from 
randomization (Visit 3) to the date of Visit 29. For a subject lost to follow-up, this will be 
defined as the time from randomization to the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed (i.e., the last contact date). 
Exacerbations that occur after a subject has discontinued IP should still be accounted for when 
deriving the total number of exacerbations; and likewise, the follow-up time will reflect the follow-up time regardless of whether or not the subject is still on IP.
5.1.2 Spirometry
General requirements
FEV
1will be measured by spirometry at the study site using equipment provided by central 
vendor. Spirometry will be performed by the Investigator or authorized delegate according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines ( Miller et al 
2005 ).
The vendor providing central spirometry services will be responsible for assuring that the 
spirometer used by each site meets ATS/ERS recommendations, and that the study site personnel who will be performing the testing are properly certified. Spirometry calibration will be detailed in a separate spirometry procedures manual.
Time of day for scheduled site visit spirometry
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
60(127)For adult subjects, spirometry testing must be initiated in the morning between 6:00 AM and 
11 AM according to the schedule provided in Table 1 . For adolescent subjects, spirometry 
testing can be initiated during the whole day according to the schedule provided in Table 1.  
All post-randomization spirometry assessments should be performed within ± 1.5 hours of the time that the randomization spirometry was performed. For example, if the randomization spirometry was started at 8:00 AM, then all subsequent spirometry testing needs to be initiated between 6:30 AM and 9:30 AM.
Important! Subjects should be instructed not to use their maintenance twice daily LABA 
(or ICS-LABA) within 12 hours of the scheduled site visit spirometry as this will affect 
the pre-BD FEV 1 value; they may be taken subsequently, at the site. For once daily BDs and 
theophylline a 48 hour washout period is required. For the same reason subjects should not 
use their SABA within 6 hours of scheduled spirometry/dECG assessments. This 
restriction is particularly critical for efficacy measures taken during the treatment period, but should also facilitate meeting the run-in FEV
1 and reversibility eligibility criteria.
Options for handling subjects who have inadvertently taken their asthma medication within 
the restricted window are described in section 7.7.2 .
Spirometry technique
Subjects should avoid engaging in strenuous exertion for at least 30 minutes prior to 
spirometry measurements. Subjects should avoid eating a large meal for at least 2 hours prior to spirometry measurements at the site. All spirometry manoeuvres (irrespective of whether to obtain values for FEV
1, FVC, FEF 25-75%) should be performed with the subject seated in an 
upright position. If this is not comfortable for the subject, standing is permitted. The same 
position should be used by the subject for each forced expiratory manoeuvre from enrolment throughout the study. The head must not be tilted during manoeuvres and the thorax should be able to move freely; hence tight clothing should be loosened. A nose-clip should be used for the manoeuvre. Mouthpieces of the same dimension and shape should be used by the subject from enrolment throughout the study.
The spirometry manoeuvre consists of three phases; the first is maximal inspiration, the 
second is a “blast” of exhalation (to obtain the FEV
1value) and the last is a continuation to 
complete exhalation.  The subject should inhale rapidly and completely from functional residual capacity.  It is important that the preceding inspiration is fast and that any pause at full inspiration be minimal (i.e. only for 1-2s).  The subject should be prompted to “blast”, not just “blow”, and they should be encouraged to fully exhale until the end of test criteria are met.  If the patient feels dizzy, the manoeuvre should be stopped, since syncope could follow due to prolonged interruption of venous return to the thorax.  Manoeuvres that do not meet the end of test criteria should not be used to satisfy the requirement of three acceptable manoeuvres.  However early termination, by itself, is not a reason to eliminate all the results from such a manoeuvre from further consideration.  
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
61(127)To allow recording of the FVC value, it is important that the whole manoeuvre lasts for at 
least 6 seconds. Ensure that none of the following has occurred: coughing during the first second, glottis closure, leak or obstruction of the mouthpiece (by the tongue).
Multiple forced expiratory efforts (at least 3 but no more than 8) will be performed for each
spirometry session.  There should be at least 3 efforts that meet ATS/ERS acceptability criteria with the highest value and second highest value for FEV
1and FVC meeting the 
ATS/ERS reproducibility criteria.  The largest FVC and the largest FEV 1should be recorded 
after examining the data from all of the usable curves, even if they do not come from the same curve.  If the criteria for acceptability and reproducibility are not met with the first 3 expiratory efforts, then additional attempts are required up to a maximum of 8.  If the reproducibility criter ia is not fulfilled after the maximum number of manoeuvres has been 
performed, the highest of the FEV
1and FVC value that is deemed acceptable should be 
selected.   The absolute measurement (for FEV 1), and the percentage of PNV ( Quanjer et al 
2012 ) will be recorded. 
The mean forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC (FEF25–75%) is taken 
from the blow with the largest sum of FEV 1and FVC. The FEF25–75% must be measured 
with an accuracy of at least +5% of reading or +0.2 L whichever is greater. It is highly 
dependent on the validity of the FVC measurement and the level of expiratory effort.
Order of administration of usual asthma controller medication and IP relative to
scheduled pre-and post-BD spirograms.
On visits when spirometry is performed the subject´s usual asthma controller medication 
should be withheld until the whole procedure for spirometry has been completed; usual 
asthma controller may be given after final post-BD spirograms. IP dosing should also be 
withheld until pre-BD spirometry has been completed.
Record keeping
A signed and dated copy of the pre- and post- BD printout must be kept at the study site for 
source data verification. The printout must be marked with the study code, subject enrolment 
code, date and time of measurement, and visit number.
Spirometry references
The Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations will be used to determine the subjects 
PNV values and are pre-programmed into the spirometer ( Quanjer et al 2012 ). 
FEV 1, expressed as percent of the PNV, will be calculated as follows:
FEV 1% of PNV = (FEV 1 measured/FEV 1PNV) x 100

Date 
62(127)5.1.2.1 Reversibility test and post-BD FEV 1efficacy assessment
Complete the initial (pre-BD) FEV1 measurement (Section 5.1.2 ) before commencing the 
post-BD assessment.  
As before, it is important that the subject has withheld each of their theophylline and BD 
medications for the minimum period of time specified in Section 7.7.2  and Appendix H.   If at 
Visit 2 or Visit 3 the subject has not adhered to this restriction the reversibility assessment 
should be re-scheduled within the next 7 days; other assessments for the visit can be completed as planned.  
Albuterol  90 μg metered dose or Salbutamol 100 μg metered dose will be used in the 
reversibility assessment.  Up to 8 doses may be administered at Visit 2 and 3, and up to 4 doses at the other visits (Visit 7, Visit 29 (EOT) and/or IP Discontinuation Visit).  If there is 
any concern about the effect on the subject’s heart rate, tremor or any other safety parameter 
during the assessment fewer doses can be administered; the reason should be noted in the subject’s medical records.
A spacer device should be used for administration of the SABA; nebulizers should not be 
used.  The same bronchodilator and type of device should be used at each visit where reversibility is assessed. 
Step 1: FEV1 measurement after 4 SABA inhalations  
For administration of albuterol/salbutamol, the subject will:
(i) Perform a gentle, complete expiration 
(ii) Inhale Dose 1 of the SABA to TLC and hold their breath for 5-10 seconds before 
the subject exhales.
(iii) Rest for approximately 30 seconds before the next dose
(iv) Repeat this for Dose 2, Dose 3 and Dose 4, resting for a further 15 – 20 minutes 
after Dose 4
After resting for 15 – 20 minutes FEV1 is measured following the technique described in 
Section 5.1.2
Visit 2 and Visit 3:  if the inclusion criterion for reversibility is met ( ≥12% and ≥200 mL) this 
is the end of the reversibility assessment.  If it is not met the subject proceeds to Step 2.
Visit 7, Visit 29/EOT and/or IP Discontinuation Visit:  this is the end of the reversibility 
assessment.
Step 2: FEV1 measurement following a further 2 (total of 6) SABA inhalations (Only at 
Visit 2 and Visit 3, if assessed)
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)
Study Code D2210C00007Edition Number 3
Date 
63(127)The subject will repeat the SABA inhalation procedures for Dose 5 and Dose 6.  (See Step 1 
above for instructions.)
After resting for the 15 – 20 minutes FEV1 will be measured following the technique 
described in Section 5.1.2   
This is the end of the reversibility assessment if either of the following occurs:
! the inclusion criterion for reversibility is met ( ≥12% and ≥200 mL) or
! the incremental change in FEV1 between Step 1 and 2 is ≤5% and the inclusion 
criterion is not met
Subjects proceed to Step 3 if the incremental change in FEV1 between Step 1 and Step 2 is 
>5% and if the criterion for reversibility has not yet been met.
Step 3: FEV1 measurement following a further 2 (total of 8) SABA inhalations (Only at 
Visit 2, and Visit 3 if assessed)
The subject will repeat the inhalation procedures for Dose 7 and Dose 8, resting for 15 – 20 
minutes after Dose 8. (See Step 1 above for instructions.) 
After resting for the 15 – 20 minutes FEV1 will be measured following the technique 
described in Section 5.1.2 . The reversibility assessment is now complete.
For subjects who need to perform step 2 and/or step 3 of the reversibility testing at visit 
3, the base-line value for the post-BD outcome variable in FEV1 will be derived from the 
value obtained after step 1.
5.1.3 Home PEF testing
An electronic, hand-held spirometer (peak flow meter) will be provided to the subject at Visit 
2, after all respiratory inclusion criteria have been confirmed (see section 3.1 ).
Home PEF testing will be performed by the subject in the morning upon awakening (and prior 
to taking their AM asthma controller) and in the evening at bedtime (and prior to taking their 
PM asthma controller). Recording of home PEF should start from the evening of Visit 2 
(Week -2) until the morning of Visit 29 (Week 52) using an ePEF meter device. When possible, ambulatory lung function measurements should be taken at least 6 hours after the last 
dose of SABA rescue medication.
Subjects should perform 3 successive peak flow manoeuvres while sitting or standing, but in
the same position at every testing; the highest of the 3 values will be captured for the morning 
and for the evening manoeuvres.
The investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to correct use of the peak 
flow meter at each visit as shown in Table 1 (or on EOT visit if prematurely discontinued 
from the study).

5.1.4 Periostin
An IUO/PEO assay is being specifically developed and validated as a companion diagnostic 
for tralokinumab to address the potential identification of a target population with an enhanced 
response rate based on the presence of high serum periostin as an indicator of IL-13 driven asthma. The performance characteristics of the periostin assay have not been established. No 
clinical decision or patient notification should be made based on the results obtained with this 
product.
A baseline periostin concentration level using the investigational assay will be determined for 
each subject enrolled in the trial.  Subject assessment with regards to periostin baseline level 
at Visit 2, will be used for stratification purposes.  Analysis will be performed by the central laboratory.  Blood samples will also be obtained at Visits 3, 9, 16, and 29. These samples may 
be used in existing and/or future clinical studies of in vitro diagnostic assays.
Instructions for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be included in a 
separate laboratory manual provided to the sites.
5.1.5 Level of fractional exhaled nitric oxide
Method of assessment
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE
NO) measurements will be performed at Visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 16, 
23, and 29 (see Table 1 ). Subjects should not use their rescue SABA medication (e.g., 
albuterol/salbutamol) within 6 hours of the measurement. Inhaled BDs (including ICS-LABA) should be withheld for the effect duration specific to the BD.  If not, the visit must be rescheduled.
Measurements will not be performed until 2 weeks after a respiratory infection. Subjects will 
beasked whether they have had a respiratory infection in the 2 weeks prior to measurement, 
which will be recorded as “Yes or No” in the eCRF. Measurement of FE
NOwill be performed 
prior to spirometry at every visit.
FENOwill be measured using a chemiluminescence analyzer  
. Information concerning the specifications and use of the analyzer will be provided 
in a separate instruction manual.
The standard single exhalation technique recommended by the ATS will be followed ( Dweik 
et al 2011 ). 
Signed and dated printouts from the measurements will be kept in the ISF for Source Data 
Verification (SDV). Printouts will be marked with the study code, subject enrolment/ randomization code, date, time of measurement, visit number and subject initials. If a printout 
cannot be printed, the mean value of the measurements will be recorded in the subject’s medical records for SDV.

5.1.6 Safety assessments
5.1.6.1 Laboratory safety assessments
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis 
will be taken at visits in accordance with the schedule outlined in Table 1 .  Haematology. 
Clinical chemistry and urinalysis samples should be collected at unscheduled visits for assessing an asthma exacerbation, at a minimum. Other unscheduled visits may be initiated as needed, and assessments performed as per investigator’s judgement. For dosing visits, all samples will be taken prior to the administration of IP.
Detailed schedules of the chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis tests are presented in Table

A 12-lead dECG will be taken in supine position, after the subject has been resting for at least 
5 minutes. The assessment should be performed before interventions with the subject (e.g.,
spirometry and administration of asthma-related medications and IP).
A standard dECG with a recommended paper speed of 50 mm/second covering at least 6 
sequential beats will be used. The Investigator or authorized delegate will be responsible for 
the overall interpretation and determination of clinical significance of any potential dECG findings. In case of discrepancy between the Investigator’s interpretation and that provided by 
the dECG machine (if applicable), the Investigator’s interpretation takes precedence and 
should be noted on the printout and recorded in the eCRF. Two identical copies of the dECG will be produced and quality checked and kept in case of further need for re-evaluation.
It is highly recommended that the same machine be used for all dECG assessments throughout 
the subject’s participation in the study.
dECG data and evaluation will be performed by the site Investigator and recorded in the 
eCRF.
5.1.9 Vital signs
Pre-dose vital signs (i.e., pulse, blood pressure, respiration rate and body temperature) will be 
obtained in accordance with schedule provided in Table 1 .
Vital signs will be taken prior to blood drawing, IP administration, and, if possible, usual 
asthma controller medication. At Visits 3 through 6, subjects should be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after IP administration for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. For the remaining visits involving IP administration, subjects will be observed for a minimum of 1 hour after IP administration for any such reaction.
Vital signs should also be taken prior to per protocol BD administration, if applicable for that 
visit.
5.1.9.1 Pulse, blood pressure and respiration rate
Pulse rate and blood pressure should be measured after the subject has been resting for at least 
5 minutes. The measurement will be taken in sitting position. Pulse rate will be obtained 
before blood pressure.
Respiration rate will be obtained after subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes, by 
counting number of breaths (i.e., how many times the chest rises) for one minute.
5.1.9.2 Body temperature
Body temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius prior to IP administration, in 
accordance with local standards.

investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to the Asthma Daily Diary at 
each visit as shown in Table 1 .
Home PEF measurement
Details regarding home PEF measurement please refer to section 5.1.3 .
Asthma symptoms
Asthma symptoms during night-time and daytime will be recorded by the subject each 
morning and evening in the Asthma Daily Diary, beginning the evening of Visit 2 until the 
morning of Visit 29.
Daytime is defined as the time period between the morning lung function assessment (upon 
rising in the morning) and the evening lung function assessment. Night-time is defined as the 
time period between the evening lung function assessment (at bedtime) and the morning lung 
function assessment.

5.2.2.2 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)
The ACQ-6 is a shortened version of the ACQ that assesses asthma symptoms (night-time 
waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, and short-
acting β2-agonist use) omitting the FEV 1measurement from the original ACQ score.
Subjects will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by 
responding to 1 question regarding their BD use, and 5 questions pertaining to their asthma 
symptoms.
Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely 
uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤0.75 
indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤1.5 indicate partly controlled 
asthma, and a score >1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006 ). Individual 
changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.
The questionnaire will be completed using the ePRO device.
Visit 1 ACQ-6 scores will determine eligibility for run-in and randomization (see section 3.1
inclusion criterion 11). An initial screening ACQ-6 will be taken at Visit 1 at the study site. 
Subjects will then complete the ACQ-6 at Visit 3, and once randomized, subjects will be 
asked to complete ACQ-6 once every 2 weeks (± 1 day) throughout the treatment period.
The Investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to the ACQ-6 at each visit 
as shown in Table 1 .
5.2.2.3 Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and Older 
(AQLQ(S)+12)
The AQLQ(S)+12 is a questionnaire that measures the health related quality of health-related 
quality of life assessment questionnaire developed for asthma subjects ages 12 and above.
The questionnaire comprises 4 separate domains (i.e., asthma symptoms, activity limitations, 
emotional function, and environmental stimuli).
Subjects will be asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score 
each of the questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The overall score will be calculated as the mean response to all questions. The 4 individual domain scores (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and

Individual improvement in both the overall score and individual domain scores of 0.5 has been identified as a minimally important change. The questionnaire will be completed using the subject’s ePRO device.
The AQLQ(S)+12 will be first completed by the subject at the site at Visit 3 (Week 0), then 
every 4 weeks (±1 day) throughout the treatment period. At the EOT visit the AQLQ(S)+12 will be completed during the visit unless completed the day prior.
The Investigator/authorized delegate will check the subject’s adherence to AQLQ(S)+12 at 
each visit as shown in Table 1 .
5.2.2.4 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom 
Impairment Questions (WPAI+CIQ)
The WPAI+CIQ consists of questions about how asthma and asthma related issues impact a 
subject’s ability to work, attend classes, and perform regular daily activities. The questionnaire relates to the subject’s experience over the previous 7 days. The WPAI+CIQ will be used to measure self-reported productivity loss. The questionnaire will be completed using the subject’s ePRO device.
The WPAI+CIQ will be first completed at Visit 3 (Week 0), then every 2 weeks (±1 day) at 
home throughout 52-week treatment period.
The Investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to WPAI+CIQ at each 
visit as shown in Table 1 .
5.2.2.5 European quality of life-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L)
The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty.
The subject will be asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most
appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also includes a visualanalogue scale, where the subject will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state
The EQ-5D-5L will be completed weekly (+1 day) starting from Visit 3 (Week 0) throughout
Week 52 (Visit 29) using the ePRO device.
The investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to EQ-5D-5L at each visit

Broad-based health care utilization asthma-related event information will be collected by the
Investigator/authorized delegate at each visit (as shown in Table 1 ) and recorded in the
appropriate eCRF module.
At Visit 1, Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU) information will be collected with a ‘one 
year’ recall period. All the subsequent visits will collect HRU information with a recall period of ‘since the last scheduled visit’.
Note : cases of hospitalization must also be reported as an SAE (as described in sections 6.2
and 6.4). 
5.2.2.7 Clinician – Global Impression of Change (CGIC) assessment
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) instrument is used to evaluate the overall 
response to treatment.  The investigator (clinician) will be asked to rate the degree to which 
the overall asthma status may have changed when compared to baseline (i.e. randomization visit/initiation of study drug).  The assessment uses a 7-point rating scale: 1 = Very Much 
Improved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally 
Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.
The CGIC will be completed at the site visits as indicated in Table 1 . It is recommended that 
the same clinician completes the CGIC at all applicable visits for an individual subject. Before 
making the assessment the clinician will need to access and review the results from all relevant assessments including lung function measurements (FEV1 and PEF) and patient 
reported outcomes (Asthma Daily Diary, ACQ-6 and AQLQ) performed before  the visit, 
Adherence to the patient reported outcomes should be closely monitored.
5.3 Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity

date of Last Subject Last Visit. 
A summary of PK analysis results will be reported in the CSR; details of the PK analysis will 
be reported separately in a bioanalytical report.
5.3.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples
Pharmacokinetic samples may be disposed of or destroyed and anonymized by pooling. 
Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymized, pooled pharmacokinetic samples 
to further evaluate and validate the analytical method. Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the Clinical Study Report but separately in a Bioanalytical Report.
Any residual back-up PK samples may be used for future exploratory biomarker research (in 
this case, residual back-up PK samples will be shipped to the AstraZeneca Biobank; see details in the Laboratory Manual).
5.3.4 Immunogenicity 
Instructions for immunogenicity (ADA and nAb) sample collection, processing, storage, and
shipment will be provided in a separate laboratory manual provided to the sites.
Samples used for immunogenicity analyses will be retained at AstraZeneca or designee for a
maximum of 15 years following the Last Subject’s Last Visit.  A summary of the analysis will be presented in the CSR. Details of the analytical method used will be described in a bioanalytical report.
Anti-tralokinumab antibodies
The pre-dose serum samples to measure presence of ADA will be collected according to the
schedule of study procedures (see Table 1 ).
The presence or absence of ADA will be determined in the serum samples using a validated
bioanalytical method. A tiered testing scheme will be employed, with the first step being screening. Samples found positive in the screening step will be tested in the confirmatory step. Samples confirmed positive for ADA in the confirmatory step will undergo endpoint titer determination and will be analyzed for the presence of nAb. 
Neutralizing antibodies
Neutralizing antibodies will be assessed at Visits 3, 16, 30 and 31 according to the tiered 
testing scheme outlined above, as well as at any discontinuation, as indicated.

5.4 Pharmacodynamics
5.4.1 Serum biomarkers
Blood (serum) samples will be collected pre-dose according to the schedule in Table 1 to 
evaluate the pharmacology of tralokinumab, including but not limited to, periostin and DPP4.
The periostin level measured at Visit 2 will also be used for stratification at randomization.
Instructions for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in a
separate laboratory manual provided to the sites. AstraZeneca or a designee will retain serum biomarker samples for investigation of the pharmacology of tralokinumab for a maximum of 15 years following the last subject’s last visit. 
The results from the investigation of such samples may not be reported in the CSR but in 
separate reports and in scientific publications as appropriate.
5.5 Pharmacogenetics
5.5.1 Collection of pharmacogenetic samples (optional)
The collection of blood for a DNA sample for pharmacogenetic research is optional.  Should 
the subject wish to provide a sample for this research, their consent or assent to participate in 
the pharmacogenetic research components of the study is mandatory.  Should a subject not 
wish to provide a sample for this research, he/she will still be allowed to participate in the main study.
The blood sample for genetic research should be obtained from the subjects at Visit 1 (i.e., at 
enrolment).  Although genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding 
subject s who may withdraw due to an AE, such 
subject s would be important to include in any genetic analysis.  If for any reason the sample is

Edition Number 3
Date 
79(127)not drawn at Visit 1 it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  Only one sample 
should be collected per subject for genetics during the study. 
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.5.5.2 Storage, re-use and destruction of pharmacogenetic samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are 
important to maintain subject confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 
years from the date of the Last Subject’s Last Visit, after which they will be destroyed.  DNA is a finite resource that may be used up during analyses. The results of any further analyses
will be reported either in the Clinical Study Report itself, as an addendum, or separately in a 
scientific report or publication.
For all samples, irrespective of the type of coding used, DNA will be extracted from the blood 
sample.  The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information on the 
sample tube. Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by the unique DNA number only.  The DNA number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the 
AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated contract laboratory.  No personal 
details identifying the individual will be available to any person (i.e., an AstraZeneca employee or contract laboratory staff working with the DNA.)
The samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  The link between 
the subject enrolment/randomization code and the DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access within the Clinical Genotyping Group 
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) at AstraZeneca.  The link will be used 
to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit and to trace samples for destruction in the case of 
withdrawal of consent or assent when the subject has requested disposal/destruction of 
collected samples not yet analyzed. 
5.6 Biomarker analysis 
The subject’s consent or assent to the use of donated biological samples for non-exploratory analysis purposes is mandatory.    
Biological samples (i.e., blood, plasma, serum) will be collected and may be analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers to assess correlations with disease activity, effects of study drug, clinical outcomes and toxicity.
5.6.1 Storage, re-use and destruction of biological samples
Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the Last Subject’s Last 
Visit, after which they will be destroyed.  The results of this biomarker research will be reported either in the Clinical Study Report itself or as an addendum, or separately in a 
scientific report or publication. The results of this biomarker research may be pooled with

future research.
5.6.2 Labelling and shipment of biological samples
The Principal Investigator will ensure that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance 
with the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), 
see Appendix C  ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials will not be shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the subject unless agreed with AstraZeneca, and appropriate 
labelling, shipment and containment provisions are approved.
5.6.3 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody will be maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Principal Investigator, or delegate, at each site will keep full traceability of collected 
biological samples from the subjects while in storage at the site until shipment or disposal (where appropriate), along with documentation of receipt of arrival.
The sample receiver will keep full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use 
until used, or disposed of, or until further shipment along with documentation of receipt of arrival.
AstraZeneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, 
monitoring of study sites, and auditing of external laboratory providers.
Samples retained for further use will be registered in  or designate during 
their entire life cycle.
5.6.4 Withdrawal of Informed Consent or Assent for donated biological samples 
If a subject withdraws consent or assent to the use of their donated biological samples that will 
be used for non-exploratory purposes, the samples will be disposed of/destroyed, and the 
action documented.  If samples are already analyzed ,AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the 
results of this research. As collection of the biological samples that will be used for non-exploratory purposes, is an integral part of the study, the subject will be withdrawn from 
further study participation.  Subjects who withdraw their consent/assent for the use of their 
samples to be used for exploratory/future use purposes, will be allowed to continue in the study.
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for ensuring that:
! The subject’s withdrawal of informed consent or assent to the use of donated
samples is notified immediately to AstraZeneca

and that the action is documented and provided to the study site.
6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether 
or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, an 
AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, washout, follow-
up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening
!Requires in-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions
!Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
Revised Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00007
Edition Number 3
Date 
82(127)!Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B  to the Clinical Study 
Protocol.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Adverse Events, including SAEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent or assent form, throughout the treatment period and the follow-up periods (i.e., Visit 
30, Week 56) and Visit 31 (Week 72).
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at any follow up visit in the study will be followed up by the 
Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. 
AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
6.3.3 Adverse event variables 
The following variables will be collected in the eCRF for each AE:
!AE (verbatim)
!The date when the AE started and stopped
!Maximum intensity* of the AE
!Whether the AE is serious or not
!Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or no)
!Action taken with regard to IP
!AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no )
!Outcome
*Intensity rating scale:
1 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2 moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) 
3 severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)
In addition, the following variables (if applicable) will be collected in the eCRF for SAEs:
!Date AE met criteria of serious
!Date Investigator became aware of the SAE
!AE is serious due to
!Date of hospitalization

Date 
83(127)!Date of discharge
!Probable cause of death
!Date of death
!Autopsy performed
!Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
!Description of the AE
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Assessment of causality
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between Investigational Product and each 
Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is provided in Appendix B  to the 
Clinical Study Protocol.
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question 
from the study personnel: ‘Have you/your child had any health problems since the previous 
visit/you were last asked’ , or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the 
CRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values and vital 
signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the 
reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.

the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator will use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin 
value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation,
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases 
in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
6.3.8 Disease progression
Symptoms of the disease under study
Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnoea, breathlessness 
and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs when:
! the sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Section 6.2,
! the subject discontinues the study due to the sign or symptom, and/or
! the sign or symptom is new to the subject or not consistent with the subject’s pre-
existing asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by the investigator.
Asthma exacerbations should not be recorded as AEs after randomization, unless it fulfils any 
of the above criteria.  All asthma exacerbations should be recorded in the exacerbation eCRF 
as per section 5.1.1 .
If a subject discontinues IP due to a study specific discontinuation criterion, this should 
always be recorded as ’Development of study specific withdrawal’ on the termination form in 
the eCRF. In addition, the investigator must assess whether the asthma deterioration should also be reported as an AE leading to discontinuation of IP (DAE)/AE leading to withdrawal 
from study on the AE form.
6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.

Date 
85(127)If any SAE occurs during the course of the study, Investigators or other site personnel must 
inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day (i.e., immediately) but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Subject Safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs, where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel must inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day (i.e., immediately) but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert will be sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative(s).
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative(s) by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative(s) will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to 
proceed.
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s 
Brochure for the AstraZeneca IP.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose with associated AEs is to be recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF, as well as in the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only to be reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose with the AstraZeneca study drug occurs during the course of the study, the 
Investigator, or other site personnel, must inform appropriate AstraZeneca representative(s) 
immediately, and no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Subject Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.4.  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days.

86(127)6.6 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.
6.6.1 Maternal exposure
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study IP should be discontinued 
immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.   The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the subject 
was discontinued from the study.
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
will inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day (i.e., immediately) but 
no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Subject Safety data entry site within 1 or 
5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
The pregnancy module in the eCRF will be used to report the pregnancy and the pregnancy 
outcome module will be used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
6.6.2 Paternal exposure
There is no restriction on fathering children or donating sperm during the study.
6.7 Management of IP related toxicities
Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, H1 and H2 antihistamines, and corticosteroids, as 
well as medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available when IP is being administered.  Study site personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis (Lieberman et al 2010). Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in Appendix G .
Anaphylaxis will be defined as serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death
(Sampson et al 2006). Anaphylaxis typically manifest as 1 of 3 clinical scenarios:
1. The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with involvement of the skin,
mucosal tissue or both and at least one of the following: a) respiratory compromise; or b) reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00007
Edition Number 3
Date 
87(127)2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure: involvement of the 
skin/mucosal tissue, respiratory compromise, reduced blood pressure or associated 
symptoms and/or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure.
Subjects will have had a pre-assessment (i.e., vital signs and lung function) prior to IP 
administration.  At Visits 3 through 6, subjects should be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after IP administration for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. For the remaining visits involving IP administration, subjects will be observed for a minimum of 1 hour after IP administration for any such reaction.
In order to help understand the potential drug-relatedness of any acute reaction, a blood
sample should be drawn during the event for additional ADA testing (if not already scheduledfor this visit). If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis of serum tryptase.  The sample will be tested at the local lab or central lab where applicable.
6.8 Study governance and oversight
6.8.1 Independent Adjudication Committee
Tralokinumab is being developed for the treatment of severe asthma. There is considerable 
variation in the severity of subjects who seek ER or urgent care, and in the clinical thresholds used to determine the need for hospitalization.
An independent adjudication committee, blinded to the treatment of the subjects, will evaluate 
cases of ER or urgent care visits and hospitalizations, as well as all deaths, that occur during the course of the study to confirm that any such event is due to a worsening of asthma. For 
completeness, the adjudication committee will also be tasked with reviewing cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular and malignant adverse events occurring after randomization. The committee will include specialists in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and oncology and will operate 
in accordance with dedicated Adjudication Committee Charter/Manual of Operations.
6.8.2 Data and safety monitoring board
An external DSMB will monitor and protect the safety of adolescent subjects throughout the 
double blind treatment period of the study. The DSMB members will be selected for their expertise. The voting members of the DSMB will be comprised of external individuals including the DSMB chair. To minimize the potential introduction of bias, DSMB members will not have direct contact with the study site personnel or subjects. 
The DSMB will review safety data on a regular basis as set out in the DSMB charter. The data 
for review will be outlined in the DSMB charter The DSMB will have access to individual treatment codes and will be able to merge these with the collected study data while the study

sticks during disposal of the system. 
The APFS consists of a pre-filled syringe su b-assembly (PFS-SA; 1 mL long pre-filled 
syringe barrel with a 1/2 inch 27 gauge thin wall staked in needle, rigid needle shield, plunger 
stopper) and a safety device. 
7.2 Dose and treatment regimens
The IP will be administered at the study site on treatment visits and within visit windows as
specified in Table 1 . An interval of  minimum 7 days  is required between 2 dosing visits.
IP administration
IP will be administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional. The two injections 
should be administered within the same body location, separated by at least 3 cm. The 
injection site must be recorded in the source documents at each treatment visit and recorded in 
the eCRF. 
IP must be equilibrated to room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to dose 
administration.
The person administering the dose will wipe the skin surface of the upper arm, anterior thigh 
or abdomen with alcohol, and allow to air dry. The skin will be pinched to isolate the SC tissue from the muscle. The needle will be inserted at a 90-degree angle approximately halfway into the SC tissue. The IP will be slowly injected (at least 5-second duration is recommended) into the SC tissue using gentle pressure. The area should not be massaged after injection.
It is advised that the site of injection of IP be rotated such that the subject receives IP at a 
different anatomical site at each treatment visit.  The suggested injection site rotation 
sequence is presented below in Figure 2 .

Date 
90(127)In cases when rotation of the injection site is not favorable for the subject and/or Investigator, 
the injection site, along with the reason why the site was changed, should be recorded in the source documents and eCRF for each such occurrence.
Further details on IP administration are provided in the IP Handling Instructions. IP
administration must be carried out according to these instructions.
After IP administration
Subjects will have had a pre-assessment (i.e., vital signs and lung function) prior to IP 
administration.  For the first 4 doses of investigational product, subjects will be monitored 
after IP administration for immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2 hours with vital signs 
taken every 30 minutes or until stable, whichever is later. For the fifth and subsequent doses of IP, subjects will be monitored after IP administration for a minimum of 1 hour with vital 
signs taken every 30 minutes or until stable, whichever is later.
Conditions requiring IP administration rescheduling
If any of the following should occur, the Investigator should reschedule the visit and
IP should not be administered until the rescheduled visit:
! The subject has an intercurrent illness, that in the opinion of the Investigator may 
compromise the safety of the subject in the study (e.g., viral illnesses)
! The subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, is experiencing an acute or emerging asthma 
exacerbation
! The subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C; ≥100.4°F) within 72 hours prior to IP administration
7.3 Labelling
Labelling of the IP will be carried out by AstraZeneca or designee in accordance with Annex 
13 and current GMP and regulatory requirements of each country participating in the study.  The labels will be translated into local languages where applicable and required by local 
regulations.
7.4 Storage
Tralokinumab/placebo is to be stored at the study site in a secured facility with limited access 
and controlled temperature. The temperature should be monitored on daily basis anddocumented in the temperature monitoring log.
The IP must be kept in the original outer container and under conditions specified on the label.In the following cases:

! Damaged kit upon receipt, or
! Damaged syringe/cartridge,
site staff should not use the affected IP, and should immediately contact their AstraZeneca 
representative for further guidance. Damaged IP should be documented via IWRS/IVRS (please refer to the IWRS/IVRS manual for further details).
7.5 Compliance
The date and time of all IP administrations, as well as any missed doses, should be recorded in 
the appropriate section of the eCRF.
7.6 Accountability
The study drugs provided for this study will be used only as directed in the protocol. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that a procedure is established and maintained 
for the operation of the unblinded study drugs, this includes but is not limited to:
! The study drugs are administrated only by a qualified, unblinded health professional 
named in the delegation of responsibility log.
! An unblinded health professional will account for all study drugs dispensed to the 
subjects.
An unblinded health professional, if applicable, or the blinded AstraZeneca monitor will 
account for all study drugs received at the site, unused study drugs and for appropriate 
destruction. Certificates of delivery and destruction should be signed.
In case of malfunctioning APFS, the centre should contact the unblinded AstraZeneca monitor 
to initiate a product complaint process according to applicable guidelines.
7.7 Concomitant and other treatments 
7.7.1 Concomitant medications
Information about any treatment in the 3 months prior to the date of the subject’s informed 
consent or assent, and all the concomitant treatments given during the study, with reason for 
the treatment, will be collected by the Investigator/authorized delegate at each visit (as shown in Table 1 ) and recorded in the eCRF.
Note : to satisfy inclusion criterion 6, the history of continuous treatment with ICS 
corresponding to ≥500μg fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation equivalents plus a 
LABA for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 should be documented in source and recorded in 
the eCRF (see section 4.1.1 ).

Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00007
Edition Number 3
Date 
92(127)Maintenance of asthma controller medication 
All subjects are required to be treated with a stable dose of ICS corresponding to ≥500 μg 
fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation equivalents (as outlined in Appendix F ) and 
LABA for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and during the treatment period. Subjects may also 
receive other physician prescribed asthma controller medications.
The aim of this study is to establish the treatment effect of tralokinumab as an add-on 
treatment and therefore the maintenance asthma controller therapy should be maintained at a 
stable dose from Visit 1 until the end of the treatment period, in order to prevent any 
independent confounding of the anticipated treatment effect of tralokinumab. Changes to the 
subject’s maintenance asthma controller medication regimen are discouraged during the 
treatment period , unless judged medically necessary by the Investigator. Ideally, such 
changes should be discussed with the AstraZeneca Study Team Physician, prior to any change being made. All changes in the subject’s maintenance medication should be documented in 
source along with rational for change and recorded in eCRF.
Maintenance medication is not regarded as an IP, but will be provided/reimbursed by 
AstraZeneca according to local regulations, in order to maintain appropriate oversight and 
access to this concomitant therapy.
Please note that subjects on maintenance treatment with theophylline should have documented 
blood concentration levels within therapeutic range. If this is not documented before signing 
the informed consent, it can be obtained after informed consent has been given or as part of 
the Visit 1 procedures. The sample can be analysed at the central or local lab as applicable.
Rescue medication 
Salbutamol, albuterol, or levalbuterol will be used as rescue medication during the study in the 
event of a worsening of asthma symptoms. As with the maintenance ICS-LABA, rescue medication is not regarded as an IP, but will be provided/reimbursed by AstraZeneca 
according to local regulations, in order to ensure access to essential rescue therapy.
7.7.2 Restrictions during and after the study
7.7.2.1 Asthma medication restrictions
Use of short-acting β2-agonists (SABA)
Regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of any asthma symptoms is discouraged from 
enrolment and throughout the study duration. Prophylactic use of SABA (e.g., prior to planned 
exercise) if deemed necessary by the subject and the Investigator, may be used, but should not 
be recorded in the Asthma Daily Diary. Any such use should be documented in medical notes 
and recorded in the eCRF.
SABA via a metered dose device is permitted as needed for worsening asthma symptoms (i.e., 
rescue use) and will be recorded in the Asthma Daily Diary as number of inhalations.

93(127)Rescue use of SABA administered via jet or ultrasonic nebulization is allowed.  Occasions 
where SABA was administered via nebulization will be recorded separately from metered 
dose inhaler inhalations in the Asthma Daily Diary.  
Use of short acting anticholinergics 
The use of short acting anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium) as a rescue treatment for worsening 
asthma symptoms outside of managing an asthma exacerbation event is not allowed from enrollment and throughout the study duration.
Use of long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) as a reliever
The use of LABA as a reliever (e.g., Symbicort maintenance and reliever treatment) is not 
allowed from enrollment and throughout the study duration.
Use of once daily bronchodilators and theophylline
Use of theophylline and once daily BDs is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.  These 
drugs should have been used at a stable dose for at least 3 months before visit 1. A 48 hour 
minimum wash-out period for theophylline or once-daily BDs is required before spirometry. 
Should the subject be taking theophylline or the once daily BD in the evening, it is advised that the Investigator ask the subject to reschedule their theophylline or BD regimen to 
morning use, if there are no medical reasons to prevent this change.
Asthma medication restrictions on the days of scheduled site visit spirometry
Pre- and/or post-dose spirometry assessments will be performed at the study site at scheduled 
visits (see Table 1 ). Restriction to a subject’s maintenance medication is required prior to the 
spirometry as described below (also see section 5.1.2 ):
Visits 2 and 3
Subjects will be asked to withhold their twice daily BD therapy (including ICS-LABA) on the
morning of the screening FEV
1measurement and reversibility test for 12–24 hours prior to the 
assessment for eligibility (see Section 3.1, inclusion criteria 8and 9).  For once daily BDs the 
required washout time is ≥48 hours.  In case the subject does not meet the reversibility 
eligibility criteria, and a second re-test is done (not earlier than next calendar day and not later than 7 calendar days after the failed attempt), twice daily BDs may be withheld for 24 hours.  
In addition, SABA should not be used within 6 hours of these spirometry assessments.  The 
subject’s usual asthma medications may be administered following completion of the screening lung function procedures.
Treatment Period (Visits 4-29)
It is important that a true pre-BD (i.e., trough) FEV
1reading obtained in order to maintain the 
integrity of planned efficacy analyses around lung function improvement. Therefore, 
subjects will be asked to withhold their usual long acting BD and SABA as outlined in 
the section above for Visits 2 and 3.  The subject’s usual asthma controller medications may 
be administered, following completion of the pre-BD spirometry. The suggested order of

Edition Number 3
Date 
94(127)administration of the subject’s usual asthma controller, per protocol SABA (on visits where 
post-BD spirometry is assessed), and IP administration relative to scheduled pre and post-BD 
spirometry is given in section 5.1.2 .
If the subject has taken their usual ICS-LABA and/or any other BD without an appropriate 
washout period (see Visits 2 and 3 above) before a site visit, the Investigator/authorized 
delegate should remind the subject of the importance of withholding their BD for an appropriate time  and reschedule the visit for another day, within the allowed window. 
If the subject has taken rescue SABA within 6 hours of the planned site visit spirometry they 
should ideally 1) remain at the site until such time that the 6 hour window has been reached or 2) return on another day, within the visit window. If neither of these options is feasible for the 
subject, spirometry may be performed with a notation indicating that the pre-BD spirometry 
was conducted within 6 hours of SABA use.
Asthma medication restrictions prior to home PEF testing 
Subjects should avoid taking their morning asthma controller medication prior to the morning 
home PEF testing, and should conduct the evening home lung function testing before taking evening asthma controller medication. When possible, home PEF testing, should be taken at 
least 6 hours after the last dose of SABA reliever medication
Asthma medication restrictions on unscheduled visits
Asthma medication restrictions on unscheduled visits may not be feasible, and may be applied 
at the discretion of the Investigator. Timing of recent controller and reliever SABA use 
relative to the unscheduled spirometry should be noted in the record.
Asthma medication restrictions at site visits with scheduled dECG assessment
Subjects should be instructed not to take their usual asthma controller medication prior to 
scheduled dECG assessment. Use of SABA should be avoided within 6 hours prior to the dECG assessment.
The medication restriction is waived for the enrolment dECG at Visit 1.
7.7.2.2 Other medication restrictions
! Use of oral or systemic immunosuppressive medication is not allowed.  Topical 
administration of immunosuppressive medication may be allowed at the discretion 
of the Investigator.  Please see section 3.2, exclusion criteria 14and 17for 
examples and further details.
! Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to randomization and 
during the study, including the follow up period, is not allowed. Inactive/killed 
vaccines (e.g., inactive influenza vaccine) are allowed provided they are not administered within 5 days before/after any dosing visit.

than those described above, these medications are to be recorded in the appropriate section of 
the eCRF.
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA
8.1 Statistical considerations
The main objectives of this study are to show efficacy in two tralokinumab dosing regiments 
vs. placebo with regards to asthma exacerbations (primary) and asthma symptom control (key 
secondary). If not otherwise stated, efficacy and safety analyses will be made versus the 
pooled placebo cohorts.
With regards to the key secondary objectives around asthma symptom control; to show 
increased asthma symptom control for tralokinumab vs. placebo the following is considered 
necessary:
a) a significant effect in percent change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1 at 
Week 52 vs. placebo and
b) either a significant effect in mean change from baseline in bi-weekly mean daily 
asthma symptom score (combined daytime and night-time score as captured in the Asthma Daily Diary) at Week 52 ora significant mean change from baseline in 
Standardised AQLQ(S) +12 Total score at Week 52.
Asthma symptom control for a dosing regimen is only to be considered when a significant 
effect with regards to annualised asthma exacerbation rate up to Week 52 has been shown.
Significant results in both the key secondary outcome variables for FEV
1and ACQ-6 could 
provide additional support for increased asthma symptom control.

96(127)A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to first subject 
randomized and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments 
completed prior to unblinding of the data. Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives.
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until the database is 
locked and all protocol violations are identified. 
8.2 Sample size estimate
A total study sample of 1,140 subjects are considered sufficient to show a reduction in AAER for the 2 dosing regimens of tralokinumab, compared to the pooled placebo cohorts (380 
subjects on each active dosing regimen, 190 subjects into each of the Q2W and Q4W placebo 
regimens).  
The sample size calculations are made in terms of subject years at risk and are based on an 
assumed exacerbation rate in the placebo group of 0.8, and shape parameter of 0.95 (over-
dispersion). The methodology used is described in Keene et al 2007 and the sample size is 
calculated for two-sided superiority tests at a significance level of 5% to achieve a power of 
90%.
Assuming a uniform loss to follow-up of 15% during the study 380 randomized subjects per 
group is expected to provide approximately 350 subject-years at risk per treatment group. This 
is expected to provide at least 90% power for treatment effects down to 32% AERR.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
All efficacy analyses will be performed using an ITT approach based on the full analysis set. 
For consistency, demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented using the full

PRO outcome variables will be evaluated based on the full analysis set.
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 General Definitions8.4.1.1 Definition of baseline and subject baseline variablesFor spirometry variables the measurement recorded at the baseline visit (Visit 3) will be used 
as baseline. If the Visit 3 measurement is missing, the last non-missing value before Visit 3 
will be used as baseline instead. For post-BD FEV1, the measurement after the first BD administration is the baseline.
The baseline for the ePRO variables (ACQ-6, AQLQ(s)+12, WPAI-CIQ, and EQ-5D-5L) will 
be captured on the ePRO device at Visit 3. Baseline for Asthma Daily Diary variables will be the bi-weekly mean for data collected between study day -14 and -1 (i.e. 14 to 1 day before 
Visit 3). 
For laboratory data and physical examination, baseline will be defined as the latest non-
missing assessment prior to first dose. 
Absolute change from baseline outcome variables is computed as (post-randomization value –
baseline value). 
Percent change from baseline is computed as ((post-randomization value – baseline value) / 
baseline value) × 100%. If either the post-randomization value or the baseline value is 
missing, then the absolute or percent change from baseline value will also be set to missing.
8.4.1.2 Visit and period windows
For the exacerbation-related analyses no windows will be applied. 
For the patient reported questionnaires collected in the ePRO, the variables will be 
summarized based on the protocol scheduled Days with ± 3-day window. 
For the other questionnaires, the window is the same as the protocol-defined visit windows. 
For local laboratory data, and all vital signs, the visit recorded in the WBDC system will be 
used.

A more detailed definition of visit and period windows will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan.
8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables
8.4.2.1 Exacerbation rateThe primary endpoint is the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) up to Week 52.  
In the statistical analysis, the number of asthma exacerbations experienced by a subject during 
the 52-week double-blind treatment period will be used as response variable, and the 
logarithm of the subject’s corresponding follow-up time will be used as an offset in the analysis to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during which the events occur. 
Asthma exacerbation is defined in Section 5.1.1
In order to calculate the number of exacerbations experienced by a subject during the 52-week 
treatment period the following rule will be applied: 
!The start of an exacerbation is defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids, 
ER or urgent care visits requiring systemic corticosteroids, or hospital admissions due to asthma, whichever occurs earlier, and the end date is defined as the last day of systemic corticosteroids, ER or urgent care visit, or hospital discharge, whichever occurs later. 
Additional systemic corticosteroid treatments, ER or urgent care visits requiring use of 
systemic corticosteroids, or inpatient hospitalization due to asthma occurring during an 
exacerbation should not be regarded as a new exacerbation. In order to be counted as a new exacerbation it must be preceded by at least 7 days in which neither criterion is fulfilled. 
Maximum follow-up time for a subject is approximately 52 weeks; defined as the time from 
randomization to the date of Visit 29. For a subject lost to follow-up, this will be defined as the time from randomization to the time point after which an exacerbation could not be 
assessed. 
For the production of summary statistics, the annual asthma exacerbation rate per subject is 
calculated, and standardized per a 52-week period according to the formula described below.
Annual Exacerbation Rate = No. of Exacerbations*365.25 / (Follow-up date – Visit 3 date + 
1).

treatment
The proportion of subjects with ≥1 asthma exacerbation during the 52 weeks of treatment will 
be a supportive variable to the primary objective. The variable will categorize each subject as 
having at least one asthma exacerbation or not (yes/no).
8.4.2.3 Time to first exacerbation
Time from randomization to the first asthma exacerbation will also be used as a supportive 
variable to the primary objective, and is calculated as follows:
Start Date of first asthma exacerbation − Date of Randomization + 1.
The time to first asthma exacerbation for subjects who do not experience an asthma 
exacerbation during the treatment period will be censored at the date of their last visit for the 
52-week double-blind treatment period, or at the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed.
8.4.2.4 Forced expiratory volume in 1 second
The key secondary variable is the pre-dose/pre BD FEV
1
The percent change from baseline to each of the post-randomization visits (post Visit 3), up to 
and including the end of 52-week double-blind treatment visit (Visit 29), will be used as 
secondary efficacy outcome variable.
The absolute change from baseline to each of the post-randomization visits (post Visit 3) up to 
and including the end of 52-week double-blind treatment visit (Visit 29) will be used as a 
supportive outcome variable.
The same outcome variables will be derived for the secondary variable pre-dose/post- BD 
FEV 1.
8.4.2.5 Forced Vital Capacity and Forced Expiratory Flow at 25-75%
The percent change from baseline to each of the post-randomization visits, up to and including 
the end of 52-week double-blind treatment visit (Visit 29) will be calculated for the exploratory variables FVC and FEF
25-75% .
8.4.2.6 Annualised asthma exacerbation rate associated with an ER or urgent care 
visit or a hospitalization
The AAER associated with an ER or urgent care visit or a hospitalization will be a secondary 
efficacy variable.
The number of asthma exacerbations that are associated with an ER or urgent care visit or a 
hospitalization experienced by a subject during the 52-week treatment period will be derived 
according to the following rule:

Date 
100(127)The start date of an asthma-related ER or urgent care visit or hospitalization is the 
start date of the ER or urgent care visit or hospitalization.
The cessation date of an asthma-related ER or urgent care visit or hospitalization is 
the stop date of the ER or urgent care visit or hospitalization.
In the statistical analysis, the number of asthma exacerbations that are associated with an ER 
or urgent care visit or a hospitalization experienced by a subject during the 52-week double-blind treatment period will be used as response variable, and the logarithm of the subject’s 
corresponding follow-up time will be used as an offset in the analysis to adjust for subjects 
having different exposure times during which the events occur.
Maximum follow-up time is approximately 52 weeks, and the follow-up time is derived a 
described in Section 8.4.2.1
Additionally, for the production of descriptive statistics, the annualised rate of asthma-related 
ER or urgent care visits and hospitalizations will be calculated using the same methodology as 
the annualised rate of exacerbations described in Section 8.4.2.1 .
8.4.3 Calculation or derivation of patient reported outcome variables
Patient-reported outcomes data will be captured via an ePRO device. The definition of key 
secondary and secondary outcome variables are provided in the following sections.
8.4.3.1 Asthma symptom score
Asthma symptoms during night-time and daytime will be recorded by the subject each 
morning and evening in the Asthma Daily Diary. Symptoms will be recorded using a scale 0-3, where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms. Asthma symptom daytime score, night-time score, 
and total score will be calculated separately. 
The total daily symptom score will be calculated by taking the sum of the daytime and night-
time asthma symptom scores for each day. If a subject is missing a value for either daytime or 
night-time asthma symptom score on a given day then the total score for that day will be set to 
missing.
The key secondary outcome variable is the biweekly mean daily asthma symptom total score. 
The daily asthma symptom total score is de fined as the sum of the daytime and night-time 
symptom scores as captured in the Asthma Daily Diary. The biweekly mean is calculated as the mean daily asthma symptom total over 14 sequential days.  If more than 7 daily scores 
(>50%) within that period is missing, then the daily asthma symptom mean score is set to 
‘missing’. 
8.4.3.2 Rescue medication use
The number of rescue medication inhalations and nebulizer treatments taken will be recorded 
by the subject in the Asthma Daily Diary twice daily.

medication on a given day, then the total rescue medication use for that day will be set to missing.
Total rescue medication use, defined as the average number of inhalations (puffs) per day will 
be calculated as the outcome variable.
8.4.3.3 Home peak expiratory flow (morning and evening)
Changes from baseline in morning and evening PEF up to Week 52 will be calculated.
8.4.3.4 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)
In the ACQ-6 questionnaire the subjects are asked to recall the status of their asthma during 
the previous week with regards to symptom and use of short acting β-agonists. The 
questionnaire include questions on
a) Awoken at night by symptoms
b) Limitation of normal daily activities
c) Waking in the morning with symptoms
d) Dyspnoea
e) Wheezef) Daily rescue medication
The questions of the ACQ-6 are measured on a 7-point scale scored from 0 (totally controlled) 
to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 score is computed as the un-weighted mean of the 
responses.
Other variables based on ACQ-6 to report include:
!ACQ-6-responder (Yes=1/No=0)
oResponder: Change from baseline ACQ-6 score #-0.5
oNon-responder :  Change from baseline ACQ-6 score > -0.5
!ACQ-6-responder (improved/No Change / Deterioration)
oImprovement: Change from baseline ACQ-6 score #-0.5
oNo change: -0.5 < Change from baseline ACQ-6 score ∃0.5

8.4.3.5 Asthma quality of life questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S) +12)
The AQLQ(S)+12) will be first completed at Visit 3 (Week 0), which will be used as the 
baseline assessment. Subjects are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 
weeks and to score each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment).
The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. The 4 individual domain 
scores (4 domains assessing 1) symptoms, 2) activity limitations, 3) emotional function, and 4) environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the 
domains. 
The key outcome variable for the AQLQ(S)+12 will be the change in mean score from 
baseline to each of the post-randomization periods. The change from baseline will be derived 
as post-randomization score minus baseline score, there will be no imputation for missing 
values.
Other variables based on AQLQ(S) +12 to be reported include:
!AQLQ(S) +12 -responder (Yes=1/No=0)
oResponder: Change from baseline AQLQ(S) +12 score ≥  0.5
oNon-responder :  Change from baseline AQLQ(S) +12 score < 0.5
!AQLQ(S) +12 -responder (improved/No Change / Deterioration)
oImprovement: Change from baseline AQLQ(S) +12 score ≥  0.5
oNo change: -0.5 < Change from baseline AQLQ(S) +12 score < 0.5
oDeterioration:  Change from baseline AQLQ(S) +12 score  ≤-0.5
8.4.3.6 European quality of life-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L)
The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort 
and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, 
moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty.
The subject will be asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most 
appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also includes a visual analogue scale, where the subject will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0-
100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state.
The change from baseline in visual analogue scale will be calculated by visit.

Broad-based health care utilization event information will be collected by the 
Investigator/authorized delegate at each visit as specified in the protocol and recorded in the 
appropriate eCRF module. Examples include aspects such as unscheduled physician visits or telephone calls or ambulance transport.
8.4.3.8 The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus 
Classroom Impairment Questions (WPAI+CIQ)
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment 
Questions (WPAI+CIQ) will be first completed at visit 3 (Week 0), which will be used as the baseline assessment.
The WPAI+CIQ questionnaire is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses productivity and 
activity impairment over the previous week.
There are a maximum of 10 questions and a minimum of 3 questions that will be completed 
by subjects as follows:
a)
  Currently employed (yes/no)
b) Hours missed work due to health problemsc) Hours missed work due to other reasonsd) Hours actually workede) Degree health affected productivity while working (0-10 scale, with 0 meaning no 
effect)
f) Attends class in an academic setting (yes/no)g) Hours missed class due to health problemsh) Hours actually attended classi) Degree health affected productivity while attending class (0-10 scale, with 0 meaning 
no effect)
j) Degree health affected regular activities (other than work or class) (0-10 scale, with 0 
meaning no effect)
If the answer to question 1 is ‘No, not currently employed’, then the subject should skip to 
question 6. If the answer to question 6 is ‘No, not currently attending class’, then the subject 
should skip to question 10.
The WPAI+CIQ provide 4 scores: 
!Absenteeism (work or class time missed),
!Presenteeism (impairment at work or class/reduced on-the-job effectiveness),

!Presenteeism = Q5/10
!Work Productivity Loss = Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)]
!Activity Impairment = Q10/10

8.4.4 Calculation or derivation of safety variable(s)
The following safety data will be collected: vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead dECG, 
hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and reported AEs.
Change from baseline (Visit 3) to each post-baseline time point where scheduled assessments 
were made will be calculated for relevant measurements. 
8.4.4.1 Adverse events
Adverse events experienced by the subjects will be collected throughout the entire study and 
will be coded by the AstraZeneca designee using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
AE data will be categorized according to their onset date into the following study periods:
!AEs occurring during run-in (onset date ≥visit 1 and before the first dose of study 
treatment) 
!AEs occurring during treatment (onset date ≥the first day of study treatment and ≤
the last day of study treatment + dosing frequency) 
!AEs occurring during follow-up, consisting of AE with
oonset date > the last day of study treatment + dosing frequency and  ≤date of 
week 56; this is only applicable for subjects that are treated for the entire treatment period
oonset date > the last day of study treatment + dosing frequency and  ≤  the last 
day of study treatment + dosing frequency + 4 weeks ; this is only applicable for subjects that prematurely discontinued treatment

Note: Here the ‘dosing frequency’ equals to 2 weeks for subjects randomized to the 2QW 
dosing regimen, and to 4 weeks for subjects randomized to the 4QW dosing regimen.
8.4.4.2 Other significant adverse events
During the evaluation of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs. 
Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after 
consultation with the Global Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant AEs 
(OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain 
events that led to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction, 
or significant additional treatment.
8.4.4.3 Laboratory variables
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis 
parameters will be taken at the times detailed in the CSP, and will be assessed in a central 
laboratory. The parameters outlined in Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 and Table 5 in Section 
5.1.6.1 , will be collected. Laboratory data will be reported in SI units.
Changes in haematology and clinical chemistry variables between baseline and each 
subsequent scheduled assessment will be calculated. Baseline is defined as the last available value measured prior to the first dose of randomized treatment. The change from baseline is 
defined as the treatment period value minus the baseline period value. There will be no 
imputation for missing values.
Absolute values will be compared to the relevant reference range and classified as low (below 
range), normal (within range or on limits) or high (above range). The AstraZeneca extended 
reference ranges will be used for laboratory variables (where they exist). All values (absolute and change) falling outside the reference ranges will be flagged.
Urinalysis data will be categorised as negative (0), trace or positive (+) at each time-point. 
For the purposes of haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis shift tables, baseline will 
be defined as the latest non-missing assessment prior to first dose, and on-treatment will be 
defined as the latest non-missing assessment whilst the subject is ongoing on treatment.
For the liver function tests: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and total bilirubin, the multiple of the 
AstraZeneca ULN (not extended) range will be calculated for each data point.
Multiple = Value / ULN

8.4.4.4 dECGs
Twelve-lead dECG measurements will be recorded in accordance with the protocol, with the 
baseline visit being defined as Visit 1.
The outcome of the overall evaluation is to be recorded as normal/abnormal in the eCRF, with 
any abnormalities being recorded as not clinically significant or clinically significant.
8.4.4.5 Physical examination
Complete and brief physical examinations will be performed at time points specified in Table 1 . 
What is included in the assessment will be dependent on whether the examination is complete 
or brief, as described in Section 5.1.7 . For the brief physical examination, only information on 
whether the assessment was performed or not will be recorded.
Each component of the baseline visit (i.e., Visit 3) complete physical examination will be 
recorded as normal or abnormal. Each component of the follow-up complete physical 
examinations will be recorded as normal, same as baseline, or new/aggravated.
Any new finding(s), or aggravated existing finding(s), judged as clinically significant by the 
Investigator, will be reported as an AE.
8.4.4.6 Vital signs
Pre-dose vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiration rate 
and body temperature) will be obtained in accordance with the schedule provided in Table 1 .
Changes in vital signs variables between baseline and each subsequent scheduled assessment 
will be calculated. Baseline will be defined as the last value prior to the first dose of randomized treatment. The change from baseline will be defined as the treatment period value 
minus the baseline period value. There will be no imputation for missing values.

8.4.5 Calculations or derivation of Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity variables
Blood samples (processed to serum) for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments 
will be collected from all subjects at baseline prior to first IP administration at Visit 3, at 
multiple time points before IP administrations during the treatment period, and at selected timepoints in the follow-up phase of the study. Anti-drug antibodies assessments will be 
conducted utilizing a tiered approach (screen, confirm, titer). These validated methods are 
conducted using a bridging assay format and statistically determined floating screening assay cut point factor and confirmatory assay cut point. The minimal sample dilution is 1:13. Titer 
values are reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that yields a value above the cut 
point. Samples from pre-defined study time points that confirm positive for ADA will also be tested for neutralizing ADA (nAb) activity. Both ADA and nAb will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics as described in Section 8.5.9 .
Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of tralokinumab:
Tralokinumab serum concentrations will be tabulated by time along with descriptive statistics.  
Population PK modelling may also be performed to better characterize the PK of tralokinumab, but will be reported separately from the CSR. 
The incidence rate of ADA to tralokinumab will be reported by tralokinumab treatment group. 
If possible and if relevant, the impact of ADA occurrence on the PK and PD and safety will be 
summarized in the CSR.
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
The main focus for the statistical analysis is to compare both dosing regimens of tralokinumab to placebo, with regards to the primary, key secondary, and safety objectives. 
The analysis of the study endpoints will include all data captured during the 52-week double-
blind treatment period. This includes data regardless of whether study treatment was prematurely discontinued or delayed, and/or irrespective of protocol adherence, unless the 
subject withdraws consent or assent to study participation. 
Summary data will be presented in tabular format by treatment. Categorical data will be 
summarized by the number and percentage of subjects in each category. Continuous variables

decimal places.
8.5.1 Testing strategy for primary and key secondary objectives
The hierarchical testing strategy described below will be used for the primary and key 
secondary outcomes in the two dosing regimens. The described testing strategy will globally strongly control the Type I error (FWER). 
Step 1:
The higher dosing regimen (300 mg tralokinumab Q2W) will be tested versus placebo at a 
two-sided 5% significance level with regards to the primary endpoint.
Step 2:
If a treatment effect is shown with regards to the primary endpoint for Q2W in Step 1, then 
a) the family of key secondary endpoints will be tested for Q2W at a two-sided 4% 
significance level using the hierarchical testing approach described further below. 
b) the primary endpoint will be tested for Q4W dosing regimen using a two-sided test at (at 
least) 1% significance level. Any significance level retained from the key secondary testing family for Q2W (bullet a) above) will be recycled to this test; hence, thesignificance level in this test depends on the results from testing the family of key secondary endpoints for Q2W, as follows:
oCase 1:  All key secondary endpoints exhibits significance for Q2W => 
primary endpoint will be tested for Q4W at level α=0.05
oCase 2:  All key secondary endpoints within the family, except one endpoint in 
Level 2 (see below), exhibits significance for Q2W => primary endpoint will 
be tested for Q4W at level α=0.03
oCase 3:  All other scenarios => primary endpoint will be tested for Q4W at 
level α=0.01
Step 3: 
If treatment effect is shown for the primary endpoint for Q4W in step 2, then the family of key 
secondary endpoints will be tested for Q4W at significance level αretained from Step 2, using 
the hierarchical testing approach described below.

Date 
109(127)In Step 2 and 3 the family of key secondary endpoints will be tested using the following
hierarchical testing structure with strong local FWER control: 
!Level 1: Percent change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1at Week 52 vs. 
placebo will be tested two-sided at significance level αretained from previous step. If 
significant treatment effect is shown, proceed to next level, else stop. All subsequent results within the family will be declared non-significant. 
!Level 2: Mean change from baseline in bi-weekly mean daily asthma symptom score 
at Week 52 and mean change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 Total score at Week 52 
will be tested using a Bonferroni approach at significance α. Hence, each of the 
endpoints will be tested two-sided at significance level α/2 (=0.02 in the Q2W 
comparison, =0.005, 0.015, or 0.025 in the Q4W comparison).
If significant treatment effect is shown in at least one of the endpoints in this level, proceed to 
Level 3, else stop. The subsequent result within the family will be declared non-significant 
and interpreted in a descriptive, exploratory way.
!Level 3: Change from baseline in ACQ-6 will only be tested if at least one of the 
endpoints in Level 2 exhibit significance. Hence, there can be two different outcomes 
in Level 2 resulting in testing the hypothesis for ACQ-6:
oCase 1: Both comparisons in Level 2 exhibit significance => ACQ-6 is testable 
and will be tested at level α(=0.04 in the Q2W comparison, =0.01, 0.03, or 
0.05 in the Q4W comparison
oCase 2: Only one of the comparisons in Level 2 exhibit significance => ACQ-6 
is testable and will be tested at level α/2 (=0.02 in the Q2W comparison, 
=0.005, 0.015, or 0.025 in the Q4W comparison).
8.5.2 Sensitivity analyses
The interpretation of exacerbation data post-discontinuation of treatment is likely to be 
confounded by reduced quality of objective confirmation of deterioration, and by the use of 
subsequent therapies. Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will be carried out to 
explore the impact of this, e.g. exclusion of data post-discontinuation of treatment.
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints based on 
different missing data mechanism assumptions including those expected to be more 
conservative such as missing not at random will be used to explore the robustness of any treatment effect, including multiple imputation approaches.  Full details of the sensitivity 
analyses will be pre-specified in SAP and documented prior to database lock of the studies.

111(127)8.5.6 Analysis of the primary variable
The primary efficacy variable is the AAER and the primary analysis is to compare the AAER 
for tralokinumab with placebo. 
For each dosing regimen the primary objective will be evaluated through the hypothesis test:
H0: rate ratio (tralokinumab/placebo) equals 1 vs.
H1: rate ratio does not equal 1. 
The AAER in the tralokinumab group will be compared to that seen in the placebo group 
using a negative binomial model. The response variable in the model will be the number of 
asthma exacerbations experienced by a subject, over the 52-week double-blind treatment 
period. Covariates and factors included in the model will include at least treatment and the stratifying variables. The logarithm of the subject’s corresponding follow-up time will be used 
as an offset variable in the model to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during 
which the events occur.
The standard parameterization approach (NB2) of the Negative model will be applied ( Hilbe 
2011 ).
The estimated treatment effect (i.e., the rate ratio of tralokinumab versus placebo), 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and two-sided p-value for the rate ratio will be 
presented. In addition, the AAER and the corresponding 95% CI within each treatment group 
will be presented.
The individual exacerbation criteria (ER or urgent care visits due to asthma that required 
systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization due to asthma, or use of systemic corticosteroids) will 
also be summarized descriptively.
8.5.7 Analysis of secondary variable(s)
All efficacy secondary objectives will be analyzed based on the full analyze population.

The percent change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1at Week 52 will be compared 
between tralokinumab and placebo using a repeated measures analysis on all subjects with a 
baseline pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1measurement in the full analysis set. 
The dependent variable will be the percent change from baseline in pre-BD FEV 1at post-
baseline protocol-specified visits (up to the EOT visit). Treatment group and the variables 
used in the stratified randomization will be included as independent variables. Visit will be fitted as a categorical variable, and the variance-covariance matrix will be assumed to be

8.5.7.2 Asthma symptoms
The key secondary outcome variable : Change from baseline in bi-weekly mean daily 
asthma symptom score (combined daytime and night-time score as captured in the Asthma 
Daily).
The change from baseline in asthma symptom total score, daytime score, and night-time score 
at Week 52 will each be summarized and analyzed using the repeated measurement approach 
defined for change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1, as described in Section 8.4.2.4 . 
Included in the model will also be the baseline mean daily asthma symptom score.
8.5.7.3 Asthma specific health-related quality of life
The key secondary outcome variable: Change from baseline in AQLQ(s)+12 total score.  
The change in mean score from baseline for AQLQ(S)+12 at Week 52 will be summarized 
and analyzed using the repeated measurement approach defined for change from baseline in 
pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1, as described in Section 8.4.2.4 . Included in the model will also be the 
baseline AQLQ(s)+12 total score.
Supportive outcome variable: AQLQ(S)+12 responder (yes/no) 
Responder variables AQLQ(S)+12 (yes/no) will be analyzed using a logistic regression model 
with covariates of at least treatment, stratifying variables, and baseline value.
The number and percentage of subjects with AQLQ(s)+12 total score changes ≥0.5 will be 
summarize by treatment (identified as a large meaningful change). Additionally, the number

8.5.7.5 Biomarker positive population based on subject’s baseline periostin or baseline 
DPP4 values
A structured exploration of the relationship between outcome, biomarkers and treatment group 
will be performed to evaluate the potential prognostic and predictive value of biomarkers, in 
order to identify a biomarker positive subpopulation which will be further evaluated in study 
D2210C00008 to confirm the effect of tralokinumab on the primary and key secondary endpoints in this population. The relative and absolute benefit of treatment in relation to the 
size of the potential subpopulation will be considered in selecting the final biomarker positive 
subpopulation. The focus will be on the Q2W treatment regimen compared to placebo, with baseline periostin as the primary biomarker of interest, but also considering baseline DPP4 
values that may be associated with up regulation of IL-13.
The following sequential steps will be taken, with further details of each step to be specified in 
the statistical analysis plan:
!A parametric model will be established for the relationship between exacerbation rate 
and baseline periostin by treatment group as follows:
oExacerbation rate will be analysed, with a negative binomial model including 
covariates of geographical region, number of exacerbations in the year before the study, baseline periostin value, treatment group (with the two placeboregimens pooled), and interaction between periostin value and treatment group. 
oNon-parametric smoothed estimates of the relationship between exacerbation 
rate baseline periostin by treatment group will be produced. This will also be 
repeated for key secondary endpoints.
oThe fit of the parametric model will be assessed in comparison to the observed 
data and to the non-parametric smoothed estimates. If the fit is considered inadequate then alternatives will be considered, initially using a log

Date 
114(127)transformation of baseline periostin value, and then other simple monotonic 
transformations if necessary.
!The selected parametric model will be used to produce estimates of the relationship 
between exacerbation rate and baseline periostin by treatment group which will be 
used to inform the selection of a periostin cut-off to define a biomarker positive subpopulation. Cross-validation will be used to minimise bias due to over-fitting. The selection will be primarily based on the primary endpoint in the Q2W tralokinumab dosing regimen and the pooled placebo regimens. Consideration will be given to the key secondary endpoints if these can further contribute to the choice of an appropriate cut-point.
!The steps above will be repeated using baseline DPP4 in place of periostin to assess 
whether it provides a marked improvement over periostin to identify the final 
biomarker positive subpopulation. 
!The selected parametric model will be used to assess the utility of the selected 
biomarker using a continuous interaction test.
The final biomarker positive subpopulation will then be further studied in study 
D2210C00008 to confirm the effect of tralokinumab on the primary and key secondary 
endpoints in this population. 
8.5.7.6 Other endpoints associated with asthma exacerbations
Proportion of subjects with ≥1 asthma exacerbation
The proportion of subjects with ≥1 asthma exacerbation during the 52 weeks of treatment will 
be addressed as a supportive variable to the primary objective. The proportion of subjects in 
the active tralokinumab arm will be compared with the proportion in the placebo group in both populations using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test controlled for stratifying variables.
The results of the analyses will be presented as weighted difference in the proportion of 
subjects who have ≥1 asthma exacerbation, together with associated 95% CI and 2-sided p-
value for each active dose regimen versus placebo. The number and percentage of subjects 
with ≥1 asthma exacerbation will also be summarized by randomized treatment for both 
populations.
Time to first asthma exacerbation
Time to first asthma exacerbation will be analyzed as another supportive efficacy variable to 
the primary objective to explore the extent to which treatment with tralokinumab delays the time to first exacerbation compared with placebo. A Cox proportional hazard model will be 
fitted to data with including treatment and at least stratifying variables as covariates.
Results of the analysis will be summarized as hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p-
values.

summarized and analyzed in the same way as rescue medication use, below.
Rescue medication use
Total rescue medication use (average puffs/day) will be analyzed as the response variable by 
fitting a linear model to the data. Treatment group will be fitted as the explanatory variable, 
and at least stratifying variables will be fitted as covariates.  The results will be presented in terms of LSMEANS, difference between treatments in LSMEANS, and 95%CI. The number 
and percentage of subjects within each treatment group who received rescue medication will 
be summarized by visit.

8.5.8 Safety and tolerability
All safety variables will be summarized using the safety analysis set and data presented 
according to treatment received.
8.5.8.1 Adverse events
AEs will be summarized separately for the treatment and follow-up periods, as defined in 
Section 6.3. AEs occurring during the run-in period, or occurring post-treatment (as per the 
definition above) will be listed, but not summarized.
An overall summary table will be produced showing the number and percentage of subjects 
with at least 1 AE in any of the following categories; AEs, SAEs, deaths due to AE, DAEs, 
and other significant adverse events (OAEs). The total number of AEs in the different AE 
categories in terms of AE counts will also be presented (i.e., accounting for multiple occurrences of the same event in a subject).
AEs will be summarized by SOC and PT assigned to the event using MedDRA. For each PT, 
the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least one occurrence will be presented i.e., for a subject multiple occurrences of an AE will only be counted once.
AEs (by PT) will be summarized by causality and maximum intensity. If a subject reports 
multiple occurrences of the same AE, the maximum intensity will be taken as the highest recorded maximum intensity (the order being mild, moderate, and severe). SAEs, OAEs, 
DAEs, and deaths will also be summarized in separate tables.
The rate of AEs per person-years at risk, calculated as (number of subjects reporting AE)/       
(total time at risk of AE), will also be reported. Rates will typically be expressed in terms of 
events per 100 subject-years.
Separate listings of subjects with AEs, SAEs, death due to AE, or discontinuations due to AEs 
will be presented.
8.5.8.2 Laboratory data
All continuous laboratory parameters will be summarized by absolute value at each visit by 
treatment group, together with the corresponding changes from baseline. The summary statistics presented will be the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, maximum, mean 
and SD. Mean changes from baseline over time will also be plotted by treatment group.
AstraZeneca defined extended reference ranges will be used for the identification of 
individual clinically important abnormalities, and a shift table will be produced for each 
laboratory parameter to display low, normal, high, and missing values. The shift tables will

117(127)present baseline and maximum/minimum on-treatment value, as applicable for each 
parameter.
Shift plots showing each individual subject’s laboratory value at baseline and at 
maximum/minimum will be produced for each continuous laboratory variable. If any 
laboratory variables show any unusual features (high or low values or a general shift in the 
data points) at other time points then shift plots of these data may be produced. A diagonal line indicating no change, and horizontal and vertical reference lines indicating the limits of 
the AstraZeneca defined reference ranges will also be displayed on the shift plots.
Data for subjects who have treatment-emergent changes outside the predefined criteria will be 
presented. This data presentation will include all visits for this subset of subjects.
The frequency of changes with respect to normal ranges between baseline and each post-
treatment time point will be tabulated. Frequencies of clinically noteworthy values (using AstraZeneca defined reference ranges) occurring during the clinical study will also be given.
In order to identify potential Hy’s Law cases, maximum post baseline total bilirubin will be 
plotted against maximum post baseline ALT, expressed as multiples of ULN. This plot will be repeated to show maximum post baseline total bilirubin against maximum post baseline AST, 
expressed as multiples of ULN. These plots will be produced on a log scale and reference 
lines will be included at 2xULN for total bilirubin and at 3xULN for ALT/AST. 
For all subjects who meet the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law (potential Hy’s Law), a 
Subject Safety Narrative will be produced, and the relevant laboratory parameters will be 
tabulated showing all visits for these subjects. Subjects with elevated ALT or AST, and elevated total bilirubin, at any time may be explored further graphically using individual 
subject profile plots.
For urinalysis data, a shift table will be generated to present changes from baseline to EOT. 
The number of subjects with treatment-emergent changes will also be summarized. Here, 
treatment-emergent changes are defined as None/Trace at baseline to Positive, at any visit 
after baseline.
Any data outside the AstraZeneca normal and extended reference ranges will be explicitly 
noted on the listings that are produced.

8.5.8.6 Analysis of Immunogenicity variables
ADA status (positive vs. negative) at each visit will be summarized by treatment group. 
Descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, and range of the actual ADA titers by treatment group and visit, where possible, will be provided. 
The ADA status across the study for each subject (positive vs. negative) will also be classified 
and summarized by treatment group. The association of ADA status across the study (positive vs. negative) with AEs/SAEs may be evaluated. In addition, the association of ADA titers 
(≥median titer in positive subjects vs. < median titer) with AE/SAEs may be evaluated for 
ADA-positive treated subjects only. The ADA-positive subjects across the study may also be divided into persistent positive versus transient positive. A subject will be considered as 
persistent positive if he/she has positive ADAs for at least two consecutive visits. Otherwise, 
the subject will be considered as transient ADA positive. The associations between ADA and AE/SAEs may be summarized for both persistent positive subjects versus transient positives 
subjects. 
Neutralizing antibody evaluations will be conducted on those serum samples that test positive 
for ADA at end of treatment and also during the study follow up period.  The test sample is 
deemed positive or negative for the presence of nAb to tralokinumab relative to a pre-
determined (in assay validation), statistically derived cut point.  Samples positive for nAb to tralokinumab are then titered to determine relative amounts of nAb present in each test 
sample.
For ADA, all subjects with titer information will be shown in the data listing.8.5.9 Analysis of pharmacokinetics
All analyses of pharmacokinetics variables will be based on the PK data set, all analyses on 
Immunogenicity variables will be based on the safety analysis set.
Due to the limited sampling schedule, the PK assessment will be primarily based on the 
observed steady-state serum trough (pre-dose) concentrations, C
trough. Empirical evaluation of 
potential impact of demographic covariates and ADA on C trough will be conducted.

123(127)medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an Investigator might know a subject’s 
identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also Regulatory authorities may 
require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
10.3 Ethics and regulatory review
An Ethics Committee (EC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) should approve the final study 
protocol, including the final version of the subject’s ICF (and assent form for subjects under 
the age of majority), and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to a subject.  The Investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable 
EC/IRB, and to the study site staff.
The opinion of the EC/IRB should be given in writing. The Investigator should submit the 
written approval to AstraZeneca before enrolment of any subject into the study. 
The EC/IRB should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study.
AstraZeneca should approve any modifications to the ICF (and/or assent form for subjects 
under the age of majority) that are needed to meet local requirements.
If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-approved by the EC/IRB annually.
Before enrolment of any subject into the study, the final study protocol, including the final 
version of the ICF (and assent form for subjects under the age of majority), should be 
approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the national regulatory 
authority is done, according to local regulations.
AstraZeneca will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory 
authorities.
AstraZeneca will provide Regulatory Authorities, ECs/IRBs and Principal Investigators with 
safety updates/reports according to local requirements.
Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the EC/IRB with reports of any 
serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the IP.  AstraZeneca will provide this information to the Principal Investigator so that he/she can meet 
these reporting requirements.
10.4 Informed consent and assent
The Principal Investigator(s) at each site will:
!Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study
!Ensure each subject is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any 
time
Revised Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00007
Edition Number 3
Date 
124(127)!Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to 
consider the information provided
!Ensure each subject provides signed and dated informed consent (and assent form for 
subjects under the age of majority) before conducting any procedure specifically for 
the study
!Ensure the original, signed ICFs (and assent form for subjects under the age of 
majority) are stored in the Investigator’s Study File
!Ensure copies of the signed ICFs (and assent form for subjects under the age of 
majority) are given to the subject
!Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for subjects harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in the informed consent or assent form that is approved by an Ethics Committee.
10.5 Changes to the protocol and informed consent or assent forms
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the International co-
ordinating Investigator, and AstraZeneca.
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study 
protocol (Revised Clinical Study Protocol).
The amendment is to be approved by the relevant EC/IRB and if applicable, also the national 
regulatory authority approval, before implementation.  Local requirements are to be followed 
for revised protocols.
AstraZeneca will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of the protocol to 
each Principal Investigator(s). For distribution to ECs/IRB, see Section 10.3.
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a site’s ICF (and/or assent form for subjects 
under the age of majority), AstraZeneca and the site’s EC/IRB are to approve the revised ICF (and/or assent form for subjects under the age of majority) before the revised form(s) is/are 
used. 
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved 
by each EC/IRB.
10.6 Audits and inspections
Authorised representatives of AstraZeneca, a re gulatory authority, or an EC/IRB may perform 
audits or inspections at the site, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and 
documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP, guidelines of the ICH, and 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol

2(3) FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 
Life threatening 
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death.  ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure). 
Hospitalisation 
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious. 
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. 
Examples of such events are:  
x Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment 
x Hepatotoxicity caused by parace tamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
x Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation 
x Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix B 
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354) 
Study Code D2210C00007 Edition Number 1.0 
Date  
3(3) A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CAUSALITY QUESTION 
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility” that an AE may have been caused by the drug. 
x Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the suspect drug? 
x Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
x Dechallenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug? 
x No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. 
x Rechallenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a rechallenge. 
x Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship? 
A “reasonable possibility” could be  considered to exist for an AE where one or more of these 
factors exist. 
In contrast, there would not be a “reasonable pos sibility” of causality if none of the above 
criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course but any 
dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of 
the AE. 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
x Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug? 
x Is there a known mechanism? 
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this.  Causal relationship in 
cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified 
as no reasonable possibility.

2(3) LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES 
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.
htm).  For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition (2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt.  
There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B. 
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus: 
x are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602. 
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shipping name: 
x UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B 
x are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens 
x Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations 
x Clinical trial samples will routinely be  packed and transported at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.
htm)  
x Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry-ice content  
x IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as 
applicable

3(3) x Samples routinely transported by road or rail are subject to local regulations which 
require that they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to 
contain any risk of infection or contamination by using approved couriers and 
packaging / containment materials at all times.  The IATA 650 biological sample 
containment standards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport is used.

4(7) 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
AstraZeneca intends to perform genetic research in the tralokinumab clinical development 
programme to explore how genetic variations may affect the clinical parameters associated 
with tralokinumab.  Collection of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from populations 
with well described clinical characteristics may lead to impr ovements in the design and 
interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to tralokinumab, but also susceptibility to asthma for which tralokinumab may be evaluated.  Thus, this genetic research may involve study of additional un-named genes or 
gene categories, but only as related to asthma. 
2. GENETIC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this research is to collect and store DNA for future exploratory research into 
genes/genetic variation that may influence the clinical response (ie, distribution, safety, 
tolerability and efficacy) to tralokinumab. 
3. GENETIC RESEARCH PLAN AND PROCEDURES 
3.1 Selection of genetic research population 
3.1.1 Study selection record 
All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research.  Partic ipation is voluntary and 
if a subject declines to participate there will be  no penalty or loss of be nefit.  The subject will 
not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. 
3.1.2 Inclusion criteria 
For inclusion in this genetic research, subjects must fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described 
in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol  (CSP) and: 
x Provision of signed and dated written in formed consent for pharmacogenetic 
sampling and analyses.  If a subject declines  to participate in the pharmacogenetic 
research, there will be no consequence or loss of bene fit to the subject.  The subject 
will not be excluded from the other aspects of  the study described in this CSP, as 
long as they consent to participate in the main study 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D 
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354) 
Study Code D2210C00007  Edition Number 1.0 
Date  
5(7) 3.1.3 Exclusion criteria 
Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the 
main study or any of the following: 
x Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant 
x Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of genetic sample 
collection 
3.1.4 Discontinuation of subjects from this genetic research 
Specific reasons for discontinuing a subject from this genetic research are: 
Withdrawal of consent for genetic research:  Subjects may withdraw  from this genetic 
research at any time, inde pendent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of 
the main study.  Voluntary discontinuation w ill not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures 
for discontinuation are outlined in Section 3.10  of the main CSP. 
3.2 Collection of samples for genetic research 
The blood sample for genetic research will ideally be obtained from the subject at Visit 1, but 
may be taken at any later visit if Visit 1 is not suitable.  Although genotype is a stable 
parameter, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such subjects would be important 
to include in any genetic analysis.  Only 1 sample should be collected per subject for genetics 
during the study.  Samples will be collected, la belled, stored and shi pped as detailed in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
For the volume of blood to be drawn from each subject for this sample, see Table 6  in Section 
5.1.6 of the main 
CSP. 
3.3 Coding and storage of DNA samples 
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are 
important to maintain subject confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 
15 years, from the date of the Last Subject La st Visit after which they will be destroyed.  
DNA is a finite resource that may be used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and 
used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. 
For all samples irrespective of the type of coding used the DNA will be extracted from the 
blood sample.  The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information 
on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by the unique DNA 
number only.  The DNA number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated contract laboratory.  No personal 
details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or 
contract laboratory personnel working with the DNA).

6(7) 4. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics 
research component, are outlined in Section 10  of the main CSP. 
4.1 Informed consent 
The genetic component of this study is optional and the subject may participate in other 
components of the main study without participating in the genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the informed 
consent form for the main study and the genetic component of the study.  Copies of both the 
signed and dated written informed consent forms mu st be given to the subject and the original 
filed at the study centre.  The Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that consent 
is given freely and that the subjects understand that they may freely discontinue from the 
genetic aspect of the study at any time. 
4.2 Subject data protection 
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype re sults to subjects, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician, or any other third party, unless 
required to do so by law. 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentia lity and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the subject.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal identifie rs of a subject.  For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an Investigator might know a subject’s 
identity and also have access to his or her ge netic data.  Also Regu latory Authorities may 
require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic 
files would remain physically separate. 
5. DATA MANAGEMENT 
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored in the AstraZeneca genotyping LIMS 
database, or other appropriate secure system within AstraZeneca and/or third party contracted 
to work with AstraZeneca to analyze the samples. 
The results from this genetic research may be reported in the Clinical Study Report for the 
main study, or in a separate report as appropriate. 
Genotype data will be tran sferred to the clinical database, and merged with the clinical data 
from the main study, prior to the statisti cal analysis and reporting of the study.

7(7) 6. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE 
The number of subjects that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unknown.  It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether suffic ient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statistical evaluation or whether only descriptiv e statistics will be gene rated.  A statistical 
analysis plan will be prepared where appropriate.

3(6) 1. INTRODUCTION 
During the course of the study the Investigator  will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. 
The Investigator participates, together with Ast raZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alte rnative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP).  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. 
2. DEFINITIONS 
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) 
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)  3x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL)  2xULN at any point during the study irrespective 
of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).  The elevations do not have to occur at the 
same time or within a specified time frame. 
Hy’s Law (HL) 
AST or ALT  3x ULN and TBL  2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can 
be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, 
viral hepatitis, another drug.  The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a 
specified time frame. 
3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES 
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination: 
x ALT  3xULN 
x AST  3xULN 
x TBL  2xULN 
 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix E 
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354) 
Study Code D2210C00007 Edition Number 1.0 
Date  
4(6) When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to AstraZeneca 
representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilant  for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met, where th is is the case the Investigator will: 
x Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory 
x Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original 
local laboratory test result 
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator 
will without delay: 
x Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section  2 of this Appendix 
for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits (including 
both central and local laboratory results) 
4. FOLLOW-UP 
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met 
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
x Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria. 
x Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. 
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met 
If the patient does meet PHL cr iteria the Investigator will: 
x Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team  
x The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and 
agree an approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of 
data.  Subsequent to this contact the Investigator will: 
x Monitor the patient until liver biochemistr y parameters and a ppropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated  
x Investigate the etiology of the event a nd perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix E 
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354) 
Study Code D2210C00007 Edition Number 1.0 
Date  
5(6) x Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available  
x If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures 
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES 
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. 
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP.  The AstraZeneca Medical Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be 
involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.   
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the 
instructions below. 
If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alte rnative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: 
x If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF 
x If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP: 
x Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s La w’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes.  
The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply 
As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned. 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made: 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix E 
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354) 
Study Code D2210C00007 Edition Number 1.0 
Date  
6(6) x Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy ’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causality assessment as per above 
x Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the 
outcome of the review

2(5) 1. INTRODUCTION 
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dos e administration are possible. The World Health 
Organization has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which are clinically 
indistinguishable: immunologic [IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated (e.g., IgG and immune 
complex mediated) and nonimmunologic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this study are listed in section 2. A guide to the signs and symptoms 
and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in section 3. Appropriate drugs, such as 
epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc,  and medical equipment to treat anaphylactic 
reactions must be immediately available at study sites, and study personnel should be trained 
to recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines.  
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the patient as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for 
analysis of serum tryptase. 
2. CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR DEFINING ANAPHYLAXIS AND 
IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE 
Anaphylaxis 
In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when an y one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: 
 
(a) Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia). 
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). 
 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely  allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours): 
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch-flush, 
swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
(b) Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia). 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix G 
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354) 
Study Code D2210C000007  Edition Number 1.0 
Date  
3(5) (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence). 
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting). 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours): Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that patient’s baseline.
 
Immune Complex Disease 
Immune complex disease or Hypersensitivity Type III is evoked by the deposition of antigen-
antibody or antigen-antibody-complement co mplexes on cell surfaces, with subsequent 
involvement of breakdown products of complement, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and development of vasculitis; serum sickness and nephritis is common. 
3. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE 
ANAPHYLAXIS 
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multi-system allergic reaction in which some or 
all of the following signs and symptoms occur:  
- Diffuse erythema - Pruritus 
- Urticaria and/or angioedema 
- Bronchospasm - Laryngeal edema 
- Hypotension 
- Cardiac arrhythmias - Feeling of impending doom 
- Unconsciousness 
- Shock 
Other earlier or concomitant si gns and symptoms can include: 
- Itchy nose, eyes, pharynx, genitalia, palms, and soles 
- Rhinorrhea

4(5) - Change in voice 
- Metallic taste 
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and bloating - Lightheadedness 
- Headache 
- Uterine cramps - Generalized warmth 
4. MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ANAPHYLAXIS 
4.1 Immediate intervention 
1. Assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and adequacy of mentation 
2. Administer epinephrine intramuscularly every 5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as 
necessary, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control signs 
and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, hypotension, shock and unconsciousness. 
4.2 Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures depending on response 
to epinephrine 
(a) Place patient in recumbent position and elevate lower extremities. 
(b) Establish and maintain airway. 
(c) Administer oxygen. 
(d) Establish venous access. (e) Normal saline IV for fluid replacement. 
4.3 Specific measures to consider after epinephrine injections, where 
appropriate 
(a) Consider epinephrine infusion. 
(b) Consider H1 and H2 antihistamines. 
(c) Consider nebulized ȕ2 agonist [e.g., albuterol (salbutamol)] for bronchospasm 
resistant to epinephrine. 
(d) Consider systemic corticosteroids.

5(5) (e) Consider vasopressor (e.g. dopamine). 
(f) Consider glucagon for patient taking b-blocker. 
(g) Consider atropine for symptomatic bradycardia. (h) Consider transportation to an emergency department or an intensive care facility. 
(i) For cardiopulmonary arrest during anaphylaxis, high-dose epinephrine and 
prolonged resuscitation efforts are encouraged, if necessary.

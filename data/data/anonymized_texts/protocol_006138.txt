Safety  Objective
•To determine the safet y and tolerability profile of SMT + Albutein 20% administration in 
subjects with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites
Overall Study Design and Description:
Approximately  410 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites will be included in this 
study  after obtaining written informed consent. The study  population will consist of subjects 
who have been hospitalized for acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis with ascites (or with 
prior history  of ascites requiring diuretic therapy ) with or without ACLF at admission or 
during hospitalization, but without ACLF at Screening . 
There will be a screening period for enrollment of each hospitalized subject i n the study . 
Screening should occur while the subject is hospitalized. Randomization must occur within 
72 hours of screening, and it can occur while the subject is hospitalized or after discharge 
from the hospital. T he first dose of Albutein 20%  is administred on the same day  as 
randomization.   
Randomization of subjects will be stratified by region (Europe or North America [NA]) and 
by whether or not subjects have been previousl y hospitalized for acute decompensation of 
liver cirrhosis prior to the most recent hospitalization for acute decompensation of liver 
cirrhosis with ascites as required b y Inclusion Criterion #3v4 ( below ). Within each stratum 
(ie, each unique combination of region and history of hospitalization for acute 
decompensation of liver cirrhosis), e ligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 
1of 2treatment groups:
•SMT + Albutein 20% 
•SMT (control group)
SMT + Albutein 20% Treatment Group
Approximately  205 subjects will be randomized to the SMT + Albutein 20% treatment 
group. Screening should occur while the subject is hospitalized. Randomization must occur 
within 72 hours of screening, and it can occur while the subject is hospitalized or after 
discharge from the hospital . The first dose of Albutein 20%  is a dministred on the same day  
as randomization  at the dose of 1.5 g/kg bod y weight (maximum 100 grams per subject ). 
Thereafter, subjects will receive Albutein 20% infusions at the dose of 1.5 g/kg bod y weight 
(maximum 100 grams per subject) every  10 ± 2 day sfor the rest of the study  (up to a 
maximum of 12 months). Subjects in this treatment group will also receive SMT.6 of 87

SMT Group
Approximately  205 subjects will be randomized to the control group and receive SMT . 
Screening should occur while the subject is hos pitalized. Randomization must occur within 
72 hours of screening, and it can occur while the subject is hospitalized or after discharge
from the hospital. Following randomization, subjects randomized to this group will receive 
SMT, which will be administer ed per institution standards.
The treatment period in the study  will be up to 12 months. S ubjects in both treatment groups 
(SMT + Albutein 20% and SMT alone ) will be followed for up to 12 months. During the 
entire study , the safety  of both treatment groups will be monitored by  a Data Safet y 
Monitoring Board.
Primary Endpoint and Secondary Endpoints:
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is to compare the 1- year transplant -free survival in the intent-
to-treat (ITT) population between the SMT + Albutein 20% treatment group and the SMT 
alone group.
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints are to assess the effects of SMT + Albutein 20% treatment 
versus SMT alone on: (1) 3- and 6 -month transplant -free and overall survival, (2) 1- year 
overall survival, and (3) total number of pa racenteses and the incidence of refractory  ascites.
Number of Subjects Planned:
Approximately  410 subjects will be enrolled in this study . These subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio into the SMT + Albutein 20% treatment group or the SMT control group.
Study Centers Planned:
Approximately  40 study  centers in the United States and Europe will participate in this study .

IG1601 - Prevention of Mortality with Long-Term Administration of Human Albumin in Subjects with
Decompensated Cirrhosis and Ascites
Effective
Study  Population
There will be 3 anal ysis populations in this study ; 2 populations for efficacy  assessment and 
1 population for safet y evaluation.
The ITT population is defined as all subjects who are randomized .The ITT population will 
be used for all efficacy  analy ses.Subjects will be grouped according to the treatment to 
which they  are randomized in all efficacy  anal yses.
The Per -
Protocol (PP) population is defined as the subset of subjects included in the ITT 
population who do not present major protocol violations wh ich might have an impact on the 
primary  efficacy  anal ysis, complete at least 80% of the scheduled treatments and are not 
excluded from the study  for interrupting the Albutein 20% treatment for more than 4 
consecutive weeks (SMT + Albutein 20% treatment gro up subjects). The primary  efficacy  
analyses will be carried out using the PP population in order to confirm the results based on 
the ITT population.
The Safet y population is defined as the subset of patients who receive at least one 
SMT +Albutein 20% admi nistration or SMT alone. Safet y analyses will be based on this 
population. Subjects will be grouped according to the treatment they  actually  received in all 
safet y analyses.
Primary  Efficacy  Anal yses
This is a study  to demonstrate superiorit y of SMT + Albutein 20% to SMT alone on 1- year 
transplant -free survival. The null hy pothesis is that the hazard functions for liver 
transplantation or death are the same for the 2 treatment groups, or equivalently , the hazard 
ratio is equal to 1. The alternative h ypothesis is that the hazard functions for liver 
transplantation or death are not the same for the 2 treatment groups, or equivalently , the 
hazard ratio is not equal to 1. The effect of SMT + Albutein 20% administration on the 
transplant -free survival at 1 y ear after randomization versus SMT alone will be summarized 
by means of Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and curves and compared between treatment 
groups b y means of the Log -rank test stratified b y region (Europe or NA) and history  of 
hospitalization for acu te decompensation of liver cirrhosis (y es or no) .An un -stratified 
analysis will be performed as a sensitivity  analy sis.
In the event that clinically and statisticall y significant imbalances are observed between 
treatment groups in any of subjects’ baselin e characteristics, sensitivity  analy ses will be 
performed in which treatment effects will be adjusted by  those characteristics by  fitting an 
appropriate Cox Proportional- Hazards (PH) model. In addition, subgroup analy ses b y age 
group, sex, race, region (Europe vs NA) , and history  of hospitalization for acute 
decompensation of liver cirrhosis (yes vs no) will be carried out for the primary  endpoint.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be carried out on the ITT population and repeated on the 
PP population.

The anal ysis of the secondary  endpoints will be performed using the ITT population.
The effects of SMT + Albutein 20% administration on the overall survival at 3, 6, and 12 
months and transplant- free survival at 3 and 6 months aft er randomization versus SMT alone 
will be assessed b y carr ying out the same anal yses for the primary  efficacy  variable described 
above.
Total number of paracenteses and incidence of refractory  ascites will be listed for each 
subject, summarized by  treatmen t group, and compared between treatment groups by  means 
of anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or Student’s t test (for normall y-distributed variables), 
Poisson regression model (for count variables), and Fisher’s exact test or Chi -square test (for 
binomial va riables).
The fixed- sequence testing method will be used to adjust for multiplicity  in the anal yses of the 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints.
Exploratory  Anal yses
As appropriate to the data, the original values or changes from baseline (last measurement 
taken prior to the start of study  treatment on Day  1) of the following exploratory  endpoints 
will be listed for each subject, summarized by  treatment group, and compared between 
treatment groups by means of ANCOVA or Student’s t tests (for normall y-distributed 
variables), non -parametric Mann- Whitney  U test (for non -parametric variables), Kaplan -
Meier estimates and Log -rank test (for time -to-event variables), Poisson regression model (for 
count variables), and Fisher’s exact test or Chi- square test (for binomial va riables): 
Incidence of ACLF, CLIF -C OF score, CLIF -C ACL F score, CLIF -C AD score, MELD score, 
Child Pugh score, number and length of hospital readmission for an acute complication of 
cirrhosis, number and length of ICU admission, incidence of disease -related complications, 
serum albumin concentration, albumin functional capacity (albumin binding capacity ), 
incidence of insertion of TI PS for refractory  ascites, and the EQ-5D- 5L health questionnaire .
For the normally -distributed variables, the ANCOVA model w ill include change from 
baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed factor, and baseline value as a 
covariate. If any potential confounders are identified among subjects’ baseline characteristics, 
they will be included as additional covariates
in the ANCOVA models to adjust treatment 
effects. In addition, for the longitudinal measurements taken repeatedl y over time, the 
treatment effects may  be explored by  using the mixed -effect model repeated measures 
analysis.
Safety  Anal ysis
The safet y analyses will be addressed by  listing and tabulation of AEs (including suspected 
ADRs), vital signs, ph ysical assessments, and clinical laboratory  tests. Data will be described 
using descriptive anal yses and treatment comparisons will be based on review of desc riptive 
statistics. The safet y analyses will be based on the Safety population.16 of 87

Decompensated Cirrhosis and Ascites

Determination of Sample Size
Based on the CANONIC study , the overall 1- year transplant -free mortalit y rate in the current 
study  population is assumed to be about 46%. Assuming a potential drop -out rate of 20% and 
5% ty pe-1 error for a 2 -sided Chi-square test, a global sample size of 410 patients (205 per 
treatment group) will allow an 80% statistical power to detect an absolute reduction of 15% 
for the 1- year mortalit y rate in s ubjects treated with SMT + Albutein 20%.
Alternativel y, the sample size was calculated based on the log -rank test as follows. Assuming 
the 1- year transplant or mortality  rate is 46% for the control group, or equivalently , the 
transplant -free survival rate is 54%, which translates to a hazard rate of 0.0017 assuming an 
exponential distribution. Using a log-rank test at the 2- sided significant level of 5%, a total of 
125 events would provide at least 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15% in 
transpl ant or mortality  rate (a 31% 1
-year transplant or mortality  rate, or equivalently , a 69% 
transplant -free survival rate) in subjects treated with SMT + Albutein 20%. This absolute 
difference in transplant or mortality  rates translates to a hazard ratio of 0 .6022, or an 
approximate 40% risk reduction. With all subjects followed for the entire 1 -year duration of 
the study , a total of 322 subjects would be required to obtain 125 events. Assuming a dropout 
rate of 20%, a global sample size of 404 subjects (202 p er treatment group) is required. This 
sample size calculation was performed using Proc Power with the Twosamplesurvival 
statement in SAS version 9.4.
Taking a conservative approach, the larger of the 2 sample sizes (ie, the one based on the Chi -
square test) will be used to ensure the study  has sufficient power.17 of 87

2BACKGROUND IN FORM ATION
In addition to the information provided below, please also refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) (1) and any  additional data supplied by  the sponsor.
2.1 Name and Description of the Investigational Product
The investigational product (I P) in this study  is Albumin (human) USP, 20%
(Albutein®20%), which will be administered as a treatment for decompensated cirrhosis and 
ascites. Albutein 20% is a solution containing 200 g/L of total protein of which at least 95% 
is albumin. See Section 4.4 for study treatments details .
Standard medical treatment (SMT) will be administered per institution standards. There are 
several published guidelines for the treatment and management of 
patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis (2-5).
2.2 Relev ant Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical 
Studies
Effects of Long -term Human Albumin Treatment in Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis
Several studies assessing the effect oflong-term human albumin treatment in subjects with 
decompensated cirrhosis have been reported (6-15). In onestudy,the effect of intravascular 
volume expansion with human albumin treatment in subjects with cirrhosis and ascites was
evaluated. Hospitalized subjects were randomized to receive diuretics alone or 
diuretics +human albumin (12.5 g /day during hospitalization followed by  25 g/week after 
discharge ) and were followed for a median duration of 20 months. Overall, human albumin
treatment was more effective than diuretics alone in resolving ascites and reducing the length 
of the hospital stay ; however , these results were only  achieved in a subset of subjects 
receiving a low dose of diuretics ( 13).25 of 87

In asecond stud y, the effects of long -term hum an albumin administration on survival, 
recurrence of ascites, and onset of other complications were examined. S ubjects hospitalized 
for first -onset ascites were randomized to receive diuretics alone or diuretics + human 
albumin (25 g/week for the first year, then 25 g every  2weeks) and were followed for a 
median time of 84 months (range 2 to 120months) . In the stud y, subjects receiving human 
albumin had a significantly  reduced recurrence rate of moderate to severe ascites and reduced 
rate of mortalit y (14). 
Athird study  is anon-profit open - label, multicenter, randomized clinical study , sponsored by  
the Agenzia I taliana del Farmaco (AIFA) (Long-Term Use of Human Albumin for the

effecti veness of long -term human albumin administration on mortality , quality  of life, and 
onset of other complications is being examined in subjects with cirrhosis and uncomplicated 
ascites (no renal failure or refractory  ascites) receiving at least 200 mg per day  of an 
anti-mineralocorticoid drug and 25 furosemide per day .Subjects are randomized to receive 
diuretics alone or diuretics + human albumin (40 g twice a week for 2 weeks, then 40 g/week 
for up to 24 months) ( 15).
Interim anal ysisof data from 386 out of a planned 420 subjects in the ANSWER study
suggest sthat long -term 
human albumin administration significantl y improves the 
management of ascites and is also able to reduce the incidence of other severe clinical 
complications of the disease to prolong survival in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis
(15).
2.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
Administration of albumin has shown efficacy  in prevention and treatment of circulatory  
dysfunction in cirrhosis (16). Par acentesis is the most used treatment in cirrhotic patients 
with ascites but can 
cause a worsening of circulatory  dysfunction . Administration of albumin 
after paracentesis can prevent this circulatory  dysfunction ( 17). In patients with spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis (SBP) , the adminis tration of intravenous (IV) 
albumin improves their 
circulatory  function , reduces the presence of hepatorenal s yndrome (HRS) from 
approximately  30 to 10% ( 9), and improves patient survival ( 14). The administration of 
albumin together with vasoconstrictors reverses the circulatory  dysfunction and normalizes 
the serum concentration of creatinine to 40 to60% in patients with HRS type1 and improves 
their survival ( 18,19). There are also data that suggest that long term albumin administration 
(25 g weekl y) improves the control of ascites and reduces the incidence and intensity  of the 
muscle cramps ( 20).
Based on these studies, l ong
-term administration of human albumin has potential beneficial 
effects on circulatory  dysfunction, inflammatory  response, oxidative stress, organ 
dysfunction, and organ failure. L ong-term treatment with human albumin was initially  
proposed for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis with ascites based on 
its oncotic properties. In patients with cirrhosis and portal hy pertension, ascites formation is 
the consequence of effec tive hy povolemia, which promotes renal retention of sodium and 
water. The preservation of the central blood volume with human albumin represents a logical 26 of 87

Decompensated Cirrhosis and Ascites
Effective
approach for the management of cirrhotic patients with ascites since it would improve renal 
function and the response to diuretics ( 21).
Long -term human albumin administration may improve circulatory  and organ function not 
only by directly  acting as plasma -expander ,but also indirectly  modulating the deleterious 
effects of immune d ysfunction and chronic or acute inflammation on the systemic circulation 
and organ function. Intravenous human albumin
administration in decompensated cirrhosis 
increase scardiac contractility  and s ystemic vascular resistances through the effects related to 
its non -oncotic properties. Maintaining an effective blood volume may  support adequate 
organ perfusion and avoid/delay the occurrence of organ impairment/failure (21). 
In addition , long -term human albumin administration may also modulate the deleterious 
effects of inflammatory  mediators on mitochondrial and cell function and on organ 
microcirculation, thus protecting target organs against tissue damage and microcirculatory  
disturbances. 
These effects could potentially  reduce the incidence of decompensation 
episodes (ie, ascites, renal or liver failure, hepatic enc ephalopathy (HE) , severe sepsis, septic 
shock, and acute -on-chronic liver failure [ ACLF ]) and increase survival rates (21).
Albutein is made from pooled human plasma. Based on effective donor screening and 
product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely  remote risk for transmission of viral 
diseases, in
cluding a theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (CJD). 
Although no cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for 
albumin, the risk of infectious agents cannot be totally  eliminated ( 1).
Albutein is contraindicated in patients with severe anemia or cardiac failure in the presence 
of normal or increased intravascular volume. The use of Albutein is contraindicated in 
patients with a history  of allergic reactions to this product. The most serious adverse 
reactions (ARs) are anaphy lactic shock, heart failure, and pulmonary  edema. The most 
common ARs are anaph ylactoid ty pe reactions. For additional inf ormation on potential risks
and adverse events (AEs) , please also refer to the IB(1) and an y additional data supplied by

2.4.2 Justification for Selection of Doses/Timing of Investigational Products
Preliminary  Results of Human Albutein 20% Dose -Finding Study  
The current albumin dosage in cirrhosis is based on empiric assumptions on the concept that 
it mainly  acts as a plasma expander. However, albumin has other biological effects unrelated 
to its oncotic capacit y (22). 
A Grifols -sponsored clinical study  (IG0802) was designed to test the h ypothesis that 
normalization of serum albumin concentration by  long -term exogenous albumin 
administration can be a target to achieve in order to potentiate the beneficial effects related to 
the oncotic and non -oncotic pr operties (23). In this open -label study , subjects with 
decompensated cirrhosis who were prone to d evelop severe circulatory  dysfunction and HRS
within a short period of time were treated with a low human albumin dose ( 1 g/kg bod y 
weight every  2 weeks for 12 weeks ). Following interim anal ysis results, which did not 
demonstrate a change in plasma renin a ctivity  (PRA), human albumin was administered at a 
higher dose with an increased frequency  (1.5 g/kg body  weight every  week for 12 weeks ).
To assess dose effectiveness, serum human albumin levels were measured at the end of 
treatment. Treatment with low-dose human albumin was not sufficient to increase the serum 
albumin levels above 34g/L (lower limit of normal) .In this treatment group, 2 out of 7 
subjects with hy poalbuminemia at the baseline visit had serum human albumin levels within 
the normal range at end of treatment. In contrast, treatment with high-dose human albumin
was sufficient to increase serum human albumin levels to within the normal range. Eight of 8 
subjects with hy poalbuminemia at the baseline visit had serum human albumin levels within 
the normal range at end of treatment.
In clinical study IG0802, 
an increase in a subject’s PRA >30% with respect to baseline 
served to demonstrate a sustained impairment of effective blood volume. Overall, a sustained 
impairment of effective blood volume w as observed in 29% of subjects (4 low-dose and 
2high-dose subjects). However, extreme circulatory  instability  (as manifested by  acute, 
reversible increases in PRA) was documented in subjects receiving low -dose human albumin, 
but not in subjects receiving high-dose human albumin . Mean changes in PRA and serum 
human albumin concentrations correlated inversely (r =
–0.459; p =0.039), while inotropic 
cardiac function improved significantl y and portal pressure did not change following long-
term human albumin administration. 
In the high -dose treatment group, the serum human albumin concentration normalized very  
rapidly  in subjects with hy poalbuminemia and ,once normalized, remained within the normal 
range throughout the study . No h yperalbuminemia was observed in an y subject in the 
high-dose treatment group. The mean change of serum human albumin concentration during 
treatment correlated inversely  with the baseline serum albumin concentration; subjects with 
the most severe hypoalbuminemia had the highest increa ses in serum human albumin .
In summary , clinical study IG0802 demonstrated that a weekly  dose of 1.5 g/kg body  weight 
was effective and tolerable in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis. In addition, the dose 28 of 87

2.5 Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted under the conditions described in this protocol and in 
compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requir ements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH),Good Clinical Practice (GCP) ,and all applicable 
regulatory  requirements.
2.6 Stud y Population
The study  population will consist of subjects who have been hospitalized for acute 
decompensation of liver cirrhosis and ascites (or with prior history  of ascites requiring 
diuretic therap y) with or without ACL F at admission or during hospitalization, but without 
ACLF at Screening .Subjects may  also present other acute complications ( HE, 
gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding , and/or bacterial infections) at admission or during 
hospitalization.
Subjects will be screened while hospitalized for acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis due 
to:
1.Development of ascites alone or associated with other complications ( GI, HE, acute 
bacteria l infection).
2.Development of a non -ascitic complication in patients with prior history  of ascites 
requiring diuretic treatment for prevention of ascites recurrence.
2.7 Relevant Data and Literature Review
Decompensated Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is a progressive chro nic liver disease characterized by  diffuse fibrosis, severe 
disruption of the intrahepatic venous flow, portal hypertension
,and liver failure. 
Epidemiological studies indicate that there is an increasing prevalence of liver cirrhosis 
related to chronic in fection by  hepatiti s B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol 
consumption ,and non
-alcoholic steatohepatitis worldwide ( 24). The natural course of 
cirrhosis is divided into 2stages. The first stage is c ompensated cirrhosis, which is defined as 
the period between the onset of cirrhosis and the appearance of the f irst major complication 
of the disease. During this period, which is relatively  long in most patients (>10 y ears), 
symptoms are absent or minor , but liver lesions steadily progress. The term decompensated 
cirrhosis defines the period following the developm ent of ascites, variceal bleeding, HEand 
bacterial infection. This period is associated with short -term survival (3 to 5 years). It is 
increasingly evident that patients rarel y die as a consequence of an end -stage irreversible 29 of 87

destruction of the liver. Rather, in most patients the cause of death is an acute deterioration in 
their clinical condition promoted by  a precipitating event, a s yndrome term edACLF.
The sy ndrome of ACLF ha d not been well characterized until recentl y when the CANONIC 
study  was comple ted (25). The aim of the CANONI C study  was to define ACLF, to assess 
the prevalence and clinical course of the s yndrome and to assess the prognosis. The 
CANONIC study  was an initiative of the European Association for the Study  of Liver -
Chronic Liver Failure (EASL -CLIF) Consortium. The EASL -CLIF Consortium defined 
ACLF as a s yndrome that develops in patients with cirrhosis characterized by acute 
decompensation ( AD), organ failure(s), and high short -term mortality .
Based on the CANONIC study , ACLF severit y was characterized by grades based on the 
level of organ failure ,ranging from grade 1 (single organ failure) to grade 3b (presence of 
≥4organ failures [25]).Table 2-1lists the criteria for ACLF grades.
Table 2-1Grades of A cute-on-Chronic Liver Failure
No ACLF -No organ failure
-One organ failure (liver failure, coagulation, circulatory or 
respiratory failure) w ith creatinine <1.5 mg/dL and no HE
ACLF grade 1a -Single kidney failure without mild or moderate HE
ACLF grade 1b -Single organ failure with serum creatinine ranging from 1.5 mg/dL 
to 1.9 mg/dL and/or mild-to-moderate HE
ACLF grade 2 -Presence of 2 organ failures 
ACLF grade 3a -Presence of 3 organ failures
ACLF grade 3b -Presence of ≥ 4 organ failures

Among patients with ACLF in the CANONI C study , 51% had ACLF -1, 35% had ACLF -2, 
and 13% had ACLF -3.The 90 -day mortalit y rate ranged from 40 t o 80%, with higher 
mortality  associated with more severe ACLF ( 25,26 ). Mortality  rates at Day  28 and Day 90

indicated in 60% of subjects during hospital stay  (25). Albumin is a critical determinant of 
the plasma oncotic pressure and therefore of circulatory  homeostasis (6,7). It is also an 
important vehicle for the transport of water insoluble substances in plasma (ie, bilirubin, bile 
salts, 
steroids, thy roid hormones, fatt y acids, drugs) ( 6). Perhaps the most outstanding 
function of albumin is that it also captures man y inflammatory  i
nducers and mediators and b y 
this mechanism it modulates sy stemic inflammation and oxidative stress ( 14).
Serum albumin in cirrhosis is saturated by a myriad of endogenous ligands resulting in severe 
impairment of its transport capacity  (scavenger). Albumin is also markedly  oxidized in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis as a consequence of the increased s ystemic oxidative 
stress in these patient s (27,28). Oxidation of albumin to human nonmercaptalbumin -2
(HNA2 )is irreversible and causes intense modifications of the protein structure and function 
and rapid clearance from the extracellular compartment ( 29,30). 
Approximately  50% of circulating albumin in decompensated cirrhosis is oxidized and 10% 
is irreversible oxidized to HNA2 ( 31). The corresponding percentages in healthy  subjects are 
21% and 1%, respectively. The percentage of oxidized albumin is significantly  higher in
patients with ACL F than in those without ACL F. Th
ese data indicate there is a significant 
reduction in the scavenger capacity  of serum albumin for inflammatory  inducers and 
mediators. This reduction may participate in the exaggerated response to the pro -
inflammatory  precipitating events observed in these patients (21). 
Therefore, substitution of the saturated and highl y oxidized endogenous albumi n molecules 
by exogenous albumin with higher functionality  is therefore another potentially  important 
beneficial effect of Albutein
20% in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. 
2.7.1 Rationale for Selection of Study Population
An anal ysis of subjects in the CA NONIC stud y (25) was performed to determine if the 
subject population was distinct from the ANSWER study  population ( 15) with respect to 
mid-term mortality . The CANONIC study  data base was composed of 867 subjects who were 
hospitalized with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites (with or without ACLF) and 
discharged from hospital without ACL F. The 
1-yeartransplant -free mortality  rate in these 
subjects was 44.5%. This finding indicate sthat subjects hospitalized by  acute 
decompensation with or without ACL F at admission or during hospitalization, but without 
ACLF at discharge represent a distinct cohort of subjects w ho have decompensated cirrhosis 
with an increased fatality rate within 1 year after discharge. Based on these findings, the 
PRECIOSA study  will be performed in this cohort of patients.

4.1 Primary  Endpoint and Secondary  Endpoints 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is to compare the 1 -year transplant -free survival in the intent -
to-treat ( ITT)population (see Section 9.7 for definition) between the SMT + Albutein 20%
treatment group and the SMT alone group.
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints are to assess the effects of SMT + Albutein 20% treatment
versus SMT alone on: (1) 3-and 6 -month transplant -free and overall survival , (2) 1-year 
overall survival , and (3) total number of paracenteses and the incidence of refractory  ascites. 
4.2 Stud y Design and Plan
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel -group, and open- label clinical 
study  to evaluate the efficacy  of SMT + Albutein 20% administration versus SMT alone in 
subjects with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites. This clinical study  is planned to be 
performed in approximately  40 study  centers in the United States and Europe . The protocol 
must be approved b y regulatory  authorities and 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Ethics Committee (EC) of each of the participating centers.
Approximately  410 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis and ascite s will be included in this 
study  after obtaining written informed consent. The study  population will consist of subjects 
who have been hospitialized for acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis with ascites (or with 
prior history  of ascites requiring diuretic therap y) with or without ACLF at admission or 
during hospitalization, but without ACLF at Screening . 
There will be a screening period for enrollment of each hospitalized subject in the study . 
Screening should occur while the subject is hospitalized . Randomization must occur within 
72 hours of screening, and it can occur while the subject is hospitalized or after discharge 
from the hospital. T he first dose of Albutein 20%  is administred on the same day  as 
randomization.
Randomization of subjects will be stratified by  region (Europe or North America [NA]) and 
by whether or not subjects have been previousl y hospitalized for acute decompensation of 
liver cirrhosis prior to the most recent hospitalization for acute decompensation of liver
cirrhosis with ascites as required b y Inclusion Criterion #3v4 (Section 5.1). Within each 
stratum (ie, each unique combination of region and history of hospitalization for acute 
decompensation of liver cirrhosis), e ligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1

4.3.1 Subject Numbering
Within each study  center , subjects in the study  will receive a consecutive subject number. 
Subject numbers are generated beginning with the study  center number (3 digits, assigned by  
the sponsor) followed consecutively with a unique number for each subject (4 digits,
beginning with the number “2” ). For example, if the investigator’s center number is 301, 
subject number will be 301
2001, 3012002, 3012003, etc., in consecutive order. Subject 
numbers, once assigned, will not be reused at an y center.
4.3.2 Randomization
Subjects who satisfy  the inclusion criteria and who do not present an y of the exclusion 
criteria will be enrolled in the study . Randomization must occur within 72 hours ( 3 day s) of 
Screening . Randomization will be stratified by  region ( Europe or NA) and by  whether or not 
subjects have been previously  hospitalized for acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis prior 
tothe most recent hospitalization for acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis with ascites as 
required b y Inclusion Criterion #3v4 ( Section 5.1). Within each stratum (ie, each unique 
combination of region and history  of hospitalization for acute dec ompensation of liver 
cirrhosis ), subjects will be randoml y assigned to 1 of 2 treatment group s
(SMT +
Albutein 20% versus SMT alone ) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be centralized 
and will be performed via an Interactive Web Response Sy stem after subject inclusion. A 
computer -generated randomization list will be used for treatment allocation.

Decompensated Cirrhosis and Ascites
Effective
4.4.1.2 Standard Med ical Treatment
Subjects allocated to the control group will receive SMT, which will be administered per 
institution standards. Several guidelines are published for the management of decompensated 
cirrhosis (2-5). Diuretic therapy  and dose modifications will be permitted on the basis of the 
evolution of ascites decompensation. Total paracentesis can be performed in the presence of 
tense ascites or s ymptoms due to the accumulation of abdominal fluid and will be followed 
by the administration of albumin. A TIPS will be considered when there are 
no other 
contraindications for this procedure for subjects with GIbleeding , refractory  ascites, or 
hydrothora x. Complications such as bacterial infections, including SBP, or acute kidney  
injury , including ty pe 1 HRS, will be treated according to current indications, which may  
require albumin infusion.
The usual treatment for comorbidities (ie, cardiac and respira tory diseases and diabetes) will 
be allowed according to the investigator’s medical judgement. An y medication administered 
during the stud y (including an y blood products) will be recorded in the electronic case report 
form ( eCRF) as well as in the subject’s medical record.
4.4.2 Labeling and Packaging of Investigational Product
Investigational products will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and 
legislation. Label text will be approved according to agreed Grifols procedures, and a cop y of 
the labels will be made available to the study  center .Each vial and corresponding box will 
have a label stating the protocol number and will specify  that the product is only  to be used in 
the clinical study .
4.4.3 Storage of Investigationa l Product
Albutein is stable for 3 years providing storage temperature does not exceed 25ºC. Protect 
from freezing. Do not use if the solution is turbid or if there is sediment in the bottle.
The product should be warmed to room temperature before use. Do not dilute with sterile 
water for injection. Once the container is open, the contents must be administered 
immediately . Do not begin administration more than 4 hours after the container has been 
entered. No remaining product in an opened container can be s tored in the refrigerator and 
used at a later time. This product must not be used beyond the expiry  date stated on the 
labeling.
Access to the IP must be strictly  limited. The pharmacist or designee is responsible for 
maintain storage temperature records a nd for immediatel y reporting deviations in 
temperature to the study  monitor.
4.5 Expected Duration of Subject Participation in the Study

4.6.1 Discontinuation Criteria for Individual Subjects
See Section 5.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria .
4.6.2 Premature Termination of Study/Closure of Center
The sponsor, IRB/ EC, and/or regulatory  authorities have the right to close this study  or a 
study  center, and the investigator/sponsor has the right to close a center, at any  time, although 
this should occur only  after consultation between involved parties. The IRB/EC must be 
informed. Should the study /center be closed prematurel y, all study materials (except 
documentation that has to remain stored at study  center ) must be returned to the sponsor. The 
investigator will retain all other documents until notification isgiven b y the sponsor for 
destruction.
A study  center can be closed for the following reasons:
•Lack of enrollment 
•Non-compliance with the requirements of the study protocol
•Non-compliance with I CH GCP

Albutein 20% is to be used only  for the study  in accordance with the directions given in this 
protocol. The study  pharmacist or designee is responsible for the distribution of the IPin 
accordance with dire ctions given in the protocol and pharmacy  manual.
The study  pharmacist or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records of the IP for 
his/her study  center . Investigational product inventory /dispensing documentation verify ing 
the receipt, dispens ing, destruction, and return must be maintained and kept current b y the 
pharmacist or designee. The unused inventory  must be made available for inspection during 
the study  by the monitor. Any  unused material may  be destroy ed at the center according to 
their standard operating procedures (SOPs) or may be returned to the sponsor if the study  
center’s SOPs do not allow local destruction.
Unused I P supplies must be accounted for by the monitor and inventory /dispensing logs must 
be verified b y the monitor prior to IP destruction. Written documentation from Grifols or 
designee of an y unused inventory  is required. At the end of the study , a copy  of the

5.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria
5.3.1 Screen Failures 
Screenin g evaluations will be used to determine the eligibility  of each subject for enrollment
into this study . Subjects who fail to meet eligibility  criteria during screening evaluations will 
be considered screen failures and will not participate in the study .
5.3.2 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
If a subject receives a liver transplant, stud y treatment and all treatment -related assessments 
will be discontinued upon transplant. The criteria to determine when a subject becomes a 
candidate for liver transplant ation is described in Section 5.3.2.1. The subject will continue to 
have subsequent planned visit assessment procedures performed .
Discontinuation of the treatment in subjects who receive a TIPS insertion will be at the 
discretion of the investigators. In case it is decided to discontinue the subject’s treatment 
early, stud y treatment will be stopped and the subject will continue to h ave subsequent 
planned visit assessment procedures performed .
Adverse events that will determine temporary  subject’s discontinuation from study  treatment 
include the following:
•
Subjects developing severe bleeding, Albutein 20% infusions will be temporaril ystopped 
until the bleeding episode is resolved. For subjects with variceal bleeding, Albutein 20% 
infusions will be temporarily  stopped until the subject has received at least 2 banding 
sessions. Albutein 20% infusions will be resumed after the bleeding e pisode is resolved 
or after the subject has received at least 2 banding sessions, respectivel y.
Adverse events that will determine permanent subject’s discontinuation from study  treatment 
include the following:
•Anaph ylactic shock or transfusion- related acute lung injury  
• S evereAEs (ie, acute myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac failure, 
pulmonary  edema ,or intestinal necrosis) that precludes the continuation of the subject in 
the clinical study41 of 87

Subjects with any  one of these severe AEs will be discontinued from study  treatment and all 
treatment -related assessments, and should continue to have subsequent planned visit 
assessment procedures performed.
5.3.2.1 Liver Transplantation Criteria
To confirm that a subject meets the criteria for a liver transplant, the MELD score and the 
Child Pugh score (Appendix 3 ) will be assessed. Priority  status will bedefined by  the MELD 
score and should be considered once a subject with cirrhosis experience san index 
complication such as ascites, HE, variceal hemorrhage, and/or hepatocellular dy sfunction . 
Subjects with an index compli cation and a MELD score ≥15, a C hild-Pugh score of ≥7,
worsening renal d ysfunction , or other evidence of rapid hepatic decompensation should be 
promptly  evaluated for a liver transplant.
Additional criteria for liver transplantation in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma or 
worsening within the Milan criteria ( Appendix 6 ) with no CONTRAI NDICATIONS as 
determined b y the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Dynamic 
Imaging criteria ( 31) are as follows:
•
Subject is not a candidate for total resection
•The hepatocellular carcinoma meets the definition of a Stage T2 lesion(s) that includes 
any of the following:
-One lesion ≥2 cm and ≤5 cm
-Two or 3 lesions ≥1 cm and ≤3 cm
-No macrovascular involvement
-No identifiable extrahepatic spread of tumor to surrounding l ymph nodes, lungs, 
abdominal organs, or bone
5.3.3 Rem oval of Subjects
Subjects may  withdraw or be withdrawn from the study  for the following reasons:
1.At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative.
2.If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study  would be detrimental to the 
subject's well -being.
3. At the specific request of the sponsor*
* Subjects will only  be removed at the request of the sponsor if a safet y concern is 
identified that may potentially  cause harm to a subject or if the risk of the specified 
treatment outweigh sthe benefit.
4.Post-consent decision due to inclusion error (determination of ineligibility  based on 
safet y or eligibility criteria).
5.Physician’s judgment following an AE after treatment.

The following is a description of the procedures/assessments to take place at each stud y visit. 
See the Schedules of Study Procedures and Events in Appendix 1 .
7.2.1.1 Screening Visit
Following signature of the informed consent form (I CF), subjects will be screened while 
hospitalized. L ocal laboratory  testing will be used for screening to determine inclusion and 
exclusion criteria have been met, prior to initiating treatment. Local laboratory  tests 
performed for screening purpose only  will be kept in subjects’ source documents but will not 
be entered into the eCRF. I n add ition, Central Laboratory  testing will be collected for the 
purpos e of safet y assessment and data anal yses. 
If a subject is ineligible for participation, their demographic data and specific reason for 
ineligibility  will be captured on the subject’s source documents and eCRF.
The screening assessments and activities will include:
•Assign subject number
• Add subject’s data into the Screening Log
• Review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria which include local labs (see Sections 5.1
and 5.2, respectivel y) to determine subject’s eligibility

8.2 Methods and Timing for A
ssessing, Recording, and A nalyzing 
Safet y Parameters
For timing of safet y assessments, please see Section 7.2.1.
8.2.1
Adverse Events 
Adverse events (includes suspected ADRs) occurring at an y time between signing of the 
subject’s ICF and the last day  of the subject’s participation ( End of Study  or Earl y 
Discontinuation Visit ) inthe clinical study  will be reported and recorded on the appropriate 
subject’s eCRF entry  and subject’s source documents. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility  to ensure that all AEs including suspected ADRs are 
appropriatel y recorded. 
8.2.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured b y a medically certified individual or a nurse according to 
his/her standard clinical practice. 
The following vital signs will be assessed:
•Temperature
•Blood pressure (s ystolic and diastolic BP)
•Heart rate
•Respiratory  rate
Vital signs will be routinely  monitored b y the study staff as detailed in Appendix 1 . The 
investigator will be required to classify  vital signs abnormalities as clinically  significant or 
not according to his/her criteria. Results will be recorded in source documents and on th e 
subject eCRF. Vital signs abnormalities judged b y the investigator as clinically  significant 
will be considered AEs.52 of 87

8.2.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Considering the medical history  inherent in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis, certain 
laboratory  abnormalities, while clinically  significant, will be expected in this medical 
context, and would not indicate treatment -emergent worsening or a new AE (being instead an 
extension of medical history /underl ying pre -existing conditions ). Examples include: low 
platelet count, decreased albumin, prolonged prothrombin time/I NR, elevated bilirubin, and 
abnormal transaminases . These conditions would be expected laboratory  consequences of 
cirrhosis/decompensated liver diseases. These results would not be considered ind ividual 
AEs as they  most likely  reflect manifestations of existing cirrhosis and hepatic 
decompensation, unless abnormalities worsen after initiation of study  treatment and become 
accentuated to a medically significant degree in a treatment -emergent fashio
n.
Central clinical laboratory  data for renal, hepatic, and hematological parameters will be listed 
for each clinical study  subjects. 
The investigator will be required to classify  laboratory  results out of the normal range 
reported b y the central laborato ry as clinically  significant or not according to his/her criteria. 
Laboratory  results out of the normal range judged by  the 
investigator as clinically  significant 
will be considered AEs.
8.2.4 Physical Examinations
A medicall y certified individual will conduct a physical examination.
8.3 Procedures for Eliciting Reports of and for Recording and 
Reporting A dverse Event and Intercurrent Illnesses
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the clinical study  are 
familiar with the content of this section.
8.3.1 Warnings/Precautions
For complete information on Albutein 20% refer to the IB.
8.3.2 Adverse Event Monitoring
Subjects must be carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring includes clinical and 
laboratory  tests and ph ysical signs. Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their 
seriousness, severity , and causal relationship to the I P. 
Adverse events will be elicited by  spontaneous reporting by  the study  individual or by  a non-
leading inquiry  or direct observation by  the study  staff. 53 of 87

8.3.3 Adverse Event Definitions
8.3.3.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product or stud y treatment and which does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with this adm inistration. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medici nal product. This includes worsening of a pre -existing condition or 
increase in frequency  of a pre- existing condition.
An AE is also defined as any  occurrence that is new in onset, expected, or aggravated in 
severit y or frequency from a baseline condition, or abnormal results or diagnostic procedures 
including laboratory  test abnormalities.
In this clinical stud y, deterioration of the targeted disease and s ymptoms associated with the 
targeted disease will not be considered an AE as long as the deterioriatio n is anticipated and 
there is no evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE. 
Anticipated disease progression includes , but not limited to: HE, GI  bleeding, portal 
hypertension, ascites, SBP, hyponatremia and HRS (s ee Section 8.3.10 ).
8.3.3.2 Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions/Adverse Reactions
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product or study  treatment related to 
any dose should be considered suspected ADRs. The phrase “responses to a medicinal 
product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product or study  treatment and 
an AE is at least a reasonable possibility . An AR is a subset of the suspected ADRs that are 
deemed as definitel y related to the treatment. See below for additional details.
8.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Event
The investigator is required to provide a causalit y assessment for each AE reported to the 
sponsor. The spons or will consider the investigator’s causality  assessment and also provide 
its own assessment. Causal relationship to the study drug will be established according to 
medical judgment on whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
betw een the AE and the study drug.
The investigator must determine and classify  the AE causalit y according to the following 
categories:
Unrelated/Not related: there is not a reasonable possibility  of causal relationship between 
the AE and the stud y drug.
Possibly related: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study  drug 
and the AE.
Definitively related: there is a reason to conclude that the study  drug caused the AE.54 of 87

IG1601 - Prevention of Mortality with Long-Term Administration of Human Albumin in Subjects with
Decompensated Cirrhosis and Ascites
Effective
Criteria to assess the causal relationship should take into acco unt of the following conditions:
• A plausible temporal sequence from the study  drug administration to the AE onset
• Whether the event follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment
• W hether the AE could be reasonabl y explained by  the subject’s cl inical state, 
comorbidities, or concomitant medications
• The occurrence of improvement on stopping/reducing the treatment (positive 
dechallenge) and/or reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (positive 
rechallenge)
For expedited safety  reporting pur poses, AEs assessed as either “definitively  related” or 
“possibly  related” will be considered POTENTIALLY RELATED or just REL ATED.
8.3.5 Severity of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
AEs including suspected ADRs will be classified according to sev erity, depending on the
intensity  of the event, as follows :
Mild : an AE which is well tolerated by  the subject, causing minimum degree of malaise and 
without affecting activities of dail y living (ADL) .
Moderate : an AE that interferes with ADL.
Severe : an A E that prevents ADL .
Severity  gradation of AE sincluding suspected ADR smust be distinguished from their 
seriousness gradation, which is defined according to event consequence. For example, 
headache can be mild, moderate or severe but not necessarily  serio us in all these cases. See 
Section 8.3.7 for Seriousness of AEs.
The i
nvestigator will be responsible for assessing the severit y of AEsincluding suspected 
ADR sduring the clinical study .
8.3.6 Expectedness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
An AE or suspected ADR is considered “unexpected” if the nature, seriousness, severit y or 
outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the refer ence information. The expectedness 
shall be determined b y the sponsor according to the reference document (ie, IB or Summary  
of Product Characteristics) for an y serious ADRs (potentially  related serious adverse events 
[SAEs ]) for expedited safety reporting purposes. 
8.3.7 Seriousness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
Adverse Events including suspected ADRs are considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, they result in an y of the following outcomes:

•Life-threatening AE (life -threatening in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe)
• In- patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization*
•A persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions 
•A congenital anomal y/birth defect
•An important medical event (important medical event in the definition of “serious” refers 
to those events which may not be immediatel y life -threatening, or result in death, or 
hospitalization, but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the subject 
or/and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above)
* After the initial hospital discharge, an y hospitalization is to be considered only  hospital 
stay for equal or more than 24 hours. The following hospitalizations should notbe 
reporte d as SAEs:
-Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization as part of a routine procedure 
followed b y the center or clinical practice (according to the investigator’s criteria) for 
the treatment of decompensated cirrhosis
-Hospitalization for a survey  visit, annual phy sicals, or social reasons
-Elective or pre -planned hospitalizations for a pre -existing condition that had not 
worsened from Baseline (eg ,elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to start of 
the study )
-A
dmissions not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of 
respite care)
This definition permits either the sponsor or the i nvestigator to decide whether an event is 
“serious .” If either the s ponsor or the investigator believes that the event is serious, the event 
must be considered “serious” and evaluated b y the sponsor for expedited reporting. 
8.3.8 Adverse Event Documentation
All AEs and SAEs occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the Final Visit 
(ie, End of Study or Early Discontinuation Visit )must be fully  recorded in the subject’s 
eCRF and SAE form (if serious) as well as in the medical record. If no AE has occurred 
during the stud y period, this should also be indicated in the eCRF.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that AEs are appropriately  recorded.
At each visit, AEs will be elicited b y asking the individual a non -leading question such as 
“Do you feel different in any way  since the last visit?” Moreover, AEs will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously  volunteered by  the subject. Clearl y related 
signs, s ymptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures should preferabl y be grouped together 
and recorded as a single diagnosis or s yndrome wherever possible.56 of 87

•Date/time of onset
•Date/time of resolution
•Severity  (mild, moderate, severe)
•Causality  (unrelated /not related , possibly  related, definitely  related)*

• Action taken (with regard to IP)
•Other action (to treat the event)
•Outcome and sequel (follow -up on AE)
* An AE occurring before subject’s exposure to treatment will be labeled as “unrelated/not 
related” .
If it is a preexisting AE that gets worse regarding intensity  or frequency , it should be 
indicated.
For AEs that occur during infusions, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE 
(if applicable), the time of onset of the AE and the time of AE change materially  in intensity  
and/or resolve will be captured in the eC
RF.
In addition to the investigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded 
according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
For example, a laboratory test abnormality  considered clinically  significant, eg, causing the 
subject to withdraw from the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical 
manifestations, or judged clinically significant in the context of the subject’s medical history  
by the investigator, should be reported as an AE. Each event must be described in detail 
along with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to treatment , action taken, and outcome. 
Each event must be adequately  supported by  documentation as it appears in the subject’s 
medical or case file.

relationship between the study  drug and the AE. Manifestations of decompensated cirrhosis 
will be treated as disease progression and will be documented in the eCRF and subject’s 
medical records, but not immediately  reported to the sponsor.
Hospitalization due to d isease progression and/or the signs and s ymptoms of disease 
progression should not be reported as an SAE during the study .
8.3.11 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events , Deaths, and Pregnancy
8.3.11.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE (see Section 8.3.7 ) that occurs after signing the study ICF through the Final 
Visit (ie, End of Study or Early Discontinuation Visit )must be expeditiously  reported 
whether or not considered attributabl e to the study drug. Each SAE must be fully  recorded in 
the subject’s eCRF and SAE Report Form. In addition, any  SAE that occurs after the end of
study /early  discontinuation should be reported if the investigator feels that the event is 
related to the use of IP.
SAEs will be reported using the designated SAE Report Form. When the investigator 
becomes aware of an SAE, she/he must submit a completed, signed , and dated SAE Report 
Form (in English) within 24 hours to the s ponsor by  email/fax. The date of this SAE 
discovery  by the study  center staff should be documented in the source documents (ie, 
medical records). 
Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization. After the initial report, all 
relevant inform ation for SAE follow -up, and for the outcome, must also be supplied to the 
sponsor in a timely  manner (within 3 day s from its identification or within 24 hours for 
relevant new information) by  means of the SAE Report Form. In addition, the s ponsor or 
contr act research organization may request additional information and/or reports.
All SAE Report Forms must be reported to:
Grifols Global Pharmacovigilance
Email:
FAX (back -up onl y): (USA)
(International)
When required, and according to local law and regulations, SAEs must be reported to the 
IRB/EC and regulatory  authorities. Copies of the investigator’s reports must be sent to the 
sponsor.58 of 87

8.3.11.2 Reporting of Deaths
The following considerations should be made for all deaths occurring during the clinical 
study :
•Any death that is unequivocally  due to disease progression should not be reported as an 
SAE, butshould be documented in the eCRF as well as in the subject’s medical record.
•Any death that is not unequivocally  due to disease progression should be immediately  
reported as an SAE (see Section 8.3.11.1) as well as documented in the subject’s medical 
record . Every effort should be made to establish a cause of death. Reporting of the SAE 
should inclu
dea comment regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, if 
appropriate, and should assign a single primary  cause of death (AE) together with any  
contributing causes.
8.3.11.3 Reporting Pregnancy
While pregnancy  itself is not a true “AE,” pregnancy  occurring in a clinical study  must be 
followed to collect information regarding the experiences of gestation and pregnancy . The 
investigator must report any  pregnancy  that occurs in a study  subject or pa rtner of a male 
subject from the first treatment exposure until 28 days after the last dose of treatment. A 
pregnancy  will not be considered an AE unless a relation to the treatment is suspected. A 
Pregnancy  Report Form must be completed and sent as soon as possible to the s ponsor. A 
copy  of the form should be filed at the study  center for pregnancy  follow -up until delivery  or 
to the end of pregnancy . Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or birth defect 
observed in the child must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the i nvestigator or study  
personnel’s first knowledge. 
Please use the email address or fax numbers (back up only ) in 
Secti on 8.3.11.1 for reporting 
pregnancy .
8.4 Type and Duration of the Follow -
Up of Subjects after A dverse 
Events 
In so far as is possible, all individuals will be followed up until the AE or suspected ADR has 
been resolved. If an AE/suspected ADR/SAE is present when the subject has completed the 
study , the course of the event must be followed until the final outcome is known, or the event 
has been stabilized and no further change is expected and the investigator decides that no 
further follow -up is necessary .

Effective
Data handling and evaluation procedures will be described in the Statistical Analy sis Plan 
(SAP).
9.1.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  treatment group. For 
quantitative variables, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum will be provided. For 
qualitative variables, the frequency  and percentage will be provided.
9.1.2 Efficacy Analysis 
9.1.2.1 Primary Endpoint
This is a study  to demonstrate superiorit y of SMT + Albutein 20% to SMT alone on 1 -year 
transplant -free survival. The null hy pothesis is that the hazard functions for liver 
transplantation or death are the same for the 2 treatment groups, or equivalently , the hazard 
ratio is equal to 1. The alternative h ypothesis is that the hazard functions for liver 
transplantation or death are not the same for the 2 treatment groups, or equ ivalently , the 
hazard ratio is not equal to 1. 
The effect ofSMT + Albutein 20% administration on the 
transplant -free survival at 1 year after randomization versus SMT alone will be summarized 
by means of Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and curves and compared between treatment 
groups b y means of the Log -rank test stratified b y region (Europe or NA) and history  of 
hospitalization for acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis (y es or no) .An un -stratified 
analysis will be performed as a sensitivity  analy sis.
In the event that clinically  and statisticall y significant imbalances are observed between 
treatment groups in an y of subjects’ baseline characteristics, sensitivity  analy ses will be 
performed in which treatment effects will be adjusted by  those characteri stics by  fitting an 
appropriate Cox Proportional- Hazards (PH) model. In addition, subgroup analy ses b y age 
group, sex, race, region ( Europe vs NA) , and history  of hospitalization for acute 
decompensation of liver cirrhosis (y es vs no) will be carried out f or the primary  endpoint.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be carried out on the ITT population and repeated on the 
Per-Protocol ( PP)population (see Section 9.7 for description of subject populations for 
analysis).
9.1.2.2 Secondary Endpoints
The anal ysis of the secondary  endpoints will be performed using the ITT population.
The effect sof SMT + Albutein 20% administration on the overall survival at 3, 6 , and 12 
months and transplant
-free survival at 3 and 6 months after randomization versus SMT alone
will be assessed b y carr ying out the same anal yses for the primary  efficacy  variable described 
above.
Total number of paracenteses and incidence of refractory  ascites will be listed for each 
subject, summarized by treatment group,  and compared between treatment groups by  means 
of anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or Student’s t test (for normall y-distributed variables), 60 of 87

Poisson regression model (for count variables), and Fisher’s exact test or Chi -square test (for 
binomial variables).
The fixed- sequence testing method will be used to adjust for multiplicity  in the anal yses of 
the secondary  efficacy  endpoints. Specifically , the superiority  of SMT + Albutein 20% 
versus SMT alone for the secondary  efficacy  endpoints will only  be tested if the superiorit y 
for the primary  efficacy  endpoint is demonstrated at the 
2-sided significance level of 5%. For 
the secondary  efficacy  endpoin ts, each subsequent hy pothesis is tested onl y if the superiorit y 
for the previous comparison(s) has been demonstrated at a 2 -sided significance level of 5%. 
The order in which the null hy potheses will be tested is predetermined for the secondary  
efficacy  endpoints as follows:
1.Time to death through 1 y ear after randomization
2.Time to liver transplantation or death through 6 months after randomization
3. Time to death through 6 months after randomization
4.Time to liver transplantation or death through 3 months after randomization
5. Time to death through 3 months after randomization
6. Total number of paracenteses
7.Incidence of refractory  ascites according the ICA criteria
9.1.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints
As appropriate to the data, the original values or changes from baseline ( last measurement 
taken prior to the start of study  treatment on Day  1) of the following exploratory  endpoints 
will be listed for each subject, summarized by  treatment group, and compared between 
treatment groups by means of ANCOVA or Student’s t tests (for normall y-distributed 
variables), non -parametric Mann- Whitney  U test (for non -parametric variables), Kaplan -
Meier estimates and Log -rank test (for time -to-event variables), Poisson regression model 
(for count variables), and Fisher’s exact test or Chi- square test (for binomial variables): 
Incidence of ACLF, CLIF -C OF score, CLIF -C ACL F score, CLIF -C AD score, MELD 
score, Child Pugh score, number and length of hospital readmission for an acute 
complication of cirrhosis, number and length of ICU admission, i ncidence of disease -related 
complications, serum albumin concentration, albumin functional capacity (albumin binding 
capacity ), incidence of insertion of TIPS for refractory  ascites, and the EQ -5D- 5L health 
questionnaire .
For the normally -distributed varia bles, the ANCOVA model will include change from 
baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed factor, and baseline value as a 
covariate. If any potential confounders are identified among subjects’ baseline 
characteristics, they  will be included 
as additional covariates in the ANCOVA models to 
adjust treatment effects. In addition, for the longitudinal measurements taken repeatedl y over 
time, the treatment effects may  be explored by  using the mixed -effect model repeated 
measures anal ysis.61 of 87

9.1.3 Safety A nalysis
The safet y analyses will be addressed by  listing and tabulation of AEs (including suspected 
ADRs), vital signs, ph ysical assessments
,and clinical laboratory  tests. Data will be described 
using descriptive anal ysesand treatment comparisons will be based on review of descriptive 
statistics. The safet y analyses will be based on the Safety population.
9.1.3.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded and classified using MedDRA®terms (s ystem organ class and 
preferred terms). 
When a causal relationship of an AE is classified by  the investigator as definitively  or 
possibly  related, the event will be defined as a suspected ADR. A suspected ADR with a 
causal relationship of “definitively related ” will be defined as an AR. The sponsor will 
consider the investig ator’s causality  assessment and also provide its own assessment. If there 
is any  disagreement in the causalit y assessment between the investigator and the sponsor, a 
separate summary  of suspected ADRs/ARs will be provided.
For summary  purpose, 
AEs will be classified as treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) or non -
TEAEs depending on the comparison of AE onset date/time with the start date/time of study 
treatment. A TEAE will be defined as an AE which occurs between the start of study  
treatment and the final visit o f the clinical study . A non -TEAE will be defined as an AE 
which occurs prior to the start of study  treatment. Non -TEAEs and TEAEs will be 
summarized separatel y.
In addition, TEAEs, including suspected ADRs, will be summarized by  each treatment 
group, system organ class, preferred term, causal relationship, severity
, and seriousness 
(serious v ersus non- serious) using descriptive statistics. At each level of summarization, a 
subject will only  be counted once per s ystem organ class or preferred term using the most 
severe AE or the AE with the strongest causal relationship to the treatment. 
AEs temporally  associated with the infusion of the IP(ie, infusional AEs, including 
infusional suspected ADRs) will be summarized by  presenting infusion/subject incide nces 
and percentages and listed. 
Subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to death, or who withdraw from the stud y because of an AE 
will also be individually  listed and summarized. 
9.1.3.2 Clinical Laboratory Values
All clinical laboratory  data ( Table 7-1) will be listed for each subject and summarized by  
treatment group. 
The investigator will be required to classify  out of the normal range laboratory  results 
repor ted b y the laboratory as clinically significant or not according to his/her criteria. 62 of 87

Out of the normal range laboratory  results judged by  the i nvestigator as clinically  significant 
in the context of the subject’s medical history will be considered AEs. 
9.1.3.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs (T, RR, HR, systolic and diastolic BP) will be listed for each subject and 
summarized by  treatment group. In case a subject presents a clinically significant 
abnormality  of vital signs during an infusion, the event will be flagged a nd reported as an AE 
temporally  associated with the infusion.
Clinically  significant vital signs abnormalities will be presented as AEs. Clinical relevance 
will be based on the investigator’s criteria. 
9.1.3.4 Physical Assessment
Physical assessment findings (normal and abnormal) will be listed for each subject and 
summarized by  treatment group. An y clinicall y significant abnormalit y, as determined b y the 
investigator, experienced by  a subject during the clinical study  and not already  present at 
basel ine will be reported as AE. 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size
Based on the CANONIC study , the overall 1
-year transplant -free mortalit y rate in the current 
study  population is assumed to be about 46% ( 24,26) . Assuming a potential drop - out rate of 
20% and 5% t ype-1 error for a 2-sided C hi - square test, a global sample size of 410 patients 
(205 per treatment group) will allow an 80% statistical power to detect an absolute reduction 
of 15% (15) for the 1 -year mortality  rate in subjects treated with SMT + Albutein 20% . 
Alternativel y, the sample size was calculated based on the log -rank test as follows. Assuming 
the 1- year transplant or mortality  rate is 46% for the control group, or e quivalently , the 
transplant -free survival rate is 54%, which translates to a hazard rate of 0.0017 assuming an 
exponential distribution. Using a log-rank test at the 2- sided significant level of 5%, a total of 
125 events would provide at least 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15% in 
transplant or mortality  rate (a 31% 1
-year transplant or mortality  rate, or equivalently , a 69% 
transplant -free survival rate) in subjects treated with SMT + Albutein 20%. This absolute 
difference in transplant or mo rtality  rates translates to a hazard ratio of 0.6022, or an 
approximate 40% risk reduction. With all subjects followed for the entire 1 -year duration of 
the study , a total of 322 subjects would be required to obtain 125 events. Assuming a dropout 
rate of 2 0%, a global sample size of 404 subjects (202 per treatment group) is required. This 
sample size calculation was performed using Proc Power with the Twosamplesurvival 
statement in SAS version 9.4.
Taking a conservative approach, the larger of the 2 sample sizes (ie, the one based on the 
Chi-square test) will be used to ensure the stud y has sufficient power.
9.3 Level of Significance to Be Used

9.7 Subject Population for A nalysis
There will be 3 anal ysis populations in this study ; 2 populations for efficacy  assessment and 
1 population for safet y evaluation.
The ITT population is defined as all subjects who are randomized. The IT T population will 
be used for all efficacy  analy ses.Subjects will be grouped according to the treatment to 
which they  are randomized in all efficacy  anal yses.
The PP population is defined as the subset of subjects included in the ITT population who do 
not
present major protocol violations which might have an impact on the primary  efficacy  
analysis, complete at least 80% of the scheduled treatments and are not excluded from the 
study  for interrupting the Albutein 20% treatment for more than 4 consecutive we eks ( SMT + 
Albutein 20% treatment group subjects). The primary  efficacy  anal yses will be carried out 
using the PP population in order to confirm the results based on the ITT population.
The Safet y population is defined as the subset of patients who receive at least one SMT plus 
Albutein 20% treatment or SMT. Safety  anal yses will be based on this population. Subjects 
will be grouped according to the treatment they  actually  received in all safety  analy ses.

cWithin 72 hours ( 3 days) of Screening, subjects w ill be randomized on Day 1. Following randomization, subjects in the SMT + Albutein 20% treatment 
group will receive the first infusion on the same day at the dose of 1.5 g/kg body weight (m aximum 100 grams per subject). Thereafter, subjects will 
receive Albutein 20% infusions at the dose of 1.5 g/kg body weight (maximum 100 grams per subject) every 10 ± 2 days for the rest of the study .
dSubjects who discontinue from the study early will hav e follow -up vital status assessments performed at Months 3, 6, and 12.
eVital signs include systolic BP, diastolic BP, HR, T,and RR. Vital signs will be measured immediately prior to and immediately after the end of the 
Albutein 20% administration in the SMT +Albutein 20% treatment group .
fClinical laboratory assessments will include hematology, chemistry, and coagulation performed by the central lab. At the Screening visit only, local 
laboratory tests will be performed in order to determine subject eligib ility. Screening local laboratory test results will be kept in subjects’ source documents 
but will not be entered into the eCRF (see Table 7
-1).
gSerum albumin concentration will be measured immediately prior to treatment. In the SMT +Albutein 20% treatment group, serum albumin concentration 
will also be measured immediately after the end of the Albutein 20% administration.
hSystemic inflammation assessment includes testing for procalcitonin, WBC, and CRP ( see Table7-1).

Appendix 2 European A ssociation for the Study  of the Liver 
Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of 
Ascites/International Club of A scites
Uncomplicated ascites: Ascites that is not infected and which is not associated with the 
development of the hepatorenal syndrome. Ascites can be graded as follows:
Grading of Ascites and Suggested Treatment
Grade of Ascites Definition Treatm ent
Grade 1 ascites Mild ascites only detectable by 
ultrasound No treatment
Grade 2 ascites Moderate ascites evident by 
moderate symmetrical distention 
of abdomenRestriction of sodium intake and 
diuretics
Grade 3 ascites Large or gross ascites with marked 
abdominal distensionLarge -volume paracentesis 
followed by restriction of sodium 
intake and diuretics (unless
patients have refractory ascites)
Definition and Diagnostic Criteria for Refractory Ascites in Cirrhosis:
Diuretic -resistant ascites Ascites that cannot be mobilized or the early recurrence of which cannot be 
prevented because of a lack of response to sodium re striction and diuretic 
treatment
Diuretic -intractable 
ascitesAscites that cannot be mobilized or the early recurrence of which cannot be 
prevented because of the development of diuretic -induced complications that 
preclude the use of an effective diuretic dosage
Requisites
1. Treatment duration Patients must be on intensive diuretic therapy (spironolactone 400 mg/day and 
furosemide 160 mg/day) for at least 1 w eek and on a salt -restricted diet of less 
than 90 mmol/day
2. Lack of response Mean weight loss of <0.8 kg over 4 days and urinary sodium output less than the 
sodium intake
3. Early ascites recurrence Reappearance of grade 2 or 3 ascites within 4 weeks of initial mobilization
4. Diuretic -induced 
complicationsDiuretic -induced HEis the development of encephalopathy in the absence of any 
other precipitating factor .
Diuretic -induced renal impairment is an increase of serum creatinine by >100% 
to a value >2 mg/ dL (177 µmol/L) in patients with ascites responding to 
treatment .
Diuretic -induced hyponatremia is defined as a decrease of serum sodium by 
>10mmo l/L to a serum sodium of <125 mmol/L .
Diuretic -induced hypo -or hyperkalemia are defined as a change in serum 
potassium to <3 mmol/L or >6 mmol/L , respectively, despite approp riate 
measures

Appendix 7 NYH AClassification –The Stages of Heart Failure
In order to determine the best course of therap y, physicians often assess the stage of heart 
failure according to the NYHA functional classification sy stem. This s ystem relates 
symptoms to every day activities and the patient's quality  of life.
Class Patient Symptoms
Class I  (Mild) No limitation of phy sical activity. Ordinary  physical activity  does not 
cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or dy spnea (shortness of breath).
Class II (Mild) Slight limitation of physical activity . Comfortable at rest, but ordinary  
physical activity  results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class III 
(Moderate)Marked limitation of physical activity . Comfortable at rest, but less 
than ordinary  activity  causes fatigue, palpitation, or dy spnea.
Class I V (Severe) Unable to carry  out any physical activity without discomfort. 
Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency  at rest. If any  physical activity  is 
undertaken, discomfort is increased.83 of 87

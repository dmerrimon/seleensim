BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/20211.IntroductionandBackground. In reviewing the protocol, the IRB must consider the rationale for the
study and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result.
Food insecurity among older adul ts is a critical health and hea lthcare issue with
implications for families, the h ealthcare system, and society . In 2017, an estimated 5.5
million older adults (7.7%) in the United States were food insecure. Food i nsecurity, defined as a
lack of consistent access to enoug h food for an active, healthy  life, disproportionately affects
older adults who are racial or et hnic minorities, those with lo wer incomes, those who are
disabled, and those living in non-metropolitan areas. Food is a  basic human need, and among
many food- insecure older adults, the need for food competes with other bas ic necessities such as
medication, housing, utilities, and transportation. While food- insecure older adults sometimes
have enough money to purchase food, they may not have the resou rces to access or prepare food
due to lack of transportation, functional limitations, or health pro blems.
Individuals with Alzheimer’s dise ase and related dementias (ADR D) are at increased risk
of food insecurity. Many individuals with ADRD living in the community are characte rized as
being low income, with close to one- quarter living under the Fe deral Poverty Level and almost
one-third enrolled in Medicaid. In early stages of ADRD, when the ability to perform complex
tasks is declining, difficulties in shopping, preparing meals, and eating may regularly arise,
especially among persons living alone, which may mark the entry  into a vicious circle of food
insecurity and health instability. Estimates of the percent of persons with dementia (PWD) living
in the community who need assi stance shopping for and preparing  meals range from 50% to
90%. Caregivers play a central role in recognizing these difficulties and prov iding support.
However, between 25% and 30% of PWD in the community live alone, a nd approximately one
quarter of PWD who live alone have limited social support and report not vi siting with family or
friends in the last month. Therefore, PWD in the community, par ticularly those who live alone,
are at increased risk of food insecurity.
Among older adults, food insecu rity is associated with poor hea lth status and health
outcomes, and accounts for an e stimated $130 billion annually i n healthcare expenses .
Previous research suggests that addressing food insecurity is as sociated with reduced odds of
hospitalization, emergency department use, and nursing home adm ission, including shorter
lengths of nursing home stays. In addition, evidence, much of w hich our team has helped
generate, continues to suggest t hat home-delivered meals, speci fically, have an impact on the
health and healthcare utilization of a highly vulnerable population of ho mebound older adults
experiencing food insecurity. Recognizing the link between food  insecurity, health, and
healthcare utilization, healthcare entities (e.g., payers, syst ems, providers) are increasingly
interested in addressing food insecurity with home-delivered meals for older patients.
While home-delivered meals  have traditionally been prov ided daily to cli ents’ homes by a

BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021alternative. In this model, participants are provided one to two weeks’ wort h of meal s in one
bulk delivery via postal courier. W hile these meals have the sa me nutritional standards as daily-
delivered meals ( ⅓ of older adults’ Dietary Reference Intake), there is limited e vidence on how
satisfaction with, and the benefit of, these meals may differ f rom the traditional daily- delivered
meal. Our pilot research suggests that clients who receive dail y-delivered meals (including
socialization and a wellness check) have lower rates of lonelin ess and falls than clients who
receive frozen, weekly delivered meals. These findings are part icularly salient given the
relationship between these two measures and older adults’health and healthcare utilization.
However,overalldifferencesinhealth andhealthcareutilization,incl udingtheabilityfor
meals to enable PWD to remain in the community, attributable to  the two meal delivery
methodsremain unknown.
The healthcare sector has a growing interest and motivation to address food insecurity in
ordertoachievebetterpatienthealthoutcomes andreducecosts. Increasingly, providers and
health systems are addressing food insecurity and its impact on  health through the direct
provision of meals. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which currently enrol lo v e ro n e - t h i r do fa l l
Medicare beneficiarie s, were given new flexibility to address chronically ill enroll ees’ social
needs, including enrollees with ADRD, through the, “Creating Hi gh-Quality Results and
Outcomes Necessary to Improve  Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act,” of 2 018. Interviews that our
team conducted with MA plans across the country indicate that t hey are examining new
opportunities to meet the needs of c hronically ill enrollees th rough the provision of home-
delivered meals in response to CHRONIC. In fact, our preliminary work using MA plan benefit
data suggests that 1,979 MA plans (47.4%) are offering a meal b enefit to their 9.4+ million
enrollees in 2020. In addition, many local communities offer meal and nutrition se rvices to
eligible individuals through Medicaid waivers or other governme nt-funded programs. The
Centers for Medicare and Medica id Services (CMS) through their Accountable Health
Communities Model are testing how identifying and addressing pa tients’ social needs, like food
insecurity, impacts healthcare costs and reduces utilization. Despite the increased focus on
addressing social needs like food insecurity through home-deliv ered meals, healthcare entities
have little information guiding  them about what mode of meal de livery (meals delivered by the
MOW program multiple times a week with socialization vs. frozen,  drop-shipped meals)
promotes community independence among PWD and benefits their caregivers.
It is particularly important to examine the differences in expe riences between the two
modes of meal delivery and how they impact community residence among PWD, who
comprise approximately 30% of Meals on Wheels (MOW) clients. There are several reasons
why examining differences in the two modes of meal delivery amo ng PWD is of great interest.
For example, frozen, drop-shipped meals require the client to t ransport the heavy box of frozen
meals to the kitchen, put them in the freezer, microwave them, open the meal containers, etc., all
of which may be particularly challenging for PWD. However, the hot/chilled meals delivered
multiple times a week by the MOW program are brought directly to  the client. Interviews we
have conducted with MOW drivers  found that it is common for dri vers to bring the meal to the
kitchen/table and set up the meal for the client (e.g., open containers). Further, PWD may
benefit greatly from physical check-ins by a meal delivery driv er because PWD may not always
accurately self- report or request  help if thereare issues. Bett er understanding of the process of
meal delivery and its impacts on the lives of PWD can improve services to mee t clients’ needs
and provide evidence to guide decision- making around what type of meals to provide and to
whom.

BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021The proposed research will address key knowledge gaps identifie d by a multitude of
stakeholders . Two recently released reports by the National Academies of Science, Engi neering,
and Medicine called for rigorous research to understand effecti ve and efficient ways for the
healthcare sector to reduce food insecurity and other health-re lated social needs. Our proposed
research addresses the need to identify, “how interventions aff ect health, for which patients, via
what mechanisms, and in what contexts,” put forward by the co mmittee, and works toward their
recommended goal to “ Fund, Conduct, and Translate Research and Evaluation on the
Effectiveness and Implementation of Social Care Practices in He alth Care Settings.” Also, this
work meets the needs of other stakeholders, including MA plans and Medicaid managed care
organizations, both of which indicated the need for evidence ar ound program effectiveness to
guide decision-making. Our proposed research is signif icant because it will provide ev idence
to guide stakeholders’ decisions and ultimately improve PWDs’ h ealth outcomes and
qualityof life.
Specific Aims and Study Objectives. The IRB must evaluate the objectives of the research in order to
determine whether the risks to participants are reasonabl e in relation to the importance of the knowledge that
may be gained.
TheSpecific Aimof theR61 is to:
1.Test and validate procedures to recruit individuals with ADRD a nd evaluate their outcomes in
partnership with Meals on Wheels programs. The goal of this aim is to test and validate the vital
elements and procedures for conducting a pragmatic effectiveness trial: specifically, 1) enrolling persons
with ADRD on MOW programs’ waiting lists to receive one  of the two types of meals; 2) recr uiting a
subsample of participants and caregivers to participate in tele phone interviews; 3) extracting and
transferring program data to Brown University; 4) linking parti cipant data with Medicare and nursing
home assessment data.
2.Materials, Methods and Analysis. The study design, methods and procedures must be adequately
described in order for the IRB to understand all activities in which human subjects will participate. The
IRB must also be able to differentiate those proce dures that are performed for research purposes from
those that are performed for routine care or evaluation.
This application is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial com paring outcomes among two
approac hes for delivering meals to food insecure older adults with Alz heimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). Research procedures include assignment to one of the tw o predominant modes
of meal delivery in standard practice, primary data collection, and se condary data analysis.
We propose a two-arm, parallel, randomized control trial. The initial pha se of this project will be a
pilot phase with one aim.

BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021Aim 1. Test and validate procedu res to recruit participants wit h ADRD and evaluate their
outcomes in partnership with MOW programs. The goal of this aim is to test and validate the
vital elements and procedures for conducting the pragmatic effe ctiveness trial: specifically, 1)
enrolling persons with ADRD on MOW programs’ waiting lists to r eceive one of the two types of
meals; 2) recruiting a subsample of participants and caregivers to pa rticipate in telephone interviews;
3)extracting and transferring program data to Brown University; 4) linking participant data with
Medicare and nursing home assessment data
Enrolling Persons with ADRD on  MOW Programs’ Waiting Lists to R eceive One of the Two
Types of Meals. We will work with programs during this pilot research award to test the
procedures for enrolling persons with ADRD who are on programs’ waiting lists to receive one of
the two types of meals that are currently provided by home-deli vered meals programs (i.e., meals
delivered multiple times a week by the MOW programs versus froze n, drop-shipped meals) As a
note: we have been informed by th e MOW programs that the freque ncy of the daily delivered meals
has been shifted to multiple times a week due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thes em e a lr e c i p i e n t s
are still receiving the same number of meals, but delivery may occur multiple times a week instead
of daily. Daily meal delivery may resume when the MOW programs are able to safely do so. Both
types of meals are regularly  provided to individuals with demen tia. To do this, the MOW program
will identify individuals who are already on their waiting list  and during the initial intake indicated
that a doctor or other healthcare professional had indicated th at they suffer from memory loss,
cognitive impairment, any type of dementia, or Alzheimer’s dise ase (this could be self -reported or
by the person making the referral). This information is a vailable in the programs’ intake records and
therefore will not require any a dditional data collection or sc reening procedures. Brown University
will randomize those individuals into one of the two groups (me als delivered multiple times a week
by the MOW programs or frozen meals) and notify the MOW program.  The MOW programs will
reach out to individuals and offer them the delivery type. If a n individual agrees to come off of the
waiting list, they will begin receiving meals. If not, they wil l remain on the waiting list (i.e., there is
no penalty for declining). The MOW program will inform theindiv idual that their decision to come
off the waiting list will not influence their place on the wait inglist -- that is, if (for whatever reason)
decide not to continue to receive their randomly-assigned mealtype, the individual will be returned
to the waiting list and will not lose their spot. We are requestinga waiv er of informed consent for
this portion of the study, as we believe this study meets the f ive criteria for a waiver as described in
45 CFR §46.116 f 3 (i-v) and detailed below. For those who have  agreed to receiving one of the two
types of meals, MOW will send c lient intake information that th ey regularly collect (e.g., name,
address, phone number, date of bi rth, last four of SSN, race, g ender, living arrangement) to Brown
University through secure methods. Brown University researchers  will randomize the participants
and will communicate assignments back to the MOW programs. Upon  receiving the assignment, the
MOW program will begin service for clients and continue to serv e the assigned meals for six
months. Following the six-month study period, individuals may c ontinue to receive their assigned
meals or roll onto the MOW programs’ usual service (i.e., meals delivered multiple times a week by
the MOW program). Importantly, the three programs who are parti cipating have agreed to continue
to serve meals to interested individuals after the study period ends .
Recruiting a Subsample of Participants to Take Part in Telephon e Interviews . To obtain rich
information about the context, implementation, and mechanisms o f impact associated with receiving
meals, a subset of PWD who accepted the intervention will be interviewed by Brown researchers. To
do this, the MOW program will send an invitation letter and inf ormed consent sheet to participants
from the first two programs (VNA Texas and Neighborly) approxim ately one month after the first
meal delivery. This letter will include an invitation to participate in an in-depth, semi-structured
pilot phone interview with Brown University researchers. Intere sted individuals will “opt -in” to
participate by contacting the research team with the information include d in the initial invitation

describe the study and will let them know that a member from the research t eam will contact them
unless they “opt-out”of the study.
Within this introductory letter, we will provide our contact information and will also include a
refusal to participate postcard that participants will be asked to compl ete and return if they
do not wish to participate in the study. For participants for w hom we do not receive a refusal
postcard, telephone call, or email indicating that they are not  interested in participating, we will
make no more than 3 attempts to contact them between the hours of 10am and 7pm, in their
representative time zones.
The Brown University research team will call the interested par ticipants, complete an informed
consent process over the tele phone, and conduct the interview. Pilot interview questions will be
guided b y the Medical Research Council’s Process Evaluation Framework. We will include
questions focused on implementation (e.g., participants’ intera ction, if any, with the driver/mail
carrier who delivers their meals), mechanisms of impact (e.g., participants’ e xperiences receiving,
preparing, and eating meals); and outcomes (e.g., participants’  satisfaction with the meal services).
We will also administer the Te lephone Interview for Cognitive S tatus (TICS-M) to assess
participants’ cognitive abilities. We will t est our procedures for recruiting and conducting the
interviews with 2-10 participants at each program. While we ini tially proposed to conduct in-person
interviews, because of COVID- 19, we will pursue telephone inter views and should conditions
change, we will seek IRB approv al to conduct in-home interviews . Nonetheless, telephone
interviewsare efficient, cost-saving, and allow for the greatest amoun t of privacy for participants.
Recruiting a Sample of Caregivers to Take Part in Telephone Int erviews. We will conduct
semi-structured telephone intervi ews with a subset of caregiver s of PWD who accepted the
intervention to better understand the process of receiving meal s and potential mechanisms behind
outcomes observed. We will test  our procedures and pilot the in terview guide with 2-10 caregivers
at each program with separate methods at the three programs (i. e., VNA Texas, Neighborly Senior
Services, and MOW-San Antonio). In the first site, VNA Texas, M OW programs will mail the
invitation letter to the emergency contact listed in th e clients’ records approximately three months
after the participant begins receiving meals. Interested caregi vers will “opt -in” to the study by
contacting Brown University rese archers who will describe the s tudy, obtain verbal consent to
participate over the telephone, a nd conduct the telephone inter view. In the second and third sites,
Neighborly Senior Services and MOW-San Antonio, researchers wil l ask participants who are
interviewed if they would share the contact information of an i nformal caregiver. Brown University
researchers will mail a welcome letter approximately three mont hs after the participant begins
receiving meals, which will describe the study and that a membe r from the research team will
contact them to schedul e the interview unless they “opt -out” of the study. Within this introductory
letter, we will include a refusal  to participate postcard that caregivers will be asked to complete and
return if they do not wish to participate in the study. For car egivers from whom we do not receive a
refusal postcard, telephone call, or email indicating that they  are not interested in participating, we
make no more than 3 attempts to contact them between the hours of 10am and 7pm, in their
representative time zones. The Brown University research team w ill be responsible for calling
caregivers, conducting an informed consent process over the tel ephone, and completing the
interview. These interviews, also guided by the Medical Researc h Council’s Process Evaluation
Framework, will focus on caregivers’ experiences and caregivers' perceptions of  participants'
experiences receiving meals, their interactions, if any, with the person who delivers their meals (i.e.,
driver or mail carrier), how the meal service may have impacted  their lives (e.g., responsibilities,
stress, burden), and their satisfaction with the meal services.  We have chosen to conduct telephone
interviews because they are an efficient, cost-saving, and effective wa y to ensure a diverse set of

Extracting and Transferring P rogram Data to Brown University . During this pilot study, in
addition to developing our data sharing platform and testing da ta transfer with our pilot sites, we
will test data transfers at least twice per participating progr am. We will ask MOW programs to
shareenrollment and programmatic  data that is regularly collect ed from current clients who have a
self- reported diagnosis of dementia/cognitive impairment. This is information that is routinely
collected and available in MOW programs’ records. While we have  confidence in our ability to
obtain and link MOW program data to CMS data given our work in a previously funded study, the
goal of this activity is to test the data sharing platform and refine instructions provided to programs.
Brown staffhave considerable expe rience receiving data directly  from a variety of sources (e.g.,
nursing home corporations) in various formats for pragmatic tri als. Our IT director will work with
MOW staff around data transfer options. Options will include tr ansfer by physical media or through
electronic submission. By either method, data will be encrypted  to at least AES-256 standards prior
to transmission. Passwords wi ll be transmitted out of band, eit her verbally or via email, or an SMS
textmessage.
Linking Participant Data with Medicare and Nursing Home Assessm ent Data. Participant data
(i.e., first and last name, phone number, date of birth, race/e thnicity, gender, address, last four of
SSN) will be shared with Brown investigators by MOW programs vi a secure methods and
downloaded to a secure Brown server. Participant information wi ll be shared securely with
HealthAPT to obtain identifiers (i.e., bene_id) to link across the Medica re enrollment record, nursing
home MDS, and claims. Our team has access to 100% national data through our P rogram Project and
the PI and co-investigators on this proposal are intimately fam iliar with the data and adept in linking
files in this way. We will assess the match rate with these uni que identifiers to determine the best
combination of data needed for linkage in the full trial. Furth er, we will use the current enrollment
data to estimate the probabil ities of linkages for our non-matc hes using our previously derived
algorithm that we used to link MOW client data with Medicare en rollment records without unique
identifiers. Finally, we will conduct initial exploratory analy ses to determine if nursing home
placement differs between the two groups of participants in the pilo t.
3.Participant Population. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that the
selection of participants is equitable and reas onably related to the purpose and aims of the
research. The IRB must also consider whether adequate safeguards are in place to minimize
any risks that are unique to vulnerable populations. To make this determination, the IRB must
review all methods and materials used to contac t and recruit potential participants, including
letters, flyers, emails, etc.
During this pilot phase, we will work with three programs who will deliver m eals to 235 participants. This
willallow us to refine the process for enrolling and randomizin g PWD to receive meals. To do this, we will 
pilot the procedures with three MOW programs: Neighborly Senior Services in Clearwater, Florida; VNA 
Texas inDallas, Texas; and Meals on Wheels –San Antonio in San Antonio, Texas.
The inclusion criteria for receiving meals include being on the waiting li st, 66 years of age or older (to allow
for Medicare enrollment and a one-year baseline lookback) and s elf-reporting a diagnosis of dementia or
cognitive impairment. Age and self- reported diagnosis come from the MOW programs’ intake records a nd
therefore no additional screening or data collection is require d for receiving meals (i.e., enrollment in the
study).

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021There is no requirement that participants be English-speaking i n order to receive meals. MOW programs
during their usual intake procedures confirm that individuals h ave working refrigerators, microwaves, etc.
necessary to store and heat the food. Both participating progra ms, like many MOWA-member programs, have
procedures in place for supplying this equipment if it is deter mined that a client is in need. MOW programs
may have a limited ability to assess individuals' cognitive abilities to store, heat, or prepare food. Furthermore,
there are many MOW programs in which frozen meals are the only option - these programs do not withhold
meals for individuals with diminished cognitive abilities.
The goal is to test, on a very small scale, procedures that we will use later o n a not-yet-funded R33. The R33 is
designed to be pragmatic and will  be scaled up to the anticipat ed goal sample of 2300. We selected 235
participants for this pilot because we want to ensure we will r each the goal we had set out in the short time
period of the pilot project.
For the interviews, we will re cruit a subsample of 2-10 persons  with dementia receiving meals and 2-10
caregivers at each program to pilot the procedures and intervie w guides. For persons with dementia, inclusion
criteria consists of receiving meals, being English-speaking, a nd having capacity to consent at the time of the
consent discussion and interview. Members of the research team have previ ous experience conducting research
with individuals with impaired decision-making capacity. Althou gh participants can end the interview at any
time, the research team members conducting the interview will c ontinue the interview even if the reliability of
the information provided is sus pected to be incomplete or not p ertinent to the question asked. As a pilot of this
procedure for the larger trial , the quality of the data reporte d by participants with dementia is of interest to the
study team.
The research team members conduc ting the interviews (i.e., Dr. Gadbois, Dr. Shield, Dr. McAuliff) will
identify and make note when the content provided by the participant does n ot contain information pertinent to
the questions being asked. As long as the person with dementia participating in the interview is not distressed
and wants to continue, then the i nterview will be completed as planned. In our experience, a participant may
understand a question later in the i nterview and be able to pro vide relevant information even in cases where
they had a less reliable respons e to an earlier item / intervie w question. However, if the  participant is not able
to meaningfully respond to a series of questions such that a la ck of data integrity is clear the interviewer can
end the interview early. If th at occurs, the research team memb er will end the interview by thanking the
participants for their contribution (e.g., “Thankyou for sharing that with me. That is all of the questions that I
have for you today. I really appreciate you taking this phone c all. Is there anything else that you want me to
know?”). It is not necessary to tell participants the interview  is being discontinued, in all cases empathy and
dignity will be prioritized.
For caregivers, interview inclusion criteria consist of being an informa l caregiver of a PWD who is receiving
home-delivered meals and English-speaking.
4.RecruitmentMethods
Randomization to Meal Group : MOW program staff will identify individuals on their existing  waiting lists who 
are age 66+ years and have a self-reported memory impairment or diagnosis of dementia. This information is 
available in the programs’ intake records and therefore will not require any additional data collect ion or screening
procedures.
Brown University will randomize individuals into one of the two  groups ( meals delivered multiple times a weekby theMOW programor frozen meals) and notify the MOW program. The MOW programs w ill reach out to individuals and offerthem the delivery type, allowing them to come off the waiting list. However , participation is voluntary and if individuals donot want to come off of the waiting list, they willretain their  place on the waiting list. The MOW program will inform the
individual that their decision to come off the waitinglist will  not influence their place on the waiting list - meaning, if the y
decide not to continue to receive their assigned meal type, they will be ret urned to the waiting list and will not lose theirspot.Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 10/06/2021

BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021The average time that clients spend on a waiting list at these three programs is between 3-5 months;
individuals who decline to participate or who decide to leave t he study and return to the waiting list
will keep their original place on the waiting list (i.e., their  accrued waiting time). The client
information will be shared with the research team at Brown Univ ersity who will be responsible for
randomizing the client to meals delivered multiple times a week by the MOW program or bi-
weekly, drop-shipped meals, and communicatingthe assignment bac k to the MOW program. We
will consult with participating programs, our expert ethicist c onsultant, Emily Largent, PhD, RN,
JD, and the Brown IRB on the process (e.g., general barriers to enrollme nt, reasons for refusal).
Based on this feedback, we will make refinements to the implementation str ategy and training
materials for the larger trial.
Brown has an established colla borative relationship with MOWA, which represents over 5000 home-
delivered meals programs. In partnership with MOWA, we have already recru ited 2 MOWA member
programs to participate in this  pilot (please see letter of sup port from MOWA). MOWA’s member
programs have agreed to collectively enroll clients with ADRD, to devote staff to implement the
intervention, and to work with the  Brown research team to devel op and execute secure data transfer
protocols. MOWA has ensured their support of recruiting additio nal programs to participate, if
needed.
Telephone Interviews with Participants : We will recruit 2-10 participan ts receiving meals at each pro gram to pilot
the telephone interview protocol. The MOW program will send an invitation letter and informed consent sheet to the
first two MOW programs (VNA Texas and Neighborly) approximately one month after the first meal delivery. This letter
will include an invitation to participate in an in-depth, semi-structure d pilot phone interview with Brown Universityresearchers. The invitation letter will describe the study and include the contact information for Brown University researcher swho the participant can call to express interest in participating. Inter ested individuals will “opt-in”to participate by
contacting the research team with the information included in t he initial invitation letter. If any of the participants from thefirst two programs (VNA Texas and Neighborly) do not respond to the initial letter, the Brown University research team
will send a second letter, reminding participants about the opp ortunity to participate in a phone interview. To test out a
different recruitment protocol in hopes of increasing participa tion, the Brown University research team will also send
participants from the third site (MOW-SA) an opt-out letter. Th is opt-out letter will describe the study and will let them
know that a member from the research team will contact them unless they “opt-out”of the study.
Within this introductory opt-out letter, we will provide our contact info rmation and will also include
a refusal to participate postcard that participants will be asked to com plete and return if they
do not wish to participate in the study. For participants for w hom we do not receive a refusal
postcard, telephone call, or email indicating that they are not  interested in participating, we will
make no more than 3 attempts to contact them between the hours of 10am and 7pm, in their
representative time zones.
A trained Brown University research team member will call the i nterested participants, screen participants, complete
an informed consent process, and complete the interview all ove r the telephone. The interviews will be scheduled at
a time of each participant’s choosing to ensure privacy and con venience. Interviews will be designed to collect
information about participants’ experiences receiving, preparing, and eating meals; their interaction, if any, with
the person who delivers their meals (i.e., driver or mail carrier); and the ir satisfaction with the meal services. Interviews
will be tailored around the needs of older adults with AD/ADRD. If the inter viewee loses his or her train of thought,
the interviewer will repeat the last topic or sentence. If participants ar et o oi m p a i r e dt oc o r r e c t l yo re f f e c t i v e l y
answer specific questions, the interviewer will use examples rather than open-ended questions.

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021In addition to the interview quest ions, we will conduct a brief  cognitive assessment (i.e., Telephone
Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS-M)) to estimate the participant’s level of cognitive
impairment. The TICS-M will be conducted after the interview questions, and the score will be
used to understand how experiences may differ for clients with differing levels of cognitive
impairment. There is no cut-off score on the TICS-M for conduct ing the interview and it will not
affect eligibility. Scores on cognitive screeners, like the TIC S-M, do not consistently predict
capacity to consent to research and clinical interview is consi dered the gold standard for capacity
assessment. That is why we are using a study-specific capacity to consent assessment and not the
score on the TICS-M.
Telephone Interviews with Caregivers : We will test our procedures and pilot the interview guide
with 2-10 caregivers at each program using two different method s at the three programs (one
program will use one method, the other two programs will use a different method). In the first site,
MOW programs will mail the invitation letter to the emergency c ontact listed in the clients’ records
approximately three months afte r the participant begins receivi ng emails. Interested caregivers will
“opt-in” to the study by contacting Brown University researchers. A trained member of the Brown
University research team will describe the study, obtain verbal consent to participate over the
telephone, and conduct the telephone  interview. In the second a nd third sites, researchers will ask
participants who are interviewed if they would share the contac t information of an informal
caregiver. Brown University researchers will mail a welcome letter appro ximately three months after
the participant begins receiving meals, which will describe the  study and that a member from the
research team will contact them to schedule the interview unles s they “opt -out” of the study. Within
this introductory letter, we will include a refusal to particip ate postcard that caregivers will be asked
to complete and return if they do not wish to participate in th e study. For caregivers from whom we
do not receive a refusal postcard, telephone call, or email ind icating that they are not interested in
participating, we make no more than 3 attempts to contact them between the hours of 10am and 7
pm, in their representative time zones.
A trained Brown University research team member will be responsible for ca lling caregivers,
conducting an informed consent process over the telephone, and completin g the interview.
Recruitment will continue with replacement until we achieve our  target total sample size of 2-10
caregivers at each program. Interviews aim to understand participants’ andcaregivers’ experiences
receiving meals, their interacti ons, if any, with the person who  delivers meals (i.e., driver or mail
carrier), how the meal service may have impacted their lives (e .g., responsibilities, stress, burden),
and their satisfaction with the meal services.
5.Compensation/Reimbursement
Participant incentives are included for persons with dementia and caregi vers who are participating
in the telephone interviews in the study. Persons with dementia will be ma iled a $50 pharmacy
gift card for a 30-minute telephone interview, an amount that is typically offered for interview studies
in populations with, or at risk for AD/ADRD. Caregivers will be mailed a $ 50 pharmacy gift card
for a 30-45-minute telephone interview.
6.Potential Research Risks / Discomforts to Participants. In order to approve the research, the IRB
must consider the risks posed to participants by th e research and any efforts to mitigate those risks.
The IRB needs to determine that the risks have been both minimized and are reasonable in relation to
the anticipated benefits to participants, as well as to the importance of the knowledge that may be
gained. The IRB will also consider whether th e informed consent process provides potential
participants with an accurate and fair description of the risks or discomforts.

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021The pilot is considered a minimal risk study. Potential risks t o individuals receiving meals
include mild distress due to not receiving the preferred type o f meal. While both options (i.e.,
meals delivered multiple times a week by the MOW program vs. frozen, ma iled meals) are
preferable to no meals at all, some participants may have a str ong preference for one over the
other and experience disappointmentif randomized to the non-preferred o ption. However, given
that participants will have expressedan interest in receiving m eals and are on the waiting list,
receiving any meals will be preferableto receiving none.
There is also a risk of breach of confidentiality to individual s receiving meals and those
participating in interviews. The risk of breach of confidential ity will be minimized to the
greatest extent possible by the stipulations set forth in the Data Use Agre ement with CMS, as
well as by the measures described below.
Protecting Participant Data
One risk of the study is a breach of confidentiality with the u se of identifiable data. All research
staff involved in the study will receive training in the protec tion of human subjects. The
procedures described here address our efforts to minimize the r isk of breach of confidentiality.
All data management and analyse s will be conducted by the Brown  Center for Gerontology &
Healthcare Research, leveraging its administration and computin g infrastructure. Researchers
and staff have many years of experience working with identifiable data fil es on a large scale and
have numerous security measures in place to ensure the integrit y and confidentia lity of the data.
CMS data will be covered under the strict terms of a data use a greement (DUA). At the
conclusion of this study, or by the date of retention identifie d in the DUA, a CMS “Certificate
of Disposition” certifying the proper destruction of all data o btained from CMS will be sent to
CMS. All non- CMS data will be handled in a similarly restrictiv e manner. In addition, all
output containing individual identifiable information is treate d as confidential data. This
information is never transferr ed electronically via email.
Identifiable information will  not be attached to any research d ocuments, and all data will be
identifiable only using the unique identifier specific to this study. All members of the research
team have experience collecting data from participants and using seconda ry data that contains
private health information. None of t he study team members have  had a breach of
confidentiality associated with their research.
For participants with dementia and caregivers taking part in the intervie ws, they may experience
some discomfort in responding to the interview questions as the y may bring up unpleasant
feelings or memories (for example, what things were like before they began  receiving meals).
However, these risks do not exceed those of topics considered in everyday l ife and are minimal.
In order to protect against these risks, the researchers will r emind participants that they are free
to stop the interview and recording at any time and it will not  impact the receipt of meals. The
interviewers will also offer participants to take a break durin g the interview if there is any
indication that the interview becomes too difficult or uncomfortabl e.
The justification for including  persons with dementia and their  caregivers in this study is the
scientific value of understanding how home-delivered meals help  people with dementia, who
make up approximately 30% of all MOW clients. Given this population’s unique needs, it is not
possible to conduct informative research for this research with  other populations (i.e., we have
selected this population for scientific reasons; it is not a convenience p opulation). In sum, this

delivery of services to people with dementia in the future –and is needed to improve service
quality for this population in support of their goal of living independent ly in the community.
7.Potential Benefits of the Resear ch. NOTE: Compensation for part icipation is not a benefit and
shouldnotbeincludedin thissection. In order to approve this research, the IRB must determine that
the potential benefits to research participants are reasonable in relation to the potential risks. Very
often, research at Brown does not include potential direct benefits to participants, but may only benefit
society as a whole by helping researchers.
Older adults with dementia on MOW waiting lists who agree to participate wi ll receive meals, as
opposed to remaining on the waiting list to receive meals. Furt her, this study would provide
information that would assist healthcare systems, providers, pa yers, programs, persons with
dementia, and their caregivers. The minimal risks to subjects a re reasonable for the importance
of the information that will help unde rstand the comparative ef fectiveness of the two
predominant forms of meal delivery for persons with dementia.
For individuals participating in interviews, they will not directly bene fit from being interviewed.
However, their participation wil l help us better understand the  experiences of older adults with
dementia who receive home-delivered meals.

Telephone Interviews with Participants : A trained co-investigator on the research team (Dr. Emily Gad bois
Dr. Renee Shield, and/or Dr. Katie M cAuliff) will assess the pa rticipant’s ability to understand and to express a
reasoned choice concerning the purpose of the study and the inf ormation relevant to their participation and
consequences of participation for the subject’s own situation. Dr. Gadbois, Dr. Shield, and/or Dr. McAuliff will
determine if all of the  following standards are met: Did the pa rticipant "make a clear choice"? Did the
participant show "understanding"? Did the participant show "rea soning/rational reasons"? Did the participant
show an appreciation of the persona l risks/benefits of particip ation in the study? This determination will be
accomplished through a four-item informed consent understanding  checklist included as an attachment. For
individuals who do not pass the 4-item consent capacity checkli st, they will be informed that they are ineligible
to participate in the interviews. If this event occurs, Dr. Gad bois, Dr. Shield, or Dr. McAuliff will allow as
much time as needed to allow the expression of any concerns. While Dr. Gadb ois, Dr. Shield, and Dr. McAuliff
have years of experience conducti ng research interviews, includ ing vulnerable populations such as those
experiencing cognitive impairment, they will receive training o n ensuring understanding by Dr. Michelle
Hilgeman, a geriatric psychologist with extensive research expe rience consenting and interviewing individuals

Dr. Shield, and Dr. McAuliff to re view their responses on the c onsent understanding checklist, answer any
questions, and discuss any challenges.
Telephone Interviews with Caregivers : A trained research team memb er will conduct the informed cons ent
process with the Caregiver. There is no reason to believe that the Caregiver will experience any challenges
comprehending the informed consent form as they are the person listed as the emergency contact for the MOW
participant. Therefore, the rese arch team member will assess th e Caregiver’s understanding of the consent
process through encouraging them to ask questions during the review of th ec o n s e n tf o r m .  D r .H i l g e m a na n dt h e
PI will regularly meet with the research team member conducting  the interviews and cons ent process to answer
any questions and discuss any challenges.
3. Documentation
Please see below for a request for a waiver of documentation of informed con sent for interviews.
4. AdditionalConsiderations
We request a waiver of documentation of informed consent for the telephone interviews with caregivers and
participants. We believe that we meet the criteria for a waiver as describ ed in 45 CFR 46.117(c)(ii):
The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which
written consent is normally required outside of the research context.
The interviews will be conducted over the phone and ask minimal  risk questions where we anticipate little to no
distress as a result of the interviews. Consent would not normally be requ ired for a telephone conversation of this
nature, and it would not be practicable to obtain signatures be cause the interviews are being conducted over the
telephone. We request a waiver of informed consent for initial enrollment to be randomized to receive one of the
Two types of meals (meals delivered by the MOW programs multiple  times a week vs frozen, mailed meals). We
believe enrollment in the tw o types of meal deliveries and anal ysis using routinely collected data meets the five
criteria for a waiver as described in 45 CFR §46.116 f 3 (i-v)and b elow:
(i)The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021Our study proposes to provide meals via the two predominant mod es of meal delivery currently used by home-
delivered meals programs and contracted for by healthcare entit ies to food insecure, homebound, community-
dwelling older adults with ADRD. Because we are recruiting from an existin g MOW waitlist, these individuals
have already expressed a desire to receive meals and shared the ir information with MOW, but they are not
currently receiving meals because of limitations in program cap acity (i.e., inadequate funding to meet demand
for meals). The primary outcome analysis for the trial is throu gh secondary data analysis of routinely collected
administrative data; therefore, no additional data collection i s required or burden will be placed on the enrolled
sample. Enrollment and receipt of meals puts these individuals at no great er risk than everyday life.
(ii)The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration;
Because we are interested in understanding the impact of receiv ing meals on the time spent in the community
among individuals living with dementia, we need to enroll indiv iduals with varying levels of dementia severity.
While some individuals with dementia may retain capacity to con sent to research (a diagnosis, especially a self-
reported diagnosis one, is not determinative), restricting the study to only those able to provide consent would
limit the generalizability of our findings, as we would likely only be able to enroll those with less-severe ADRD.
If we were to conduct a capacity assessment and sought to inclu de people who lacked capacity to consent to
research, we would need to identify a legally authorized repres entative (LAR). Most individuals with ADRD
living in the community do not have a LAR appointed. Some studi es have found rates as low as 0% of
individualswith mild dementia and only 11-23% of those with mod erate to severe dementia have legal
documents in place such as guardianship, trusteeship, proxy, or power of attorney (Ruggieri & Piccoli, 2003).
Furthermore, LAR rates vary by race and socioeconomic status an d are lowest among racial minorities and those
with less education(AARP, 2000) . Our prior work has found that MOW clients are more likely to be racial and
ethnic minorities and low-incom e than the general population of  older adults. In addition, MOW programs do not
collect information about clients’ LARs. Therefore, there is no  mechanism for identifying LARs for potential
participants in this study. Finally, MOW programs do not collec t information to identify possible surrogates for
consent. In addition,surrogate consent laws for research partici pation vary by state, and it would not be possible
to identify a consent process that is consistent across the programs that will participate in the follow-on
pragmatic trial and located
in 5 states. Taken together, requiring consent would result in bias through differential selection into the study
and comprise the validity and overall scientific value of the study find ings.
Waiving theinformed consent process allows us to include individualswho may not have capacity to give
consent, the very groupwhois most at risk of nursinghome placement andwh om we hypothesizewould
experience the greatest effect of this low-risk intervention that they ha ve already signed up to receive but are
currently unable to access because of program limitations. Notably, we are not asking for a waiver of consent
because we assume that no participants can consent; rather, we are asking f or a waiver because including only those
individuals for whom consent can be obtained (either directly from the par ticipant or from a LAR) would prohibit
conclusions to be drawn or bias the sample such that our conclusions would be skewed. In addition, there are two
other considerations. First, a goal of this pilot is to test the feasibilit y of the procedures for enrolling individuals with
ADRD in a study of the effects of receiving meals from MOW on time in the c ommunity. Our team will use the
experience from this pilot study to inform enrollment procedures in a foll ow-on pragmatic trial. While we are only
including 235 individuals in this study, the larger follow-on pragmatic study will in clude 2300 individuals with
ADRD. In that case, the sample size is so large that it would be impracticabl et oc o n d u c tc a p a c i t ya s s e s s m e n t sw i t h
each individual. Thus, it will be informative to test waivers here.
Second, our power calculations to derive our needed sample size for our la rger trial were based on our prior
observational study that included the population of MOW clients with vary ing degrees of dementia severity. We are
unable to conduct a power analysis and derive a needed sample size for our fo llow-on trial only among those who
have capacity to consent/less severe impairment; this information is sim ply not available. Therefore, by excluding
individuals who may not have capacity to consent, we may be underpowered to detect an effect for our primary
outcome, time to nursing home placement, in the larger trial.

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021(iii) If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the
research could not practicably be carried out without usin g such information or biospecimens in an identifiable
format;
We are proposing to use routinely collected administrative data for the an alysis of the primary and secondary
study outcomes. We require the data in identifiable format in o rder to link data received from the MOW
program to data received from the Centers for Medicare and Medi caid Services (CMS) at the client level and
could not conduct the study without the link. A waiver of consent is regula rly sought out for analyses that are
conducted using linked CMS data. Mea sures to protect the confid entiality of the information are described
below.
(iv) The waiver or alteration will not adversely af fect the rights and welfare of the subjects;
This study population with dementia is unique. While some indiv iduals with dementia could successfully
complete a consent process over the telephone, we would likely lose the ability to enroll those most likely to be
impacted by meal delivery type (i.e., individuals with more tha n mild cognitive impairment or mild AD)
confounding our ability to address the primary aims of this stu dy. The level of understanding necessary to
comprehend the study design during a telephone conversation wit h someone they have not met (i.e., consenting
to receive meals, which they have already requested) may introd uce added burden and distress. In addition, for
those who have previously requested meals but do not have capac ity to consent to receive meals through this
study, resulting in a return to the MOW waiting list, could be distressing. Some people may worry that
individuals on the MOW waiting list would feel they had no reas onable alternative to agree to participate in
research in order to receive meals or worry that they will not keep their place on the waiting list if they decline
to participate. By waiving the  consent process (as we have done  in previously funded studies), providing meals
to individuals, and linking MOW program data with claims data addresses th ese concerns and is consistent with
the pragmatic trial design.
(v) Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with
additional pertinent information after participation.
Finally, we will ensure that participants are provided information abou t the study upon completion of the study.
We will do this through including a description of the study an d results in the MOW programs’ newsletters,
which is shared with all clients and caregivers. Included will be the contact information of who to call for
additional information. In addition, we will mail a study summa ry to all participants and caregivers who took
part in the interviews.

BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021Forresearchthatinvolvestheuseof identifiablesecondarydata/biospe cimens,includingcodeddatafromwhich you maybeableto ascertain participant identity.
If your research does not involve identifiable secondary data / biospecimens, proceed to PART VI.DATASECURITY ASSESSMENT1. From what source(s) will you acquire or access the data / biospecimens?
Secondary data sources will incl ude participant data from MOW p rograms as well as CMS data.
We will utilize research identifiable (RIF) claims, enrollment, assessm ent, data from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). We will acquire these data through the strict terms of a data use
agreement (DUA) that we will enter into with CMS.
MOW participant data (e.g., fi rst and last name, telephone numb er, date of birth, race/ethnicity, gender,
address, SSN, client ID, emergency contact information, living arrangem ent, participant
dementia/cognitive impairment, diagnoses, functional status) as  well as programmatic data (e.g., meal
delivery start date, meal delive ry end date, breaks in service for meal delivery (including reasons for
break in meal delivery service, issues/complaints/satisfaction from participant, caregiver, or delivery
person, and total number of meals delivered to participant) will  be shared with Brown investigators via
secure methods and downloaded to a secure Brown University server.
As part of this March 2020 amendment we are adding two new data sources (both secondary data from
MOWA):
-Data from a 2013 pilot conducted by MOWA
This pilot was a programmatic evaluation conducted by MOWA and was not cons idered a research
study
-Programmatic data from 13 MOW programs.
Both of these datasets have already been disclosed to us without a DUA as par t of a pervious project,
and MOW is aware we will be reusing these datasets for this project.
Client information is covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement exe cuted between Brown and MOWA. We
will explore obtaining individual Data Use Agreements with part icipating programs if necessitated by the
programs, and will file IRB amendments as needed to reflect the need for DUA s if MOW requires them.
2. Describe the type(s) of data and date range(s) of the data you will use and the characteristics of the study
research population (e.g., age range, sex, and any other pertinent demo graphic information.)
The inclusion criteria for the current pilot include being on t he waiting list, 66 years of age or older (to allow
for Medicare enrollment and a one-year baseline lookback, so an yone over the age of 65 will be included) and
self-reporting a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment. Age and s elf-reported diagnosis come from the
MOW programs’ intake records.
Additionally, to determine the efficacy of two different modes of meal delivery (frozen vs. meals delivered
by MOW programs multiple times a week), we will leverage a prev ious pilot trial that was completed in
2013 with 626 participants randomized to three arms: 1)daily del ivered meals, 2) frozen, weekly delivered
meals, and 3) remain on the waiting list. From thePARTV.USEOFSECONDARYDATA/BIOSPECIMENS

BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/20212013 pilot, we have SSNs for 302 pa rticipants (123 participants  in the daily-delivered meal arm; 79
participants in the frozen, we ekly delivered meals; and 100 par ticipants who remained on the waiting list) that
we are requesting linkage for CMS  data to examine their charact eristics, healthcare utilization, and time to
nursing home placement. Eligibility criteria for the 2013 pilot data include being enrolled in the pilot. We will
also leverage data from 13 MOW programs (which includes 14,000 MOW participants) that we previously
linked to CMS claims using probab ilistic methods under a previo us DUA. Criteria for inclusion forthis cohort
include MOW recipients ages 66 and older receiving meals from one of the 13 MOW programs.
For each cohort, we will track their healthcare utilization, in cluding time to nursing home placement.
Additionally, for each cohort, we are also requesting from CMS a year of data prior to them entering the
cohort in order to compare their c haracteristics leading up to the receipt of MOW to see how similar they are
to one another. For the 2013 pilot data, this will entail using  data starting from February 6, 2012, and for the
13 MOW programs, starting on January 1, 2009 (with lookback to 2007 in order to characterize MOW clients'
healthcare utilization prior to e nrollment in MOW as well as th eir diagnoses and functional status changes
leading up to enrollment).
For the current pilot, this will entail using data starting from April 202 0.
Inclusion of Women. Women will not be oversampled but will be included as th ey appear naturally in the
populations described above.
Inclusion of Minorities. All races and socio-economic statuses will be re presented in the data as they appear
naturally in the target data populations.
Inclusion of Children. Not applicable - Our study examines the population of MOW clients age 66 and over.
3.We request a waiver of informed consent for the release of the MOW and C MS data under the Common
Rule. We acknowledge that:
(1)The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; the only risk is the
breach of confidentiality of the use of the data. Our safeguards are detail ed in the application.
(2)The waiver or alteration will not adversely af fect the rights and welfare of the subjects; No contact with
individuals is necessary for the completion of this project since all data will have been previously collectedfornon-research purposes. Results will be reported in aggregate and no publi shed reports will includeinformationon specific individuals.
(3)The research could not practicably be ca rried out without the waiver or alteration; We are
proposing to use routinely collected administrative data for th e analysis of the primary and
secondary study outcomes. We requi re the data in identifiable f ormat in order to link data received
from the MOW program to data received from the Centers for Medi care and Medicaid Services
(CMS) at the client level and could not conduct the study witho ut the link. A waiver of consent is
regularly sought out for analyses that are conducted using linked CMS data . Measures to protect the
confidentiality of the inform ation are described below
(4)Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after
participation. We will not have direct access to any individuals not enrolled in the
randomization portion of the study. Therefore, we will include a study sum mary and results in

4. HIPAA and Protected Health Information (PHI):
At the individual level, this project will use secondary data sources fro mt h eC e n t e r sf o rM e d i c a r ea n d
Medicaid Services (CMS), and Mea ls on Wheels (MOW). Direct iden tifiers such as social security
number, first and last name, telephone number, and address will  be present in the MOW data (not in
the CMS data), but other identif iers will be present in both da ta. The data contain personal health
information (PHI), and the CMS data will be disclosed to the re search team by the CMS under the
strict terms of a Data Use Agreement (DUA). Shells of the DUA f orm and executive summary (which
includes a drafted data management section) are included with this requ est.)
v. 6/5/2020 Page19of33
As part of the CMS DUA, we request that a HIPAA waiver of authorization be gr anted by the Brown
IRB in order to allow CMS to release the PHI to us. MOW may also require a DUA f or their data, we
are not yet sure about that and will update the IRB and the Bro wn DUA office before we pursue a
DUA.
We acknowledge that:
The PHI use or disclosure involves no more than minimal risk to the priva cy of individuals.
Part VI (3) and Part VI (6), as well as the Protections Against  Risk section below outlines how we
will accomplish protecting identifiers from improper use and di sclosure, as well as our plan to
destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with  research. In addition, we confirm that
the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity except  (a) as required by law, (b)
for authorized oversight of the research study, or (c) for othe r research for which the use or
disclosure of the PHI is permitted by the Privacy Rule.
The research could not practicably be conducted without the requested wai ver or alteration.
The CMS data used for this project have been previously collect ed for non-research purposes.
Depending on the cohort as desc ribed above, we will use data fr om 2007-2021. No contact with
individuals is necessary or desired for this study. It would be  impossible for us to obtain individual
permission from these individuals.
The research could not practically be conducted without access to and use o f the PHI.
The research could not be conducted without access to these individually identifiable data since CMS
does not release assessment data  (i.e., MDS) in less restricted  form. We need the PHI in the MOW
data to link to their CMS data, perform the randomization, and for follow-up. Additionally, we need
the PHI in order to determine the efficacy of the two different  modes of delivery on time to nursing
home placement (primary outcome) as well as days in community a nd hospital transfers (secondary
outcomes) among food insecure older adults with ADRD.
Protections Against Risk
Dr. Kali Thomas will ensure that systems are in place to minimize the risk of breach of

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021confidentiality for all data in this trial. Brown maintains numerous conf idential databases, including
MDS and Medicare files, and has a high level of security built into its com puting systems. Dr.
Thomas will work closely with MOWA leadership to develop protoc ols to maintain a high level of
data confidentiality for extracting and merging data from their programs’ records. She will also work
with our DUA manager (Dr. Julie Lima) and our IT Director (Jeffrey Hiri s).
All data transfers will be man aged by the IT Director. Those be tween MOW programs and Brown
University will be done by secured methods, likely via a secure  stfp server. Data will be encrypted
with an Advanced Encryption Sta ndard (AES) of at least 256-bit encryption algorithm. This is a
block cipher adopted as an enc ryption standard by the U.S. gove rnment. The National Security
Agency (NSA) has deemed the use  of 256- bit AES encryption algor ithm as secure enough for U.S.
government top secret information. Passwords will be transmitted out of b and, either verbally, email,
or via an SMS text message. Identi fiers for MOW clients will be  shipped to HealthApt to pull their
Medicare and assessment data from  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To maintain
and assure the security of iden tifiable information shipped to HealthApt, all finder files containing
secure information will, again, be encrypted to at least AES-25 6 standards. The files will be
password protected with a passwo rd no less than 10 digits in len gth and must contain a combination
of letters and numbers. The data shipment will be sent by a courier service w ith tracking capabilities,
such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, or Registered Mail options. The passwo rd and the DUA# to which the
finder file belongs will be emailed to H ealthAPT at CMSdata@gdit.com.
As mentioned above, The Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research maintains numerous
confidential databases and has a high level of security built into its com puting system. The
computing infrastructure consists of a VMScluster, which houses  all substantial data, a group of
Windows servers that provide computer services and infrastructu re support for client systems, and
client Windows PCs through which all Gerontology users access ou r systems. Network security is
provided by a combination of University firewalls, local networ k access controls, and continuous
auditing and monitoring for security breaches. All access from systems external to the local area
network (LAN) is limited to encrypted channels, e.g., Secure So ckets Layer (SSL) for Virtual
Memory System (VMS) terminal se ssions, or Virtual Private Netwo rk (VPN) connections for LAN
file-sharing access. (Unencry pted access is provided for the Cen ter's external website and general
email support functions.) The VMScluster acts as a file server for 186 Windows clients, and file
access controls are consistentl y applied whether access is from  the VMS or Windows environment.
Security within the system is  applied via Access Controlled Ent ry (ACE) attached to all files on all
systems. Security is applied uniformly to all files within a subtree of any file system, with the general
rule that groups of users sharing a common task may read each o ther’s files but, in most cases, not
write to each other’s files. VMS provides a highly -secure programming environment with ACEs
applied to all objects and extre mely controlled access to the l arger system for individual users, as
well as a versioning file system, secure batch queues and distr ibuted processing, and efficient backup
and recovery procedures. Windows clients are limited to a subse t of these services (e.g., there is no
way for file version information to be shown to Windows clients ), but otherwise access is secured as
for any other method of accessing data.
Personally-identified data, as we ll as partially de-identified data, are housed in files that are
restricted to systems managemen t or to programmers who have bee n identified as custodians. No
data are ever moved to more "public" spaces without identificat ion information being stripped or
non-reversibly encoded. Encoding is generally done via fairly l arge Roman cyphers applied
iteratively to the original character string. No reverse encodi ng is ever generated nor maintained.
Any matching between personally-identified data sources is done within a secured area prior to any

Brown University IRB Amendment Approval 05/11/2021
BrownUniversityIRBAmendmentApproval08/19/2021data being exported. Windows servers that house partially de-id entified data have matching ACEs
applied so that access restricti ons are applied consistently wi th VMS-based data. It should be noted
that since we use demographic covariates for many of our analys es, even the encoded data are best
considered partially de-identified. ACEs restrict access to all  data, such that access to any data
elements on the servers is limited to those staff authorized to  make such access. Authorizations are,
in turn, granted by the core system's support staff upon reques t from a PI or other appropriate data
owner. All users authorized to access systems have access to so me storage, which is considered
"general file sharing," but, by convention and policy, all indi vidual or otherwise restricted data are
prohibited from being stored on such space. Desktop systems are authorize d to specific users, and it
is assumed that they will store data that they have been author ized to work with on such local
systems. The LAN is switched, yielding a reasonable amount of s ecurity between clients and
servers within the LAN. Desktop systems are required to run cur rent anti-virus software and are
prohibited from running local file-sharing software. External a nalyses are run periodically to verify
the security of the systems within the LAN.
Similarly, the Windows servers that support the LAN are configu red as a local, isolated, secure,
collapsed Active Directory (AD) forest local to our LAN, Domain Name System (DNS), and
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP); other critical serv ices are secured within the
context of the local forest and are not accessible externally with the exce ption, of course, of VPN or
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access from authorized client systems. Ex tensive monitoring is
done from the VMS cluster to ensure  the health and stability of  the Windows forest structure and
the individual servers within it.
In summary, the VMS computer system is highly secure and access ible only to authorized users.
Within the group of authorized users, access to project data is  restricted to individuals who are
authorized to work on that specific research project. Access to identifie rs is further restricted to only
the systems manager and any person designated to do raw data me rges across files. Furthermore,
Gerontology employees have sig ned an oath of confidentiality, a nd its violation is sufficient
grounds for immediate termination. Results of this research wil l be presented for large groups so
that individuals cannot be identified. We will suppress the rep orting of any data where the number
of individuals is less than 11.

prevented?
Personally-identified as well as partially de-identified data is housed in files which are restricted to the
systems manager or to programmers who have been identified as C ustodians or project staff for a
specific data collection process which requires use of personal  identifiers. No data is ever moved to
more “public” spaces without personal identifying information b eing stripped and replaced by unique
and non-informative person IDs. Insofar as CMS provides such ID s (e.g., a study-specific beneficiary
ID) we have used them. Any matching between personally-identifi ed data sources is done within a
secured area prior to any data being exported.
It should be noted that since the Center uses demographic covariates and p rovider IDs for many of our
analyses, even the encoded data is best considered partially de -identified. ACEs restrict access to all
data housed by the Center, such t hat access to any data element s on the servers is limited to those staff
authorized to make such access. Authorizations are in turn granted by the core system’s support staff,
upon request from a PI or other a ppropriate data owner. All use rs authorized to access Center systems
have access to some storage whic h is considered “general file s haring,” but by convention and pol icy
all individual or otherwise restricted data is prohibited from being sto red on such space.
Desktop systems are authorized to specific users and it is assumed that the yw i l ls t o r ed a t at h a tt h e ya r e

amount of security between clients and servers within the LAN. Desktop systems are required to run
current anti-virus software and are prohibited from running loc al file-sharing software. External
network scans are run periodically to verify the security of the system s within the LAN.
Similarly, the Windows servers which support the LAN are config ured as a local, isolated, secure,
collapsed AD forest local to our LAN. DNS, DHCP and other critical service sa r es e c u r e dw i t h i nt h e

Brown Qualtrics: CIS has pre-vetted Brown Qualtrics for collection/storage of up to Risk Level III data . Qualtrics is the preferred
survey tool for all Brown research data collection.
REDCap: Brown does not currently have its own instance of REDCap. Access to REDCap through a Lifespan collaborator must be
explicitly identified.
Data collection: The expectation is that data collection devices will only store data during active data collection. Data must then be
transitioned to more secure long-term storage solutions.
Departmental/CIS managed servers: If data are collected/entered di rectly onto a Departmental or CIS managed server, you must
ensurethat the server meets the security standards described in the Minimum Security Standards for Servers based on the Risk Level
of the data identified in 1D.

assess which type of meal is best for our homebound clients with dementia by allowing them to
live longer in their communities. The project will be conducted with Meals on Wheels America
and include multiple member programs across the United States; one of thes ep r o g r a ms i t e s

Our program serves 2900 clients per year and currently has a waiting list of 900 individuals, 26%
of whom have been told by a healthcare professional that they suffer from me mory loss,
cognitive impairment, any type of dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease. We are eager to serve this
project as the research will have a direct impact on our operations, the hea lthcare system and
ultimately, the lives of our clients. We are increasingly contracting wit hh e a l t h c a r ep r o v i d e r s

Dear Dr. Thomas,
On behalf of Meals on Wheels America, it is with great pleasure that I am comm itting to our
continued partnership with Brown University in support of the p roposed pilot research, "Home-
delivered meals for persons with dementia: Which model delays nursing hom eplacement?”
Meals on Wheels America has been committed to building the evidence base th at
demonstrates the impact and value of home-delivered meals for a long time. Brown
University has been a critical partner in that endeavor.
The need for home-delivered meals is great and growing but the resources to meet this need
are woefully inadequate and millions of seniors are  going  without t hese  basic  services
leading to decline in health and well-being and  often,  institutional ization.  As  Meals  on
Wheels America has identified healthcare partnerships as its core strate gic priority in order
to drive resources to the provision of Meals on Wheels services to a far grea ter number of
seniors who can benefit from our services, including those with dement ia, the abilityto
demonstrate impact in terms of both healthcare outcomes and need for high- cost healthcare
services is essential.
The proposed pilot study will provide a much-needed opportunity to build o ut this evidence base
in areas that are of greatest interest to prospective healthcare partners , including what mode of
meal delivery works best for patients with dementia.
Meals on Wheels America is the leading national voice for the nat ion's estimated 5,000
community-based Meals on Wheels providers that are committed to serving s eniors
struggling with hunger and isolation. As a national organization, we advocate, provide
education and training, serve as a convener, conduct research, and much mo re  to
support the ability of the network to extend its reach and impact. In its con tinuing
partnership with Brown University, Meals on Wheels America wiII provide t he following
organizational support:
•Meals on Wheels America has secured support from two programs locat ed in
Florida and Texas (with waiting lists that include individuals with demen tia) to
participate in this pilot project. These programs have collectively agre ed to enroll 40
clients and to serve on the Stakeholder Advisory Panel. We are committed to
recruiting additional programs, i f needed, depending on what is lea rned during the
pilot phase of the project.
•Meals on Wheels America will contract with and manage our partnership with TRIO

•Meals on Wheels America will provide project management to our participat ing

project to ensure its success.
•We will co-host training of programs and monthly conference cal ls with programs
and research team.
•We will leverage our communications team and channels to disseminate

Throughout the development of this pilot project, the MOW progr am directors and I have been
involved in the study design and provided important feedback about feasib ility and outcomes. I
look forward to continuing to work with you and your team in th is capacity and engage with you
throughout the award by sharing Meals on Wheels experiences and pers pectives from working
with our clientele.

resources of Meals on Wheels America to fulfill our obligations as describ ed above. In my role
as Chief Strategy and Impact Officer, I will serve as the primary point of co ntact for this mission-
critical work to ensure that our responsibilities are executed in accorda nce with our agreement
with Brown University. In addition to my role as an integral member of the re search team, I will
also serve on the Stakeholder Advisory Panel alongside Uche Akobundu, PhD. We have
established a strong partnership and have worked closely together in the d evelopment of this
proposed research project.
I am confident that this research will be essential in our effo rts to partner with healthcare for the
delivery of Meals on Wheels services. As a result, we will be b etter positioned to ensure that no
senior in this country is hungry or isolated.

DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN2
Please reference the Data Management Plan Guidelines ,Data Management Plan Evaluation Guide ,Collaborator
Checklist ,a n d / o rt h e FAQ document for more information on completing this section. These materials are found under
the Executive Summary section of the New Study Requesting Data page of the website.
For research studies involving researchers from another organization that will have access to RIF or non-identifiable
files, please refer to the Collaborator Checklist for guidance and considerations to include in the Data Management
Plan.
For collaborating organizations that will be receiving a physical copy of the CMS data files, a full Data Management Plan
should be completed by the collaborating organization.
1.PHYSICAL POSSESSION AND STORAGE OF CMS DATA FILES
1.1.Who will have the main responsibility for organizing, storing, and archiving the data? Please provide name(s)
andjobtitle(s).
JeffreyRHiris,ITDirector
1.2.Describe how your organization maintains a current inventory of CMS d atafiles.
An Excel spreadsheet is used to track all incoming and outgoing  media. It records the media identity insofar as
itislabeled,dateanddirectionoftransfer,filesystemlocationofthef ilescopiedfromthemedia,andbriefly
describes the data. Decrypted versions of the raw dataare stored in the sam ef i l es y s t e ml o c a t i o n ,o r  b e l o wi t .
Raw data is stored in directories with a regular naming convent ion which clear identifies the source of the data.
No master inventory is maintained of all derivative datasets, h owever all CMS data is processed in a similar
fashion. 1) Raw data is read using whatever accompanying code o r formatting is provided by a program stored
in a single standard location by the Custodian; 2) one of a sma ll number of programmers then applies code to
standardize this raw data, such code being stored in a small nu mber of protected locations; and 3) all
standardized datasets are then stored in a small number of spec ific file system locations. Analytic datasets built
pursuant to a specific DUA are then stored in a DUA-specific an alysis location within the file system. Programs
which manipulate that data clearly identify the DUA, EDGN, and/ or any other identifying information provided
when the data us received. Second stage programs which further standardize the data clearing identify the
sourcedatauponwhichtheyoperate.
1.3.Describehowyourorganization bindsallmembers(i.e.,organizations,i ndividualstaff)ofresearch teams to
specificprivacyandsecurityrulesinusingCMSdatafiles.
All staff and organizations which handle CMS data covered by a DUA are identified on that DUA and if required
have signed the appropriate amendment which binds them to CMS requiremen ts. Center staff and any other
data users are required to sign internal confidentiality agreements cov ering all Center work with sensitive data.
This internal confidentiality agreement is found at the back of  the Center’s Handbook of Computing and
ResearchManualand issigned byallBrown andnon-Brown personnelworking ondata stored attheCenter.It

1.5.Describe your organization’s training programs that are used to  educate staff on how to protect CMS data files.
Brown staff are trained under the Brown CITI certification syst em in the handling of human subjects data. CMS
data is not considered different from other sensitive human subjects data .T h eC e n t e ri ss m a l le n o u g ht h a t
staffhandling sensitive data are trained internallyandinformally on th ep r o p e rh a n d l i n go fC M Sd a t af i l e s .
Staffhandlingsensitivedataarerequiredto readour Center’s HandbookofComputing andResearch and sign a
confidentiality agreement which indicates they understand the need to pr otect sensitive data, and the technical
requirements of maintaining such protections. In addition, our DUA Mana ger and Project Contact (currently
Julie Lima) gives a Center-wide talk 2-3 times yearly to outlin e ongoing policies and procedures for working with
confidentialdataattheCenter.
1.6.Explain the infrastructure (facilities, hardware, software, other) tha twillsecuret heCMSdat af iles.
a.Physical security for the servers housing sensitive data is provided by a c ombination ofBrown card-access controls
and physically secured space within a common server room. The n etwork switching infrastructure is maintained by
Brown and our network is protect ed by ACLs which limit external  access to services and protocols which are
unencryptedorotherwisetoosensitivetotraverseanexternal network.P owerandcoolingintegrityisprovided
byBrown facilitiesmanagement,including generatorpowerin the eventof a loss of external power.Hardware
supportforthe Center’s servers isprovidedbytheCenterandby BrowncentralIT(CIS).
b.Data is currently stored on file servers and is protected by AC Ls leveraging group membership to provide an
effective baseline security model. Access by client Windows systems is co ntrolled by the user’smembership in this
group structure. While the underlying security model is DAC, us ers are not granted Control access to any files nor
directories. Data is routinely moved between file servers as a part of routine systems support activities, and ACLs
controllingaccess areautomatically rewritten to theirbaseline statea sa partofany suchcopying.
c.While the Center does host a variety of modern services in supp ort of its mission, including Web servers, users
are strictly limited in how they can interact with such service s. The casual dissemination of Web content to the
publicinparticularisnotpossible.
Access to the Center’s internal networks is protected by multip le layers of firewalls and network access control
lists. The University as a whole is committed to a multi-year p lan to improve network security by moving
sensitive data resources into non- routable internal networks. Given the complexity of all the Cen ter’s
operationsandtheneedtomaintainacoherentnetworkinfrastructurethi sisamulti-yearprocess.
Remote access to any data, regardless of sensitivity, is in gen eral limited to remote access via Windows
terminal servers. (Trusted staff are permitted to make VPN connections us ing Center-owned and maintained
client systems.) Such servers are housed in the same data cente r as the Windows servers and operate in the
same security context.Some few staffhandling less sensitive data do make remote connections to theirusual
desktopsystems,whichispermittedbutdiscouraged.
1.7.Describethepoliciesandprocedures r egardingthephysicalpossessiona ndstorageofCMS datafiles.
The Brown CIS Acceptable Use Policy (defined in http://www.brown.edu/ci s/policy/aup.php) requires that all
users of Brown computing resources are limited to those resourc es for which they have appropriate
authorization and are to use those resources in a manner consistent with t heir authorization. CMS identifiable
data files fall into the category of PIHI data and their approp riate use is defined by general by the Policies and
Procedures Relating to Research P rivacy of the Office of the Pr ovost
(http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Provost/policies/rpp.html) . In a general sense, CMS data files may be
broken into three classes, namely identifiable data, Limited Da ta Sets (as defined in the context of the above
Policy), and de-identified data with small cell suppression app lied. Functionally, CMS data may be classified as
media received from CMS and local computer files built from the  data contained on such media. All received
CMS data file are stored in the Center’s locked section of the machine room. Normally, they are either in that
secure location or in the physical possession of the data custo dian, for example when received from a courier
service.Similarly,workingcopiesofdata filescontaining PIHIorLDSda taareonlystoredon serverswithinthat

secure locked location. LDS datasets may be analyzed locally on workst ations within our firewalled network,
but are not stored on such local systems. All data acquired und er a DUA which is identifiable, protected,
embargoed, or otherwise sensitive is never stored on user-contr olled removable media of any type. As a
standard Disaster Recovery procedure such data is stored in an encrypted form on removable backup media.
As outlined in the accompanying justification letter to this DUA request, one complete set of tapes will be held
externally for Disaster Recovery (DR) purposes in a secure vaul t maintained by Iron Mountain at their Rhode
Island offsite facility located in Chepachet, RI, 02814. Others  are maintained in the same secure environment
asourserversandsecuredin the same fashion (thatis,withlimitedaccess bysystems staff,behind twolocked
doors,andwithcardaccesscontrols).
Why: in the event of a catastr ophic failure of the Center's com puting infrastructure it is essential that a
reasonably recent backup copy of all da ta and software systems be maintain ed.Note that internally we
maintain multiple copies of basically all data and systems on n on-removable media, replicated between various
storage systems. Such replication is secured by the use of loca l disks, firewalls, and/or encryption. However, in
the event of a catastrophic environmental failure (e.g.a water leak lead ing to a roof collapse over the server
room near in time to a similar disaster in the DR replicate server room), ora malicious software attack leading
todataloss(e.g.,aransomware attack),anoffline backupwould beessent ial toensure recovery.
Physical safeguards:all backup tapesexceptfor those storedoffsite for DR purposesare storedwithin the same
physical environment as the Center's main servers. Any retired media are physically crushed before being
removed from the server room before being shipped out as e-waste for shre dding and recycling. (Our current
media are Linear Tape Open (LTO) tapes which cannot be effectiv ely de-gaussed). The one offsite copy will be
picked up by an Iron Mountain courier for storage in their faci lity, such copy to consist of a box of tapes in a
container secured with a locking tag. After the first copy has been transfe rred a monthly swap will occur via
the Iron Mountain courier. Given the media are encrypted there seems minim al operational risk in allowing

on each project. From a computer operations perspective, each P I is required to identify any unique security
groups or contexts within their research, and to identify team members who should be granted access to
specific resources. (For example, any project with PIHI and LDS  data would have a more secure location and
more restricted group for PIHI access, a separate space and group for LDS ac cess.) Given the small number of
PIs within the Center, this has been controlled informally usin g e-mail as the control system and the local
authorization databases as the system of record, but given CMS’ s requirement of auditable controls, we are
developing a paper recor dssystem to document rightsgranted to staff memb ers.Note that as a matter of cost
control much of the CMS data provided to the Center is handled by a small numb er of programmers who work
across all CMS projects on initial data preparation and removal  of PHI identifiers. (Thus, the role of these core
programmers with respect to the CMS PIHI data for any individua l research project is not specifically tracked
since they have the same duties with respect to all projects.) Research team members who are not a member
of this small group of programmers will be granted limited acce ss to data as needed for their duties, or to

life safety personnel and other necessary University exceptions . Technical safeguards are primarily provided by
the use of access controls on data stored on the core servers. Software interfaces which can access the data
are limited in number, scope, and connectivity to other systems , and tightly controlled by the Center. In
particular, unencrypted transmission of any Center data outside  the secure internal networks is blocked insofar
as technically possible. Ultimately, the security and integrity ofall C enter data depends upon the diligence and
integrityofthestaffhandlingthedata.
Physical security for the servers housing sensitive data is provided by a c ombination of Brown card-access controls

2.DATA SHARING, ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION
2.1.Describe your organization’s policiesandproceduresregarding the sharing,transmission,anddistri bution of
CMSdatafiles.
Itisour policy that data is received underadatauseagreementwithCMSand cooperatively the PIactsaslocal
functional data owner and the Center as technical data owner. A ny sharing, transmission, or distribution is
strictlycontrolledbytherequirementsoftheDatauseAgreementsignedw ithCMS.
ItisaviolationofBrownPolicy tomovePIHIorLDSdata out from the secure s ystems toanylesssecuresystem,
and as a matter of Center Policy no portable systems nor remova ble media are authorized for the storage of
identifiable data except as part of our Disaster Recovery plan as outlined in sections 1.7 and 1.8 above and in
theaccompanyingjustification letter.
In the exceedingly rare case of the transfer of non-identifiable data, t he encrypted data file may be transferred
using encrypted network protocols , notably https, with password  protection for the transfer. Note that
separate passwordsare used forencryption and transfer, andboth are shi pped via other media and methods.
General Brown Policies regarding appropriate data use are bindi ng upon all faculty and staff of Brown
University.Inparticular:

Ultimately the “Policy on the Ha ndling of Brown Restricted Info rmation” (https://it.brown.edu/computing -
policies/policy-handling-brown-restricted-information) defines in general terms the need to protect human
subjectsdata,whichwould includeanydata receivedfrom CMSunderaDUA.
That in turn references “Policie s and Procedures Relating to Re search Privacy”
(http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Provost/policies/rpp.html)  which defines in general terms the
requirementsfordefiningandcontrollingaccesstoPHIdata.
Somewhat tangentially, data received fromCMS under a DUA may be viewed as t he property ofCMS, even if
not personal health information. The use of such data is covered in gene ral terms by the “Acceptable Use
Policy” (http://www.brown.edu/cis/policy/aup.php) which requires compli ance with the requirements of the
data’sowner.
Within the Center’s context, we have a Handbook of Computing an d Research that artic ulates procedures for
the handling of CMS data. However, note that ultimately a DUA i s an agreement between the PI and CMS; the
Center is a component of Brown and cannot change Brown Policy n or make new Policy. It can augment Brown
Policyregardinginternaloperations,suchasthemechanicsofdatatrans fers.
Atpresent,all external data transfers ofsensitive data are handled by theData Custodian for theCenter.
2.2.Ifyourorganizationemploys a datatracking system,pleasedescribe.
There is no industry definition for this term, but insofar as i t is commonly used, we do not employ a data
tracking system. It is a violation of Brown Policy to move PIHI  or LDS data out from the secure systems to any
less secure system and asamatter ofCenterPolicy no portable systems norr emovable media are authorized
for the storage ofidentifiable data exceptas partofour DisasterRecover yp l a na so u t l i n e di n  s e c t i o n s1 . 7a n d
1.8 above and in the accompanying justification letter. Note that followi ng best practices, Center computer
securityisimplementedinaconcentricfashionwith allaccesstosecured locationswherePIHIdatashouldbe
stored limited to a small number of staff persons. Most research  team members have no access right to PIHI
data,andlimitedaccesstoLDSdataasappropriatetotheirrole.
The Center has undertaken internal discussion in this regard, a nd is in the process of determining how best to
track CMS (and other sensitive data) within our systems. Given current l imits to technical controls that canbe
applied when Investigators and staff are working on numerous projects wi th different DUAs, ultimately any
such process is dependent upon staff adhering to Policy requiri ng such tracking. It is therefore unclear whether
tracking individual data items is  useful; we currently employ a n implicit classification scheme that aligns
security descriptors with storage locations. Aligning that scheme with DUA requirements and in turn requiring
that files covered by a DUA be stored in the place that classif ies them as belonging to that DUA may thus be a
morescalableapproachthaninventoryingandtrackingdatasetsindividu ally.
The Center is working on a documented version of these procedur es. This is therefore explanatory, not
requiredprocedure.
In general, note that the Center’s computer operations are gene rally based within Windows, based on access to
individual files. No database technology is used to store CMS d ata for general use. Files are organized into
trees and read access to a tree from a specific root downwards is granted to specific groups of users. Write
access is granted to a subset of those users atand below certain nodes in the file tree. Given the needs to users
to create their own files and the need for consistent security, it is consid ered neither feasible nor supportable
tomanageaccesstoindividualfileswithinthefiletreeexceptasabove.

Informally, all incoming data is stored by the Custodian within a set of locations to which only a subset of the
professional programming staff. Specific code is responsible for rem oving primary identifiers from incoming
data, and otherwise cleaning it and standardizing it, before it is placed i nto different “base file” locations. Read
access to this partially de-identified data is then granted to additional analysts, PIs, and staff, upon receipt of an
appropriateconfidentialityform.
Finally, each DUA (or other type of project, e.g. contract) has  one or more file trees dedicated to its work.
Accessto these isgrantedby systemsmanagement staff upon receiptofa re quest from the PI.Note thatsuch
requestsalsoinformthegrantofaccesstobasefiles,e.g.claimsdata.
Therefore,ultimately the classification system is based upon location of a file within the file trees; essentially,
the top-level directory identifies the classification of the files withi n. DUA-specific analytic files are clearly
identified as being part of that project. Incoming and base fil es of various types, e.g. claims and MDS
assessments, are identified as such, but their creation and des truction is the responsibility of the Custodian
and,rarely,coreprogrammingstaffunderthedirectionofaPI.
Since data is stored within files, access could be tracked via various audit and alarm mechanisms. To date we
have no requirement to provide such tracking, and to be honest,  it would be hard to effectively track access in
thesenseofreduceandanalyzeaccesspatternsgivenfundinglimits.
Note that itis a matter ofCenter policy that all data be stored in accordan ce with the above guidelines, at least
for current research. We do know, from the inception of a DUA o r other project, which spaces users are
requiredtostorefilesforthatprojectin.Wedonotcentrallytrackthena me,size,orotherspecificsofthefiles
that are developed in the course ofa project, any more than we centrally tr ack the names of documents and
spreadsheets produced. The PI has complete visibility over all files within the space for a given DUA and is
responsible for certifying the destruction ofall datasets within said s pace as partofDUA termination.
2.3.Describe thepolicies andprocedures your organizationhasdeveloped for thephysical removal, transportand
transmissionofCMSdatafiles.
ThePolicyRelating toResearch Privacy from the Office oftheProvost,ref erenced above,coversallhandling of
PIHI, and requires that it be kept confidential. Within our Cen ter, in all cases, whether data is inbound or
outbound, no sensitive data in transmitted nor received unless encrypte d. Encryption is generally applied
which includes the AES-256 standard, although other strong encr yption may be applied under specific
circumstances. (For example, while not relevant to the handling  of CMS data, SSL encryption is commonly
employed for websites which must display PIHI or other PII.) En cryption keys are transmitted separately, if
possibleusingalternativemediaand/orchannel.
2.4.Explain how yourorganization will tailorand restrict data access privil eges based on an individu al’srole on the
researchteam.
Depending upon the needs of the research team, one or more secu rity project groupings are used. Each project
grouping allows for staff to be assigned read-onlyor read-write access to project files, although read-write
access is further limited to specific directories in a regular and well-defined fashion. Projects handling PHI or PII
will in general need access to at least two project spaces, one  for datasets including sensitive identifiers, one for
datasets stripped of such identifiers. Given the level of CMS da ta re-use and staffing constraints it is not
uncommon to have three to five levels of project groups associa ted with a given research team, some spanning

Passwords are required to be reasonably long and complex, strik ing a balance between recall limits and
technical requirements. Passwords must be changed frequently, a nd a common password is used across all
interactivesystems. Some systemsused by junior staffdoenforce session timeoutlimits,but ingeneral staffare
permitted to work after hours and thus systems are operational 24 x 7. Encr yption within the protected systems

The standard interface for most users is expected, but not requ ired, to be a Windows system, either a local
desktop or a remote desktop session on a central server. All Center owned ma chines are joined into a Windows
Domain, specific to the Center and locally managed. Idle sessio n screen locks are provided by GPO, but users
are able to change limits if they wish. Idle sessions are never  terminated since some software becomes “idle”
without saving intermediate results, and thus any form of automatic sessi on termination would cause lost work
product. Similarly, which the terminal servers will lock the re mote desktop session when idle, they do not
disconnectthesession.
Bypolicy,anyconfidentialdata,ofwhichallCMSacquiredunderaDUAisas ubset,shallnotbe storedonalocal
system. This includes laptops, desktops, mobile devices of othe r sorts, external storage devices, etc. The central
servers are secured by multiple layers of physical security. Si milarly the C enter’s network is isolated behind
multiple layers of switches and firewalls. Data at rest on serv er disks is not encrypted except insofar as it may be
prepared for a data transfer. Recognizing our poor disaster rec overy posture since unencrypted tapes cannot be
securely exported from theserver room, we’reengaged in a processofadding encryption to ourbackup system.
Data transfers within the Center’s local network are not encrypted, partly due to speed concerns, partly as a
matter of platform compatibility. The Center’s local network is blocked from allowing Windows or Unix native
file sharing method using standa rd ports. Data transfers for co nfidential data outside of the network are
prohibited, but terminal server traffic is always natively encr ypted. All network tra ffic beyond the Brown

and procedures for responding to potential breaches in the security and pr ivacy of the CMSdata.
Brown’sComputing Information Services: Policy on the Handling of Brown Restrict ed Information /computing-

Brown IRB, and CMS of known or likely exposure of CMS PII data,  and conversely CIS may notify the User of a
suspected security breach (https://it.brown.edu/information-sec urity/protect-university-data/brown-university-
cybersecurity-program). Specific notification to CMS per the re quirements of this DUA falls to Center systems
management as technical owner of the data. It is assumed that t his would occur via the CMS incident reporting
hotline. Notification will be ma de within 1 hour of the discove ry of any security breach. Note, however, that the
term“potential” above is disturbing; we will report any and all breaches where there is a rea sonable likelihood that

3.2.Explain how your organization’s data management plans are reviewed andapproved.
ApprovalisgrantedbyCenterseniormanagement to the systemsmanager to s elect,develop,andmaintain the
security infrastructure for the core systems, as well as other technical and functional supporting systems. PIs,
acting as functional data owners, work with systems and program ming staff, as technical data owners, to
manage project data. No Center formal review and approval proce ss has been implemented, nor would one be
appropriate. The Brown IRB does review and approve research pro posal involving PHI or PII with respect to
data security and confidentiality safeguards in the context of each specific research project, as does each data
ownerwithwhichaPIholdsaDUAforaspecificproject.
3.3.Explainwhetherandhow your organization’s data management plansare subjected to periodic updates during
theDUAperiod.
Data management plans are updated by PIs in response to changin g conditions and competing priorities. The
Center does not assert ownership of this process although we have insti tuted a limited annual review for each
project with the PI, aligned with yearly CMS expiration dates to confirm the personnel and data approved under
a particular DUA. In addition, certain types of DUA amendment r equests require a re-review of the data

are responsible for the destruction of any derivative data file s, which should have been stored in specific
projectspacesassociatedwith theirDUAorother projectscope,in compli ance withCMS policies.
Ultimately, the Custodian is responsible for certifying the dis position of CMS data, in accordance with our
standard business practices. Once signed, the form is handed ov er to our DUA Manager, Julie Lima, who
submits the formal requestfor DUA closure to CMS or the appropriate fede ral project officer orDUA Requester
with instructions to submit to C MS following current CMS policy  found at https://www.cms.gov/Research-
Statistics-Data-and-Sy stems/Files-for-Order/Data-Disclosures-Da ta-Agreements/DUA_-
_Extensions_Closures.htmlNote that all Center staff are covered  by Brown Policy on the handling of sensitive
data, and such Policies are written and maintained under the au spices of the office of the Provost. In particular,
such policies imply and require that staff not undertake to circumvent da ta destruction mechanisms. Such
Policy is freely available for review by all staff at any time. The Center is undertaking to amplify that Policy with
detailsinternaltoourbusinesspractices,inordertoclarifytheproced urerequirementsforadheringtothose
policies. To a first approximation, that means diligently erasing any all data covered by a DUA or IRBagreement
atthe terminationof suchagreement,exceptforsuch retentions asallowe d by suchagreements.
4.2.Describe your organization’s policies and procedures used to pr otect CMS data files when individual staff
members of research teams (as well as collaborating organizatio ns) terminate their participation in research
projects(whichmayincludestaffexitinterviewsandimmediateaccesste rmination).
The PolicyRelating to Research Privacy ofthe Officeofthe Provost,refer encedabove, in concert with the Brown
Acceptable Use Policy for computing resources, requires that no  use be made of any CMS data files after a staff
person’s association with a research project is terminated. As a matter of Center Policy, a s being developed to
meets CMS’s requirements for auditable staff allocations all re search staff will have signed a confidentiality
agreement covering their use of CMS data. Our Center is current ly considering putting a time limit on such
agreements and requiring regular renewal. Staff access to sensi tive data is terminated as soon as systems
managementstaffisnotifiedbythePIthatastaff member’s participationinaprojecthasterminated.Notethat
no work product destruction is ever undertaken by system staff, and thus a ccess termination is a relatively light-
weight process, should a staff member’s participation in a proj ect resume. Language has been added to the
CenterUser’sGuidereinforcingthesepoints.
Note that we do not currently have a policy which requires an exit interview relevant to data security.Staff have
no physical devices with any security significance and it would  be a violation of policy to have a local copy of any
confidential dataset, including a CMS dataset. Conveniently, th e Custodian is also the senior system
administrator,so assoon as he isnotifiedbythePIorother staff(eg.HR ad min),accessisterminated assoonas
possible. Practically, this means within minutes of notificatio n. PIs and other Investigators may of course
require exit interviews as a part of other business processes; the security plan does not encompass workflow
management. Note that revoking staff access to a protected proj ect space can be accomplished without
removing them from allaccesstoCentersystems.Such removalsare made in the same manneras terminations,
thatis,uponreceiptofarequestforsuchremovalbyaPItotheCustodian.
4.3.Describepoliciesandprocedures your organizationusestoinform CMSofp rojectstaffing changes,including

The Policy Relating to Research Privacy of the Office of the Pr ovost requires, through its reference of the IRB
approval process, that changes to the Principal Investigator (P I) be reported to the IRB. Separately, each DUA
between CMS and a researcher requires that CMS be informed of s taffing changes relating to those staff
members with direct and unsupervised access to CMS data. Proced urally, our Center PIs normally directly

4.4.Describe your organization’s policies and procedures to ensure original data files are not used following the
completionoftheproject.
General Brown Policies regarding appropriate data use are bindi ng upon all faculty and staff of Brown

Ultimately the “Policy on the Handling of Brown Restricted Info rmation” (https://it.brown.edu/computing -

That in turn references “Policie s and Procedures Relating to Re search Privacy”
(http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Provost/policies/rpp.html ) which defines in general terms the
requirementsfordefiningandcontrollingaccesstoPHIdata.
Somewhat tangentially, data received from CMS under a DUA may b e viewed as the property of CMS, even if not
personalhealthinformation. The useofsuchdataiscovered ingeneral ter msbythe “Acceptable UsePolicy”
(http://www.brown.edu/cis/policy/aup.php )which requires compliance with the requirements of the data’s
owner.
The Policy Relating to Research Privacy of the Office of the Pr ovost, referenced above, in concert with the
Brown Acceptable Use Policy for computing resources, requires t hat no use be made of any data acquired
under control of this or any other CMS DUA beyond the termination of that DU A.Therefore, by Brown Policy,
there is no authorized access to data files beyond completion o f their project. The Center’s User’s Guide
emphasizesthese points.(Note thatinall casesdataisauthorized foruse in a specific fashion in the contextof
a specific project. If CMS authorized re-use of data in an addi tional project within the Center, access to that
data is tracked separately in the context of each project.) Pro cedurally, data is erased from all systems as part
of the destruction process. Since the same staff receive, proce ss, and destroy the data, no technical controls
are applied beyond employing safety features such as disk high water marking. Similarly, PIs and staff are
responsible for storing derivative datasets in project-specific locati ons secured to limit access to only project
staff, and to erase any sensitive datasets as part of study ter mination unless the entire project space is being
erased.(Thislatterisnotnormallydone,butrathertheprojectspaceis “dehydrated” sothatitonlycontains
residual work product such as program code. Such derivative files often need to be referenced for years after
theterminationofallDataUseAgreements.)

IRB Amendment Approval
To: Kali Thomas, Box G-S121-6
From: Human Research Protection Program
Date: October 06, 2021
Protocol: Home-delivered meals for persons with dementia: Which model del ays
nursing home placement?
Protocol #: 2008002788
Amendment #: 5
Approval Date: October 06, 2021
This amendment was approved by expedited procedures in accordan ce with 45 CFR 46.111.
Approval of this amendment (memo dated:10/01/2021) includes:
1. modify the language in the protocol to reflect that particip ants are receiving meals delivered
 multiple times a week by the MOW program, rather than daily-de livered meals. 
2. Revise one error in the protocol, where it should read biwee kly frozen meal delivery rather than
 weekly frozen meal delivery. Participants are still receiving the same amount of meals in both
 arms. 
3. Modify the recruitment targets for two sites - Neighborly an d MOW-San Antonio. We would like
 to modify the target goals from 60 to Neighborly to 45-60, and  MOW-SA from 100 to 100-115.
Any changes to this research protocol must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval
prior to implementation. While this study is active, compliance  with any post-approval monitoring
activities and all Brown University HRPP policies and procedure s, including the Reportable Events
Policy,  are required.
All study staff must successfully complete CITI training  in human subjects research prior to
beginning work on this project.

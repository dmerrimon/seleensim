Lip Rejuvenation  with Restylane® Silk on Projected  First 
Impressions and Mood  Perceptions  
Indication  Subjects  with mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to severe 
perioral  lines who request  lip rejuvenation  with Restylane® Silk 
 
Sample Size   
20 
 
Number  of Centers   
One center in the United States  
 
Study Objectives  The primary  objective  of this study is to determine  if subjects  
who receive  lip rejuvenation  treatment  with Restylane® Silk 
project  a more positive  first impression  and report  an 
improvement  in mood perception.  
 
Subject Selection  A total of 20 subjects  who wish to receive  lip rejuvenation  
treatment with  Restylane® Silk and meet the specified  criteria  will 
be enrolled.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Design  20 subjects  with mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to severe 
perioral  lines will be enrolled  and injected  with Restylane® Silk. 
Photographs  will be taken  prior to and 14 days after Optimal 
Cosmetic  Results  has been achieved,  as judged  by the investigator.  
 
Changes  in the projected  first impression  will be assessed  by a total 
of 200 blinded  evaluators  rating  the photographs  of subjects  from the 
baseline and from 14 days post achieving the Optimal Cosmetic 
Results.  Changes  in subjects’  mood  will be self-assessed  through 
Subjective  Happiness  Scale and Happiness  Measures  questionnaires. 
Aesthetic alterations will be assessed by the investigator via the 
Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, Oral Commissure Severity 
Scale,  and the Perioral  Lines Severity  Scale as well as by the self- 
assessment of subjects using the Global Aesthetic Improvement 
Scale.  
 
A schematic of the study design is presented in Appendix A .

Study Duration   
Subjects  will be followed  for 14 days after a treatment  that 
has produced  Optimal  Cosmetic  Results.  
 
 
Clinical Hypothesis  Subjects  who are treated  with Restylane® Silk for lip rejuvenation 
project  a more positive  first impression  as compared  to their pre- 
treatment baseline. Those who are treated with Restylane® Silk will 
also report  a more positive  mood perception  after treatment  as 
compared to  pre-treatment.

4 BACKGROUND  
A first impression  can be defined  as the initial judgment  made  of a person  without  a prior 
familiarity.  It has been well recognized  that these zero-acquaintance  impressions,  which  are 
formed  within  seconds  of seeing  a person,  are greatly  influenced  by physical  appearances1-3. The 
perceived  impression  forms  an image  of personality,  known  as the physical  personality , that 
induces  a set of expectations  and behaviors  in others,  which,  in turn, impact  the manner  by 
which an individual  is judged  and treated  in the society.  
 
It has been suggested  that ‘attractive ’ individuals  receive  better  judgments  and treatments4 
whereas  those  deemed  ‘unattractive ’ generally  seem  to elicit  negative  responses5. Various clinical 
studies have also linked aesthetic enhancements, through surgical or non -surgical 
procedures,  with improved  projected  first impressions6-8. Remarkably,  the self-perception  of 
physical  appearances  also seems  to affect the development  of inherent  personality.  It has been 
elucidated that self -dissatisfaction due to craniofacial abnormalities can elicit low self -esteem5 
while non-surgical  aesthetic  enhancements  may improve  self-esteem  and lead to a better  quality 
of life9. Thus, improvements  of physical  appearances  can create  a better  projected  first 
impression  as well as a better  self-satisfaction.  
 
In the past decade,  dermal  fillers have become  one of the most popular  minimally  invasive 
treatments for rejuvenation and body sculpturing. According to the American Society of Plastic 
Surgeons,  over 1.6 million  hyaluronic  acid filler procedures  were performed  in 201310. 
Restylane® Silk (Galderma Laboratories, L.P.) is a hyaluronic acid injectable filler, which is 
approved by the FDA for submucosal implantation for lip augmentation and dermal implantation 
for correction  of perioral  rhytids.  The goal of this study  is to determine  if lip rejuvenation  of 
patients  with mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to severe  perioral  lines using Restylane® 
Silk would  lead to an improved  projected  first impression  and self-perception  of mood.  
 
5 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The primary  objective  of this study  is to determine  if lip rejuvenation  with Restylane® Silk 
results  in an improved  projected  first impression  as well as an improved  self-perception  of 
mood.  
 
The secondary objective is to evaluate aesthetic improvements after lip rejuvenation treatment  
with Restylane® Silk and assess  relations  to any alternations  in the projected  first impression

 6 STUDY  DESIGN  
This is an open -label, post -market study to assess the impact of lip rejuvenation with 
Restylane® Silk on the projected first impression and the self -perception of mood.  
 
20 subjects,  at least 21 years of age, who display  mild to severe  oral commissures  or none to 
severe  perioral  lines, as judged  by the Principal  Investigator  (PI) utilizing  the Oral 
Commissure Severity  Scale (OCSS,  Appendix  G) or the Perioral  Lines Severity  Scale 
(POLSS,  Appendix  H), will be  enrolled.  
 
The study is composed  of up to 4 patient  visits and a post-visit  evaluation  of patients’ 
photographs  by blinded  evaluators.  A schematic  of the study design  is presented  in Appendix  A. 
 
All subjects  who meet the specified  criteria,  listed in Section  7, will complete  the Subjective 
Happiness  Scale11,12 (SHS,  Appendix  B) and the Happiness  Measures  questionnaire13 (HM, 
Appendix  C) prior to receiving  any treatments.  The PI also records  the severity  of subjects’  oral 
commissures  and/or  the perioral  lines using the OCSS  and/or  the POLSS  respectively.  
Furthermore, all subjects undergo photo - and videography, as described in Appendix I, prior to 
treatment.  
 
Subjects  will then be injected  with Restylane® Silk with a volume  sufficient  to achieve  Optimal 
Cosmetic  Results  (OCR),  per treating  investigator’s  discretion  but not to exceed  a total  of 4 ml (4 syringes).  
Subjects  will be assessed  14 ± 3 days after injection  for achieving  the OCR. If OCR has  not 
been reached,  as judged  by the PI, a second,  ‘touch-up,’ injection  of Restylane® Silk will be 
performed.  
 
The final evaluation  of subjects  will take place 14 ± 3 days after achieving  OCR. Hence,  this 
would  be 14 ± 3 days after the first injection  for those who achieved  OCR with one treatment  
but 28  ± 3 days after the first injection  for those who required  a ‘touch-up’ injection . Subjects  will 
complete  the SHS and HM questionnaires  as well as self-report  any aesthetic  alterations 
experienced  using the Global  Aesthetic  Improvement  Scale (GAIS,  Appendix  D). They will 
also undergo  photo - and videography,  as described  in Appendix  I. Furthermore,  the PI will 
rate the subjects  on the GAIS (Appendix  E) as well as on the OCSS  and the POLSS.  
 
Photographs  taken at pre-treatment  and 14-Day Post-OCR will be randomly  divided  into 4 
binders,  for a total of 10 photographs  per binder.  Each binder  will be evaluated  at least by 
50 blinded  evaluators  using the First Impressions  Questionnaire  (FIQ, Appendix  F) to rate 
each photograph.  
 
7 SUBJECT  SELECTION  
A total of 20 subjects  who meet all of following  inclusion  criteria  and none of the

8 TREATMENT  AND STUDY  SUPPLIES  
 
8.1 Description  of Study  Supplies  and Handling  
Restylane® Silk (Galderma  Laboratories,  L.P.) is a gel of hyaluronic  acid produced  by the 
Streptococcus  species  of gram-positive  bacteria  that is chemically  crosslinked  with butanediol 
diglycidyl  ether (BDDE)  and suspended  in phosphate  buffered  saline  (pH 7) at a concentration  
of 20 mg/ml  with 0.3% lidocaine.  Restylane® Silk supplies  are stored  in a secure  cabinet  at 
room temperature  at the investigation  site. 
Silk-FI-01 
Version  2, 11 June 
2015 DeNova Research 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 13 of 32  
 8.2 Packaging and  Labeling  
Restylane® Silk is supplied  in disposable  glass syringes  with a Luer-Lok® fitting  and is co- 
packed  with a sterilized  30 G x ½ needle.  Each syringe  contains  1 ml of the injectable  gel (20 
mg/ml  of hyaluronic  acid) with 0.3% lidocaine.  Each package  is for single  patient  use. A 
patient record  label,  which  is included  in the syringe  label,  will be attached  to each  patient’s  records  for product  
traceability.  
 
8.3 Method of  Application  
8.3.1 Pre-treatment  Guidelines  
Prior to treatment,  the patient  is advised  to avoid taking  aspirin,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory 
medications,  St. John’s  Wort,  and high doses  of vitamin  E supplements  14 days prior to the day of 
treatment,  as these agents  may increase  bruising  and bleeding  at the injection  site. 
8.3.2 Treatment  Procedure  
   The patient’s  face is washed  with  soap  and water  and dried  with  a clean  towel.  The treatment  
area is cleansed  with alcohol  or Benzalkonium  Chloride.  
   Topical anesthetic (30% lodocaine) is applied to the injection area. Alternatively, at 
patient’s  request,  an infraorbital/mental  nerve  block  with  3% mepivacaine  is used  to anesthetize 
the treatment  area. 
   Restylane® Silk is administered  using a thin gauge  needle  (30 G x ½) or a 22 gauge 
cannula.  The needle  is inserted  at an approximate  angle of 30° parallel  to the length  of 
the wrinkle,  fold, or lip. For rhytids,  Restylane® Silk is injected  into the mid-to-deep 
dermis.  
   A maximum  dose of 4.0 ml is used per treatment.  
8.3.3 Injection  Technique  
Restylane® Silk may be injected  by a number  of different  techniques  depending  on the treating 
physician’s  experience  and preference  as well as the specific  characteristics  and needs  of each patient 
(Restylane® Silk Package Insert14). The appropriate injection method will be employed per 
treating investigator’s  discretion.  
 
9 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
 
9.1 Visit 1: Screening  Assessments  
The PI and/or  designee  is responsible  for keeping  a record  of all subjects  screened for entry 
into the  study as well those who did not meet the criteria,  as described  in Section  7, and hence  
were excluded.  
 
The following procedures will be performed:  
 
1. The PI or designee  evaluates  and confirms  that the subject  fulfills  all 
the inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  as described  in Section  7. 

Silk-FI-01 
Version  2, 11 June

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 14 of 32  
 2. A written  informed  consent,  signed  by the subject  as well as by the investigator  
or designee, is  obtained.  
3. Demographic  information  and medical  history  are obtained.  
4. List of concomitant  medications  is collected.  
5. Vital signs (blood  pressure  and pulse rate) are measured.  
6. If the subject  is a female  of child bearing  potential,  a urine collection  for in-
clinic pregnancy  test will be conducted.  
7. Subject completes the SHS  questionnaire  
8. Subject completes the HM  questionnaire.  
9. Subject  undergoes  standardized  digital  photography  and video of full face in accordance 
with  the site’s  SOP (described  in Appendix  I). 
 
9.2 Visit 2:  Treatment  
Visit 2 will take place no later than 14 days after the screening  assessments.  If the period 
between  the screening  assessments  and the treatment  is greater  than 14 days, the in-clinic urine 
pregnancy test will be repeated for females of childbearing potential. The following  procedures 
will be  performed:  
 
1. Subject ’s medical  history  and concomitant  medica tions are reviewed  for changes  since Visit 
1, Screening  Assessments.  
2. PI rates the subject  on the OCSS  and POLSS  at rest. 
3. The injection  area is wiped  with a Benzalkonium  Chloride  towelette.  
4. A topical  anesthetic  containing  30% lidocaine  is applied  to the injection  areas. 
Alternatively, subject may choose to receive a nerve block, infraorbital/mental with

10 RESPONSE  CRITERIA  
 
10.1  Primary Variable  Assessments  
The primary  assessment  of this study is to determine  if subjects  who receive  lip rejuvenation 
treatment  with Restylane® Silk would  project  a more positive  first impression  as well as 
experience  a more positive  mood perception  as compared  to their baseline.  The primary  efficacy 
will be established  by comparing  the projected  first impression  of subjects  at 14-Day Post-OCR 
with that of the baseline.  The change  is mood perception  will be determined  by comparing  the 
SHS and HM results  from 14-Day Post-OCR with those from the baseline.  
10.1.1  Assessment of First  Impressions  
Upon completion  of the study,  a minimum  of 200 blinded  evaluators  will assess  one of four 
binders,  for a minimum  of 50 blinded  evaluators  per binder,  each comprised  of 10 
photographs selected  randomly  from Visit 1 (baseline)  or Visit 4 (14-Day Post-OCR) for 
each subject.  The

11 DATA  MANAGEMENTS  
 
11.1  Case Report  Forms  
For each subject  enrolled  who has given informed  consent,  completed  the screening  process,  and 
began  the study  process,  a Case Report  From (CRF)  will be created  and signed  by the PI or 
designee  to certify  completeness  and correctness.  
 
If a subject  is withdrawn  from the study due to a treatment -related  AE, due diligence  must 
be used  to document  the outcome.  Source  documentation  verification  will be performed  by 
the study monitors.  All CRFs will remain  at the study  site. 
 
11.2  Data Handling  
Data management  based  on GCP refers  to the activities  defined  to achieve  safe routines  for 
efficiently  entering  clinical  data information  into a database  while avoiding  errors.  The data 
management  routines  include  procedures  for handling  CRFs, database  set-up and management, 
data entry and verification,  data validation,  and documentation  of the performed  activities 
including  information  of discrepancies  in the process.  
 
The database,  the data entry screens,  and program  will be designed  in accordance  with the study 
protocol  and the CRF. Single  data entry and proofreading  will be used for data entry and 
verification.  Data validation  will be performed  after data entry and verification  by manual  review. 
When the clinical  study coordinator  has made all efforts  to ensure  that the data recorded  in the 
CRFs and entered  in the database  is as correct  and complete  as possible,  "clean  file" is declared,  and 
the database is closed. The clinical study coordinator should document the database closure in a 
signed written document. Final statistic al analysis should be generated using data from the closed 
database.  Any additional  subsequent  changes  or corrections  to the closed  database  should  be 
documented  in an audit trail. 
 
11.3  Publication  
Following  completion  of the study,  the data may be considered  for reporting  at a scientific 
meeting  or for publication  in a scientific  or medical  journal.

13 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
13.1  Definition  
An adverse  event (AE) is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a subject  or clinical 
investigation  subject  administered  a pharmaceutical  or medical  device  product  that does not 
necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with this treatment.  Adverse  events  include  the following: 
all suspected  adverse  device  or procedure  reactions,  occurrence  of apparently  unrelated  illnesses  
Silk-FI-01 
Version  2, 11 June 
2015 DeNova Research 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 19 of 32  
 (i.e., symptoms  or diseases  that were not present  at study entry),  worsening  of a pre-existing 
illness (i.e., concurrent symptoms or diseases), injuries or accidents, and abnormalities in 
physiological  or laboratory  testing  or physical  examination  findings  that require  clinical 
intervention  or further  investigation  (beyond  ordering  a repeat confirmatory  test). Throughout  the 
study,  subjects  will be monitored  for signs and symptoms  of adverse  events.  
 
All adverse  events  reported  during  the study  period  will be recorded  in detail  in the subject’s medical file and  
CRF. 
 
13.2  Recording of Adverse  Events  
Subjects  will be instructed  by the PI to immediately  report  the occurrence  of any adverse  
event. Each subject  should  be questioned  at all visits whether  any side effects  or adverse  
events  have occurred. All spontaneously volunteered, inquired, and observed adverse 
experiences will be recorded in  detail.  
 
13.3  Serious  Adverse  Events  and Unanticipated  Adverse  Device  Effects  
13.3.1  Definition  
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  are defined  as undesirable  events  experienced  by a subject  
that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution, whether or 
not considered  to be device -related  by the Investigator.  An AE is defined  as being serious  
if: 
 
1. It is fatal or life threatening  (life threatening  means  that in the opinion  of the 
Investigator, the subject  was at immediate  risk of death  from the adverse  
reaction)  
2. It is permanently  or temporarily  disabling  
3. It requires  inpatient  or prolonged  hospitalization  
4. Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
 
An unanticipated  adverse  device  effect is defined  as any serious  adverse  effect on health  or 
safety, any life threatening problem, or death that was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in t he investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary  plan or application),  or any other unanticipated  serious  problem  associated  with a 
device  that relate  to the rights,  safety,  or welfare  of subjects.  
13.3.2  Serious  Adverse  Events  Recording  and Reporting  
Any serious  and/or  unexpected  adverse  event that occurred  while on study or one month  after 
completion  of study must be reported  to DeNova  Research  via telephone.  The Serious  Adverse 
Event Report  Form must be completed  and faxed to DeNova  Research  and IRB within  24 
hours of notification.  
 
In addition,  the local IRB or EC must be notified  of all adverse  events  that are serious  
and/or unexpected.  
Silk-FI-01 
Version  2, 11 June 
2015 DeNova Research 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 20 of 32  
 All adverse events, including serious and unexpected events, must be recorded by th e 
Investigator  on the standard  Adverse  Event Report  form. This form will be included  in the 
CRF. All Adverse Event Reports describing adverse events other than serious or unexpected 
adverse events  will be inserted  into the CRF. In addition,  any serious  and treatment -related  
unexpected adverse  events  must be reported  to the local IRB within  5 business  days of the 
event.  
 
Subjects  who have had a serious  adverse  event must be followed  clinically  until all parameters, 
including  laboratory  values,  have either  returned  to normal  or are otherwise  explained.  If death 
was the outcome  of the event on the initial Adverse  Event Report,  a Follow -up/Final  Report, 
including  an autopsy  report,  when performed,  must be completed.  
 
14 QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
 
14.1  Institutional  Review  Board  Approval  
An IRB shall review  and have authority  to approve,  require  modifications,  or disapprove  the 
investigation.  Accordingly,  this protocol,  the informed  consent  document,  and any relevant 
supporting  information  must be submitted  to the IRB for review  and receive  approval  prior 
to study initiation.  Except  in an emergency,  any amendments  to the protocol  require  approval  
by both Sponsor  and the IRB prior to their implementation.  
 
Additionally,  the PI is responsible  for providing  the IRB with progress  reports  of the 
investigation  at regular  intervals  (at least once per year) as well as with any other 
accurate, complete,  and current  information  that the IRB may request  concerning  the 
investigation.  
 
14.2  Informed  Consent  
Informed  consent  shall be documented  by the use of a written  consent  form approved  by the 
IRB an d signed  by the subject  or the subject’s  legally  authorized  representative.  A copy  of the final, IRB-
approved  document  must be provided  for record -keeping  purposes.  Originals  of the IRB- 
approved  consent  form and sign individual  consent  documents  must be retained  in the site’s 
study files. Each subject  must be provided  with a copy of his/her  signed  consent  form. 
 
14.3  Study  Monitoring  
The PI will allow designees from the study sponsor to periodically audit all CRFs and 
corresponding  source  documents  for each subjects,  as well as, any data related  to the study file. 
The monitoring  visits provide  for an opportunity  to evaluate  the progress  of the study,  to verify 
the accuracy  and completeness  of CRFs, to resolve  any inconsistencies  in the study records,  and 
to assure  that all protocol  requirements,  applicable  regulations,  and Investigator’s  obligations  are being met. 
The PI must maintain  source  documents  such as lab reports,  photographs,  history,  and physical  
examination  reports,  etc., for possible  review.

Page 21 of 32  
 14.4  Modification of  Protocol  
If modification  of the protocol  is necessary,  the modification  must be confirmed  with the 
IRB. No  changes  to the protocol  that would  significantly  affect the safety,  scope,  or quality  of 
the study may be implemented prior to written approval of the IRB. Changes to the 
protocol, however,  may be made when necessary  for the health  of the subject.  All 
modifications  must be documented  at the site. Moreover,  if the study protocol  is revised  at 
any point during  the study, IRB will be notified  according  to CRF 21 Part 812. 
 
14.5  Departure from the  Protocol  
Minor  deviations  to the study  protocol  may be permitted  if they  will not increase  the subject’s risk or affect 
the validity  of the study.  All deviations  must be documented  at the study site. 
 
When an emergency  occurs  that requires  a departure  from the protocol  for an individual,  a 
departure  will be only for that subject.  The PI in such an emergency  will, if circumstances  and 
time permit,  contact  the IRB prior to departing  from the protocol.  If this is not possible,  such 
contact  must be made as soon as possible  in order to allow for an evaluation  of the significance 
of such departure  to the affected  subject  and to other subjects  and to permit  a decision  as to 
whether  or not the subject,  for whom  the departure  from the protocol  was affected,  is to 
continue in the study.  The CRFs will completely  describe  the departure  from the protocol  and 
state the reasons  for such departure.  In addition,  IRB will be notified  in writing  of such 
departure  from protocol.  
 
14.6  Confidentiality of Subject  Records  
The information  obtained  during  the conduct  of this study is confidential,  and will be disclosed 
only to the Investigator  and regulatory  authorities  as deemed  necessary  and/or  as required  by 
law. The PI must provide  full disclosure  of all study data and make  study  files available  for 
inspection  upon request  by the IRB and/or  relevant  authorities  including  the study sponsor.  
Upon notice, the local authorities may inspect and copy records that identify subjects through 
number and initial combinations. However, such copies have to be blinded (i.e., all 
personally identifiable  data have to be blacked  out) in order to prevent  identification.  The 
sponsor  will be notified  of any impending  inspections  relating  to the study.  
 
14.7  Record  Retention  
The PI shall maintain  accurate,  complete,  and current  records  relating  to the participation  in 
this study, including the  following:

Appendix I Standard Operating Protocol for Photo - and Videography  
 
Photography and Poses 
 
   Use the grid feature  on any of these viewers  to ensure  the Frankfort  Plane (imaginary  line 
from tragus  to infraorbital  rim) is parallel  to the floor. 
Stand approximately 1.5 m from patient with the camera in a portrait position.  
Ensure  the patient  has a relaxed  expression  and that lips are closed  and eyes are open for 
each photo.  
   Give instructions  like,  “Slowly  move  your  chin  down”  or “Slowly  turn  your  nose  to the left”  to achieve  
the desired  poses  listed  below

 Standard Poses (all at 1.5 m)  
 
1. Frontal  
Make  sure  the patient  doesn’t  have  their  chin  high  or low by checking  the Frankfort  
Plane.  For this view, the line on the viewfinder  should  extend from  the 
right tragus,  across  both infraorbital  rims and across  the left tragus.  
This should  be parallel  to the floor. 
 
2. 45° Left 
For this view, the tip of the nose should  line up with the edge of the cheek.  
 
3. Left Profile  
For this view, ensure  the patient  is not rotated  to the left or right 
(hint: look at the eyebrows  to see how much  of the glabella  you 
see). 
 
4. 45° Right 
For this view, the tip of the nose should  line up with the edge of the cheek.  
 
5. Right Profile  
For this view, ensure  the patient  is not rotated  to the left or right 
(hint: look at the eyebrows  to see how much  of the glabella  you 
see). 
 
 
Stand  approximately  1.75 m from the patient  with the camera  in a landscape  
position. Standard  facial expressions  (holding  each expression  for 2-3 
seconds):

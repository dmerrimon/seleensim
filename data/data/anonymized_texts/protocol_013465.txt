1.0 BACKGROU ND & ST UDY RAT IONALE 
 
Extensive mitral annular calcification (MAC) pos es a significant risk in elder ly subjects u ndergoing mitral 
valve surg ery. M AC has been associated with high er risk of c ardiova scular dis ease, card iovascular d eath, 
and all-cause death.1 Surgic al replacement o f such v alves presents a tec hnically challenging p rocedure  
with the potential f or rupture at the atrial ve ntricular j unction and of the left vent ricular wall.2 Thus,  
new surgic al and minimally invasive tec hniques for mitral replac ement c ould imp rove treatment of high- 
risk subjects with MAC. 
 
Rece ntly, is olated reports of deploy ment of the Edw ards SAPIEN™ XT (Edw ards Life sciences, Irvin e, CA, 
USA) valve in native mitr al valves with extensive M AC have shown early anecdot al feasibility in a li mited 
number of cases. There a re several reports using t ransapical, transeptal, or transatrial approach es with 
varying degr ees of su ccess.3,4,5,6 The multi-cent er IDE Mit ral Implantati on of TRAn scatheter vaLv es in 
native mitral stenosis (MITRAL) S tudy initiated by N orthsho re Univ ersity Health S ystem is currently 
studying this techniqu e, primarily focusing on the tran scatheter, tran sseptal approach. Early exp erience  
with this p rocedu re demonstrat es limited success with t reatment of subjects with mitral stenosis an d 
regurgitation a ssociat ed with extensive MAC. H owever, technic al challenges with this approach have  
included lef t vent ricular outflow t ract (LVOT) obstruction (1 1% of subjects), v alve embolization (7%), an d 
a 30-day mortality (34%) in the limited data available.7 In order to po ssibly mitigate some of the 
challeng es with this appr oach, we p ropose to study a limited a ccess surgic al approach with the Edw ards 
SAPIEN 3 valve plac ed in the mitral v alve position under direct vision to optimize procedu ral safety a nd 
success. From our own li mited experience with the su ccessful treatment of 3 s ubjects with this 
approach, we f eel that an expa nded study in a larg er number o f subjects incl uding o ther investigators is 
warranted. 
 
 
2.0 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURE  
 
Surgical access is allowed via any accepted heart team approach.  Any commercially approved  delivery 
system for the SAPIEN 3 valve may be used. 
 
Surgic al access is via a mini-anterolate ral thoracotomy with the patient under general anesthesia and on

 cardiopulmonary bypass s upport. Cannu lation for c ardiopulmon ary bypass is typically achieve d through 
the common femoral arterial and venous circulation, though axillary arteri al cannulation is a suitable 
substitute for subjects in which there is concern for arterial occlu sive disease. There are several  
methods to prepare for cardiac entry. These include a cardioplegic or cold, fi brillatory arrest, depending 
on the individual patient circumstances. A left atriotomy is performed t o access the mitral valve. The 
mitral valve is then evaluated to determine whether conventional replacement is a reasonable 
depending upon the severity of MAC. If not, the anterior leaflet is  then resected, leaving approximately 
0.5cm to 1cm of residual leaflet tissue adjacent to the annulus. Pledgette d mattress sutures are placed  
in both of the fibrous trigones and the mid-portion of the post erior leaflet. The valve is then sized with a 
25ml valvuloplasty balloon. If there is a reasonable fit with no gap betwee n the inflated balloon and the 
annulus, then a 26mm Edwards SAPIEN 3 is selected. If there is a gap, then a 29 mm Edwards SAPIEN 3 is 
selected. If there are concerns about the native annulus being too large, a c uff of felt material can be 
placed to minimize paravalvular leak. 
 
The v alve implant is performed with thoraco scopic guidance ( 30 degree, 5 mm-10mm endo scope). The 
 
commisures of the p rosthetic v alve are aligned with the fibrous t rigones. To control the deliv ery, two 
separate op erators a re required. One slowly d elivers the v alve correcting f or depth and orientatio n 
while the oth er inflates the balloo n slowly within the native v alve to maximal dilation f or at least 10  
seco nds, and thoraco scopic confirmati on of a fully deployed v alve is o btained. The fibrous t rigone  
sutures are th en placed th rough the skirt on the prosthetic v alve an d tied. The v alve is teste d with cold 
saline to ensure a ppropriate l eaflet mobility an d assess f or paravalvular leak .  Following co nfirmation, a 
vent may  be placed across the valve for de-airing, and the atrium is closed. 
 
 
3.0 PURPO SE 
 
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and f easibility of the Edw ards SAPIEN 3 valve in 
subjects with mitral annular c alcification (MAC) a ssociated wit h mitral stenosis (M S) and/or mitral 
regurgitation who are at high- risk for mitral valve surgery or deemed inoperable due to the extent of 
calcification.

Written IRB app roval of the p rotocol and ICF must be p rovided to the Sp onsor prior to the enrollment of 
any sub ject in the clinic al study at each investigation al site. The Investigator is responsible f or ensuring 
that inf ormed consent is o btaine d from all sub jects prior to any diagnostic tests or treatments that are  
outside the sta ndard c ourse of treatment tha t would be f ollowed if this sub ject was not being consid ered 
for enrollmen t in this clinic al study. Subjects must be i nformed th at their medical records will be sub ject 
to review by the Sponso r, its authori zed design ee or representativ es of FD A. Sub jects will be informed 
that they are fr ee to re fuse participation in this clinic al study without loss of benefits to whic h they are 
otherwise e ntitled, a nd, that if they choose to participat e, they may withdraw at any time  without 
prejudice to f uture care. The inf ormed consent p rovided by each investigation al site’s IRB must  be sign ed 
prior to st udy participation. The original sign ed informed consent f or each subject must be  retained by 
the Investigat or and is sub ject to review by the Spons or and the FD A. A copy of the informed consent will 
be p rovided to the sub ject. 
 
21.0  WITHDRAW AL 
 
 
Subjects may  voluntarily wi thdraw from the st udy at any time. If such withd rawal occurs, or if the 
subject fails to re turn for visits, the site investigat or must determine the primary reason f or a subject ’s

For sub jects who are lost to f ollow- up, the site investigator shoul d show "due diligence" by docume nting 
in the s ubject record steps ta ken to co ntact the s ubject, e.g., dat es of tele phone calls, registered le tters, 
etc. 
 
Subjects who a re prematurely wit hdrawn from st udy treatment or from the st udy will not be replaced. 
 
 
22.1 POTENTI AL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
 
The risks a ssociat ed with the use of the syst em are similar to those encou ntered wit h standard cardiac 
catheterization, use of anesthesia, mit ral valve replacement (MVR) and the use of biop rosthetic he art 
valves, in a ddition to risks a ssociat ed with st udy-related p rocedures (e .g. Transesophageal 
echoc ardiogra phy, MSCT scan, etc.). A list of anticipated or pote ntial adverse events is p rovided below. 
 
 
22.2 Adverse E vents 
 
 
An adverse event is any undesirable clinic al occurrence in a st udy sub ject, wheth er or not it is 
related to the study interve ntion. Any condition that w as recorded as pre-existing is not an AE 
unless there is a change in the nature, sev erity or degree of the co ndition. Furthermor e, for a pre- 
existing co ndition th at is not protoc ol defin ed to be rep orted as an adverse event, a change in 
severity must m eet the c riteria f or being serious (see definition below). 
 
22.3 Serious Ad verse Eve nt 
 
 
Serious adv erse eve nts are defin ed by FDA regulation as any experience that results in a fat ality or 
is life threatening; results in significan t or persistent disability; requires or prolongs a 
hospitalization; results in a congenit al anomaly/birth defect; or represents o ther significant  
hazards or pote ntially serious h arm to research s ubjects or others, in the opini on of the 
investigat ors. Imp ortant medical events that may  not result in d eath, be life-th reatening, or  
require hospitalization m ay be considered a s erious adv erse event when, bas ed upon app ropriate 
medical judgme nt, they may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the o utcom es listed in this definitio n.

22.4 Unanticipated Serious Ad verse E vent 
 
 
An unanticipate d (unexpected) serious adv erse event is any serious adverse event that is not  
protocol-defined. Expedit ed reporting is required f or serious adv erse ev ents th at are unexpecte d. 
 
 
22.5 Event Recording 
 
 
The following adverse eve nts will be captured throughout the period of study participation: 
 
A. Protocol-defin ed (as desc ribed below) 
 
B. Serious unanticipated eve nts (serious “Other ” adverse events) 
 
 
22.6 Causality 
 
 
The investigat or will a ssess the relationsh ip of an adverse even t to the surgic al intervention. I f 
possible, the investigat or shou ld distinguish the relationship betw een the event and ( a) the 
surgic al procedu re and (b) the investigation al intervention (implant of Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve). 
Causality will be defin ed as follows: 
A. Probable  
 
Adverse events that, after c areful medic al evaluat ion, are consider ed with a high degree  
of cert ainty to be related to the surgic al intervention 
The following ch aracteristics will apply: 
 
1. A reasonable t emporal relationship exists between the event and t he 
surgic al intervention, and 
2. The event is a known reaction to the surgic al interve ntion and cann ot 
be explained by an alternative etiology commonly o ccurring in the 
population/i ndividual. 
B. Possible  
 
Adverse events that, after c areful medic al evaluat ion, do not me et the c riteria f or a 
probable relationsh ip to the surgic al intervention, but f or which a connection canno t be 
ruled ou t with certainty. 
The following ch aracteristics will apply: 
Page 24 of 57 
 February 26, 2016 
Protoco l Version 1.1 
 SITRAL Confidential 
Baylor Sco tt & Whi te Resear ch Institute  
  
1. The event o ccurs after surgic al intervention, and 
 
2. The event is not a known reaction to surgic al interve ntion, but  
cannot be explained by a commonly o ccurring alternative etiolo gy. 
 
 
C. Unlikely  
 
Adverse events that, after c areful medic al evaluat ion, do not me et the c riteria f or a 
possible or probable relationship to surgical interve ntion and f or which a co nnection is 
unlikely. 
The following ch aracteristics will apply: 
 
3. The event does n ot follow a reasonable temp oral sequence from  
administration of the surgic al intervention, or 
4. May have be en produced by environme ntal factors, and there is no 
apparent pattern of response to the surgic al interve ntion. 
 
 
22.7 Reporting of Serious Adverse E vents 
 
 
All investigato rs must report both expect ed (protocol-defined) and unexpect ed serious adverse  
events. All serious protoc ol defined adv erse events must be reported directly to the clinical 
center’s IRB and the s ponsor within 10 working days of knowledge of the eve nt, or as dictated by 
the specific IRB poli cy, whichev er is sooner. All unexpected serious adv erse events must be 
report ed to the spons or within 24 hou rs of knowledge of the event and the clinic al center’s IRB as 
dictat ed by the specific IRB poli cy. 
 
 
22.8 Eliciti ng adverse e ffect information 
 
Investiga tors are responsible for p reparing and s ubmitting all reports as sum marized on Table 1.0. 
 
 
 
Case Report Fo rms should be e ntered wi thin 10 d ays after the correspo nding visit. Inv estigators are  
responsible for notifying the Sponsor of any changes to prev iously reported d ata. Upon request of the  
reviewing IRB, FDA, the Inv estigator must provide a ccurate, complete, and cu rrent information about  
any aspect of the study .

22.11  Potential Benefits 
 
 
The clinic al benefits of using the SAPI EN 3 valve in subjects with mit ral annular calcification (MAC ) 
associat ed with mitral stenosis and/or regurgitati on are n ot known at the present time. There are  
no gu aranteed benefits from participatio n in this clinic al study and being treate d with the study 
devic e. 
 
 
Mitral valve replac ement with the SAPIEN 3 v alve may  result in one or more of the following  
benefits for sub jects typically consid ered high risk or inoperable f or surgical MVR: decrease in 
mitral stenosis, decrease in mitral regurgitation, ac ute alleviati on of symptoms relat ed to mitral 
insufficiency and/or stenosis, and/or improv ed morbidity and mortality. Information g ained from  
the conduct of this st udy may  be of benef it to oth er people with the same medical condition in 
the future as the i ndication for the syst em is expa nded.

Introduction: 
 
 
 
 
Before you say that you wil l be in t his clinical t rial (a kind o f rese arch study) you n eed to read t his form. It is 
import ant for you to under stand all the information in t his form. T his form w ill tell you w hat the clinical trial is 
about and how it w ill be don e. It w ill tell you about some pro blems t hat might ha ppen during the c linical t rial.  It 
will also tell you about the g ood things t hat might happen for you during the c linical trial. Wh en you read a paper 
like this to learn about a cli nical tria l it is c alled “inform ed consent. ” The people who are do ing this clinical trial 
are giving you very important information about the clinical trial. Wh en you give your consent fo r som ething, it is 
the same a s giving your permi ssion. T his consent form may cont ain wo rds that you do not under stand. Pleas e 
talk with one of the doctor s or thei r staff if you have question s. Do not s ign this consent form unless all you r 
question s have b een answer ed and you feel comforta ble with the information you have re ad. You w ill be giv en a 
copy of the form to keep. 
 
 
You are be ing asked to take part in t his study because you have been diagnosed a s having mit ral stenosis and 
mitral annular c alcification (MAC) and are high- risk or inoperable for mit ral valve surgery.

The purpose of t his study is to establi sh the safety and feasibili ty of the Edw ards SAPI EN 3 valve in subj ects with 
mitral stenosi s and mit ral annular c alcification (M AC) who are high- risk or inoperable for mit ral valve surger y. 
 
 
Wha t is the Status of the Drugs (Devices or Procedure s) involved in this study? 
 
 
The Edwards SAPEIN 3 valve is c urrently approv ed by the U S Food and Drug Administration for the treatment o f 
aortic stenos is. 
 
 
 
 
How Man y People Will T ake Pa rt In The St udy? 
 
 
About 30 peo ple will take part in t his study at six sites worldwid e. About 5 of the se peo ple will take part at this 
location. 
 
 
Wha t Is Inv olved In The St udy? 
 
 
The fo llowing information w ill be co llected fo r all study s ubjects prio r to pro cedure. Baseline ass essmen ts must 
be com pleted within 30 da ys of subject enrollment unless otherwi se specified. 
 
• Medical History and Ph ysical Exam including Cardiac Medications 
• Blood tests (about 2-3 teaspoons) 
• Society of Tho racic Surgeons (STS) Risk Score Assessment 
• Heart cath eterization wi th an x- ray dye (contrast media ) to evalua te you r heart. T his test w ill take about 2 
hours. 
• Com puted tomography (CT) scan of chest, he art and abdomen with assessment o f degree and pattern o f 
MAC wi th an x-ray dye (cont rast media ). This test w ill take about 1-2 ho urs. 
• Tran sthoraci c echocardiogram ( TTE: a probe is placed on your chest and im ages of your he art are 
recorded). The TTE does not require anesth esia and takes about 45 minutes. 
• 12 Lead Electrocardio gram (ECG) (a test w hich measures the ele ctrical a ctivity of your he art) 
• Chest X-Ray w hich will take about 15 minut es 
• Pulmonary Fun ction Test (PF T) 
• 6 minu te walk test (measures how far you can w alk in si x minutes) 
• New York He art Association classification (this is a score based on seve rity of you r heart failure symp toms) 
• Quali ty of Life questionnaire w hich will take about 10 minu tes 
• 5 meter w alk test (this meas ure how fast you w alk) 
 
 
Wha t Happens during the procedure?  
The  study  docto r  will  perform  you r  mitral  valve  surger y  in  a  cardia c  operat ing  room  (OR)  under  gene ral 
anesth esia. An incision w ill be made on you r right side so that the study doctor can access you r hear t.

You w ill be placed on car diopulmonary by pass during your proce dure. This is sometim es call ed a “heart-lun g 
machine ”. The machine will re move the blood from your body t hrough tubes and add oxygen to it. The machin e 
then returns the blood to your bod y. The study doctor w ill try to minimize the time you spend on t his machine. 
The study doctor w ill explain the ent ire pro cedure to you, including all the risks and the steps he w ill take to 
minim ize tho se risks. 
 
 
 
 
Once the study doctor has access to your mit ral valv e, a small portion w ill be removed from you r valve leaflet and 
the study doctor w ill choose an Edwa rds Sapien 3 valve that is appropr iately s ized. A camera w ill be us ed to help 
visualize the procedure to confirm t hat the valve is in a good position and that there are no leaks. On ce the v alve 
is confirm ed to be in a g ood position ed and wel l seated, sut ures will be us ed to secure the valve in position and 
the he art will be clo sed. 
 
The v alve fun ction w ill be assessed by tr ansesophageal echocardio gram (TEE) during the procedure. If the valv e 
appe ars to be functioning well with little to no paravalvula r leak ( blood flow ing aro und the valv e). The patient will 
be weaned from the “heart lung machine ” and transferred to the ICU for further c are. 
 
 
The fo llowing information w ill be co llected during you procedure: 
 
 
• Tran sesophagea l echocardiogram (TEE) assessment s:

a sm all amo unt of blood or urine w ill be coll ected, to confirm you are not pregnan t, before the st udy procedure. 
A urine pregnan cy test is not as sensitive as a blood pregnancy test and a ne gative ur ine test does not com pletely 
rule out an e arly pregnan cy in pro gress. 
 
 
 
A serum pregnan cy test will be given to if you  are cons idered  of child-bearing po tential (WOCBP). To be cons idered 
as non-WO CBP, you mu st be po st-menopausal (12 month s of natural amenorrhea wi th an appropriate c linical profile 
[e.g., age ap propriate, history of vasomotor symp toms] or six months of spont aneous a menorrhea wi th serum FSH 
levels > 40mIU/mL) 
 
 
 
Other study procedu re risks: 
• Possible nausea and vomiting from gene ral anaesth esia 
 
• Possible bruising at blood draw site 
 
 
If you have additio nal question s about these risks, a sk the re searcher. 
 
 
Please notify the study doctor or study staff if you expe rience any side effec ts or complica tions during the 
study. You wi ll be monitored throughout the study in or der to minimize risks.

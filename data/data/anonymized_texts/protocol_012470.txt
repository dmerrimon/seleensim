3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Background & Rationale  
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common peripheral neuropathies and the 
most well -known workplace repetitive stress injury.1-4 The carpal tunnel is located at the wrist and 
is composed of the eight carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. The median nerve travels 
through the carpal tunnel at the wrist and may become entrapped due to inflammation, awkward 
wrist postures, r epetitive hand motions, or other causes. Compression impairs normal median nerve 
function, which leads to paresthesia, pain, numbness, and other symptoms in the distribution of the 
median nerve. Chronic compression may lead to irreversible nerve damage, si gnificant impairment 
of hand function, and muscle atrophy.1,4 
Commonly, CTS is first addressed with conservative treatment options, including wearing 
wrist braces or splints, lifestyle changes, or the use of oral non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agents 
(NSA IDs).3-6 Although wrist splints are prescribed at night and as much as possible during the day, 
fulltime compliance is poor.7 Patients may elect to receive a steroid injection into the wrist, but the 
procedure is hazardous3 and the effects are short -term. Repeat injections are not recommended.  
Severe cases of CTS are often referred directly to surgery to prevent further nerve damage. 
Approximately 70 -90% of carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgeries have good to excellent long -term 
outcomes,4 but, like all opera tions, there are risks associated with CTR surgery. Some of these risks 
include injury to the median nerve, its branches, vessels or tendons; infection; and scar sensitivity.8 
In a review of 186 CTR cases, about 24% of patients experienced mild residual sy mptoms and 8% 
experienced recurrent or persistent problems.3 
The shortcomings of current conservative treatment options and the fear of invasive 
procedures, scarring, or return of symptoms after surgery motivate several patients to explore other 
conservati ve, non -invasive treatment options.  
 
3.2. Study Device  
The study device is a stiffness -optimized thermoplastic curved band that has a strong 
biocompatible adhesive in the center of the concave side of the device. Similar to other non -invasive 
devices for CTS, the study device is a Class I device that requires Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) registration but does not require 510(k) clearance.  
Unlike the majority of traditional and dynamic splints, the study device was developed to 
decompress the median nerve  without excessive applied force and cumbersome usage 
requirements. The design of the study device allows for free movement of the wrist with minimal 
impediment of daily activities.  
The study device is indicated for people who have been diagnosed with mild  to severe carpal 
tunnel syndrome. It is fit to the subject based on the criteria in the Instructions for Use.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 11 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  The sham device is similar to the active study device but with a conformable cushion attached 
to the underside to prevent the main mechanism of a ction. Neither the sham nor the active study 
device contain any medicinal substances or electromagnetic properties that could affect human 
tissue.  
The active study device and the sham device should be stored at room temperature.  
3.3. Potential Risks & Benefits  
3.3.1.  Known Potential Risks  
Immediate risks related to the device include skin irritation or reaction to the 
adhesive used on the device, and discomfort related to any forces that the device applies to 
the wrist.  
Previous studies have found the study de vice can be worn for over 12 hours with 
little to no discomfort and minor to no redness.9 
The sham device is the same as the active device but with a cushion on the underside. 
This cushion is similar to sponges used for make -up or healthcare applications.  
3.3.2.  Known Potential Benefits  
Prolonged wear (anywhere from 1 week to 4 weeks) of the study device may 
reduce symptoms of CTS.9 
The sham device may cause a placebo effect and reduce symptoms of CTS as well.  
 
4. Objectives & Endpoints  
Objective  Endpoints  Explanation  
Primary  
Investigate whether daily 
wear of the study device 
significantly reduces 
patient -reported CTS 
symptom severity.  Symptom Severity Score (SSS) 
of the Boston Carpal Tunnel 
Questionnaire (BCTQ) in the 
treatment group at 8 weeks 
compared to Baseline.  The SSS is a validated 
combined measure of the 
patient’s perception of the 
level and frequency of pain, 
numbness, tinglin g caused by 
CTS. 8 weeks is the end of 
the treatment period . 
Secondary  
Determine whether there is a 
difference between the 
active device group  and 
sham group.  Comparing SSS at 8 weeks and 
between the active device 
group  and sham group.  Between group comparison 
conducted for the primary 
outcome variable at the 
primary endpoint (8 weeks).  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 12 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  Additionally, we will 
determine if this difference 
continues post -treatment.  Comparing SSS 1 month  post-
treatment (12 weeks) between 
the active device group and 
sham group.  Single t imepoint at 12  weeks 
compared between groups for 
post-treatment analysis.  
Exploratory  
Does CTS symptom 
improvement occur before 8 
weeks?  Significant reduction in SSS 
compared to Baseline at any 
time point before 8 weeks.  Identification of significant 
SSS reduction before 8 weeks 
suggests a shorter minimum 
duration of wear.  
Do unilateral and bilateral 
CTS patients respond 
differently to treatment?  Change in SSS at 4 an d 8 
weeks in a unilateral subgroup 
compared to a bilateral 
subgroup.  Unilateral patients showed 
significant SSS improvement 
in the pilot study, whereas 
bilateral patients seemed to 
show none.9 Both 4 - and 8 -
week timepoints compared in 
case a difference is seen 
before the end of treatment.  
Do patients respond 
differently based on 
Baseline severity?  Change in SSS at 4 and 8 
weeks in mild, moderate, and 
severe subgroups.  AANEM guidelines 
categorize CTS into 3 
severity groups.  
Describe the effect of study 
device treatment on patients 
with hormonal -induced 
CTS, such as pregnancy.  Change in SSS at or within 8 
weeks in a subgroup of 
pregnant women.  The study device is 
hypothesized to work 
primarily for repetitive stress 
induced CTS. Pregnant 
women often develop CTS 
due to swelling of the tissue.  
Demonstrate high subject 
compliance.  Diary wear time responses.  
Number of dropouts due to 
non-compliance.  Compliance is measured by 
adherence to daily wear and 
actual vs advised wear time.  
Obtain user feedback on the 
comfort, use, and design of 
the study device.  User Feedback Survey 
responses at the end of 
Treatment Period  Collects qualitative data on 
practical aspects of the 
device.

 Page 13 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  5. Study Design  
5.1. Overall Design  
It is hypothesized that daily wear of th e study device will result in significant improvements in 
patient -reported symptom severity. It is also hypothesized that the effects from active study device 
treatment will be significantly greater than effects from sham treatment. In both cases, it is 
hypothesized that improvements will be sustained post -treatment.  
This study is designed as a randomized, double -blind, sham -controlled, two -arm trial 
consisting of an eight -week treatment period (active study device or sham), followed by one 
required follow -up four weeks later  (at week 12) . After the required follow -up evaluation , the active 
device group can optionally continue to report  symptom  changes  for an additional 8 weeks . The 
sham group participants can elect to wear  the active study device for 8 weeks  after completing their 
week 12 follow -up evaluation of the sham device . For both groups, completion through the optional 
follow -ups results in a 5 -month patient duration.  
There are two study groups: the active device group receiving the active study devic e and the 
sham group receiving a non -active sham device. Subjects will be informed that they have a 50:50 
chance of receiving treatment or a sham. They will also be informed that if they receive sham 
device , they will be offered the active device 4 weeks i nto the  post-treatment period. However, all 
subjects will not know what treatment they are on until the conclusion of the trial. Study devices 
are shipped directly to enrolled subjects from the Sponsor’s designated shipping associate, which 
blinds site sta ff to group assignment.  
There are (at minimum) three physical research sites but subjects are primarily enrolled 
remotely. The physical research sites are clinics that local subjects can physically go to if needed 
(e.g., medical concern, AE). Enrolled sub jects are assigned to the PI of the geographically closest 
physical site.  
Subjects are enrolled following confirmation of CTS in one or both wrists via a recent Nerve 
Conduction Study ( NCS ) and are asked to wear the assigned device daily for 8 weeks. The NCS is 
an electrodiagnostic technique used to confirm clinical diagnosis of CTS, with a 56% to 85%  
sensitivity and at least 95% specificity for CTS.15 The primary outcome measure, Symptom 
Severity Score ( SSS) of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) , is evaluated at:  
● Baseline  
● Once every 2 weeks during the 8 -week treatment period  
● 4 weeks after  the end of treatment (at week  12) 
 
After week 12, the active device group can continue to complete follow -ups every 4 weeks for 
another 8 weeks. At the end of  week 12, the sham group will be given the opportunity to wear the 
active study device for 8 weeks. These subjects will be evaluated  once every 2 weeks during an 8 -
week treatment period with the active study device (similar to the initial treatment period).

 Page 14 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  5.2. Scient ific Rationale  
The study device was used in a pilot clinical trial (PPS -CTMD -15-001, 
ClinicalTrials.gov ID [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) that finished in October 2016 with promising results. 
Participants showed an average improvement in symptom severity scale (SSS) score o f the Boston 
Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) of 0.59 ± 0.68 points at 4 weeks (end of treatment period) 
compared to baseline SSS scores. After the 4 -week treatment period, symptoms continued to 
improve for a total of 0.79 ± 0.74 points lower SSS compare d to Baseline at 12 weeks.9 These 
results motivate the primary objective of this study.  
The pilot study investigated the effects of the study device up to 4 weeks, but the 
trajectory of SSS did not indicate that improvement plateaued by 4 weeks. Thus, the treatment 
period is extended to 8 weeks in this study to determine if improvements continue with longer -term 
wear.  
Analysis of the unilateral vs bilateral CTS patients showed a stark contrast in response. 
SSS of the unilateral patients improved 0.9 ± 0.5 p oints at 4 weeks and up to 1.2 ± 0.5 points at 12 
weeks. In contrast, the bilateral patients appeared to show no improvement; however, the pilot 
study was not powered to detect differences in unilateral and bilateral subgroups. This difference 
is being exp lored as an exploratory objective in this study.  
Most participants described the study device as being very comfortable and easy to 
wear. However, there were occasional comments about discomfort from the edges of the device. In 
Aim 1 of the NIBIB grant R44 EB024713 -01, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate 
the applied pressures on wrists using tactile pressure sensors, the changes in median nerve 
dimensions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the changes in carpal tunnel or median 
nerve compression pressures in cadavers when the study device was applied to the wrist. This 
allowed the study device to be re -designed to fit a wider range of people  and to reduce 
uncomfortable pressure points. A user feedback survey is incorporate d in the present study to 
improve user satisfaction, which is critical for any practical application and success.

 Page 16 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  6.4. Enrollment Determination  
Subjects that pass the inclusion/exclusion criteria, have provided or completed a NCS report 
confirming mild to severe CTS diagnosis, and have signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) are 
considered enrolled in the study.  
6.5. Screen Failures  
Scree n failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical trial 
(i.e., sign the ICF) but are not subsequently randomized to a study intervention or enrolled. Some 
reasons for not enrolling after signing the ICF include the subject decid ing not to participate or the 
discovery of disqualifying criteria after signing the ICF.  
In certain cases, a subject may need an NCS performed under their primary care 
provider after having signed the ICF. If the NCS report does not meet the inclusion crit eria, the 
subject is not enrolled and is categorized as screen failure.  
6.6. Strategies for Recruitment & Retention  
Each site will advertise and recruit subjects per each site’s best practices and following 
applicable GCP, HIPAA, and all local to federal laws. Recruitment may be supplemented with 
IRB-approved physical advertisements such as flyers or cards and with IRB -approved digital 
advertisements on webpages and social media. Sponsor may supply advertising and marketing 
materials at Sponsor’s discretion or a s needed by the sites.  
Sites may identify eligible subjects from their patient or volunteer databases or from 
their (electronic) medical records. Physicians at each site may identify eligible subjects during 
routine appointments, at which point the physic ian should offer information about the study to the 
patient. Sites may also obtain referrals from nearby or partner clinics.  
Before enrollment, all subjects are informed that there is a 50/50 chance of receiving 
the real device or the sham device. However,  the sham group will be given the opportunity to 
undergo treatment with the real device upon completion of the main part of the trial ( after Week 
12). This method seeks to increase fairness of participation and improve retention of sham group 
participants.  
 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1. Screening, Informed Consent and HIPAA  
Subjects that pass the pre -screening questionnaire and meet all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be asked to participate in the study. The study design, objective, procedures, schedule, 
and participation parameters/criteria will be provided to and/or discussed with subjects prior to 
enrollment. Subjects wishing to participate must read and complete the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF) and sign an “Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Health Inf ormation for Research” 
release as a component of the ICF (HIPAA authorization) prior to undergoing any study -related 
procedures.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 17 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  The ICF/HIPAA Authorization may be sent electronically to the subject. Subjects and 
designated site staff may sign electronical ly or can physically sign but must provide a scanned 
signed copy ICF/HIPAA Authorization to the site for documentation.  
Documentation of screening, eligibility confirmation, and reasons for ineligibility or 
non-participation will be kept in a Screening Log . 
 
7.2. Enrollment, Baseline Assessment, and Randomization  
7.2.1.  Enrollment Procedures  
After the subject has passed the pre -screening questionnaire , the subject will begin 
enrollment, which includes reading and signing the ICF/HIPAA Authorization, completing 
the Enro llment Form  which includes the BCTQ and NPRS, and confirmation of CTS 
diagnosis via NCS.  After confirming meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject is 
considered enrolled. The subject will be randomized into either the active device group or 
the sham group and assigned a Subject ID.  
Once the subject is enrolled, study devices are shipped (expedited) to the subject 
to begin treatment as soon after enrollment as possible. If a subject is bilateral, only the 
worse wrist (via NCS severity and/or SSS score) will be treated during the study. If NCS 
severity and/or SSS score are the same for both wrists, the dominant wrist will be treated. 
Standardized training and instructional materials will be provided to the subject on how to 
use the study devices, how and when to complete surveys , Diaries , etc. ; how and when to 
report AE’s/SAE’s; and how to contact site staff or PI.  
7.2.2.  Subject ID Assignment  
Subjects will be assigned a unique identification code (Subject ID). The subject ID 
is unique across all sites. After the subject is enrolled in the study, all forms will refer to 
the subject with the Subject ID and not the subject’s name. Each site will maintain an 
Enrollment Log linking identity of study subjects to the Subject IDs.  
7.2.3.  Baseline Assessment  
The Enrollment CRF captures Baseline assessment measures. These include:  
● Date of birth/age  
● Gender  
● CTS severity (mild, moderate, or severe, from NCS)  
● CTS diagnosis by hand (unilateral/bilateral, right/left/both)  
● BCTQ and NPRS for affected hand(s)  
 
7.2.4.  Randomization  
There are two treatment groups: active study device or sham device. Subjects will 
be equally randomized across all sites to ensure equal and equivalent active device and 
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 18 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  sham groups. Randomization will occur using a Sponsor -supplied randomization tool or 
using the randomization module of the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) platform.  
 
7.3. Treatment Period  
The Treatment Period begins the first day that the subject begins wearing the device. 
Electronic Diaries are sent to subjects every day from the first day of tre atment for 56 days. 
Subjects should be reminded if (s)he does not complete an entry. If 3 or more consecutive diary 
entries are missed, the site should contact the subject to remind them to complete entries or they 
could be withdrawn from the study.  No mor e than 3 consecutive Diary entries and no more than 
25% of total entries should be missed (14 out of 56 diary entries), but withdrawal due to missed 
Diary entries will be up to Sponsor after evaluating the situation  
Follow -up surveys  are electronically sen t to subjects every 2 weeks from the subject’s first 
day of device wear up to 8 weeks. The subject should complete the survey s within 3 days and 
reminders should be sent if the subject does not complete the survey . If the subject does not 
complete the survey within 3 days, the site should follow up with the subject to remind them to 
complete the survey  and address any issues preventing the subject from completing the survey . 
All subject correspondences and contact attempts should be documented.  
On the last day of treatment, the subject will complete a User Feedback Survey. This should 
be completed within 5 days.  
 
7.4. Post-Treatment Period  (Active Study Device Group)  
After the 56th day of treatment  (end of Week 8) , subjects will stop wearing the device. A po st-
treatment follow -up will then occur  4 weeks after the last day of treatment (Week 12). Survey  
completion and reminder timelines are the same as for the Treatment Period Follow -up Surveys 
above.  
Subjects in the treatment group will be exited after the la st day of the Post -Treatment Period 
(end of Week 12) and after they have completed all required surveys and follow -ups. See Section 
7.6 Exit Procedures . 
7.5. Post-Treatment Period (Sham Device Group)  
After the 56th day of tr eatment  (end of Week 8) , subjects will stop wearing the device. A 
post-treatment follow -up will then occur 4 weeks after the last day of treatment (Week 12). The 
sham group will be offered the active study device at this point. If the subject agrees, then (s)he 
will wear the active study device daily for an additional 8 weeks and complete Follow -up 
Surveys biweekly and Diary entries daily . On the last day of treatment (Week 20), the subject 
will complete a User Feedback Survey.  
If the subject decides not to test of the active study device, then the subject will be Exited 
from the study.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 19 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  7.6. Exit Procedures  
Exit procedures will only occur after the assigned site has ensured the subject has completed 
all required assessments and follow -ups. The assigned site staff member will complete the Exit 
CRF.  
An Exit CRF must be completed for any subject that has signed  the ICF and is being 
withdrawn for any reason.  
7.7. Subject Withdrawal  
Potential reasons for withdrawal or removal o f subjects are outlined below:  
● Subject decides it is in his/her best interest to withdraw  
● Principal investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to withdraw  
● Subject is noncompliant during the 12-week treatment period (i.e., Sponsor deems subject 
has missed too many Diary entries or Follow -ups).  
● Subject is lost -to-follow -up at any point (more than 5 documented attempts to contact and 
ask to complete follow -ups with no response after 3 weeks)  
● Subject fails to refrain from other CTS treatments or therapies.  
If the subject is withdrawn, the PI or designated staff member must fill out the Exit Form and 
document the reason for withdrawal or removal of the subject from the study. Unless the subject 
requests removal of their data, any data or information collected from the subject will remain in the 
database and analyzed at the sponsor’s discretion.  
 
8. Study Supplies  
8.1. Study Device Supply  
A designa ted Sponsor employee independent from the clinical trial will be delegated authority 
for shipping supplies to enrolled subjects (heretofore referred to as “Shipping Associate”). This 
individual will not reveal any PHI or PII to the other Sponsor employees involved in the clinical 
trial.  
Once a subject is enrolled, the Shipping Associate will be informed of the type of devices to 
ship (active device or sham), quantity, and the name and address to ship to. The Shipping Associate 
will expedite the package to the newly enrolled subject.  
If subject has not received devices by the expected delivery date, site staff must contact the 
Shipping Associate to re -send the package. Shipment and Confirmation Logs will be kept by the 
sites.  
8.2. Study Device Reconciliation and  Destruction  
Subjects are asked to retain all used and unused study devices throughout the Treatment Period. 
At the end of the Treatment Period, or otherwise determined by the Sponsor, subjects will be asked 
to return all used and unused study devices by m ailing the devices using supplied shipping 
materials.  
Number of lost, used, and unused devices will be reconciled for each subject.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 20 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  The Sponsor will retain devices. Device destruction or disposition is at the discretion of the 
Sponsor.  
8.3. Other Study Supplies  
Study -related documents, investigator binders, study subject binders, and project trial binders 
will be provided by the sponsor. Other supplies will be supplied as needed and negotiated by site.  
 
 
9. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1. Specification of and Methods for Collecting Safety Parameters  
Subjects will be able to report safety concerns on their surveys and Diarie s. Subjects 
may also contact their assigned site staff directly with safety concerns. Subjects will be instructed 
to report any safety conc ern or medical event including injury, sickness, hospitalization or other 
adverse event that occurs during their involvement in the study.  
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse events (AE) is any unexpected medical problem experienced by th e 
subject that occurs during treatment or during the study that may or may not be associated with 
the treatment.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that results in a life -threatening situation, 
inpatient or prolonged hospitalization, significant inca pacity or disruption of normal life 
functions, abnormal birth defect, or death. Any major medical event that may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention may be interpreted as SAEs.  
9.3. Reporting Procedures  
Site staff and Sponsor ’s Clinical Research Manager will regularly monitor survey  and 
Diary responses (e.g., daily for Diaries and as they come in for other surveys ) for any safety 
concerns. Severity and relatedness of patient -reported safety concerns will be assessed by the PI or 
appropriately qualified site staff member. If determined to be the level of an adverse event or 
serious adverse event, the safety concern will be recorded in the AE/SAE Log within the IRB’s 
reporting timeframe . The PI or appropriately qualified site sta ff member will determine the 
necessary follow -up medical response.  
Minor AEs such as minor injuries ( e.g., sprains, cuts, bruises) or minor illnesses ( e.g., 
colds, flus, food poisoning) that are clearly not associated with device do not need to be reporte d 
to the Sponsor or IRB. AEs that result in injury to the affected wrist area or in discontinuation of 
device use should be reported to the Sponsor.  
SAEs are to be recorded as soon as possible from the discovery of the SAE and both 
the PI, sponsor, and IRB  notified promptly. The Sponsor should notify all sites of an SAE. 
AEs/SAEs should be reported within the timeframes from IRB and GCP guidelines.  
9.4. Follow -up for Adverse Events  
Site staff should contact subjects that report an AE within 3 days of learning of  the 
AE, unless the AE is minor (see above).  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 21 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  For subjects with a reported and recorded AE, site staff should contact the subject at 
each subsequent Follow -up (i.e., every 2 weeks during Treatment Period, every 4 weeks during 
Post-Treatment Period) to obtai n an update on the status of the AE/SAE. The AEs should be 
followed until resolved, considered stable, or the subject is exited from the study.  
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
10.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
H0: Daily wear of the study device does not improve symptom severity.  
H1: Daily wear of the study device improves symptom severity by at least 0.4 
points.  
10.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
H0: Daily wear of the study device does not improve symptom severity in 
comparison to sham treatment.  
H1: Daily wear of the study device improves symptom severity by at least 0.4 
points more than the sham group.  
H0: Changes in symptom severity are not sustained after stopping treatment.  
H1: Changes in symptom severity are sustained or continue a fter stopping 
treatment.  
 
10.2. Sample Size Determination  
A total of 102 subjects are required for this study, with 51 in each group.  
The outcome measure used for calculations in the SSS of the BCTQ, which ranges 
from 1 to 5 with 1 being no symptoms (improved) and 5 being the worst symptoms (worsened).  
A moderate effect size of 0.4 was chosen, assuming that study device efficacy is 0.4 
greater than sham.  
The pilot study experienced a drop -out rate of 20% (2 out of 13 total). With the longer 
treatment and follow -up times of this study, a higher drop -out is expected.  Therefore the sample 
size calculation is modified by an estimated attrition rate of 25%.  
The primary objective examines the 8 week vs baseline within -active group SSS 
change. Sample size determinatio n explanation. The power analysis using the above results in a 
significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.94*.  
The secondary objective examines the change in SSS after 8 weeks between the active 
study device and sham groups. Sample size calculation is bas ed on a parallel, one -sided t -test power 
analysis to identify an effect size of 0.4, standard deviation of 0.7 (based on the pilot study PPS -
CTMD -15-001), significance level of 0.05, power of 0.8, and an estimated attrition rate of 25%.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 22 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  The sample size was  chosen to meet both the primary and secondary objectives.  
10.3. Randomization and Blinding Procedures  
A simple randomization scheme is used to allocate subjects into the treatment group or 
the sham group. Site staff will be blinded to the randomization list an d the Sponsor clinical research 
team blind to the allocation of each subject.  
Blinding will be broken for each sham group participant at his/her  first post -treatment 
follow -up (Week 12) so that the site can offer the sham group participant the opportunity  to try the 
active study device. Complete b linding will be broken at the end of the study when all data has 
been entered and validated and the database has been locked.  
Blinding may be broken if a subject experiences a SAE  and if knowledge of the device 
is necessary for proper medical treatment of the SAE. Due to the low risk and minimal side effects 
associated with the device from previous studies, unblinding in most cases is not deemed necessary 
for medical treatment.  
The subject’s assigned site must obta in approval from the Sponsor to break the blind. 
After approval, the Shipping Associate responsible for randomization will provide the assignment 
for the subject in question . After a subject’s treatment has been revealed, this must be noted along 
with reas ons for breaking the blind in the subject’s records and in the Deviation/Violation Log.  
10.4. Population for Analyses  
Statistical analyses will be based on a per protocol analysis - i.e., performed only on the SSS 
scores for subjects that have completed the ful l 8 week treatment period.  
10.5. Statistical Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the improvement (reduction) in SSS of the treatment 
group at 8 weeks after the first day of device wear. The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed 
using a paired, one-sided t -test. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the improvement (reduction) in SSS of the 
treatment group compared to the sham group at T4 (8 weeks after the first day of device wear). The 
secondary endpoint will be analyzed using a two sample one -sided t-test. 
A repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to evaluate changes over time 
in both the active and sham groups.  
The exploratory endpoints will be analyzed using descriptive methods.  
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects that  received treatment.  
 
11. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1. Data Collection Methods  
Data for each subject at each site will be entered into an electronic data capture (EDC) 
system. Paper forms used as CRFs, during enrollment, or at other time points will b e entered into 
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 23 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  the EDC by site staff. Surveys  are administered to subjects to collect baseline, follow -up, AE/SAE, 
user feedback, and exit data. Subjects use their own devices to complete the se surveys and Diaries  
online. Forms will record the subject’s ID, assigned site, date completed, and other relevant 
information. Subjects will be trained during or after enrollment on how to use and fill out the se 
surveys . Support and re -training will be provided to subjects w henever requested.  
Appropriate security and privacy settings in the EDC system, or procedures set up for 
use with the EDC system, will be put in place to meet minimum applicable regulations. These may 
include audit trails, unique log -ins, and custom user a ccess. The EDC system will be set up and 
managed by the sponsor’s Clinical Trials Manager or Clinical Trials Data Manager. Before study 
launch, the system will be tested and validated.  
11.2. Data Management  
The Sponsor Clinical Research (Data) Manager will contr ol access to the EDC. 
Specific forms and functions will be granted to Sponsor and site staff based on their role in the 
study. The Clinical Research (Data) Manager will create the survey s and electronic workflow.  
Site staff and the Clinical Research Manage r will have access to subject responses in 
the EDC and will have the ability to correct data when necessary. Data correction may occur in 
instances where a subject enters the wrong information (e.g., puts in 2018 for their birth year) and 
the correction ha s been verified.   
Once data collection is complete, the Clinical Research (Data) Manager will work with 
site staff to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data. Data will be exported, reviewed, cleaned 
as necessary, and then locked for statistical analy sis. 
Unlocking of the database requires justification and approval. Reasons for unlocking, 
date of unlocking, and date of re -locking the database will be documented.  
11.3. Quality Assurance  
11.3.1.  Training  
Training on the protocol, procedures, forms, and EDC system wil l be provided to 
the site prior to launch of the study. Training may be completed through teleconference 
or in-person, as determined between the Sponsor and the site. Training will be 
documented in Training logs.  
11.3.2.  Deviations/Violations  
A deviation is an unp lanned departure from protocol by the staff, participant, or 
investigator that does not cause significant consequences and is not intended to be a 
permanent or systematic change.  
A violation is a divergence from protocol that reduces the quality or 
complet eness of the data (e.g., missing or erroneous critical information on the surveys , 
I/E criteria not met), makes the Informed Consent Form inaccurate (e.g., ICF not fully 
signed), or impacts a subject's safety, rights, or welfare (e.g., unreported SAEs). Ot her 
violations include repeated subject non -compliance and intentional departures from 
protocol.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 24 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  Site staff and PIs should be vigilant in identifying, recording, and addressing all 
deviations from and violations of the protocol. All deviations and violatio ns should be 
recorded in the Deviations/Violations Log. The PI or appropriately delegated individual 
will determine if the Sponsor and/or IRB should be notified. Any deviation or violation 
performed to protect patient safety or confidentiality or otherwise  impacting patient 
safety or confidentiality should be immediately reported to the IRB and Sponsor.  
11.3.3.  Monitoring  
A staff member(s) at each site will be responsible for regularly monitoring subject 
responses in the EDC system. If a subject misses Diary entries or survey responses beyond 
the acceptable windows, the designated site staff member will contact subject to e nsure 
completion of the documents.  
The site staff member will also follow up with subjects to clarify entries that are 
or seem to be incorrect or questionable.  
The Sponsor Clinical Trials Manager or Data Manager will similarly monitor 
subject compliance an d safety across all sites weekly or biweekly. Any errors, 
discrepancies, missed entries, or other entries of concern will be queried to the respective 
site. The clinical research coordinators (CRC) or similarly designated staff member at each 
site is expec ted to respond to and resolve or help the Manager resolve the issue in a timely 
manner. Queries and resolution will be tracked by the Clinical Trials Manager.  
The Clinical Trials Manager (or similarly designated staff member) will also check 
in regularly w ith each site to review items such as enrollment status, subject compliance 
and safety, supplies, and site questions or issues. These will be tracked in a Remote 
Monitoring Log.  
After the first 3 subjects are enrolled at each site, the Clinical Trials Manager or 
Associate will check in with the site to ensure procedures are being conducted as expected 
and to address any problems early on. If refresher training is needed, the site may request 
virtual in -person training with the Clinical Trials Man ager.  
Interim monitoring visit(s) may be scheduled as needed.  
11.4. Study Data & Records Retention  
Study records will be maintained for at least 2 years after study close -out.  
 
12. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
This protoco l and the informed consent document (provided as a separate document) and 
any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB or ethics committee 
responsible for oversight of the study.  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 25 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  12.2. Informed Consent Forms  
The most recently approved v ersion of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be used to 
obtain and document informed consent of study participants. The ICF is provided in English with 
no translations planned. If a new version of the ICF is approved during the study, previously 
consente d and enrolled subjects will be re -consented using the newly approved ICF , only if the 
changes to the ICF are substantial and the IRB requires re -consent . 
A signed ICF will be obtained from each participant. For participants who cannot consent 
for themselv es, such as those with a legal guardian, the guardian must sign the ICF. The ICF will 
describe the purpose of the study, the procedures involved, the requirements to follow, the risks and 
benefits of participation, and compensation. A copy will be given to  each participant or legal 
guardian.  
12.3. Participant Confidentiality  
During screening, prospective subjects agree to provide their name, email, phone number, 
and potentially general area of residence (such as zip  code, for assignment to closest research site).  
This information is used to email the prospect introductory study information and send study surveys 
and forms. To protect the privacy of enrolled subjects, no personally identifiable information will 
be included in any material sent to the Sponsor (excep t in cases listed below). This includes: 
enrollment logs, patient names, phone numbers, fax numbers, patient addresses, Social Security 
numbers, local hospital medical record number.  
The Sponsor employee responsible for shipping devices to enrolled subjec ts (“Shipping 
Associate”) will be not be involved in any other clinical research and will only receive the minimum 
necessary information to ship the correct devices to the subject (i.e., name, address, treatment).  
Compensation also requires that the name and address of the subject be provided to a 
Sponsor employee handling finances. In these cases, the name and address of the subject without  
the associated Subject ID will be sent to the designated employee to process and send compensation. 
The shipping and  compensation employees will not be involved with any other component of the 
study and will not share any subject’s personally identifiable information with Sponsor employees 
associated with the study.  
 
13. PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH  
Authorship will reflect joint cooperation between PPS and participating PI(s). Authorship 
responsibilities should be established prior to the writing of any manuscript.  
No individual publications are allowed unless agreed upon, reviewed, and approved by the Sponsor 
before  submission and/or publication. No individual publications are allowed prior to the completion of 
a final report for the study.

 Page 30 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  APPENDIX I: BOSTON CARPAL TUNNEL QUESTIONNAIRE (BCTQ)  
The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) is a patient -administered measure of symptom severity 
and functional impairment due to carp al tunnel syndrome. It has been shown to be “valid, reliable, 
responsive, and acceptable” tool to use as a primary outcome measure in carpal tunnel syndrome 
studies13.  
 
Each response has a value from 1 to 5. The average value of the responses to the first  11 questions 
provides the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score. The average value of the responses to the remaining 
7 questions provides the Functional Severity Scale (FSS) score. The lowest value is 1 and represents no 
symptoms or functional impairment. Th e highest value is 5 and represents the worst possible symptoms 
and functional impairment.  
 
Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ)  
The BCTQ is 2 -part survey that quantifies the severity of your carpal tunnel syndrome. Thinking about 
your symptoms due t o carpal tunnel syndrome for a typical twenty -four (24) hour day  during the past 
two (2) weeks , please answer the following questions. (If you have bilateral CTS (both hands affected),

 Page 33 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  APPENDIX II: NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY (NCS)  
An electrodiagnostic confirmation of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in addition to clinical diagnosis of CTS 
is required for enrollment into the PPS-CTS-SBIR2 study.  A nerve conduction study (NCS) must be 
performed and provided to the site before patients can be enrolled into the study. The objective of the 
examination is to determine the presence of nerve damage or destruction in study subjects a nd to classify 
CTS severity as mild, moderate, or severe (per AANEM criteria13). The following NCS tests are the 
minimum tests that must be performed to confirm CTS diagnosis and provided for reference.  
 
Median and ulnar motor and sensory studies should ha ve been performed on either (unilateral CTS) or 
both wrists (bilateral CTS) of each study subject to confirm CTS diagnosis.  
  
Procedure  
The study subject will be placed in a supine position and any clothing will be adjusted or removed to allow 
for exposure  of the wrist and forearm.  Electrodiagnostic testing will be performed with a Cadwell Sierra 2 
EMG unit and a grounding pad will be used.  Skin temperature will be measured and testing will be 
performed with skin temperatures in the 26 –32°C range.  
  
Four (4) separate sub -studies will be performed as part of the overall nerve conduction study 
(electrodiagnostic carpal tunnel testing) as follows:  
  
Median nerve sensory distal latency study : 
Orthodromic stimulation with active ring electrode placed at th e base of the second finger and reference 
electrode placed distally 4 cm apart.  Stimulation is performed 13 cm proximal to the active ring electrode 
over the median nerve between the tendons of the palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis.  
  
Normal value s: 
Amplitude: > 20 µV  
Conduction velocity: > 50 m/sec  
Distal peak latency: < 3.5 msec  
  
Ulnar nerve sensory distal latency study : 
Ring electrodes are placed over the fifth digit 4 cm apart with the active electrode proximally at the base 
of the finger.  Stimulation is performed 14 cm proximally radial to the flexor carpi ulnaris.  Distal distance 
will be 11 cm.  
  
Normal values : 
Amplitude: > 17 µV  
Conduction velocity: > 50 m/sec  
Distal peak latency: < 3.1 msec  
  
Median nerve motor conduction veloc ity and latency study : 
The active surface electrode is placed one half the distance between the metacarpophalangeal joint and 
the thumb and the midpoint of the distal wrist crease.  The reference electrode is placed on the distal 
phalanx of the thumb.  
  
PPS-CTS-SBIR2 v.3  CONFIDENTIAL  12/20/2018  
 
 Page 34 of 34 Aim 2 Trial Protocol  Distal stimulation is performed 7 cm proximal to the active electrode over the median nerve between the 
tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus.  Proximal stimulation is performed over the 
medial aspect of the antecubital space between the b iceps tendon and brachial artery.  
  
Normal values : 
Amplitude: > 4.0 mV  
Conduction velocity: > 49 m/sec  
Distal latency: < 4.4 msec  
  
Ulnar nerve motor conduction velocity and latency study : 
The active surface electrode is placed over the abductor digiti minimi on appointment between the distal 
wrist crease and the crease at the base of the fifth digit.  The reference electrode is placed on the fifth 
digit.  The elbow is flexed to 90°.  Stimulation is performed 8 cm proximal to the active electrode just over 
the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon; a second stimulation just distal to the ulnar groove and a third stimulation 
proximal to the ulnar groove, with the cathode distally placed.  
  
Normal values : 
Amplitude: > 6.0 mV  
Conduction velocity: > 49 m/sec  
Distal latency: < 3.3 msec  
  
All amplitude, conduction velocity and latency values will be recorded in the subject’s chart and results 
will be printed and attached to the subject’s chart.  
  
A one -sided (unilateral) nerve con duction study (electrodiagnostic carpal tunnel test) will take 
approximately 20 minutes to perform.  
  
In the case that diagnosis is still uncertain after performing these four sub -studies, the following two (2) 
sub-studies may be performed:  
  
Median/radial  sensory study : 
Antidromic stimulation with the active ring electrode placed at the base of the thumb and reference 
electrode placed distally 4 cm apart.  Stimulation performed 10 cm proximal to the ring electrode over the 
radial nerve at the radial styloi d process and over the median nerve at the wrist between the tendons of 
the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus.  
  
A difference of > 0.4 msec between the radial and median nerve peak latency, where the median nerve 
would be slower, will be considered  abnormal.  
  
Median versus ulnar sensory latencies to digit 4 study : 
Ring electrodes are placed at the base of the 4th finger, active proximal, reference distal, 4 cm apart. 
Stimulation is performed over the medial and ulnar nerves at the wrist at identica l distances from the 
proximal electrode (11 -13 cm).  
  
A difference of > 0.5 msec will be considered significant.

Name of Finished Product: Miconazole oil  
Name of Active Ingredient: 2% miconazole  
Study Title:  
Randomized, Double -blind, Phase III Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Miconazole Oil 
versus Vehicle Oil in the Treatment of Otomycosis , Followed by an Open -label Safety  
Evaluation  
Study Number:  MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
Study Center(s):  Up to  20 study centers in the United States (US)  
Number of Subjects Planned:   
Approximately 390 (estimated); the actual number enrolled will be the number needed to 
achieve at least 128 subjects eligible to be included in the modified intent -to-treat (MITT) 
population, defined as all subjects who were randomized  with a positive fungal culture  at 
Screening/ Baseline , and to a chieve at least 300 subjects exposed to miconazole oil for 14 
days  who are evaluable for safety . Thus, a higher or lower number than estimated may be 
enrolled , with enrollment continuing until the required numbers of subjects have been 
achieved . 
Phase of Development:  3 
Objectives:  
• Confirm the efficacy of miconazole oil compared with vehicle over a 14 -day treatment 
duration  in subjects with otomycosis  
• Assess the safety of miconazole oil over a 14 -day treatment duration  
Design and Methodology:  
This study will be conducted in 2 portions:  
1. Enrollment A, which will consist of 2 treatment periods as follows and will be conducted in 
subjects with otomycosis : 
a. A randomized, double -blind, parallel -group treatment period . This treatment period  will 
be referred to as the “Randomization Period” and will be followed by:  
b. An optional, open -label treatment period with miconazole oil . This treatment period  will 
be refer red to as the “Optional Open -label Extension .” 
2. Enrollment B, which will consist of open -label treatment  with miconazole oil  in subjects who 
will not be required to have signs and symptoms of otomycosis.  
Enrollment A  
The study will start with Enrollment A , in which a n estimated 220 male or female subjects with 
otomycosis will receive study drug , although  this number may be higher or lower depending on 
the percentage of subjects eligible to be included in the MITT population . Subjects will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to recei ve miconazole oil or vehicle , for 14 days. The study 
drug will be administered as 5 drops per ear at ~30 mg per drop instilled into the external ear 
canal of the ear(s) affected by otomycosis . 
Randomization Period  
During the Randomization Period, b oth the subject and the investigator and study staff  will be 
blinded as to the contents of the study drug .

At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment 
of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of 
fungal elements, and aural fullness ), and an evaluation of medical history. Urine will be 
obtained for pregnancy screening in female subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and 
concomitant medications will be reported. Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of 
otomycosis and who meet all other eligibility criteria will be entered into the study. A fungal 
culture of the affec ted ear(s) will be taken, then debris will be cleaned from the affected ear(s) 
following the site’s normal procedures. The subject will be randomized, and study drug will be 
weighed and dispensed to the subject along with a subject diary. The subject will then begin 
treatment with study drug. The subject or caregiver will instill the first dose of study drug at the 
site, under the supervision of the investigator or site personnel. Adverse events (AEs) will then 
be assessed. The subject will then leave the c linic and continue to administer the study drug 
and to complete the subject diary twice per day as instructed. Subjects will be instructed to 
avoid getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by using a blow 
dryer, and to place a Vaseline -impregnated cotton ball over the affected ear(s) to help keep 
water out of the ear while bathing or showering.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8  for the On Treatment Visit, at which  time a clinical 
evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a cleaning of the affected ear(s) 
(following the site’s normal procedures), a review of the subject diary, and an assessment of 
AEs and concomitant medications will be performed . Subjects will continue to administer the 
study drug and to com plete the subject diary twice per day, up through Day 14, following the 
same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15  for the End of Treatment Visit, at which time a 
clinical evaluation  of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis and a fungal culture of the 
affected ear(s)  will be performed ; however, a fungal culture will not be required at this visit for 
subjects known to have a negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline , as assessed aft er at 
least 14 days of incubation by the clinical laboratory performing the fungal culture. AEs and 
concomitant medications will also be assessed, and the subject will return all unused study 
drug along with the completed subject diary .  
Subjects will retu rn to the clinic on Day 22 for the Test of Cure Visit, at which time an 
assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of otomycosis and a fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s)  will be performed ; however, a fungal culture will not be required at this visit for subjects 
known to have a negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline , as assessed after at least 14 
days of incubation by the clinical laboratory performing the fungal culture . AEs and 
concomitant medications will also be assessed. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in 
women of childbearing potential.  
Optional Open -label Extension  
Subjects who  either  complete the  Randomization Period  of the  study (up through the Test of 
Cure Visit) , or who are prematurely discontinued from study treatm ent during the 
Randomization Period  due to worsening of signs and/or symptoms of otomycosis in the 
judgment of the investigator , will be offered the opportunity to participate in an optional open -
label extension , if they have a visual presence of fungal el ements  in at least one ear treated 
during the Randomization Period . Only the ear(s) that were treated in the Randomization

Period will be potentially eligible for treatment during the Optional Open -label Extension . 
All subjects in the Optional Open -label E xtension  will receive miconazole oil for 14 days.  No 
unblinding of the subject’s treatment in the Randomization Period will occur at this time.  
Before a subject enter s the Optional Open -label Extension , all procedures for the Test of Cure 
Visit will be completed  for that subject ; however, a fungal culture will not be required at this 
visit for subjects known to have a negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline, as assessed 
after at least 14 days of incubation by the clinical laboratory performing the fungal culture .  
At the first visit of the Optional Open -label Extension  (Day OLE1, which will occur while the 
subject is already onsite for the Test of Cure or Early Termination Visit from the 
Randomiz ation  Period ), study drug  (miconazole oil)  will be weighed and dispensed to the 
subject along with a subject diary. Subjects or their caregivers will administer t he first dose of 
miconazole oil  at the site . AEs and concomitant medications  will then be assessed . Subjects 
will then continue to administer miconazole oil  and to complete the subject diary twice per day 
for a total of 14 days , following the same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline 
Visit on Day 1.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day OLE15 for the End of Treatment Visit , at which time a 
clinical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis will be performed, as well as an 
assessment of AEs and concomitant medications . A urine pregnancy tes t will be performed in 
women of childbearing potential.  The subject will return all unused miconazole oil  along with 
the completed subject diary .  
Data for Enrollment A will be unblinded after all subjects p lanned for  Enrollment A have 
completed both the R andomization Period and the Optional Open -label Extension, so that 
analyses from Enrollment A can be conducted even if Enrollment B is still ongoing (i.e., before 
the conclusion of Enrollment B).  
Enrollment B  
Enrollment B may be initiated while Enrollment A is still actively enrolling subjects. An 
estimated 170  male or female subjects will receive study drug  (miconazole oil)  in Enrollment B , 
although this number may be higher or lower depending on the total number of subjects  
needed to achieve at least 300 subjects who are exposed to miconazole oil for 14 days in the 
study overall  who are evaluable for safety .  
At Screening/Baseline (Day B1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination  and an 
evaluation of medical history. Urine will be obtained for pregnancy screening in female 
subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant medications will be reported. Subjects 
who meet all eligi bility criteria will be entered into the study. Study drug will be weighed and 
dispensed to the subject along with a subject diary. The subject will then begin treatment with 
miconazole oil . In subjects who do not have otomycosis, t reatment will be  in the left ear if both 
ears are otherwise eligible; if only one ear is eligible, treatment will be in that ear. In subjects 
who have otomycosis (i.e., any signs and/or symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis of 
otomycosis in the judgment of the investigato r), treatment will preferably be in the ear(s) with 
otomycosis, provided the ear(s) meet all eligibility criteria . If both ears are judged by the 
investigator to have otomycosis and both meet all eligibility criteria, both ears may be treated . 
The subject or caregiver will instill the first dose of miconazole oil  at the site, under the

supervision of the investigator or site personnel. AEs will then be assessed. The subject will 
then leave the clinic and continue to administer miconazole oil  and to complete  the subject 
diary twice per day , following the same instructions for miconazole oil  administration as in 
Enrollment A . 
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day B15 for the End of Treatment Visit, at which time AEs 
and concomitant medications will be asse ssed . Subject s will return all unused miconazole oil  
along with the completed subject diary . A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of 
childbearing potential.  
Timing of Subject Recruitment Into Enrollment A and Enrollment B  
The study will start with Enrollment A, which will continue until the sponsor determines that a 
sufficient number of subjects  (see Sample Size below)  has been recruited to conduct the 
planned analyses for Enrollment A, at which time the sponsor (or designee) will notify all study 
sites to terminate further enrollment into th e Enrollment A  portion of the study.  
Recruitment of subjects into Enrollment B will begin when the sponsor (or designee)  notifies 
sites to begin recruiting subjects into Enrollment B , and will end when  the sponsor (or 
designee) notifies study sites to pause or permanently terminate  recruit ment of subjects into 
Enrollment B. Enrollment B may occur over one or multiple time periods, each of which will 
begin and then pause (or permanently end) upon sponsor  (or designee) notification to the 
study sites. The purpose of this mechanism is to allow concurrent enrollment of Enrollment A 
and Enrollment B at times (such as during the wintertime) when recruitment into Enrollment A 
is likely to be diminished due to a  lower expected incidence of otomycosis, while also allowing 
the sponsor the flexibility to pause or permanently terminate recruitment into Enrollment B for 
reasons including (but not limited to) time periods during which a higher incidence of 
otomycosis i s expected (at which times the sponsor may wish for the focus of the study  to be  
on recruitment of subjects into Enrollment A), or  evaluat ion by the sponsor of the number of 
subjects still needed for Enrollment B  (see Sample Size below) .  
At times when Enr ollment A and Enrollment B are concurrently ongoing, if a subject is found to 
be eligible for both Enrollment A and Enrollment B , the subject  should be enrolled into 
Enrollment A whenever possible.

Other ingredients: refined peanut oil, mineral oil, oleth -2, and isopropyl myristate  
Mode of administration: subjects will be seated and then instructed to tilt their heads so that 
the affected ear is facing up. The subject or caregiver will then gently pull the ear lobe 
backward and upward and apply 5 drops of mico nazole oil into the ear. The subject will be 
instructed to keep the head tilted with the ear facing up for approximately 3 to 5 minute s to 
allow the miconazole oil to penetrate lower into the ear canal. If both ears are being treated, 
the process will then  be repeated for the other ear after a 5 -minute wait.

Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
• Percentage of subjects with “therapeutic cure,” defined as “mycological cure” plus 
“clinical cure” at the Test of Cure Visit. Mycological cure is defined as a negative 
mycological culture, and clinical cure is defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs 
and symptoms according to the scales for each individual sign or symptom . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Percentage of subjects  with mycological cure at the Test of Cure Visit.  
• Percentage of subjects with clinical cure at the Test of Cure Visit.  
Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Percentage of subjects with “modified therapeutic cure ” at the Test of Cure Visit, 
defined as mycological cure plus a score of 0 for the clinical sign of fungal elements 
plus a score of 0 or 1 for each of the clinical signs and symptoms of pruritus, debris, 
and aural fullness.  
• Percentage of subjects with “therapeutic improvement ” at the Test of Cure Visit, 
defined as mycological cure plus a score of 0 or 1 for each of the clinical signs and 
symptoms of fungal elements, pruritus, debris, and aural fullness.  
Safety Endpoint  
• Percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
Statistical Analyses:  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the percentages of subjects by treatment group with 
therapeutic cure, mycological cure, and clinical cure in the study ear at each evaluation. 
Descriptive statistics will also be presented for the percentages of subjects by treatment group 
with success at each secondary and tertiary endpoint, and for each sign or symptom of 
otomycosis in the study ear at each evaluation . Descriptive statistics will include the number 
and percentage of subjects in each category.  
In Enrollment A in cases of bilateral otomycosis, the ear with the worse infection at 
Screening/Baseline, as assessed by the investigator by taking into account both clinical signs 
and sympto ms and fungal culture results, will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If 
both ears are determined by the investigator to have the same degree of infection at 
Screening/Baseline, the left ear will be used as the study ear for the purposes of e fficacy 
analyses.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, p ercentages of subjects with therapeutic cure at the Test of 
Cure Visit will be compared using a chi-square test with a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05. 
Comparisons will be conducted in a similar  manner  between the miconazole oil and vehicle oil

groups for the secondary endpoints of clinical cure and mycological cure.  Missing data will be 
imputed as treatment failures for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses ; missing data 
otherwise will not  be imputed . 
The primary population for efficacy analyses will be the MITT population, defined as all 
subjects who were randomized  with a positive fungal culture  at Screening/ Baseline . 
Two safety  population s will be used  for safety analyses . The first will be the Randomization 
Period safety population, defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug 
and had at least one post -Baseline safety assessment  during the Randomization Period ; this 
population w ill be used for safety data for the Randomization Period . The second will be the 
Open Label safety population, defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of 
miconazole oil and had at least one post -Baseline safety assessment  during the Optional  
Open -label Extension or Enrollment B ; this population will be used for safety data for the 
Optional Open -label Extension and Enrollment B.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the 
Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported TEAEs, defined as any AE 
with an onset on or after the date of first study drug application, will be summarized. 
Summaries will provide the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, 
preferred term , severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity 
or relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ 
class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, re spectively, 
within each category. All reported serious AEs ( SAEs ) will be summarized by the number of 
subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to 
study drug.  Descriptive statistics will be presented for a ll safety data.  
Sample Size:  
For the Randomization Period of Enrollment A , approximately 128 subjects (~64 in each 
group) are required to provide 80% power, using a chi-square test with a 2 -sided significance 
level of 0.05 , assuming a response rate for the primary efficacy endpoint of 25.0% in the 
miconazole oil group and 7.1% in the vehicle oil group.  
The sample size of 220 subjects for Enrollment A assumes that ~58% of subjects enrolled into 
Enrollment A  will have a posi tive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and will therefore be 
included in the MITT population. Th is number may be higher or lower depending on the 
percentage of subjects eligible to be included in the MITT population . 
The overall study sample size of ~39 0 subjects is the total number of study subjects estimated 
to achieve at least 300 subjects exposed to miconazole oil for 14 days  who are evaluable for 
safety . A higher or lower number of total subjects may be enrolled in order to achieve the 
required tota l numbers of subjects for each of Enrollment A  and Enrollment B .

Page 17 of 88 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Miconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent that has been available by prescription and over the 
counter  (OTC) , in different formulations, for many years. It is commonly used for different types 
of fungal skin infections, such as Candida , ringworm, jock itch, athlete’s foot, nail fungus, 
vagin al yeast infections, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Formulations containing up to 4% 
miconazole nitrate have been approved for OTC use as topical antifungal agents in cream, 
ointment, powder, or gel dosage forms.  The 2% formulation is commonly used for 
dermatophytic infections.  
While antifungal agents including miconazole are used in practice for the treatment of fungal 
otitis externa (also called otomycosis), there are currently no treatments approved by the United 
States  (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  for this indication in humans . Miconazole is 
currently FDA -approved as a component of two veterinary combination products (Surolan and 
Easotic ) administered otically to dogs  for the treatment of canine otitis externa caused by 
susceptible strains of yeast and bacteria . Each veterinary product contains miconazole in 
combination with an antibacterial agent and a corticosteroid. The concentration of miconazole 
present in Surolan (23 mg/mL miconazole nitrate) is similar to the 2% concentration of 
miconazo le planned for use in humans in this study. The concentration of miconazole present in 
Easotic is 15.1 mg/mL miconazole nitrate, which equates to approximately 1.5% miconazole.  
While the causative organism of canine otitis externa, Malassezia pachydermatis , is not typically 
associated with human otomycosis in the US, it is expected that human otomycosis, which is 
most commonly associated with organisms from the Candida  and Aspergillus  genera, would 
respond to concentrations of miconazole similar to those us ed in dogs.  
The mechanisms of action of miconazole when used topically for the treatment of fungal 
infections involve its actions against the fungal organisms, rather than the ir human  host. 
Miconazole targets  the cytochrome P450 -dependent enzyme 14 -α-stero l demethylase, an enzyme 
that is also involved in mammalian cholesterol synthesis, resulting in inhibition of ergosterol 
biosynthesis in the cell membrane. Because ergosterol is an important component of the cell 
membrane, inhibition of its synthesis inhib its fungal cell growth [Vandenbosch 2012].  In 
addition to its activity toward the enzyme 14 -α-sterol demethylase, miconazole also leads to 
increased reactive oxygen species in  fungal  organisms, which appears to result in fungicidal 
activity [Vandenbosch 2010; Musaji 2010].  
The mechanisms of action of miconazole against fungi in general appear to be applicable to 
fungi associated with otomycosis . Data from a recently -completed Phase 2 study of the 
investigational product ( 2% miconazole oil ; Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc. Study HD -MCZ -PHII -
DRF062016 ) demonstrated 25.0% of subjects with therapeutic cure, defined as a negative fungal 
culture plus the absence of each of the otomycosis signs and symptoms of pruritus, debris, fungal 
elements, and pain, compared with 7.1% of subjects treated with control product (vehicle oil), at 
the final test of cure study visit , following a 14 -day treatment regimen . The percentage of 
subjects with therapeutic cur e following a 7 -day treatment regimen was 8.3%, supporting the 
14-day treatment duration for miconazole.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 18 of 88 Clinical studies of 2% miconazole conducted outside of the United States also suggest the 
efficacy of miconazole in the treatment of human otomycosis [ Kiakojuri 2007; Vennewald 2010; 
Navaneethan 2015].  In vitro  studies of miconazole have also demonstrated activity  of 
miconazole  against some clinical isolates of fungi associated with human otomycosis  in the US  
[Bass iouny 1986; Stern  1988] .  
Adverse event (AE) data from the recently -completed Phase 2 study of the investigational study 
support the  acceptable  safety of miconazole oil and generally demonstrated a lower percentage 
of patients with treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) in each of the  miconazole oil gro ups (which 
were treated for either 7 or 14 days)  compared with the vehicle oil group (which was treated for 
14 days). The most frequently reported TEAEs in the 14 -day miconazole oil group in the Phase 2 
study were application site pruritus, application sit e pain, and ear infection  fungal  (Table 1). In 
each case except for ear infection fungal, a higher percentage of subjects in the 14 -day vehicle 
oil group  compared with the 14 -day miconazole oil group  reported the TEAE. Similar results 
were observed for the 7 -day miconazole oil group , although  a higher percentage of subjects in 
the 7 -day miconazole oil group had the TEAE of application site infection compar ed with the 14 -
day miconazole oil and 14 -day vehicle oil groups.

No serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in the Phase 2 study. AEs leading to discontinuation in the 
Phase 2 study were observed in a higher percentage of subjects in the 14 -day vehicle oil group 
compared with either the 14 -day miconazole oil or 7 -day miconazol e oil group, providing further 
evidence of an acceptable safety profile for miconazole oil  (Table 2).

1.2 Study Purpose  
The purpose of th is study  is to gather confirmatory  data on the efficacy and safety of 2% 
miconazole oil after topical otic administration  in subjects with otomycosis. During the 
Randomiz ation  Period of the Enrollment A  portion of the study, a  14-day regimen of twice -daily 
administration of 2% miconazole oil will be compared with the same treatment regimen using 
the product vehicle. During t he Optional Open -label Extension  of the Enrollment A portion and 
the Enrollment B portion  of the study, a 14 -day regimen of twice -daily administration of 2% 
miconazole oil will be administered in an open -label fashion in order to gather safety information 
in additional subject s. 
1.3 Inclusion of Subjects with Peanut Allergy  
Miconazole oil contains refined peanut oil. Inclusion in this study of subjects with peanut allergy 
is justified by studies and publications documenting safe use of the refined peanut oil, a s well as 
products containing the refined peanut oil (such as DermOtic, which is the same product as the 
Derma -Smoothe/FS for which two safety studies were performed in subjects with known 
hypersensitivity to peanuts) [Yunginger 2001; Paller 2003]. Reports  also exist of subjects with 
known peanut allergy who have continued to safely use products such as Derma -Smoothe/FS 
even after an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts [Paller 2003]. The refined peanut oil used in the 
Derma -Smoothe/FS, DermOtic, and miconazole  oil products has been treated to remove the 
peanut proteins which are generally responsible for allergic reactions to peanuts. Thus, the 
inclusion of subjects with peanut allergy in this study is not expected to pose an excessive risk to 
these subjects.

a. Subjects must meet all eligibility criteria in Section 4.1 to be randomized  in Enrollment A . 
b. Subject must have a visual presence of fungal elements  to be enrolled in the Optional Open -label Extension . 
c. Subject must meet all eligibility criteria in Section 4.2 to receive treatment with miconazole oil  in Enrollment  B. 
3.1 Enrollment A  
The study will start with Enrollment A , in which an estimated 220 male or female subjects with 
otomycosis will receive study drug, although this number may be higher or lower depending on 
the percentage of subjects eligible to be included in the modified intent -to-treat ( MITT ) 
populatio n (see Section 10.4.2 ). Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
miconazole oil or vehicle, for 14  days. The study drug will be administered as 5  drops per ear at 
~30 mg per drop instilled into the external ear canal of the ear(s) affected by otomycosis.

Page 22 of 88 3.1.1  Randomization Period  
During the Randomization Period, both the subject and the investigator and stu dy staff will be 
blinded as to the contents of the study drug.  
At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment of 
the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of 
fungal elements, and aural fullness), and an evaluation of medical history. Urine will be obtained 
for pregnancy screening in female subjects of childbearing potenti al. Prior and concomitant 
medications will be reported. Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of otomycosis and who 
meet all other eligibility criteria will be entered into the study. A fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s) will be taken, then debris w ill be cleaned from the affected ear(s) following the site’s 
normal procedures. The subject will be randomized, and study drug will be weighed and 
dispensed to the subject along with a subject diary.  The subject will then begin treatment with 
study drug. T he subject or caregiver will instill the first dose of study drug at the site, under the 
supervision of the investigator or site personnel. Adverse events (AEs) will then be assessed. The 
subject will then leave the clinic and continue to administer the st udy drug  and to complete the 
subject diary  twice per day as instructed. Subjects will be instructed to avoid getting water in the 
ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by using a blow dryer, and to place a Vaseline -
impregnated cotton ball over  the affected ear(s) to help keep water out of the ear while bathing or 
showering.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8 for the On Treatment Visit, at which time a clinical 
evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a cleaning of the affect ed ear(s) (following 
the site’s normal procedures), a review of the subject diary, and an assessment of AEs and 
concomitant medications will be performed. Subjects will continue to administer the study drug 
and to complete the subject diary twice per day, up through Day 14, following the same 
instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15 for the End of Treatment Visit, at which time a 
clinical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otom ycosis and a fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s) will be performed ; however, a fungal culture will not be required at this visit for subjects 
known to have a negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline , as assessed after at least 14 days 
of incubation by the clinical laboratory performing the fungal culture . AEs and concomitant 
medications will also be assessed, and the subject will return all unused study drug  along with 
the completed subject diary .  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 22 for the  Test of Cure Visit, at which time an 
assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of otomycosis and a fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s) will be performed ; however, a fungal culture will not be required at this visit for subjects 
known to have a negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline , as assessed after at least 14 days 
of incubation by the clinical laboratory performing the fungal culture . AEs and concomitant 
medications will also be assessed. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of 
childbearing potential.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 23 of 88 Efficacy assessments will include fungal culture of the affected ear(s) , and assessments of 
clinical signs and symptoms of otomycosis. In cases of bilateral otomycosis, both ears will be 
treated and evaluated by the investigator, but o nly 1 ear will be used as the study ear for efficacy 
analyses , the designation of which will be performed at the end of the study in accordance with 
the following. If only 1 ear has a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline, that ear will be 
used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears have a positive fungal culture at 
Screening/Baseline, the ear with the worse infection at Screening/Baseline, as assessed by the 
investigator by taking into account the clinical signs and symptoms  of otomyc osis, will be used 
as the study ear for efficacy analyses . If both ears have a positive fungal culture and are 
determined by the investigator to have the same degree of infection at Screening/Baseline, the 
left ear will be used as the study ear for the pur poses of efficacy analyses . 
Safety assessments will include AE s. 
3.1.2  Optional Open -label Extension  
Subjects who either complete the Randomization Period  of the study (up through the Test of 
Cure Visit), or who are prematurely discontinued from study treatment during the 
Randomization Period  due to worsening of signs and/or symptoms of otomycosis in the 
judgment of the investigator, will be offered the opportunity to participate in an optional open -
label  extension , if they have a visual presence of fungal elements in at least one ear treated 
during the Randomization Period . Only the ear(s) that were treated in the Randomization Period 
will be potentially eligible for treatment during the Optional Open -label Extension . 
All subjects in the Optional Open -label Extension  will receive miconazole oil for 14 days.  No 
unblinding of the subject’s treatment in the Randomization Period will occur at this time.  
Before a subject enters the Optional Open -label Extension , all procedur es for the Test of Cure 
Visit will be completed for that subject ; however, a fungal culture will not be required at this 
visit for subjects known to have a negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline, as assessed after 
at least 14 days of incubation by t he clinical laboratory performing the fungal culture .  
At the first visit of the Optional Open -label Extension  (Day OLE 1, which will occur while the 
subject is already onsite for the Test of Cure or Early Termination Visit from the Randomization 
Period ), study drug (miconazole oil) will be weighed and dispensed to the subject along with a 
subject diary. Subjects or their caregivers will administer the first dose of miconazole oil  at the 
site. AEs and concomitant medications will then be assessed. Subjects w ill then continue to 
administer miconazole oil  and to complete the subject diary twice per day for a total of 14 days, 
following the same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day OLE 15 for the End of Treatment Visit , at which time a 
clinical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis will be performed, as well as an 
assessment of AEs and concomitant medications. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in 
women of childbearing poten tial. The subject will return all unused miconazole oil  along with 
the completed subject diary . 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 24 of 88 The purpose of the Optional Open -label Extension  is safety  and to provide supportive evidence 
of efficacy . Efficacy assessments will include assessments of clin ical signs and symptoms of 
otomycosis. Safety assessments will include AEs.  
3.1.3  Timing of Analysis for Enrollment A  
Data for Enrollment A will be unblinded after all subjects p lanned for  Enrollment A have 
completed both the Randomization Period and the Optiona l Open -label Extension, so that 
analyses from Enrollment A can be conducted even if Enrollment B is still ongoing (i.e., before 
the conclusion of Enrollment B).  
3.2 Enrollment B  
Enrollment B may be initiated while Enrollment A is still actively enrolling subjects.  An 
estimated 170 male or female subjects will receive study drug  (miconazole oil)  in Enrollment B , 
although this number may be higher or lower depending on the total number of subjects needed 
to achieve at least 300 subjects who are exp osed to miconazole oil for 14 days in the study 
overall  who are evaluable for safety .  
At Screening/Baseline (Day B1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examin ation and an evaluation 
of medical history. Urine will be obtained for pregnancy screening in female subjects of 
childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant medications will be reported. Subjects who meet 
all eligibility criteria will be entered into the  study. Study drug will be weighed and dispensed to 
the subject along with a subject diary. The subject will then begin treatment with miconazole oil . 
In subjects who do not have otomycosis, treatment will be in the left ear if both ears are 
otherwise elig ible; if only one ear is eligible, treatment will be in that ear. In subjects who have 
otomycosis (i.e., any signs and/or symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis in 
the judgment of the investigator), treatment will preferably be in the ear(s) with otomycosis, 
provided the ear(s) meet all eligibility criteria. If both ears are judged by the investigator to have 
otomycosis and both meet all eligibility criteria, both ears may be treated.  The subject or 
caregiver will instill the first dose  of miconazole oil  at the site, under the supervision of the 
investigator or site personnel. AEs will then be assessed. The subject will then leave the clinic 
and continue to administer miconazole oil  and to complete the subject diary twice per day , 
follow ing the same instructions for miconazole oil  administration as in Enrollment A . 
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day B15 for the End of Treatment Visit, at which time AEs 
and concomitant medications will be assessed. Subjects will return all unused miconazole oil  
along with the completed subject diary . A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of 
childbearing potential.  
Safety assessments will include AEs.  
3.3 Timing of Subject Recruitment Into Enrollment A and Enrollment B  
The study will start wit h Enrollment A, which will continue until the sponsor determines that a 
sufficient number of subjects (see Section 3.4) has been recruited to conduct the planned 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 25 of 88 analyses for Enrollment A, at which time the sponsor (or designee) will notify all study sites to 
terminate further enrollment into the Enrollment A portion of the study.  
Recruitment of subjects into Enrollment B will begin when the sponsor (or designee) noti fies 
sites to begin recruiting subjects into Enrollment B, and will end when the sponsor (or designee) 
notifies study sites to pause or permanently terminate recruitment of subjects into Enrollment B. 
Enrollment B may occur over one or multiple time period s, each of which will begin and then 
pause (or permanently end) upon sponsor (or designee) notification to the study sites. The 
purpose of this mechanism is to allow concurrent enrollment of Enrollment A and Enrollment B 
at times (such as during the winter time) when recruitment into Enrollment A is likely to be 
diminished due to a lower expected incidence of otomycosis, while also allowing the sponsor the 
flexibility to pause or permanently terminate recruitment into Enrollment B for reasons including 
(but not limited to) time periods during which a higher incidence of otomycosis is expected (at 
which times the sponsor may wish for the focus of the study to be on recruitment of subjects into 
Enrollment A), or evaluation by the sponsor of the number of subjec ts still needed for 
Enrollment B (see Section 3.4).  
At times when Enrollment A and Enrollment B are concurrently ongoing, if a subject is found to 
be eligible for bo th Enrollment A and Enrollment B, the subject should be enrolled into 
Enrollment A whenever possible.  
3.4 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 390 total subjects are estimated to be enrolled into the study  (~220 subjects 
estimated  for Enrollment A and ~170 subjects estimated  for Enrollment B ) as described in 
Section 3.4.1  for Enrollment A  and in Section 3.4.2  for Enrollment B . 
3.4.1  Enrollment A  
An estimated 220 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled in Enrollment A in order to achieve 
at least 128 evaluable subjects (i.e., included in the MITT population, defined as those who were  
randomized with a positive fungal culture  at Screening/ Baseline ). The number of subjects who 
are enrolled may be higher or lower than 220 depending on the percentage of subjects eligible to 
be included in the MITT population ; enrollment in Enrollment A  will continue until the required 
numbers of subjects have been achieved . 
3.4.2  Enrollment B  
An estimated 170 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled in order to achieve at least 300 total 
subjects in the study (including both Enrollment A and Enrollment B ) who are exposed to 
miconazole oil for 14 days  who are evaluable for safety . This number has been estimated on the 
basis of the following assumptions:  
• A total of 220 subjects will be enrolled into the Randomization Period  of Enrollment A , with 
110 subjects exposed to active treatment with miconazole oil ( on the basis of the 1:1 
randomization  for the Randomization Period ), and 110 subjects exposed to the vehicle 
treatment:  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 26 of 88 • Of the 110 subjects exposed to active treatment  (miconazole oil)  in the Randomization 
Period , ~90% (100 subjects) will complete the full 14 days of treatment , with the 
remaining ~10% (10 subjects) completing less than the 14 -day treatment course  
• Of the 110 subjects exposed to vehicle treatment in the Rando mization Period , ~50% (55 
subjects) will opt to participate in the Optional Open -label Extension  of Enrollment A , 
with the other ~50% (55 subjects) concluding participation in the study  
• Of the 55 subjects exposed to miconazole oil  treatment in the Optional  Open -label Extension , 
~90% (50 subjects) will complete the full 14 days of treatment , with the remaining ~10% (5 
subjects) completing less than the 14 -day treatment course  
• On the basis of these assumptions, ~150 subjects will have been exposed to miconazo le oil 
for the full 14-day treatment during Enrollment A (100 subjects during the Randomization 
Period and 50 subjects during the Optional Open -label Extension), and an additional  ~150 
subjects exposed to miconazole oil for the full 14 -day treatment will be needed to achieve the 
≥300 total subjects required  to be exposed to miconazole oil for the full 14 -day treatment  
• Assuming ~90% of subjects enrolled into Enrollment B complete the full 14 days of open -
label  treatment with miconazole oi l, ~170 subjects will be required to be enrolled in 
Enrollment B in order to achieve ~150 subjects who complete the full 14 -day treatment with 
miconazole oil  
• Therefore , ~150 subjects from Enrollment A and ~150 subjects from Enrollment B are 
estimated to be  needed for at least 300 total subjects in the study who are exposed to 
miconazole oil for a full 14 days.  
The actual number of subjects enrolled into Enrollment B may therefore be higher or lower than 
170 depending on the accuracy of the assumptions as st ated above , including the number of 
subjects who have completed a full 14 days of treatment with miconazole oil in Enrollment A as 
well as in Enrollment B . Enrollment will continue in to Enrollment B  until the required number of 
subjects exposed to miconazo le oil for 14 days and evaluable for safety has been achieved .  
3.5 Investigators  
The study will be conducted at up to 20 investigative site s located in the US.  
The study will be conducted by investigator s who are determined by the sponsor to be suitably 
quali fied by training and experience to conduct this study in compliance with all applicable GCP 
and FDA federal regulations or local regulations. Sub -investigators will be identified on the 
Form FDA 1572.

  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 27 of 88 During Enrollment A , the study duration  for a subject who parti cipates only in the 
Randomization Period  of the study will be up to 31 days, which includes up to 1 day for 
screening (if screening procedures need to be initiated  the day before treatment), 14 days for 
treatment, and 8 days of follow -up, including the vis it window of up to 8 additional days after 
the scheduled day to complete the final Test of Cure Visit. 
The study duration for each subject who participates in both the Randomization  Period  and 
Optional Open -label  Extension  will be up to approximately 48 days, which includes up to 31 
days for the Randomization  Period  followed by up to 1 7 days for the Optional Open -label 
Extension  (which includes a visit window of up to 3 additional days after the 14 -day treatment to 
complete the final study visit) . This study duration takes into account that the Day OLE1 
procedures will occur while the subject is already onsite for the Test of Cure or Early 
Termination Visit for the Randomization Period.

Page 33 of 88 4.3 Subject Discontinuation  
A subject MAY  be withdrawn from the study (at the discretion of the investigator, sponsor, 
and/or IRB) p rior to study completion for any of the following reasons , including, but not limited 
to: 
• A serious adverse event (SAE) occurring during the course of the study which precludes 
continued follow -up 
• Intercurrent illness which may, in the investigator’s opinion, significantly affect study 
assessments  
• Failure to follow required study procedures  
• For subjects participating in Enrollment A , a negative fungal culture  at Screening/Baseline 
(as assessed after at least 14 days of incubation by the clinical laboratory performing the 
fungal cultures)  
A subject MUST be discontinued prior to the final study visit for any of the following reasons:  
• Whenever the subject decides it is in his/her best interest to withdraw  
• Whenever the investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to be withdrawn  
Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject, schedule a 
final study visit, and obtain as  much follow -up data as possible. If possible, the assessment 
schedule for the Test of Cure V isit (Randomization Period ) or the End of Treatment Visit 
(Optional Open -label Extension  or Enrollment B ) should be performed , and an effort should be 
made to coll ect all study drug . A fungal culture is not required for subjects who are prematurely 
discontinued from the study.  
For Enrollment A , due to the time required to obtain fungal culture results  from 
Screening/Baseline , subjects will be enrolled into the study  based on a clinical diagnosis of 
otomycosis  (including  the visible presence of fungal elements at Screening/Bas eline), without a 
requirement for a positive fungal culture. Subjects who end up with a negative  
Screening/B aseline  fungal culture are not requi red to  be discontinued from the study, but these 
subjects will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis . Because the sponsor’s goal is to 
have  at least 128 subje cts in the MITT population (see Section 10.4.2 ), the total number of 
subjects enrolled into  Enrollment A  may be higher or lower than 220, depending on the 
percentage of subjects who are eligible to be incl uded in the MITT population.  
Subject discontinuations will be documented clearly on the applicable electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced , but additional subjects 
may be enrolled and randomized into Enrollment A  if it appears that the estimated number of 
subjects  for Enrollment A  (approximately 220) is insufficient to meet the sponsor’s goal of 
having at least 128 subjects in the MITT population . After completion of Enrollment A , 
additional subjects (i.e., exceeding the 390 subjects total for the study) may be enrolled into 
Enrollment B  if it appears that the estimated total number of study subjects is insufficient to 
achieve at least 300 subjects who have been exposed to miconazole oil for 14 days  who are 
evaluable for safety .

Page 34 of 88 4.4 Subjects Lost to Follow -up 
An effort must be made to contact s ubjects who do not retur n for scheduled visits, to schedule 
the visit and/or obtain as much follow -up data as possible. At least t hree telephone calls  and one 
certified letter  must be placed to the subject  after the first missed visit, to attempt to get the 
subject to complete the visit  and to gather as much follow -up data as possible , before a subject 
may be considered lost to follow -up and discontinue d from the study . Subjects who miss a visit 
may still be scheduled for a subsequent visit . 
All follow -up attempts will be documented and kept with the subject’s source documentation, 
and the applicable eCRFs will be completed. The date a subject will be co nsidered lost to follow -
up will be the date of the last non -missing visit.  
5 CONCOMITANT THERAPIES  
All concomitant therapies must be recorded on the eCRF.  
Every effort should be made to keep concomitant therapy and dosing constant during the study. 
Any changes in concomitant therapies during the study must  be recorded on the eCRF  at each 
visit. The reason for any change in concomitant therapies should be rep orted as, or in 
conjunction with, an AE except as noted below:  
• Prophylactic therapies, such as vaccines  or prophylactic analgesics , must be recorded on the 
eCRF  but should not be reported as AEs.  
• Changes in therapy for pre -existing conditions that are no t related to a worsening of the 
condition must be reported on the eCRF  but should not be reported as AEs. The condition 
must be reported on the eCRF as part of the subject’s medical history.   
5.1 Enrollment A  
In addition to a ll concomitant therapies , all therapies within 3 months  prior to Day 1  must also be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
5.1.1  Permitted Medications  
Therapies (medication and non -medication therapies) not restricted by the protocol may be used 
during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health. Vitamins 
and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator as reasonable 
for maintaining good health. Non -prohibited chronic therapies being used at Screening /Baseline  
may be continued.  
Oral analges ic medications such as non -steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  or 
acetaminophen are permitted . Such medications may be helpful for the management of pain 
caused by otomycosis and/or study procedures such as ear cleaning and administration of study 
drug.

Page 35 of 88 5.1.2  Prohibited Medications  
Other than the study drug, no other topical medications  (including but not limited to antibiotics, 
alcohol, boric acid, peroxide, and/or corticosteroids)  are allowed to be used in the ear(s) being 
treated with study drug . Other prohibited treatments include systemic antifungal therapy, 
warfarin, immunosuppressive or immune -stimulating drugs, and systemic steroids.  A subject 
who discontinues study drug during the Randomization Period and who subsequently uses a 
topical corticosteroid (e.g., to treat  an AE such as itching) in the ear(s) that were treated with 
study drug during the Randomization Period will be eligibl e for the Optional Open -label 
Extension if the topical corticosteroid is discontinued in the ear(s) that will be treated with study 
drug before the start of study drug in the Optional Open -label Extension , and as long as  the 
subject meets all other eligibi lity criteria  for the Optional Open -label Extension . 
5.2 Enrollment B  
In addition to a ll concomitant therapies , all therapies within 28 days prior to Day B1 must also be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
5.2.1  Permitted Medications  
Therapies (medication and non -medication thera pies) not restricted by the protocol may be used 
during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health. Vitamins 
and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator as reasonable 
for maintaining good health. Non -prohibited chronic therapies being used at Screening/Baseline 
may be continued.  
Oral analgesic medications such as NSAIDs  or acetaminophen are permitted.  
5.2.2  Prohibited Medications  
Prohibited treatments include systemic antifungal therapy and warfarin.

Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 42 of 88 window but that are intended to fulfill scheduled visit requirements will be collected and 
transcribed to the appropriate scheduled visit eCRF.  
If a subject is seen for multiple visits during a given visit time frame, the dat a from the visit(s) 
that are intended to meet the protocol requirements for the scheduled visit should be captured on 
the visit eCRF. Any other data from any additional visits within a scheduled visit interval will be 
captured elsewhere on the eCRF.  
6.5 Post -study Follow -up 
Subjects who require further follow -up for an AE will be followed according to Section 8.4. If a 
subject requires further follow -up of AEs upon discontinuation or completion of the study, the 
investigator should schedule post -study follow -up visits, as necessary.  
6.6 Missed Visits  
If a subject misses any scheduled follow -up visit and cannot be seen prior to the start of the visit 
range for the next scheduled follow -up visit, the visit is considered missed.  
6.7 Subject Completion  
The subject has completed the study when the Test of Cure Visi t is completed  (Randomization 
Period  of Enrollment A ), or when the End of Treatment Visit is completed (Open -label 
Extension of Enrollment A or Enrollment B ). Subjects who require further follow -up for an AE 
will be followed according to Section 8.4. 
6.8 Early Study Termination  
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate this study prematurely. If during the study it becomes 
evident to the sponsor that t he study should be stopped prematurely, the study will be terminated 
and appropriate notification will be given to the investigator, IRB, and FDA, as applicable. The 
sponsor or designee will instruct the investigator to stop screening/enrolling subjects , to bring all 
subjects who remain in the study ( for example, subjects who are currently  receiving treatment or 
who have completed treatment but have not yet completed the Test of Cure Visit  in the 
Randomization Period, or subjects who have not completed the End of Treatment Visit in the 
Optional Open -label Extension or in Enrollment B ) in for a final study visit as soon as possible, 
and to arrange for study closeout at the site.  
7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The required study procedures are detailed in this section. The timeline for these procedures is 
presented in Section 6. 
7.1 Medical/Medication History  
At Screening /Baseline , the investigator or designee will interview each subject and obtain a 
complete medical  and medication  history, including a history of all su rgeries and past medical 
procedures . The subject must not require any treatment or medication for concurrent illnesses as 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 43 of 88 specified by the inclusion and exclusion criteria or anticipate the need for any excluded 
concomitant medications.  
7.2 Physical Examinatio n 
At Screening /Baseline , the investigator or designee will perform a physical examination to 
include the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, throat; neck; cardiovascular; 
lungs; abdomen; lymph nodes; extremities; neurological; skin; musc uloskeletal ; and body 
temperature . For subjects participating in Enrollment B , a physical examination of the treated  
ear(s) will also be performed at the End of Treatment Visit; a more extensive physical 
examination is not required for these subjects at th e End of Treatment Visit but may be 
performed if necessary in the judgment of the investigator (e.g., to support evaluation of an AE).  
7.3 Urine Pregnancy Test  
The urine pregnancy test (performed in females of childbearing potential only) must have a 
minimum s ensitivity of 25  mIU of β -hCG/mL of urine.  
7.4 Otomycosis Signs and Symptoms  
The signs and symptoms of otomycosis will be assessed according to the scales for pruritus (see 
Section 7.4.1 ), debris (see Section 7.4.2 ), presence of fungal elements (see Section 7.4.3 ), and 
aural fullness  (see Section 7.4.4 ). The same evaluator should assess each subject for signs and 
symptoms of otomycosis at each visit throughout the subject’s participation in the study, if 
possible.  
7.4.1  Pruritus  
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked by the 
investigator (or designee) about the severity of itching present in each ear being treated with 
study drug. Questions such as the following will be used in order to gather information for this 
assessment:  
“Over the last 24 hours, h ave you had itching in yo ur ear?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, has your itching interfered with your daily activities?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, has your itching been bad enough to keep you awake?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, would you describe your itching as intolerable or constant?”  
The investigator will then score the symptom of pruritus for each ear being treated with study 
drug, taking into consideration the subject’s and/or caregiver’s answers and the investigator’s 
observations of the subject. Scores will be according to the follo wing scale:  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 44 of 88 Score  Category  Description  
0 None  No itching  
1 Mild  Occasional itch, not interfering with daily activities  
2 Moderate  Fairly persistent itch, partially tolerated; sleep is not interrupted  
3 Severe  Intolerable, constant itch; sleep is interrupted  
7.4.2  Debris  
Upon otoscopic examination, the investigator will score the amount of debris present in each ear 
being treated with study drug . Scores will be  according to the following scale:  
Score  Category  Description  
0 None  No debris present  
1 Scant  Debris minimally present, but with no notable occlusion of external ear 
canal  
2 Moderate  Debris present with partial occlusion of external ear canal; tympanic 
membrane can be visualized  
3 Heavy  Complete occlusion of ear canal; tympanic membrane can not be 
visualized  
7.4.3  Presence of Fungal Elements  
Upon otoscopic examination, the investigator will assess t he presence of fungal elements in each 
ear being treated with study drug . Scores will be  according to the following scale:  
Score  Category  Description  
0 Absent  No fungal elements present on visual inspection with otoscope  
1 Present  Fungal elements present on visual inspection with otoscope , such as 
visualization of white filaments in debris; black, gray, bluish, yellow, 
or white discharge; white debris with hyphae; or moist white plugs 
with black debris; or other observations that in the investigator’s 
judgment are indicative of the presence of fungus  
7.4.4  Aural Fullness  
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age o f the subject) will be asked by the 
investigator (or designee) whether aural fullness is present in each ear being treated with study 
drug. Questions such as the following will be used in order to gather information for this 
assessment:  
“Over the last 24 h ours, h ave you had a feeling of fullness in your ear ?” 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 45 of 88 “Over the last 24 hours, has a feeling of fullness  in your ear  interfered with your daily 
activities?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, has a feeling of fullness  in your ear  been bad enough to keep you 
awake?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, would you describe a feeling of fullness  in your ear  as intolerable?”  
The investigator will then score the symptom of aural fullness for each ear being treated with 
study drug, taking into consideration the subject’s and/or caregiver’s answers and the 
investigator’s observations of the subject. Scores will be according to the following scale:  
Score  Category  Description  
0 None  Not present  
1 Mild  Present but not affecting daily activities  
2 Moderate  Present and affecting daily activities  but tolerable  
3 Severe  Intolerable and severely disrupting daily activities; sleep is 
interrupted  
7.5 Fungal  Culture  
At designated visits, the investigator or designee will obtain a sample from the external ear to be 
sent to a central laboratory for fungal culture. Techniques for obtaining and handling the sample 
and sending it to the laboratory will be described in a se parate laboratory manual.  If both ears 
will be treated with study drug, both ears will be cultured.  
The central laboratory will grow and identify fungal organisms  from the sample provided by the 
investigator. The central laboratory will also test the susce ptibility of the fungal isolates to 
miconazole.  
7.6 Ear Cleaning  
At designated visits, the investigator or designee will clean the ear(s) that are being/have been 
treated with study drug, according to the site’s normal procedures. Ear(s)  being treated  will be 
cleaned  at the designated visits  even if they appear clear of debris . In cases in which the 
investigator would normally not clean the ear because it appears to be clear, this  cleaning may be 
minimal . All ear cleaning will be documented in the eCRF.  
7.7 Adverse  Even t Evaluations  
See Section 8. 
7.8 Randomization  
See Section 9.2.

Page 46 of 88 7.9 Study Drug Administration  
See Section 9.1.1 . 
7.10 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects or their caregivers  (as appropriate)  will complete a diary documenting  each study drug 
administration.  Additionally, each bottle of study drug will be weighed by the investigator or 
designee before dispensation  to the subject  and at each visit in which the used bottle  is brought to 
the site . 
7.11 Protocol Deviations  
The IRB -approved protocol must be followed except in the case of a change that is intended to 
eliminate an immediate risk to subjects.  
The date of, nature of, and reason for deviations will be documented and explained by the 
investigator in all cases. Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the safety of the 
subject or the integrity of the study must be reported by the investigator to  the sponsor and/or its 
designee and to  the IRB immediately. Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to 
the requirements of the governing IRB.  
All changes to the pr otocol will be made by the sponsor or designee as an approved amendment 
to the protocol, submitted to the FDA, and approved by the IRB prior to implementation. New or 
altered consent forms required by the IRB due to a protocol revision must be signed by al l 
subjects currently enrolled in the study and must be used for any subsequent subject enrollment.  
8 ADVERSE EVENT S 
8.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a study drug  and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (inc luding a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of an investigational or marketed study drug, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational or marketed study drug. AEs include any illness, sign, or symptom that has 
appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to 
the study drug. Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator 
product.  
Medical cond itions/diseases present before signing the informed consent form are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after the informed consent form is signed.  
AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a 
subject. At each  examination or visit, study personnel will ask each subject the following 
question, “Have you  had any problems since we last spoke?”  If known, the investigator should 
report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual s ymptoms.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 47 of 88 The worsening or reoccurrence  as compared to any previous visit  in a subject of any symptom of 
otomycosis (including any increase in numerical score for pruritus and /or aural fullness 
according to the scales presented in Section 7.4, and/or any other symptom of otomycosis that 
worsens but is not captured in the scales presented in Section 7.4) should be reported as an AE . 
The diagnosis of the underlying disease or disorder should be reported as the AE, if known. For 
example, i f the worsening symptom is believed to be due to otomycosis, the AE should be 
reported as “wo rsening of disease under study.” If the worsening symptom is believed to be due 
to some other cause  (such as bacterial infection) , that underlying illness or disorder should be 
reported as the AE.  
Debris and fungal elements are considered signs ( manifestation s) of otomycosis  and minor 
changes are expected as a natural progression of the disease; therefore, minor changes in debris 
and fungal elements scores may not necessarily be captured as AEs if the changes are not 
clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator. If, however, in the investigator’s 
judgment there is a clinically significant worsening of debris and /or fungal elements , an AE of 
“worsening of disease under study ” should  be recorded.  
8.1.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of deat h at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment may je opardize the patient/subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above) . Examples of such events include but are not limited to : allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive tre atment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasia or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospital admission , or a 
hospitalization that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that has 
not worsened since the start of the study, is not considered an SAE.  
8.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE will be determined by the inves tigator according to the following 
definitions:  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 48 of 88 • Mild:  Awareness of event, but easily tolerated and does not disrupt  usual  activity  
• Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual  activity  
• Severe:  Incapacitating, with inability to perform usual activities  
8.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study drug will be assessed by the investigator according to the 
following definitions:  
• Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study drug makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Suspected:  The temporal relationshi p of the event to the study drug makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do 
not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for  suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “suspected.”  
If the relationship between the AE and the study drug is determined by the sponsor to be 
“suspected,” th e event will be considered to be related to the study drug for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting.  
8.4 Documentation  of Adverse Events  
All AEs must be completely recorded on the Adverse Events section of the eCRF. The collection 
of AE information will begin after the subject has signed informed consent and continue up 
through the Test of Cure Visit  (Randomization Period) or up through the End of Treatment Visit 
(Optional Open -label Extension or Enrollment B) . Subjects experiencing AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the 
end of their participation in the study or that resulted in permanent discontinuation will receive 
follow -up as appropriate until the AEs have either resolved or have stabilized.  
For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
• Onset (date);  
• Resolution (date);  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe);  
• Relationship to study drug (not suspected, suspected);  
• Action taken (none, study drug temporarily interrupted, study drug permanently 
discontinued, concomitant medication taken, hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization, 
other);  
• Serious (yes/no) ; 
• Whether the AE occurred at the study drug application site (yes/ no);

8.4.1  Additional Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur from the time the subject has signed the informed consent until the Test of 
Cure Visit  (Randomization P eriod) or up through the End of Treatment Visit (Optional Open -
label Extension or Enrollment B) will be reported. Additionally, any SAEs “suspected” to be 
related to the study drug and discovered by the investigator at any time after the study should be 
reported. Each of t hese SAEs must be reported to the sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of the 
occurrence of the SAE, o r within 24 hours of learning of  the SAE . Information on recurrent 
episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must also be reported within 24 hours 
of the investigator receiving the information.  
Reporting may be  by telephone , confirmed facsimile transmission, or confirmed email  to the 
medical monitor.  The investigator must assess the relationship of the SAE to study drug and 
must complete the SAE form. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports 
are required. Follow -up information (e.g., discharge summary)  will be retained in the subject’s 
chart and a copy (with the subject’s personal information removed and with the subject identified 
only by subject number) will be sent  by confirmed facsimile transmission  or confirmed email  to 
the medical monitor . In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report (with 
the subject’s personal information removed and with the subject identified only by subject 
number) should be sent to the medical monitor . 
As required  and after the sponsor’s review and determination of causality , the sponsor and/or 
designee will notify investigators of all AEs that are serious, unexpected, and considered by the 
investigator to have a suspected  relationship to the study drug. This notification will be in the 
form of an up date to the Investigator’s Brochure (i.e., “15-day letter ”). An AE, whether serious 
or non -serious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported in the clinical safety 
section of the Investigator’s Brochure or if the event is of greater frequ ency, specificity or 
severity.  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator’s Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB according to local regulations. The in vestigator and IRB will determine if the informed 
consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for 
reporting any other safety information.  Follow -up reports should be submitted when requested or 
when pertinent info rmation becomes available.  
The sponsor will report all SAEs to the US FDA on the appropriate schedule depending on the 
event’s expectedness and relationship to study drug based on the available information as 
presented in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Any SAE occurring after the final study visit  and which is not considered to be of “suspected” 
relationship to study drug does not need to be reported.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 50 of 88 8.5 Pregnancy  
Females of childbearing potential, as defined in Section 4.1.1  (Enrollment A) and Section 4.2.1  
(Enrollment B) , must use an effective method of contraceptio n from screening up through the 
final study visit . Acceptable methods include the use of at least one of the following: 1) IUD;  2) 
hormonal contraceptives (oral, inject able, implant, or ring) ; 3) barrier  contraceptives (condom or 
diaphragm)  with spermicide ; or 4) abstinence.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form and sent by 
confirmed facsimile  or confirmed email  to the medical monitor, as well as documented in the 
eCRF. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug  
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
In the event of pregnancy that is detected during treatment with study drug, the subject must be 
withdrawn from further treatm ent with study drug.  The subject may continue to participate in the 
study on a case -by-case basis after discussion between the investigator and  the sponsor and/or 
the sponsor’s designee.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study  and/or study drug . 
8.6 Study Contacts  
Study contacts will be provided in a separate document.  
9 STUDY TREATMENTS  
9.1 Description of Study Drug  
Miconazole oil contains the active ingredient, 2% miconazole , formulated in an oil vehicle 
containing refined peanut oil, light mineral oil, oleth -2, and isopropyl myristate.  For subjects 
randomized to the vehicle oil group, the vehicle oil  will not contain miconazole and will instead 
contain a greater amount of refined peanut oil  and mineral oil  to account for the absence of the 
miconazole.  
Study drug  will be supplied in bottles containing ~20 grams of product. The dispensing tip  will 
deliver approximately 30 mg  of product per drop.  
9.1.1  Administration  
Subjects will be seated  or lying on one side with the head positioned so the ear being treated  is 
facing up . If both ears are being treated, the ear that appears to have less severe disease will be 
treated first. The subject or caregiver will gently pull the ear lobe backward and upward and 
apply 5 drops of study drug  into the ear. The subject will be instructed to keep the head 
positioned with the ear facing up  for approximately 3 to 5 minute s to allow the study drug  to coat 
the ear canal . After this time , the subject can then straighten his/her head , and excess material 
dripping out of the ear  can be gently patt ed using a clean cotton ball.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 51 of 88 If both ears are being treated, t he subject will then w ait at least 5 minutes, then repeat this 
procedure for the second  ear. 
During the Randomization Period , while on study treatment, subjects will be instructed to avoid 
getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by using a blow dryer, and 
to place a Vaseline -impregnated cotton  ball over the affected ear(s) to help keep water out of the 
ear(s) while bathing or showering.  Subjects in the Optional Op en-label Extension  and subjects in 
Enrollment B who have signs and/or symptoms of otomycosis may also be given these 
instructions.  
Subjects in both portion s will be asked  to avoid  bathing or shower ing for at least 30 minutes after 
applying study drug.  
9.2 Randomization  
For the Randomization Period , subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: 1) 
14-day treatment with miconazole oil; or 2) 14-day treatment with miconazole oil vehicle.  
Randomization is not applicable to either the Optional Open -label Extension  of Enrollment A or 
to Enrollment B . 
9.3 Blinding/Unblinding  
The contents of the study drug (miconazole oil versus vehicle) will be blinded to both the 
investigator (and all study staff) and the subject  during the Randomization Period  of Enrollment 
A. Randomized study drug will be packaged in identical bottles and will be labeled with a 
randomization number rather t han the contents of the bottle.  
If it becomes necessary to un blind  a subjec t’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
investigator should contact the sponsor. A person at the sponsor organization who is not 
otherwise involved with the study will maintain a randomization list that will enable that person 
to inform the inve stigator of the subject’s treatment allocation. The treatment allocation  is to be 
obtained only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of the medication being taken will 
influence the med ical management of the subject.  
9.4 Study Drug  Handling and Dispensing  
9.4.1  Packaging  and Labeling  
The miconazole oil  and the oil vehicle will be  manufactured, packaged and labeled by Hill 
Dermaceuticals, Inc. It will be packaged in dropper bottles, each of which will contain ~20 
grams of study drug. The dropper will dispense approximately 30 mg  per drop.  
For the Randomization Period  of Enrollment A, the study drug  and vehicle will be packaged in 
primary bottle  and provided in identical study drug kits. Each kit will contain the investigational 
drug product  (or placebo product) , reserve identical drug product  (or placebo product) , bag of 
cotton balls, and Vaseline jelly . The subject will be dispensed the kit (minus the reserve product) 
at Baseline only. The dropper bottles will be weighed with the cap on prior to dispensing. If the 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 52 of 88 subject loses a bottle  (lost or damaged), the reserve bottle  will be dispensed using a replacement 
process as defined in the randomization plan .  
For the Optional Open -label Extension  of Enrollment A  and for Enrollment B , the study drug 
will be packaged in a primary bottle that will be dispensed directly to the subject. The dropper 
bottles will be weighed with the cap on prior to dispensing.  If the subject loses a bottle (lost or 
damaged), a reserve bottle will be dispensed from the study drug inventory packaged for open -
label  use. 
Each drug kit dispensed will be documented on the drug accountability log.  
Labels on the drug kit  will contain the following information:  
• Protocol number  
• Subject number  
• Space for entry of the subject initials  
• Space for entry of date dispensed  
• A statement reading, “For otic  use only. Avoid contact with eyes and lips”  
• A statement reading, “Store at controlled room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) 
with excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F)”  
• A statement indicating the spons or, Hill Dermaceuticals  
• A statement indicating the quantity of product (20 grams ) 
• A statement reading, “Caution: New Drug - Limited by Federal Law to Investigational 
Use”  
• A statement reading, “Keep out of Reach of Children ” 
9.4.2  Storage  
The study drug is to be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C, or 68°F to 77°F), with 
excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).  All investigational study drug 
must be stored in a secure facility, with access limited to the investigator and authorize d staff.  
9.5 Accountability  
The investigator or designee (e.g, study coordinator or pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring 
storage as per the label on the study drug and adequate accountability of all used and unused 
study drug. Adequate accountability includ es acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of 
study drug (quantity and condition), records  of administration (including container number, date 
administered , subject number, and the initials of the person administering the drug), and 
documentation of qua ntities returned to the sponsor (or designee) . 
At time points during the course of the study and/or upon completion of the study, the sponsor or 
designee will review and verify the investigator's accountability records.   
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 53 of 88 9.6 Return and Destruction  
At the compl etion of the study, following verification of the investigator’s accountability records 
by the sponsor and/or designee, all study drug must be returned to the sponsor or designee.  This 
would include study drug returned by the subjects at the completion of the study , and reserve 
products that were not used . 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) Version 9.4 
or higher. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two -sided and will  be performed at the 
0.05 level of significance.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. For 
categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be 
presented. For contin uous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of subjects), 
mean, and standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  
Full details of statistical analyses will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan.  
10.1 Study Endpoints  
10.1.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit with 
“therapeutic cure” , defined as “mycological cure” plus “clinical cure”  for the study ear , at the 
end of the Randomization Period  for each subject . Mycological cure is defined as a negative 
mycological culture , and c linical cure is defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs and 
symptoms based on investigator assessment according to the scales for each individual sign or 
symptom.  See Section 7.4 for the scales for each otomycosis sign and symptom.  
10.1.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include the following  (each having been assessed at the end of 
the Randomization Period  for each subject) : 
• Percentage of subjects with mycological cure  at the Test of Cure Visit . 
• Percentage of subjects with clinical cure at the Test of Cure Visit . 
10.1.3  Tertiary Efficacy En dpoints  
Tertiary efficacy endpoints will include the following (each having been assessed at the end of 
the Randomization Period for each subject) : 
• Percentage of subjects with “modified therapeutic cure” at the Test of Cure Visit, defined 
as mycological cu re plus a score of 0 for the clinical sign of fungal elements plus a score 
of 0 or 1 for each of the clinical signs and symptoms of pruritus, debris, and aural 
fullness.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 54 of 88 • Percentage of subjects with “therapeutic improvement” at the Test of Cure Visit , defin ed 
as mycological cure plus a score of 0 or 1 for each of the clinical signs and symptoms of 
fungal elements, pruritus, debris, and aural fullness.  
10.1.4  Safety Endpoint  
A safety endpoint will be the percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) , with 
treatment -emergent defined as occurring upon or after administration of the first dose of study 
drug.  
10.2 Hypotheses  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit 
with “therapeutic cure”, defined as “mycolo gical cure”  plus “clinical cure” for the study ear. 
Mycological cure is defined as a negative mycological culture, and c linical cure is defined as the 
absence of all otomycosis signs and symptoms based on investigator assessment according to the 
scales for  each individual sign or symptom.  
Analysis is based on the following hypothesis:  
H0: pT – pV = 0  
H1: pT - pV > 0.  
where H0 is the null hypothesis, H1 the alternative hypotheses, and pT and pV are percentage of 
subjects with success in the Treatment (mic onazole oil) and Vehicle (vehicle oil) groups, 
respectively. Comparisons between groups for the difference in the percentage of subjects 
achieving the primary endpoint of therapeutic cure will be conducted using a chi -square test with 
a 2-sided significanc e level of 0.05 . 
Comparisons will also be conducted similarly between the miconazole oil and vehicle oil groups 
for the secondary endpoints of clinical cure, and mycological cure.  
10.3 Sample Size  
For the Randomization Period, a pproximately 128 subjects (~64 in  each group) are required to 
provide 80% power, using a chi-square test with a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 , assuming a 
response rate for the primary efficacy endpoint of 25.0% in the miconazole oil group and 7.1% in 
the vehicle oil group.  
The sampl e size of 220 subjects for Enrollment A assumes that ~58% of subjects enrolled into 
Enrollment A  will have a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and will therefore be 
included in the MITT population. This number may be higher or lower depending o n the 
percentage of subjects eligible to be included in the MITT population . 
The estimated sample size of 170 subjects for Enrollment B is not based on statistical 
considerations and is instead based on the achievement of at least 300 subjects who have bee n 
exposed to miconazole oil for 14 days who are evaluable for safety (see also Section 3.4.2 ). 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 55 of 88 10.4 Study Populations  
10.4.1  Intent -to-treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all subjects who were randomized . 
10.4.2  Modified Intent -to-treat Population  
The modified intent -to-treat (MITT)  population will be a subset of the ITT population. The 
MITT population will include subjects in the ITT population  with a positive fungal culture  at 
Screening/ Baseline . The MITT population will be the primary population to assess efficacy.  
10.4.3  Per Protocol Population  
The per protocol (PP) population will be a subset of the MITT population and will include all 
subjects who complete the Test of Cure visit without any major protocol violations. The PP 
population will include subjects in the MITT population who did not meet a ny of the following 
criteria:  
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Used an interfering concomitant medication  
• Did not attend the Test of Cure visit  
• Did not attend the End of Treatment visit  
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjec ts must have received 
80%-120% of the expected applications of study medication in the study ear during 
participation in the study)  
• Out of visit window at the Test of Cure Visit ( -1/+8 days)  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to an adverse event r elated to study treatment, 
documented lack of treatment effect, or wo rsening of condition will be included in the PP 
population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to 
accommodate for unforeseen events that occur red during the conduct of the trial that result in 
noteworthy study protocol violations.  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the PP population in a supportive manner.  
10.4.4  Safety Population  
Two safety populations will be defined.  
The Randomization Per iod safety population will include all subjects who received  at least one 
dose of study drug and had at least one post -Baseline safety assessment  during the 
Randomization Period .  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 56 of 88 The Open Label safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of 
miconazole oil and had at least one post -Baseline safety assessment  during the Optional Open -
label Extension or Enrollment B . 
Safety analyses  for the Randomization Period  will be performed using the Randomization Period 
safety  population.  Safety analyses for the Optional Open -label Extension and Enrollment B will 
be combined and presented using the Open Label safety population.  
10.5 Statistical Methods  
10.5.1  Efficacy  Analys es 
The primary population for efficacy analyses will be  the MITT population (see Section 10.4). 
Efficacy analyses  will also be performed  on the ITT and the PP population s and will be 
considered supportiv e. 
The primary analysis will be conducted once Enrollment A is complete.  
The number  and percent of subjects who demonstrate a positive outcome for the primary efficacy 
outcome  as well as all secondary and tertiary efficacy outcomes will be presented . 
The primary endpoint, defined as the percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit with 
“therapeutic cure” , will be compared between groups using a chi -square test with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05 . 
The secondary endpoints will be ana lyzed analogously to the primary endpoint.  
In Enrollment A in  cases of bilateral otomycosis, if only 1 ear has a positive fungal culture at 
Screening/Baseline, that ear will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears have 
a positive funga l culture at Screening/Baseline, the ear with the worse infection at 
Screening/Baseline, as assessed by the investigator by taking into account clinical signs and 
symptoms, will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears  have a positive f ungal 
culture at Screening/Baseline and  are determined by the investigator to have the same degree of 
infection at Screening/Baseline, the left ear will be used as the study ear for the purposes of 
efficacy analyses.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided  for otomycosis signs and symptoms  and also for  clinical 
cure, modified therapeutic cure, and therapeutic improvement ; each at Day 15 will be 
summarized using the ITT population for both the Randomization  Period  and the Optional Open -
label Extension . 
10.5.1.1  Multi ple Comparison/Multiplicity  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by requiring the primary efficacy endpoint to be 
statistically significant. Specifically, failure of the primary efficacy endpoint will invalidate the 
statistical significance of the s econdary efficacy endpoints.  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol MZ-0120 -ESP3 -052 
  14 Sep 2020 / Version 4  
Page 57 of 88 Evaluation of the secondary efficacy endpoints will use a gated sequential procedure in order to 
control for multiplicity. These tests will be performed for only the MITT population. The testing 
process will terminate whenever a statistical test for a step is not significant, i.e.,  any subsequent 
test will be considered not significant. The order of testing is:  
1. Percentage of subjects with mycological cure at the Test of Cure Visit.  
2. Percentage of subjects with clinical cure at th e Test of Cure Visit.  
10.5.2  Safety Analys es 
Safety summar ies will be conducted using two safety population s (see Section 10.4.4 ). All AEs 
occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study drug application, 
will be summarized . Summaries  will provide the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system 
organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study  drug. When summarizing TEAEs 
by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system 
organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, 
respectively, within each category. All  reported SAEs will be summarized by the number of 
subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to 
study drug.

13.1 Amendment 1 Version 2 04 February 2020  
The purpose of this amendment was to remove the following sec ondary endpoints:  
• Percentage of subjects with mycological cure at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with clinical cure at the Test of Cure Visit.  
No detailed summary of changes was prepared for Version 2 because the prior version (Version 
1, 28  January 2020) was internal only.  
13.2 Amendment 2 Version 3 18 May 2020  
This amendment reflects updates and revisions to the protocol resulting from an End -of-Phase 2 
meeting with FDA  and changes in sponsor strategy for the development of miconazole oil . An 
overview of major changes is as follows . 
• An optional open -label extension  was added to the study to allow s ubjects the option to be 
treated with active drug (miconazole oil) if they have a visual presence of fungal elements in 
at least one ear following randomized treatment . 
• A second portion was added to the study (called Enrollment B), which will commence after 
comple tion of the first portion (called Enrollment A) in order to gather safety information for 
miconazole oil in additional subjects. Because the purpose of Enrollment B is safety, subjects 
in Enrollment B are not required to have a diagnosis of otomycosis.  
• Secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints were  added . 
Clarifications and minor changes to study conduct and statistical analyses were also made.  
A more complete  summary of changes  from the prior version  is provided below. Insertions  are 
bolded . Deletions are struck through . For s ections that are new or have been completely revised , 
only a short description is provided.

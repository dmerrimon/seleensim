 1. SUMMARY  
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) from an HLA -
matched related donor (MRD) can cure patients with hematologic disorders.  
Unfortunately, many patients with these disorders lack a MRD. For such patients, 
transplantation using unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) has b een utilized as an 
alternative donor transplant strategy. The advantages of UCB transplant (UCBT) 
include the ease and rapidity of availability, requirement of less than perfect HLA match, and lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants.  The major disadvantage of UCB transplantation in adults is the limited number of nucleated cells contained within the cord unit resulting in prolonged neutropenia which contributes to infection and transplant r elated mortality (TRM). In order to harness the advantage of UCB 
availability and to overcome the disadvantage of delayed neutrophil recovery, co-administration of unrelated UCB and highly purified haploidentical peripheral blood 
CD34+ cells from a related donor promotes rapid engraftment and reduce TRM 
secondary to prolonged neutropenia associated with conventional UCBT 1-12. 
Miltenyi Biotec’s CliniMACS
® CD34 Reagent System was approved as a 
Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) by the U.S. FDA. The approved label indication i s 
“The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is indicated for processing hematopoietic 
progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) from an allogeneic, HLA -
identical, sibling donor to obtain a CD34+ cell -enriched population for hematopoietic 
reconstit ution following a myeloablative preparative regimen without the need for 
additional graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients with acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) in first morphologic complete remission”. While sufficient clinical data exists t o warrant the use of haploidentical CD34+ selected cells 
combined with single unit umbilical cord blood as a standard of care stem cell transplant strategy, the strategy requires CD34+ cells selection using the Miltenyi CliniMACS
® CD34 Reagent System. Though the Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34 
Reagent System is used for this purpose at numerous centers1-12, the device is not 
FDA approved for this specific indication. As such this investigational device exemption (IDE) protocol supports the use of Miltenyi CliniMACS
® CD34 Reagent 
System for preparing CD34+ enriched/T -cell depleted cells from haploidentical 
mobilized peripheral blood.  
The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G -CSF and undergo apheresis to 
collect CD34+ stem cell product after Miltenyi CD34+ selection. The products will be 
cryopreserved until the time of transplantation. Recipients with hematologic 
malignancies will receive a standard conditioni ng. After the conditioning regimen, 
subjects will receive an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+ cells that have been positively selected and T -cell depleted following G -CSF mobilization (goal 
CD34+ cell dose of 3 x 10
6 CD34+ cells /kg recipient) com bined with a single UCB 
unit (serologically matched at ≥ 4/6 HLA loci).  UCB unit will not be manipulated, and 
will be prepared and infused separately following standard of care procedure.

 This study will evaluate 200  patients with hematologic disorders meeting 
indication for transplant but who do not have MRD. Safety will be monitored 
continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment -related serious 
adverse event rate (TRSAE), defined by failure of  Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34 
Reagent System to select CD34+ cells, and/or failure to engraft that is higher than historical control   (<10% for hematologic malignancies and 34% for severe aplastic 
anemia).  
 
2. OBJECTIVE  
To determine safety and efficacy of Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent 
System to select haploidentical CD34+ cells.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
3.1. Review  
Haploidentical donor stem cell transplantation, umbilical cord blood transplant, 
and Haploidentical CD34+ selected cells combined with single unit umbilical cord 
blood transplant : 
Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo- SCT) is a curative option for 
many hematologic disorders, MRD are available for only 30% of the patients needing a transplant. Alternative stem cell source includes cord blood or a parti ally matched 
(haploidentical) family donor. Potential donors for haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo- SCT) include family members (parents, siblings, or children) 
who share one haplotype with the recipient. Haplo- SCT may have advantages over 
UCB T for the following reasons: 1) higher stem cell dose and rapid hematological 
recovery, 2) feasibility of repeated cell collections for post -transplant 
immunotherapy
13,14. The major disadvantage of haploidentical transplant is high rate 
of acute and chronic GVHD without significant immunosuppression, or high rates of relapse if significant immunosuppression is administered.  
UCB is also increasingly being used as a source of stem cells, as this allows the 
transplantation of patients without a MRD. Advantages of UCBT include: 1) the 
rapidity by which UCB units can be obtained, 2) low relapse rates, 3) the requirement for less t han a perfect HLA match, and 4) lower rates of graft versus host disease 
associated with HLA mismatching compared to bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants.  The major disadvantage of UCBT in adults is the limited number of nucleated cells c ontained within the cord unit resulting in prolonged 
neutropenia and failure of engraftment, which contributes to infection and TRM. Median time to neutrophil engraftment is prolonged at day 22 (range, 21- 25 days), 
with less than 10% graft failure for pati ents with hematologic malignancies. Median 
IDE #17240  
Gutman, MD   ver: 22FEB 2021 
Confidential and Proprietary    Page 7 of 30  
 time to neutrophil engraftment for patients  with severe aplastic anemia is even 
further prolonged at 42 days (range, 13 to 55 days), with the primary graft failure 
incidence of 34%15-18.  
Engraftment is defined as achievement of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 
≥500 cells/μl for three consecutive days.   
Primary graft failure for cord blood transplant (also known as failure to engraft), 
is defined as failure to achieve a neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥500/μl by day 42 post -
transplant and the aplastic appearance of a marrow sample.  
Delayed (secondary) graft failure is defined by failure to achieve a neutrophil 
count (ANC) of ≥500/μl after initial achievement of ANC recovery to >500/μL for three consecutive occasions.  
In order to harness the advantage of UCB availability and to overcome the 
disadvantage of delayed neutrophil recovery, co- administration of unrelated 
umbilical cord blood and highly purified haploidentical peripheral blood CD34+ cells from a related donor promotes rapid engraftment and reduce TRM secondary to prolonged neutropenia associated with conventional UCBT 
1-12. 
 
4. SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION 
Miltenyi Biotec’s CliniMACS ® CD34 Reagent System was approved as a 
Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) by the U.S. FDA. The approved label indication is “The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is indicated for processing hematopoietic 
progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) f rom an allogeneic, HLA -
identical, sibling donor to obtain a CD34+ cell -enriched population for hematopoietic 
reconstitution following a myeloablative preparative regimen without the need for 
additional graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first morphologic complete remission.” In this clinical protocol, the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System will be used for processing hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) from an allogeneic, HLA -haploidentical, related donor to obtain a CD34+ cell -enriched 
population for hematopoietic reconstitution following a preparative regimen in patients with hematologic disorders who require transplant. The procedure used to enrich the CD34+ cells wi ll be identical to the procedure used under the HUD.   
While sufficient clinical data exists to warrant the use haploidentical CD34+ 
selected cells combined with single unit umbilical cord blood as a standard of care stem cell transplant strategy, the strategy requires T -cell depletion and enrichment 
for CD34+ cells using the Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System 1-12. Miltenyi 
CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is used for haploidentical CD34+ selected cells combined with single unit umbilical cord blood transplant at nu merous centers, but 
the device is not FDA approved for this specific indication.  This protocol supports 
IDE #17240  
Gutman, MD   ver: 22FEB 2021 
Confidential and Proprietary    Page 8 of 30  
 the use of this device under the proposed IDE. We therefore propose this clinical 
protocol of umbilical cord blood and haploidentical CD34+ cells trans plant following 
standard conditioning regimen as treatment for subjects with hematologic disorders.   
 
5. STUDY DESIGN  
This is an investigator initiated clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of Miltenyi CliniMACS ® CD34 Reagent System to promote engraftment.  
The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G -CSF and undergo apheresis to 
collect CD34+ selected stem cell product after Miltenyi CD34+ selection. The 
products will be cryopreserved until the time of transplantation.  
Recipients will receive a standard conditioning regimen (Please refer to section 
8 for dosing and schedule). After the conditioning regimen, the subjects will receive 
an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+ cells that have been positively 
selected and T -cell depleted following G -CSF mobilization (goal CD34+ cell dose of 
3 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg recipient) combined with a single UCB unit (serologically 
matched at ≥  4/6 HLA loci).  UCB unit will not be manipulated, and will be prepared 
and infused separately following standard of care procedure.

 9. BIOSTATISTI CAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Primary Endpoint:  To determine the rate of successful  engraftment of patients 
who received haploidentical CD34+ selected cells combined with single unit 
umbilical cord blood transplant.  Failure defined as failure of Miltenyi CliniMACS ® 
CD34 Reagent System to select CD34+ cells, and/or failure to engraft by day 42.  
9.1. Methods of Statistical Analysis  
  There will be 20 0 individuals who may be included in this study of safety analysis.   
The primary outcome of this study is the proportion of individuals who have had a 
successful engraftment by the end of the 42 day period. Assuming a sample size 
of 200, if there is an engraftment success rate of 75% (or a failure rate of 25%), 
there would be a resulting 95% confidence interval of 63% to 87% (that is a width 
of 12% on either side of 75% successful engraftments).  
 
9.2. Sample Size  
A maximum of 200 subjects will be evaluated for safety analysis.  
 
9.3. Stopping Rules for Safety  
 Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on 
the treatment -related serious adverse event rate (TRSAE). Safety monitoring will 
continue until engraftment.  
 Stopping rule for TRSAE is defined as failure of Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34 
Reagent System to select CD34+ cells, and/or failure to engraft. The number of 
TRSAE which will end the study are based on an acceptable rate of 10% of 
patients with hematologic malignancies and 20% of patients with severe aplastic 
anemia having adverse events.

 10. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
10.1.  Safety Monitoring and Oversight  
The sponsor investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the 
trial monitoring plan, in addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial 
including any specimens collected, executing the data and safety monitoring 
(DSM) plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal 
authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight 
from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of 
Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center) . The DSMC is responsible for 
ensuring data quality and study participant safety for all clinical studies at the CU Cancer Center, which is the coordinating institution of this trial. A summary 
of the DSMC’s activities is as follows:  
• Conduct of internal  audits  
• Ongoing review of all unanticipated adverse device effects, serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UAPs)  
• May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer 
Center’s Executive Committee  
Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs and UAPs are 
reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor investigator per protocol. All SAEs and UAPs including unanticipated adverse device effects are to be reported to 
the DSMC within 7 (for fatal or life- threatening event s) or 15 (non- life-
threatening events) calendar days of the sponsor investigator receiving notification of the occurrence.  
Each subject’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by the site PI and 
appropriate staff at weekly meetings. Data regarding number of  subjects, 
adverse device effects, treatment modifications and treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  
The sponsor investigator will provide a DSM progress report to the CU 
Cancer Center DSMC on a recurring basis (ei ther every six or twelve months 
based on DSMC vote). The DSM report will include a protocol summary, current enrollment numbers, summary of adverse device effects to include 
IDE #17240  
Gutman, MD   ver: 22FEB 2021 
Confidential and Proprietary    Page 16 of 30  
 specific unanticipated adverse device effects, SAEs, UAPs and AEs, any 
treatment m odifications, all protocol deviations, and protocol amendments. The 
DSM report submitted to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted. Results and recommendations from 
the review of this progress report by the DSMC will then be provided to the 
sponsor investigator in a DSMC review letter. The sponsor investigator is then responsible for ensuring this letter is submitted to the site’s IRB of record at the 
time of IRB continuing review.  
 Site monitoring vi sits will be performed by the sponsor investigator’s 
authorized representative on a regular basis, pursuant to the Monitoring Plan. During these visits, information recorded on the CRFs will be verified against 
source documents. Additional computer program s that identify selected 
protocol deviations, out -of-range data, and other data errors within the 
electronic data entry may also be used to help monitor the study. As necessary, 
requests for data clarification or correction will be sent to the appropriate site 
PI. Independent auditors from the sponsor investigator’s authorized 
representative will be allowed by the site’s PI to audit. In addition, audits may be conducted at any time by appropriate regulatory authorities and/or the IRB.

 13. CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System (see current Investigator’s Brochure)  
13.1.  Investigational Product  
Miltenyi Biotec’s CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System was approved as a 
Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) by the U.S. FDA. The approved label 
indication is “The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is indicated for 
processing hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, 
Apheresis) from an allogeneic, HLA -identical, sibling donor to obtain a CD34+ 
cell-enriched population for hematopoietic reconstitution following a 
myeloablative preparative regimen without the need for additional graft versus 
host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) in first morphol ogic complete remission.  
In this clinical protocol, the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System will be used 
for processing hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, 
Apheresis) from an allogeneic, HLA -haploidentical, sibling donor to obtain a 
CD34+ cell- enriched population for hematopoietic reconstitution follow ing a 
preparative regimen in patients with severe hematologic disorders who require 
transplant. The procedure used to collect the cells will be identical to the 
procedure used under the HUD.  
 The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is a medical device that is u sed 
in vitro to select and enrich specific cell populations. When using the CD34 Reagent, the system selects CD34+ cells from heterogeneous 
hematological cell populations for transplantation in cases where this is 
clinically indicated. The CliniMACS CD34 R eagent System is comprised 
of four primary components:  
• CliniMACS CD34 Reagent: a sterile monoclonal antibody reagent 
specific for CD34+ cells  
• CliniMACS plus Instrument: a software controlled instrument that 
processes the blood sample (cell product)  
• CliniMACS Tubing Sets: single -use, sterile, disposable tubing sets with 
two proprietary cell selection columns (CliniMACS Tubing Set and 
IDE #17240  
Gutman, MD   ver: 22FEB 2021 
Confidential and Proprietary    Page 23 of 30  
 CliniMACS Tubing Set LS)  
• CliniMACS PBS/EDTA Buffer: a sterile, isotonic phosphate -buffered, 
1 mM EDTA, saline solution, used as external wash and transport fluid 
for the in vitro preparation of blood cells.  
 
 
13.2.  Physical, Chemical and Toxicological Information  
• CD34 Reagent Description:  the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent is a dark amber, 
nonviscous, colloidal solution containing the antibody conjugate in buffer. 
The conjugate consists of a monoclonal antibody towards the class II 
epitope of the human CD34 antigen. The murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody 
is covalently linked to dextran beads that have an iron oxide/hydroxide core 
and are superparamagnetic.  
• Safety testing of the CD34 Monoclonal Antibody:  cell banking, cell culture, as well as subsequent purification of the antibody, follow the applicable current international guidelines as described in Section 4 of the 
Investigator’s brochure for Miltenyi  CliniMACS CD34+ system, Version 7, 
dated 6/13/2011. The testing of the CD34 Master Cell Bank, the End of Production Cells, the CD34 mAb pooled cell culture harvest (unprocessed 
bulk) and the purified CD34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) have been 
completed and the purified CD34 mAb has been released for manufacturing 
of the CD34 Reagent. Additionally, the viral inactivation/removal steps used 
in the purification of the CD34 monoclonal antibody have been validated.  
• Safety testing of the CD34 Reagent: detailed toxicity studies have been 
undertaken to assess the safety of the CD34 Reagent when delivered in 
dosages significantly greater than the projected maximum dosage 
anticipated in clinical use. The testing was performed in accordance wit h 21 
CFR §58, Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies. A 
summary of this testing is provided in Table 3 .

13.3.  Safety Testing of CliniMACS® System Components  
Instrument, Tubing Sets and PBS/EDTA Buffer -  Biocompatibility testing of 
the CliniMACS  System components (Tubing Sets and PBS/EDTA Buffer) was 
performed according to ISO 10993. The requirements of ISO 10993 were 
fulfilled for the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System.   The CliniMACS plus 
Instrument has been tested for electrical safety and the pot ential for fire, shock, 
explosion, or mechanical damage.  Potential safety issues have been reduced by using a design to meet European standards EN 60601- 1. It is UL and CSA 
listed and approved.  
 
13.4.  Overall Safety of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System  
The results summarized in this Investigator’s Brochure support that 
CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System is sufficiently safe for clinical use with 
IDE #17240  
Gutman, MD   ver: 22FEB 2021 
Confidential and Proprietary    Page 25 of 30  
 human subjects. The potential application of the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent is 
broad. Infusion of purified CD34+ cells is indicated in a number of clinical 
applications after myeloablative or lymphoablative therapy including reduction 
of tumor cells in the transplant and depletion of T cells for autologous 
(autoimmune diseases) and allogeneic transplantations.  
 Individual risk analysis on the therapeutically used target cells isolated in 
conjunction with CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System should be addressed by each site using these cells. A European safety study, ACS 950101, for the 
CliniMACS System was published in Bone Marrow  Transplantation 25; 243- 49, 
February 2001. The study was designed to meet European Essential Requirements 3 and 14 (MDD 93/42/EEC) and was conducted per EN540 to 
support the CE Marking of the device (received December 1997).  
 The initial clinical study with the CliniMACS System was conducted in 
subjects undergoing high- dose chemotherapy for breast cancer. The purpose 
of the European Safety Study was to show:  
• Suitability of the CD34 Reagent and other CliniMACS components 
for selection of CD34+ cells with high, yield, purity viability and 
safety  
• CD34+ cells can safely be administered to subjects after myeloablative chemotherapy  
• Selected CD34+ cells are effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic system after myeloablative chemotherapy  
• Rate of device failures  
 
Cells were isolated from leukapheresis products from sixty -five subjects 
enrolled in the study. Fifty -four subjects received selected CD34+ cells and 
fifty-two were evaluable for engraftment as summarized in the table below (one 
patient died 5 day s post-transplant  and prior to engraftment and one patient did 
not recover platelet counts even after back -up cells were infused). All subjects 
receiving selected cells completed 60 and 100- day follow -up after infusion, 
IDE #17240

 during which time their hematological and immune status were monitored, as 
was HAMA production. A summary of the results of the European Clinical Trial 
is provided below.

The following conclusions were made regarding this clinical study:  
• The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System selects CD34+ cells from heterogeneous hematological cell populations. The resulting CD34+ 
product is of high purity (median of 96.1 %, range 27.4 –  99.4 %); the 
median recovery of CD34+ cells was 52.3 % (range 15.2 –  146.3%). 
The reported performance results are similar to those seen in pre-
clinical studies.  
• Infusion of selected, autologous CD34+ cells after high dose 
chemotherapy resulted in rapid engraf tment (see Table 4 ). These 
data are comparable to previously reported results, using bone marrow or peripheral blood cells as stem cell source. Following 
cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin (CTCb), Weaver et al. 
reported median times to platelet and neutrophil engraftment of 9 
days (range 0- 53 days) and 9 days (range 5- 26 days), respectively. 
Also after CTCb, Elias et al., reported median times to platelet and 
neutrophil recovery of 12 days (range 8- 134 days) and 14 days 
(range 10- 57 days), respectiv ely19,20.  
• The selection process has no discernable effect on cell viability or 
IDE #17240

 sterility.  
• There were no adverse events or device malfunctions reported as 
related to the infusion of the cells or use of the CliniMACS CD34 
Reag ent System. None of the subjects were reactive for HAMA post 
infusion. There were no reports of late engraftment failure or evidence of delayed immune reconstitution.

62 STUDY DESCRIPTION
2.1 Study Design
This is an open -label non-randomized Phase Ib trial investigating the combination of dasatinib 
and nivolumab in CML  subjects with chronic phase (CML -CP) or accelerated phase (CML -AP), 
who are progressing on, resistant to, sub-optim ally responding to, or intolerant to prior treatment 
with any  TKI (except dasatinib in case of prior intolerance).
The study  consists of an escalation and an expansion phase. Dose levels are defined by the 
nivolumab dose (see Table Table 2.1-1 ). All subjec ts are treated until progression/treatment 
failure or intolerance for a maximum of up to 2 years with dasatinib and nivolumab combination 
and up to 1 additional y ear with dasatinib alone. 
In the escalation phase, safet y and tolerability  will be assessed i
n cohorts of up to 12 subjects 
using a modified toxicity  probability  interval (mTPI ) design1. This method is expected to more 
accuratel y estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) among a set of proposed doses than 
designs like 3 + 3 or 6 + 6 (when the same cohort size is used). The mTPI method uses a set of 
decision rules guided by posterior inference and requires the definition of a target toxicity  rate 
and an equivalence interval (EI), in which any dose is considered sufficiently  close to the true 
MTD as to be selected as the estimated MTD. Dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT) will be assessed for 
CML -CP and CML -AP in a pooled fashion. Approximately  24 - 48 subjects will be required for 
the escalation phase (see Section 5). Subjects who do not complete the DLT period for reasons 
other than dose -limiting toxicities will be replaced.
The Study  Team (Principal Investigators and Sponsor representatives) will determine accrual 
schedule and timing of cohort escalation and dose for expansion based on all 
available 
inform ation. Refer to protocol Section 3.1.3 for the criteria for dose escalation. Decisions will be 
based primaril y on safety  data for the first 6 weeks of combined treatment (Weeks 3 -8 
inclusive) in subjects with both CML -CP and AP but all relevant experienc e, including 
interruption or discontinuation for toxicity  after the DLT period and AEs during subsequent 
treatment, will be considered. Refer to protocol Section 3.1.3.1 for the definition of DLT. At 
completion of the escalation phase, the MTD will be asse ssed based on the estimate derived from 
the mTPI  method (the dose for which the difference between the estimated toxicity  and the target 
toxicity  is smallest among the doses tested). 
Subsequently , 21 - 33 additional subjects will be treated in an expansion phase at a dose selected 
during the escalation phase (recommended Phase 2 dose), in order to achieve a total of 45 - 68 
subjects (see Section 5). If the overall safet y profile of the study  drugs is less favorable than that 
initially  observed in the escalation phase, then further enrollment to the expansion cohort will be 
interrupted and a decision whether 
or not to continue dosing will be based on discussions of the 
observed aggregate (acute and chronic) toxicities between the study  Investigators and the 
Sponsor. 
Dasatinib is administered once -daily (QD) starting in Week 1 (Day  1) at 100mg po QD in 
subjects with CML -CP and at 140mg po QD in those with CML -AP. In selected cases, a lower 
starting dose of dasatinib could be allowed. Subjects will receive dasatinib alo
ne during

7Weeks 1 - 2 of this study . Nivolumab will be administered as an IV infusion beginning on 
treatment Day 15 (Week 3) and then every  two weeks (3 days). In the escalation phase, DLT 
assessment will occur during the first 6 weeks of combination therapy (Weeks 3-8, inclusive).
Dose levels are defined as in Table Table 2.1

Not applicable (open label study ).
2.3 Blinding and Unblinding
There are currentl y 6 approved amendments. The history  of protocol amendments including the 
dates and changes to the protocol are summarized below.
Amendment 1 (11-Jul-2013, all sites) : The objective of this amendment was to permit the 
collection and storage of blood samples for use in future exploratory pharmacogenetic 
research. 
Amendment 2 ( 12-Sep- 2013, all German sites) : This amendment was written in response to a 
request from the German Health Authorities to ensure that HIV positive subjects are 
excluded from the study  in Germany .
Amendment 3 (23- Oct-2013, all sites) : The main objective of this amendment was to 
implement recommendations received from the United State Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). These recommendations were mainly  to have 2 prior TKI therapies for CML  prior 
to entering the trial and to include all non-hematologic Grade 3 or greater adverse events 
(AE) irrespective of duration in the definition of DLT. The pharmacokinetic and anti-drug 
antibody  sampling schedules were amended as well as theanaly sis section (to add 
report of 
immunogenicit y and neutralizing antibodies analy ses). In addition, the method to assess the 
selected dose for the expansion phase, the MTD, as well as some inclusion or exclusion 
criteria, and the time and event schedule were corrected or clarified. 
Amendment 4 (07- Feb-2014, all French sites) : The main objective of this amendment was to 
implement recommendations received from the French Health Authorities. The major 
changes resulting from this amendment were the exclusio n of subjects with suboptimal 
response during or intolerance to the last prior TKI, to consider possible pulmonary  arterial

8hypertension (PAH) at cardiac evaluations and to change slightl y the QTcF (Fridericia 
correction) level at which dasatinib must be d iscontinued.
Amendment 5 (01- Oct- 2014, all sites) : The main objectives of this amendment were to 
clarify  some eligibility criteria, to update the DLT definition (by excluding Grade 4 
hematologic AEs attributable to disease and dasatinib, as cytopenia is very common in TKI-
pretreated CML  patients with hematologic progression who are starting dasatinib), to remove 
most dasatinib PK sampling, and to allow a starting dose of dasatinib lower than 
100mg/140mg daily for CML -CP/AP in select cases. In addition, edits to provide 
consistency , clarification, correction, simplification of time and events schedules or fix 
typographical errors were made.
Amendment 6 ( 15-Apr-2015, all sites) : Escalation to nivolumab 3mg/kg will be permitted for 
subjects receiving a nivolumab dose of 1mg/kg (n = 9, at time of this Amendment) after 
9 months on study . 
Now that Dose Level 2, nivolumab 3mg/kg, is open to enrollment, this option becomes 
appropriate. The minimum of 9 months treatment at 1mg/kg will assure that safet y data is 
adequate at this dose. This change will permit subjects to escalate under the following 
conditions:
Only  subjects with clear evidence that their disease is not responding at 1mg/kg 
nivolumab could be escalated. There is evidence that nivolumab efficacy  is dose-
dependent, with different thresholds for different tumors.
Only  subject s with very good tolerance of 1mg/kg (i.e., have no clinically -significant 
nivolumab
-related AEs of any grade) after > 9months on study  could be escalated. No 
DLTs were observed among the 12 evaluable subjects treated at nivolumab dose of 
1mg/kg . Subjects who have tolerated 1mg/kg are expected to tolerate 3mg/kg equall y 
well.
3 OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary
The primary  objective is to assess the safety  and tolerability  for the combination of dasatinib and 
nivolumab in subjects with CP or AP CML , in order to select a Phase 2 dose. The assessment of 
safet y and tolerability will be based on:
Dose limiting toxicities (DL Ts) as defined in 
Section 3.1.3.1 of the protocol,
Incidences of adverse even ts (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), during the DLT 
period, the full treatment period of the subjects with the combination therapy , and during the 
expansion phase,
Frequencies of abnormal clinical laboratory  tests (summarized by  worst toxicity  grade ).

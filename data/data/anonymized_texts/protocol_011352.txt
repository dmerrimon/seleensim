ii PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS – BMT CTN PROTOCOL 0 801 
 
A Phase II/III Randomized, Multicenter Trial Comparing Sirolimus plus Prednisone and 
Sirolimus/Calcineurin Inhibitor plus Prednisone for the Treatment of Chronic Graft -
versus -Host Disease  
 
Principal Investigators:  Paul Carpenter, MB , BS 
 Mukta Arora , MD 
 
Study Design:    Combined Phase II/III, randomized, open label, multicenter, 
prospective comparative study of sirolimus plus prednisone versus 
sirolimus/calcineurin -inhibitor plus prednisone for the treatment of 
chronic GVHD.  
 
Phase II Component:  
A Phas e II randomized trial  of sirolimus + prednisone (Arm 1) versus 
sirolimus + calcineurin inhibitor + prednisone (Arm 2).  
The intent is to enroll subjects at the start of initial therapy for 
chronic GVHD, or before their chronic GVHD is refractory to 
glucocor ticoid therapy, or is chronically dependent upon 
glucocorticoid therapy and multiple secondary systemic 
immunosuppressive agents.  Patients will be stratified by transplant 
center and will be randomized to an experimental arm of  sirolimus + 
prednisone or t he comparator arm of sirolimus + calcineurin inhibitor 
+ prednisone in a 1:1 ratio.  
Phase III Component:  
The Phase II study above will proceed into the Phase III component 
of the protocol  if the experimental arm is more efficacious than the 
comparator arm.    
Thus, subjects that were enrolled on the Phase II will continue to be 
followed for the Phase III endpoints. Phase III accrual will then be 
completed by enrolling additional patients.   
 
Primary Objective:  Phase II Component:  
To estimate  the proportion o f subjects with complete or partial 
responses after 6 months of therapy in both study arms using an 
intention to treat analysis.  
 
Phase III Component:  
To compare the proportion of subjects with complete resolution of all 
reversible manifestations at 24 mon ths after starting therapy in both 
study arms.

iii Secondary Objectives:  Phase II component  estimate s among patients receiving SRL 
versus SRL +CNI : the percent reduction in the average daily dose of 
prednisone (or equivalent) by 6 and 12 months ; the cumulat ive 
incidence of treatment  failure at 1 year; the prevalence of active 
symptomatic chronic GVHD at 1 and 2  years ; the cumulative 
incidence of discontinuation of all systemic immunosuppr essive 
therapy at 1 and 2 years; the  overall and cancer progression -free 
survival at 1 and 2 years ; the candidate serum biomarkers of chronic 
GVHD at baseline, 2 months and 6 months; and, to evaluate NIH and 
other new response instruments in chronic GVHD.  
Phase III component comparisons among patients receiving SRL  
versus SRL  +CNI : percent reduction in the average daily dose of 
prednisone (or equivalent) at 6, 12, and 24 months; cumulative 
incidence of treatment failure at 1 and 2  years; prevalence of active 
symptomatic  chronic GVHD at 1 and 2 years; cumulative incidence 
of di scontinuation of all systemic immunosuppressive therapy at 1 
and 2 years ; overall and cancer progression -free survival at 1 and 2 
years ; candidate serum biomarker s of chronic GVHD at baseline, 2 
months , and 6 months ; and, to evaluate NIH and other new resp onse 
instruments in chronic GVHD.  
3-Year Assessments : All patients except those who are enrolled 
during the last 12 months of accrual will be evaluated at 3 years after 
beginning study therapy for the endpoints above under the Phase III 
component.  Patient s enrolled in the last 12 months will not complete 
3 year assessments and will be excluded from the analysis.

Treatment Description:   
Arm 1: Sirolimus + Prednisone  
Arm 2: Sirolimus + C alcineurin Inhibitor + Prednisone  
Prednisone is administered initially as a single early morning dose of 
1 mg/kg/day [or equivalent (Adults: maximum dose 100 mg, for age 
< 17 years , the use of adjusted body weight as per institutional 
guidelines should be considered to calculate doses for patients who 
weigh > 110% of ideal body weight) ].   
If prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) is 
contraindicated (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, 
osteoporosis, avascular bone necrosis, major moo d disturbance) 
patients may begin prednisone between 0.5 -1 mg/kg/day.   
Prednisone therapy continues at the initial dose until there is 
objective evidence of improvement in manifestations of chronic 
GVHD.  
The initial taper of prednisone from the starting  dose of 0.5 -1 
mg/kg/ every day  (or equivalent) is attempted within 2 weeks after the 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
v first evidence of improvement in GVHD and takes place over 4 -8 
weeks to achieve a dose of 0.5 -1 mg/kg/ every -other -day.   
Once an alternating -day prednisone (or equivalent)  regimen is 
achieved, the dose of prednisone should be held constant for 10 -12 
weeks until all reversible manifestations of chronic GVHD resolve, 
after which a second taper is attempted.  The tempo of this second 
taper may follow individual institutional g uidelines but it is 
recommended that the extent of the taper be approximately calibrated 
to the magnitude of an individual patient’s alternating -day prednisone 
dose.  For example, a patient whose prednisone dose has been stable 
at 0.5 mg/kg/every -other -day may attempt to taper prednisone 
completely.  However, a patient whose prednisone dose has been 
stable at 1.0 mg/kg/every -other -day is recommended first to taper 
over 4 -8 weeks to 0.5 mg/kg/every -other -day, followed by 2 -3 
months of further observation bef ore attempting a complete taper.  
Calcineurin inhibitor therapy continues at a dose which achieves 
the following trough serum levels (HPLC/TMS):  
a) Tacrolimus: 5 -10 ng/mL  
b) Cyclosporine: 120 -200 ng/mL  
Sirolimus therapy begins at 2 mg orally per day (1 mg/m2 per day if 
< 40 kg) to target a trough serum level of 3 -12 ng/mL.   
Supportive care  will follow institutional guidelines that reflect 
reasonable standard practices appropriate to the patient with chronic 
GVHD as outlined by the Ancillary Therapy and Supportive  Care 
Working Group Report of the NIH Consensus Development Project 
on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic GVHD.2  
 
Accrual Objective:  Phase II Component:  One hundred subjects will be randomized 1:1 
across the Phase II study (50 per arm).  
 
Phase III Co mponent:  If the Phase II is successful, then 100  patients 
from the Phase II study continue on the Phase III.   Two hundred 
additional subjects will be randomized 1:1 across the Phase III ( 100 
per arm) for a combined Pha se II/III total of 300 subjects .    
 
Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is 3 years for the Phase II , and 4 years 
for the Phase III.  
 
Study Duration:  The estimated study duration is  3.5 years for the Phase II , and 6 years 
for the Phase III .

1-1 CHAPTER 1  
 
 
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
 
1.1. Chronic Graft -versus -Host Disease (cGVHD)  
 
Fifteen percent to 80% of pa tients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) 
develop chronic GVHD depending on stem cell source and donor -host factors.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Therefore, it is not surprising that cGVHD is the major complication among patients who survive 
beyond 100 days.  Standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for cGVHD us ing glucocorticoids 
with or without a calcineurin inhibitor has not changed for three decades despite the observation 
that most patients respond inadequately.  If the total time to discontinue all systemic IST is 
measured as a surrogate for graft tolerance , it takes a median of 2 -3 years from the onset of 
cGVHD therapy; varying according to stem cell source and other factors.10  Unfortunately, 
despite the association of cGVHD with reduced relapse of malignancy, the protracted duration of 
cGVHD makes it the l eading cause of impaired immunity, compromised functional status, and 
late treatment -related deaths.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16  The protean and sometimes irreversible organ 
manifestations of cGVHD create a burden of symptom s that may negatively impact quality of 
life even after tolerance is achieved.  New approaches to standard IST for cGVHD are needed to 
achieve early control of cGVHD manifestations and facilitate tolerance.  
 
A hypothesis driven choice of novel IST study ag ents has been problematic because cGVHD 
pathophysiology has been poorly understood.  As a result, contemporary early therapy trials have 
been extremely limited.  Most therapy trials have been restricted to single arm Phase II studies in 
steroid -refractory cGVHD and preliminary data exists for at least  five commercially available 
therapies that have shown some activity.17, 18, 19, 20, 21  However, a renewed interest and 
understanding of the potential role of regulatory T cells (T regs) in facilitating graft tolerance has 
generated enthusiasm for testing tolerance induction strategies that do not impede the expansion 
of T regs.  Traditi onal calcineurin -inhibitor (CNI) based therapy impedes T regs22 and a subset 
analysis from one study suggested that survival was worse when progressive onset cGVHD was 
treated with cyclosporine plus prednisone compared to prednisone alone.23  In contrast, a more 
recent therapy , sirolimus does not impede T regs, making it a logical candidate to consider 
further.22, 24, 25, 26, 27  Therefore, this prospective randomized combined Phase II/III study will test 
two arms:  
Arm 1:     Sirolimus + Prednisone  
Comparator Arm (Arm 2):  Sirolimus + Calcineurin Inhibitor + Prednisone  
 
1.2. Balancing Experimenta l Design Purity and Study Accrual  
 
Eligibility criteria for this study (Section 2.3.1 and 2.3.2) were designed to avoid major 
heterogeneities in the resistance of individuals to IST yet should be compatible with the need to 
optimize timely accrual for earl y phase testing.  Experimental therapy has generally been 
reserved for failed primary therapy despite the fact that time to discontinue IST for cGVHD 
usually exceeds several years.  This trial encourages physicians to enroll patients with newly

1-2 diagnosed c GVHD but also allows the common practice of short term “testing” standard therapy 
and by subsequently allowing the inclusion of patients not responding to less than or equal to 16 
weeks of initial therapy with prednisone ± a CNI  ± an additional non-sirolim us agent . 
 
1.3. Sirolimus (rapamycin) in GVHD  
 
Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a naturally occurring macrolide that has immunosuppressive, 
antifungal, and antitumor properties.  Although structurally similar to tacrolimus, sirolimus 
binds uniquely to FK binding protei n 12 (FKBP12) and then complexes with mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) rather than with calcineurin.  The FKBP12 -mTOR complex affects 
upstream and downstream signaling that ultimately leads to T and B cell suppression.28, 29  
Downstream there is reduced DNA transcription, translation, protein synthesis and cell cycling. 
Upstream interactions with m TOR include the PTEN/pI3 kinase/Akt and Janus kinase pathways, 
which importantly include the mediation of IL -2 driven signaling from the T cell receptor.30  
This contrasts with the calcineurin inhibitors, which more directly inhibit cytokine production, 
particularly IL -2.  Sirolimus may also act by inhibiting antigen uptake, cellular maturation, 
intracellular signaling and induction of apoptosis in dendritic cells. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 
 
Phase II data indicates ac tivity of sirolimus in over one hundred patients with steroid -refractory 
cGVHD and overall response rates of 63% to 94%.17, 37, 38 [P. Carpenter  unpublished]  Sirolimus 
has also been reported to improve the efficacy of acute GVHD prophylaxis regimens although 
this did not extend to a reduced incidence of cGVHD.39, 40  In all these studies sirolimus was 
combined with a CNI and the side effect profile of combination therapy is now well delineated 
and generally manageable with close attention to the rapeutic drug monitoring to avoid renal 
dysfunction that includes: thrombotic microangiopathy, hemolytic uremic syndrome and 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.  Nephrotoxicity is rare when sirolimus is used without 
CNIs.  
 
Of central interest to this stu dy is the recent understanding that sirolimus might facilitate 
tolerance when used in CNI -free regimens via preferential expansion of T regs. 22, 41  
 
1.4. FOXP3+CD4+CD25+ Tregs in Chronic GVHD  
 
Although IL -2 is important for the development and expansion of conventional effector T cells 
(Tconv), IL -2 is also critical for establ ishing and maintaining immune tolerance.42, 43, 44  The 
principal mechanism whereby IL -2 promotes immune tolerance appears to be via its roles in the 
preferential generation and maintenan ce of FOXP3 CD4+CD25+ Tregs compared to T conv.  In one 
study, the frequency of CD4+CD25 T regs and median FOXP3  values in patients with cGVHD was 
about half that of the non-cGVHD group but the suppressive function of these cells remains 
normal.45  This reduct ion was thought to be physiologically relevant given the low naturally 
occurring frequency of T regs in the blood of healthy individuals yet the critical role in controlling 
a wide range of immune responses.  This is perhaps best illustrated  by the clinical  severity of the 
IPEX syndrome which is caused by specific mutations of FOXP3  that result in a functional 
deficiency of T regs.46  Interestingly, sirolimus therapy was able to abrogate severe manifestations 
of the IPEX syndrome in 3 children.47

1-3 1.4.1.  Inhibition o f Tregs by Calcineurin -dependent IL -2 Production  
 
Several recent data suggest that it is time to reevaluate the role of calcineurin -inhibitors (CNIs) 
for the treatment of GVHD and induction of tolerance.  Murine T regs are able to suppress 
experimental acut e GVHD and murine T regs share functional characteristics with their human 
counterparts.  Because IL -2 signaling is critical for the survival of FOXP3+ Tregs in vivo it is 
important to understand the implications of commonly used IST on T reg function in viv o.  Zeiser 
et al  compared cyclosporine and sirolimus as IST in an MHC class I and II mismatch T cell 
depleted bone marrow transplant model with T cell add -back in a 1:2 ratio of T regs /Tconv.22  
Cyclosporine si gnificantly reduced T reg function in vivo as assessed by increased proliferation of 
Tconv, GVHD severity, and reduced survival.  The reduced suppressor function of cyclosporine -
exposed T regs was IL -2 dependent and correlated with a reduced number of FOXP3 + T cells in 
vitro and in vivo, suggesting the critical importance of calcineurin -dependent IL -2 production.  
In contrast sirolimus did not inhibit the expansion of donor derived FOXP3  Tregs.22  This data is 
in keeping with other in vitro studies showing that sirolimus selectively expands murine T regs as 
well as functional T regs in both healthy and diabetic human subjects.48, 49  Both thymic generation 
and peripheral preservation of FOXP3  Tregs appear to be negatively regulated by cyclosporine 
and facilitated by sirolimus.26  Interestingly, the frequency of CD4+CD25+ does not track with 
the total CD4+ cells suggesting that T regs are an independently regulated subset among CD4+ 
cells.45  The differential impact of  sirolimus on T regs compared to T conv appears to result from 
reduced usage of the mTOR pathway in T regs compared with T conv and explains the synergistic 
effect of sirolimus and T regs in GVHD protection.  The mechanism is complex but appears to 
involve incr eased usage of the STAT5 pathway over the PI3K pathway in response to IL -2 and, 
together with sirolimus -induced mTOR inhibition, the differentiation of CD4 T cells is skewed 
toward a FOXP3 -expressing phenotype.25, 45  In addition, activation of T conv induces rapid down -
regulation of PTEN which does not occur in T regs.25  T cell compartment targeted PTEN knock -
out mice hav e T regs that are rendered susceptible to mTOR inhibition.  
 
1.5. Calcineurin -Inhibitor Free Immunosuppression  
 
Data from a randomized primary therapy study in cGVHD23 and recent empirical data from four 
centers sugg est that it is not unsafe to discontinue a CNI in the treatment of cGVHD. The 
cGVHD study comparing cyclosporine plus prednisone to prednisone required 79 of the 145 
patients who were randomly assigned to prednisone to discontinue cyclosporine shortly afte r 
beginning the study.  The cumulative incidence of secondary therapy was not increased in the 
prednisone only arm arguing that removal of cyclosporine is safe.  A subset analysis suggested 
that survival was worse when progressive onset cGVHD was treated w ith cyclosporine plus 
prednisone compared to prednisone alone which is of interest from the context that CNI -based 
therapy impedes T regs.22  Previous randomized trials had also suggested that the incidence of 
cGVHD was not affected by early discontinuation of cyclosporine in patients who did not have 
acute GVHD on Day 60 after transplantation50 or by prolongation of cyclosporine in patients 
who did not have cGVHD on Day 80 after transplantation .51  A combined tota l of approximately 
30 patients from Stanford, MD Anderson, NIH/NCI, and FHCRC have received a cGVHD 
therapy change that involved stopping a CNI and adding sirolimus or, in a few cases, 
mycophenolate mofetil. CNIs were mostly discontinued abruptly or after a brief taper.  Major 
flares of acute inflammatory GVHD manifestations were not observed.

1.6. Endpoints for Clinical Trials and Response  
 
The cGVHD field has been hampered by difficulties in being able to objectively measure 
complete and partial responses to therapeutic interventions.  However, short term endpoints like 
CR+PR are necessary because long term, albeit more objective endpoints like survival, or 
discontinuation of all systemic IST, are impractical for early phase testing.  To begin to address 
this obstacle, the NIH Consensus Development Project for Clinical Trials in cGVHD has 
published study design concepts aimed at improving the quality of response data to allow 
objective evaluation of new cGVHD therapies.52, 53  Central to the design of response criteria is 
that measurements need only capture the most important cGVHD manifestations that  reflect 
clinically relevant (functional) benefit for an individual patient.  Measurements should avoid 
detecting trivial responses that arise from crossing thresholds defined by categorical scoring. 
Ideally, instruments should measure a meaningful change calibrated as a percentage of baseline 
abnormality or function, and based upon statistical considerations or clinical perception.  
Clinical ly meaningful changes  might include the measurement of self -reported observations of 
the way a patient feels or funct ions before and after treatment.  Organ manifestations that might 
not be reversible (dry eye, fasciitis, bronchiolitis obliterans  with fibrosis ) need to be handled 
differently from manifestations that are expected to fully reverse.  Alternatively, potentia lly 
irreversible manifestations should be included only for progression.  The Working Group 
recognized that central review of clinical grading and response may improve reproducibility in 
multi -center trials.  
 
A detailed performance analysis of the newly de signed GVHD response instruments will be 
possible from the extensive data that will be generated by comprehensive measurements taken at 
baseline and after study interventions.  The goal will be to develop a set of more objective, 
clinically relevant respon se criteria that could be used in future studies.

2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1. Study Overview  
 
Combined Phase II/III, randomized, open label, multicenter, prospective comparative study of 
sirolimus plus prednisone versus sirolimus/calcineurin -inhibitor plus prednisone for the 
treatment of chronic GVHD.  
 
Phase II Component:  
Phase II will be a randomized trial  of Sirolimus (SRL) + Prednisone (PDN) vs SRL + calcineurin 
inhibitor (CNI) + PDN.  
 
The intent is to enroll subjects at the start of initial therapy for c hronic GVHD, or before their 
chronic GVHD is refractory to glucocorticoid therapy, or is chronically dependent upon 
glucocorticoid therapy and multiple secondary systemic immunosuppressive agents.  Patients 
will be stratified by transplant center and will be randomized to an experimental arm  of SRL + 
PDN [Arm 1] or the comparator arm of SRL + CNI + PDN [Arm 2] in a 1:1 ratio.  
 
Each study arm will include prednisone (or equivalent) and sirolimus .  The experimental arm 
will avoid a calcineurin inhibitor.

Phase III Component:  
If the result of Phase II confirms the hypothesis that the CNI free Arm (SRL +PRN) appears to 
be superior to the CNI containing Arm (SRL +CNI +PDN) then the trial will proceed into the 
Phase III component .  Thus, subjects that were enrolled on the Phase II will continue to be 
followed for the Phase III endpoints.  Phase III accrual will then be completed by enrolling 
additional patients.

2-2 2.2. Hypothesis and Study Objectives  
 
The primary purpose of the Phase II component is to compare a treatment regimen that contain s 
sirolimus without a calcineurin inhibitor, to a comparator regimen of sirolimus with a calcineurin 
inhibitor.  The goal is to determine if sirolimus plus prednisone is a sufficiently promising 
treatment regimen for further comparison in the Phase III trial.  
 
The primary hypothesis is that avoidance of a calcineurin inhibitor in the treatment of chronic 
GVHD might facilitate the development of tolerance and improve the GVHD response rates at 6 
months, and ultimately the 24 month complete response rates compared to immunosuppressive 
therapy regimens that contain a calcineurin inhibitor (the comparator arm, SRL + CNI + PDN).  
 
2.2.1.  Primary Objective  
 
Phase II Component :  The primary objective is to estima te in patients with recently diagnosed 
chronic GVHD the rates of complete plus partial responses at 6 months after randomization in 
both study arms using an intention to treat analysis.  
 
Phase III Component :  To compare the proportion of subjects with comp lete resolution of all 
reversible manifestations at 24 months after starting therapy in both study arms.   
 
2.2.2.  Secondary Objectives

receiving SRL versus SRL + CNI.  
3. To estimate  the prevalence of active symptomatic chronic GVHD at 1 and 2 years , 
among patien ts receiving SRL versus SRL + CNI.  
4. To estimate  the cumulative incidence of discontinuation of all systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy at 1 and 2 years , among patients receiving SRL versus SRL 
+ CNI.  
5. To estimate  overall and cancer progression -free survival a t 1 and 2 years , among patients 
receiving SRL versus SRL + CNI.  
6. To evaluate  candidate serum biomarkers of chronic GVHD at baseline, 2 months, and 6 
months , among patients receiving SRL versus SRL + CNI.  
7. To evaluate NIH and other new response instruments in  chronic GVHD.  
 
Phase III Component:

3-Year Assessments : 
All patients except those who are enrolled during the last 12 months of ac crual will be evaluated 
at 3 years after beginning study therapy for the endpoints 1 through 5 listed above under the 
Phase  III component ( also see Section 3.2).  Patients enrolled in the last 12 months will not 
complete 3 year assessments and will be excl uded from the analysis.

2.5.1.1.  Initiating sirolimus therapy ( Arms 1 and 2)  
 
Formulatio n Route  Adult  Child < 17 yr  
Rapamune®  Oral 2 mg daily  1 mg/m2 daily  
 
Initial doses are calculated using actual body weight except for those patients who are greater 
than 100% of ideal body weight in which case calculation of dose using adjusted body weig ht is 
recommended.  
 
There is generally no loading dose for patients with classic chronic GVHD.  For patients with 
chronic GVHD and acute overlap syndrome,  physicians may elect to administer a loading dose 
of 6 mg (3 mg/m2 for children < 17 yr) followed by a daily maintenance dose of 2 mg.  
 
2.5.1.2.  Targeting sirolimus levels, dose adjustment and other considerations  
 
The target serum level for sirolimus  is 3-12 ng/mL  
 
Oral solution and tablets are available for incremental dosing.  Dose adjustments are based upon 
clinical judgment of the managing physician after considering clinical toxicity, serum levels, 
GVHD, concomitant drug use and the rate of rise or decline of the serum level (see Table 2. 5b 
and “Sirolimus & CNI Therapy Physician Guide”) . Sirolimus blood level s will be measured 
by either HPLC or immunoassay.   
 
Other Important Considerations:  
• To minimize the variability of exposure to sirolimus, it should be taken at a consistent 
time of day and consistently with or without food.  
• Sirolimus should not be taken w ithin  4 hours after administration of Neoral®  (or 
Gengraf®)  cyclosporine oral solution and/or cyclosporine gelatin capsules because 
premarketing studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated 116% -512% elevations of mean 
Cmax and 148% -230% elevations in AUC wh en sirolimus oral solution or tablets were 
simultaneously administered with Neoral  but not when the doses were separated by 4 
hours.  
• Grapefruit juice  reduces CYP3A4 -mediated metabolism of sirolimus and must not be 
administered with sirolimus or used for d ilution.  
• Extreme caution when subject is on voriconazole therapy (See Section 2. 7.1). 
• Emesis : The sirolimus dose may be repeated within 15 minutes of a vomited dose.  
• Impaired renal function  does not mandate dosage adjustment.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-6 • Impaired hepatic function should prompt consideration for sirolimus maintenance doses 
to be reduced but no dose adjustment of the loading dose is necessary. Maintenance 
doses of sirolimus may be reduced by approximately one third in patients with hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Score  of ≥ 7/15 based on the sum of 1, 2 and 3 points 
respectively for each of: serum bilirubin in mg/dL (< 2, 2 -3, > 3), serum albumin in 
mg/dL (> 3.5, 2.8 -3.5, < 2.8), INR (< 1.7, 1.71 -2.2, >2.2), hepatic encephalopathy (none, 
grade I -II, grade III -IV), or as cites (none, slight, moderate/refractory).  
• Interchangeability of oral solution and tablets:  Two-milligram Rapamune Oral 
Solution is clinically equivalent to 2 -milligram Rapamune oral tablets; hence, are 
interchangeable on a milligram to milligram basis.  However, it is not known if higher 
doses of Rapamune Oral Solution are clinically equivalent to higher doses of tablets on a 
milligram to milligram basis (see Section 2. 7.1). 
 
2.5.1.3.  Sirolimus adverse reactions  
 
Most side -effects of sirolimus occur with prolonged  use, especially when used in combination 
with CNIs like tacrolimus and cyclosporine.  Sirolimus alone is not associated with neurotoxicity 
or nephrotoxicity because of its inability to inhibit calcineurin.  Adverse reactions that resulted in 
rates of siro limus discontinuation > 5% were increased creatinine, hypertriglyceridemia and 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

2.5.1.4.  Management of sirolimus toxicities  
 
Toxicities will be scored as per the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 3.0 (see http://ctep.cancer.gov/ forms/CTCAEv3.pdf ).  
 
• Hyperlipidemia: In the Phase III studies, treatment of new -onset hypercholesterolemia 
with lipid -lowering agents was required in 42 -52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus 
arms.  Concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors 
(statins) and/or fibrates appeared to be well tolerated.  However, statins or fibrates should 
only be administered with caution to patients being treated with sirolimus and a CNI, at 
doses which are reduced according to label recommend ations.  Treated patients should be 
monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis.  Sirolimus should be continued during 
therapy for hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia unless the lipid levels are 
uncontrollable with standard therapy and are de emed to be at risk to the subject, per the 
treating physician.  
 
• Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA): Studies in adult transplant patients have shown an 
increase in TMA from 4.2% when patients were treated with tacrolimus or cyclosporine 
alone compared to 10.8 % in patients treated with the tacrolimus/sirolimus combination.54  
TMA may occur both in the setting of sirolimus and/or CNI levels being above the 
therapeutic range or when levels are within desired ranges.  Although complete renal 
recovery occurred in 92 % of these patients, the potential seriousness of this complication 
requires careful monitoring and early therapy.  
 
To meet the definition for TMA a patient must have all of the following:  
1. Increased percentage (> 4%) of schistocytes in the blood  
2. De novo, prolonged, or progressive thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50x109/L 
or 50% or greater reduction from previous counts)  
3. Sudden and persistent increase in LDH  
4. Decrease in hemoglobin concentration or increased red blood cell transfusion 
requirement  
5. Decrease in serum haptoglobin  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-8 The following criteria are supportive of this diagnosis:  
1. Sudden and persistent increase in BUN and Creatinine  
2. Neurological symptoms  
 
TMA should be managed preventively and conservatively.  Prevention involves 
monitoring and keeping CNI and sirolimus levels within the target ranges.  When CNI 
and sirolimus levels are high, doses need to be held for hours to days until levels in the 
therapeutic range are measured.  High levels should prompt closer scrutiny of the 
patient’s laboratory stu dies for a drop in hematocrit, presence of schistocytes, rise in 
serum LDH, BUN or creatinine, or drop in haptoglobin and in platelet count.  Any 
changes in these measures should warrant close scrutiny of the patient with tight control 
of levels of tacroli mus and sirolimus.  Immediate reporting of TMA to the Protocol 
Princi pal I nvestigators is required .  
 
If TMA develops then the CNI  should be discontinued and one of the Protocol Principal 
Investigators should be contacted to discuss the case .  If a systemi c agent is substituted for 
the discontinued CNI , then treatment failure should be designated.   Sirolimus should be held 
if serum levels are supratherapeutic and restarted once in the target range at an 
appropriate dose .  The use of plasmapheresis and plasm a exchange does not appear to be of 
significant clinical utility in the management of transplant -associated microangiopathy, but 
may be used at the discretion of the treating physician . 
 
• Hematological Toxicity: It is recommended that the ANC, hematocrit an d platelet counts 
will be monitored at the frequencies described in Table 2. 5b, Section 2. 5.1.3.  A thorough 
investigation should be made to assess for possible causes of the cytopenia (recurrent 
disease, infection, drug effect other than sirolimus, TMA, autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia/thrombocytopenia, GVHD, late engraftment of platelets in cord blood transplant, 
etc.).  If other causes have been ruled out and cytopenias are significant (ANC<500, 
platelets <20K) sirolimus doses may be decreased by 50%.  If th e cytopenia does not 
resolve after two weeks, sirolimus may be held.  If counts improve, restart sirolimus at 
50% of dose and titer to full dose as tolerated.  
 
• Other Toxicities: Patients with toxicities such as lower extremity edema, arthralgias, and 
aphth ous ulcers, should have a thorough assessment to rule out other causes of these 
symptoms (medications, heart failure, GVHD, etc.).  If the toxicity is thought to be 
caused by sirolimus and is significant, sirolimus dosing may be decreased by 50%.  If the 
symptoms do not stabilize, improve, or resolve after two weeks then sirolimus may be 
held. In some cases, interstitial lung disease  has resolved upon discontinuation or dose 
reduction of sirolimus.  The risk may be increased as the sirolimus concentration 
increases.  
 
2.5.1.5.  Sirolimus drug interactions  
 
Sirolimus is a substrate for cytochrome CYP 3A4 and a P -glycoprotein (P -gp).  
  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-9 Drugs that may increase sirolimus blood concentrations include CYP 3A4, 5, or P -gp inhibitors:  
• Calcineurin inhibitors: Simultaneous admi nistration of cyclosporine soft gelatin capsules 
(Neoral®) results substantial increases in the sirolimus Cmax and AUC.  This is avoided 
if administration of cyclosporine and sirolimus is taken 4 hours after administration 
of cyclosporine.  
• Calcium Channel Blockers: diltiazem, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil and amlodipine. 
Sirolimus should be monitored and a dose adjustment may be necessary.  
• Triazole antifungal agents: fluconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole. The magnitude of increases sirolimus C max, tmax, and AUC is 
such that sirolimus should be administered cautiously together with fluconazole, 
itraconazole, or posaconazole, and with extreme caution if administered together 
with voriconazole .  If co -administra tion is unavoidable, then the dose of sirolimus 
should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of the antifungal medication as 
recommended in Table 2. 7a. and that there should be very frequent monitoring of trough 
concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood.  Sirolimus concentrations should be 
measured upon initiation, during co -administration, and at discontinuation of antifungal 
treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly.  
• Macrolide antibiotics: clarithromycin, erthyromycin, telithromycin, tr oleandomycin (but 
NOT azithromycin).  
• Gastrointestinal prokinetics: cisapride, metocloproramide . 
 
Drugs that may decrease sirolimus blood concentrations include CYP 3A4, 5, 7 or P -gp inducers :  
• Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, phenytoin.  
• Antib iotics: Rifampin, rifanpentine.  
• Herbs: St. John’s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ). 
 
Care should be taken when other drugs or substances that are metabolized by CYP3A4 or P -
glycoprotein are administered concomitantly with sirolimus.  Grapefruit juice reduced CY P3A4 
mediated metabolism of sirolimus and must not be used for dilution.  
 
2.5.2.  Calcineurin Inhibitor (Tacrolimus or Cyclosporine)  
 
2.5.2.1.  Stopping calcineurin inhibitor therapy ( Arm 1 ) 
 
It is suggested that patients who are randomized to a CNI -free regimen and are alr eady taking a 
CNI discontinue their CNI therapy by rapid taper over 1 -2 weeks.  The initial dose reduction 
should be at least 50% of the current dose.

Initial doses are calculated using actual body weight except for those patients who are greater 
than 100% of ideal body weight in which case calculation of dose using adjusted body weight is 
recommended.  
 
2.5.2.3.  Targeting CNI levels, dose adjustment and other considerations  
 
The target serum level for tacrolimus  is 5-10 ng/mL                
 
The target serum  level for cyclosporine  is 120-200 ng/mL  
 
Dose adjustments are based upon clinical judgment of the managing physician after considering 
clinical toxicity, serum levels, GVHD, concomitant drug use and the rate of rise or decline of the 
serum level.  A reaso nable approach that incorporates these principles into a management 
algorithm is suggested in Table 2. 5b. and “Sirolimus & CNI Therapy Physician Guide” 
which attempts to target steady state blood trough levels within relatively narrow therapeutic 
ranges wi th the goal of preventing combined toxicities of sirolimus and calcineurin inhibitors.  
 
The suggested frequency for monitoring sirolimus and CNI blood levels varies from monthly to 
twice weekly based upon the guidance provided in Table 2. 5b.  Monitoring fr equency takes into 
consideration changes in renal function and changes in concomitant medications which are 
known to affect levels by altering the metabolism of either sirolimus or CNIs.  It is important to 
recognize that drug -related toxicities occur with  greater frequency when sirolimus and CNIs are 
given concomitantly ( also see Sections 2.5.1.3-2.5.1.5).  
 
Whole blood levels of CNIs will be measured by high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) or HPLC with tandem mass spectrometric detection  (preferr ed methods) or equivalent 
method with correlation coefficient ≥ 0.90 .

Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-12 Other Important Considerations :  
• Children  generally require a larger total daily dose of CNI by we ight than adults. If aged 
< 6 years, every 8 hour administration may be required to maintain desirable serum 
trough levels. For those patients in whom adequate serum trough levels cannot be 
maintained using intermittent oral or IV dosing, continuous IV inf usion may be 
warranted.  
• Review of concomitant medications for potential interactions that may significantly 
alter serum CNIs levels (see Section 2. 5.2.7-2.5.2.8) is essential  because  CNIs undergo 
extensive metabolism by the hepatic and intestinal cytochro me P -450 system which may 
impact toxicity and efficacy of CNIs.   
• Although elevated CNI blood levels are more frequently associated with toxicity 
(especially renal or hepatic), “therapeutic” CNI blood levels may also be associated with 
toxicity  (e.g. signi ficant tremors). Therefore, dose decreases are recommended for 
significant organ toxicities that manifest despite a “therapeutic” CNI level.  
• Emesis : A repeat dose of CNI may be given if emesis occurs within 15 minutes of a 
dose.  
• CNIs should be administere d at a consistent time each day and in relation to meals.  
Neoral oral solution should be administered in orange or apple juice at room temperature.   
• Subjects should avoid beverages containing the enzyme bergamottin  (grapefruit juice, 
Sunny Delight, Fresc a, and Squirt) when taking CNIs.  
• Distal paraesthetic pain or burning during the infusion  may be alleviated by extending 
the IV infusion time for Sandimmune from the standard of 1 hour to as long as 6 hours. 
Alternatively, cyclosporine may be administered as a continuous infusion over 24 hours 
for patients intolerant of intermittent administration.  
• Monitor closely for an acute allergic reaction for the first 30 minutes after starting 
tacrolimus IV infusion and at frequent intervals thereafter.   
• Intravenou s route of administration is preferred for patients with progressive GVHD 
of the liver or gastro -intestinal tract  until GVHD is clinically improved and the oral 
route reliable.  
• If the oral route becomes temporarily unfeasible and conversion to the intraven ous 
formulation is required the following recommendations are made:  
Starting Oral  
Formulation  Conversion to IV formulation  
Prograf®  IV Prograf = 0.25 x total daily dose of oral Prograf  but should be 
given as continuous daily infusion  
Neoral®  IV Sandimmun e = 0.4 x total daily dose of Neoral  
Gengraf®  IV Sandimmune = 0.4 x total daily dose of Gengraf  
Sandimmune®  IV Sandimmune = 0.25 x total daily dose of oral Sandimmune

2-13 2.5.2.4.  Tacrolimus adverse reactions  
 
The primary toxicities in large controlled trials were  reversible renal insufficiency, hypertension, 
hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, and neurological toxicity (tremor and 
headache).  With the IV formulation, there is also an infusional toxicity of the cremaphor diluent.  
There is increased risk o f opportunistic infections and secondary malignancies.  Some of these 
toxicities are recognized complications of transplantation.

2-14 2.5.2.5.  Cyclosporine adverse reactions  
 
The toxicities of cyclosporine are similar to tacrolimus but not overlapping ( see Section 2.5.2).  
Common toxiciti es include: hypertension, tremor, hirsuitism, hyperlipidemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypomagnesemia, elevated creatinine/BUN, hyperglycemia, paraesthesiae, gingival hyperplasia, 
abnormal LFTs, acne, reduced bicarbonate, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, nausea, vomit ing, 
CNS disturbances and potential for TTP/HUS/TMA similar to tacrolimus and exacerbated by 
sirolimus (see Section 2.5.2.4 ), gynecomastia, and with the IV form: flushing, erythema, skin 
bullae.  
 
2.5.2.6.  Management of tacrolimus and cyclosporine toxicities  
 
Please  see Section 2. 5.1.4 and Table 2. 5b for management of nephrotoxicity, Thrombotic 
Microangiopathy and hyperlipidemia . 
 
2.5.2.7.  Tacrolimus drug interactions  
 
Tacrolimus is a substrate for cytochrome CYP 3A4 enzyme systems.  
 
Drugs that may increase tacrolimus blood concentrations include CYP 3A4 inhibitors:  
• Calcium Channel Blockers: diltiazem, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil. Tacrolimus 
should be monitored and a dose adjustment may be necessary.  
• Triazole antifungal agents: fluconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole , posaconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole.  See Section 2. 7.1 for recommendations for preemptive dose 
reduction of CNI doses  when initiating triazole antifungal therapy  (Table 2. 7a.) and 
anticipated need to increase CNI doses after triazole antifungal the rapy is discontinued 
(Table 2. 7b.). 
• Macrolide antibiotics: clarithromycin, troleandomycin.  
• Gastrointestinal prokinetics: cisapride, metocloproramide.  
• Other: cyclosporine, ethinyl estradiol, omperazole, lansoprazole, methylprednisolone.  
 
Drugs that may decr ease tacrolimus blood concentrations include CYP 3A4 inducers :  
• Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, phenytoin.  
• Antimicrobials: Rifampin, rifabutin, caspofungin.  
• Herbs: St. John’s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ). 
 
Due to potential for additive or syn ergistic impairment of renal function, care should be taken 
when administering tacrolimus with drugs that may be associated with renal dysfunction.  These 
include but are not limited to amphotericin B products, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, 
trimethoprim wit h sulfamethoxazole, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, statins, angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists, and diuretics.

Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-15 2.5.2.8.  Cyclosporine drug interactions  
 
The drug interactions for cyclosporine are similar or identical to tacrolimus (see Section 2. 5.2.7).  
Postmarketing cases of myositis, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with 
concomitant administration of cyclosporine with HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) which 
should be used with caution and at doses which are reduced doses according to label 
recommen dations.  
 
2.5.3.  Prednisone  
 
2.5.3.1.  Initiating prednisone therapy  
 
Prednisone  is administered initially as a single early morning dose of 1 mg/kg/day [or equivalent 
(adults: maximum dose 100 mg, age < 17 years: adjusted body weight as per institutional 
guidelines for pa tients who weigh > 110% of ideal body weight) ].   
 
If prednisone (or equivalent) at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day is contraindicated (e.g. poorly controlled 
diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, avascular bone necrosis, major mood disturbance) patients 
may begin p rednisone between 0.5 -1 mg/kg/day.   
 
Prednisone therapy continues at the initial dose until there is objective evidence of improvement 
in manifestations of chronic GVHD.  
 
2.5.3.2.  Monitoring  
 
Prednisone therapy will be monitored according to institutional guidel ines. 
 
2.5.3.3.  Prednisone adverse reactions  
 
The side effects of prednisone are broad and well recognized.  They include but are not limited 
to: fluid and sodium retention, hypokalemia, hypertension, myopathy, muscle wasting, altered 
body habitus with cushingoid a ppearance, osteoporosis, tendon rupture, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, 
impaired wound healing, thin fragile skin, petechiae and ecchymoses, ruddy facies, negative 
nitrogen balance, pseudotumor cerebri, headache, secondary adrenal insufficiency, suppression 
of growth in children, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, posterior subcapsular cataracts, 
glaucoma, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, severe depression, emotional 
instability, and frank psychosis.  
 
2.6. Approach to Tapering Immunosuppressive Therap y 
 
The recommended sequence is to taper prednisone, then CNI (for study subjects on Arm 2) and, 
finally sirolimus.  The suggestions for taper schedules are explained in Sections 2.1 (schematic 
overviews) and 2. 6.1 - 2.6.2 below.  Minor variations in these tapers are expected based on the 
physician discretion which considers individual clinical circumstances.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-16 2.6.1.  Prednisone Taper  
 
The initial taper of prednisone (or equivalent) from the starting dose of 0.5 -1 mg/kg/ every day  is 
attempted within 2 weeks a fter the first evidence of improvement in GVHD and takes place over 
4-8 weeks to achieve a dose of 0.5 -1 mg/kg/ every -other -day.   
 
Every -other -day dosing, in which twice the usual daily dose of prednisone is administered every 
other morning provides the pa tient requiring long -term pharmacologic dosing with the beneficial 
effects of glucocorticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary -
adrenal suppression, the cushingoid state, glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth 
suppre ssion in children.  Note that this approach may not be appropriate for every patient 
because of complications associated with large swings in prednisone dose.  
 
Once an alternating -day prednisone regimen is achieved, it is recommended that the dose of 
prednisone be held constant for 10 -12 weeks until all reversible manifestations of chronic GVHD 
have resolved, after which a second taper may be attempted.  The tempo of this second taper may 
follow individual institutional guidelines but it is recommended tha t the extent of the taper be 
approximately calibrated to the magnitude of an individual patient’s alternating -day prednisone 
dose.  For example, a patient whose prednisone dose has been stable at 0.5 mg/kg/every -other -
day may attempt to taper prednisone co mpletely.  However, a patient whose prednisone dose has 
been stable at 1.0 mg/kg/every -other -day is recommended first to taper over 4 -8 weeks to 0.5 
mg/kg/every -other -day, followed by 2 -3 months of further observation before attempting a 
complete taper.  
 
2.6.2.  Sirolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor Tapers  
 
Arm 1  (Prednisone + Sirolimus):  
Sirolimus may be tapered at the discretion of the managing physician over 1 -3 months after 
prednisone has been discontinued.  The recommended approach is to monitor and confirm th e 
stability of GVHD response for 1 -3 months before tapering sirolimus.  Please see Section  2.6.1 
regarding the taper of prednisone.  
 
Arm 2  (Prednisone + Sirolimus + Calcineurin Inhibitor):  
After prednisone is discontinued, the order and approach for taper ing sirolimus or the CNI 
occurs at the discretion of managing physician.  The recommended approach is to monitor and 
confirm the stability of GVHD response for 1 -3 months before tapering the CNI over 3 -6 
months.  A similar 1 -3 month period of monitoring to  confirm the stability of GVHD response to 
stopping the CNI is recommended prior to attempting taper or discontinuation of sirolimus.  
Please see Section 2.6.1 regarding the taper of prednisone.

Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-17 2.7. Supportive Care  
 
All supportive care will be in keeping with  BMT CTN Manual of Procedures and local 
institutional guidelines that reflect reasonable standard practices appropriate to the patient with 
chronic GVHD as outlined by the Ancillary Therapy and Supportive Care Working Group 
Report of the NIH Consensus Deve lopment Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic 
GVHD.2  Supportive care should be administered in a similar fashion to subjects randomized to 
both arms of the study.  
 
2.7.1.  Concomitant Azole Therapy  
 
Antif ungal prophylaxis: Triazole antifungal medications are expected to increase serum CNI and 
sirolimus levels, therefore, dosages of CNIs and sirolimus, should be adjusted accordingly using 
the guidelines recommended in Table 2. 7a. and 2. 7b.  Due to extreme i nteractions with 
sirolimus, voriconazole is contraindicated during sirolimus therapy.   In the event of 
suspected or documented fungal infection, alternative antifungal therapy should be used 
wherever possible.

2. If an voriconazole m ust be added to control fungal infection then following the 90% reduction in 
sirolimus dosing55 and/or 50% -67% reduction in CNI dosing SRL and/or CNI serum levels 
should be measured 24 -48 hours later and then every 3 -4 days until levels are stable and in th e 
desired range.   If voriconazole is given intravenously or if voriconazole and sirolimus are not 
given together, these guidelines may not apply because the effect on bioavailability of sirolimus 
will be weaker.  
3. Note that sirolimus tablets should not be sp lit or crushed .  Fractional dose of sirolimus may be 
achieved by drawing an appropriate volume of the 1 mg/mL oral liquid formulation into a 1 mL 
syringe and swallowed directly (or mixed with water  or orange juice ; no other liquids, including 
grapefruit ju ice, should be used for dilution ). 
4. If posaconazole or itraconazole or high -dose fluconazole are added then SRL and/or CNI serum 
levels should be followed 48 -72 hours later and then every 3 -5 days until levels are stable and in 
the desired range.

Note:   Although sirolimus and CNI doses may need to be substantially increased when azole therapy is 
stopped , the azole mediated inhibition of cytochrome CYP 3A4 (and other) and P -glycoprotein may take 
5-10 days to abate and therefore immediate dose increases are not advised.  Rather, sirolimus and CNI 
dose increases should be cautious and based on more frequent monitoring of the sirolimus and/or CNI 
levels as appropriate.   
 
2.8. Drug Information  
 
2.8.1.  Description, Administration and Storage  
 
2.8.1.1.  Sirolimus (rapamy cin, Rapamune®)  
 
Sirolimus is a naturally occurring compound produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus.  In 
addition to its immunosuppressive properties, sirolimus has antifungal, antiviral and 
antineoplastic properties ( see also Section 1. 3). 
 
1) Oral soluti on:  
Sirolimus oral solution is supplied in cartons of 2 oz (60 mL fill) or 5 oz (150 mL fill) 
amber glass bottles, or foil pouches.  The oral solution contains sirolimus at a 
concentration of 1 mg/mL and the following inactive ingredients: Phosal 50 PG 
(phosphatidylcholine, propylene glycol, monodiglycerides, ethanol, soy fatty acids, and 
ascorbyl palmitate) and polysorbate 80.  The oral solution also contains 1.5% - 2.5% 
ethanol.  The appropriate dose of sirolimus oral solution should be measured using t he 
provided amber colored oral syringe and is diluted in at least 2 oz (1/4 cup) of water or 
orange juice to improve palatability.  No other liquids, including grapefruit juice, 
should be used for dilution.   After vigorous mixing, the diluted dose should b e taken 
immediately.  Refill the container with an additional volume (recommended minimum of 
4 oz (1/2 cup) of water or orange juice, stir vigorously, and drink or administer at once to 
assure delivery of all of the medication.  Small children may not be a ble to consume the 
recommended volumes of water or orange juice suggested for dilution and may need 
lesser volumes.  
 
Sirolimus oral solution provided in bottles may develop a slight haze when refrigerated.  
If such a haze occurs allow the product to stand at room temperature and shake gently 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-19 until the haze disappears.  The presence of this haze does not affect the quality of the 
product. Rapamune® Oral Solution bottles and pouches should be stored protected from 
light and refrigerated at 2 C to 8C (36F to 46F).  The syringe should be discarded after 
one use.  After dilution, the preparation should be used immediately.  
 
2) Tablets :  
Sirolimus tablets are available as white, tan or yellow -to-beige triangular -shaped tablets 
marked “RAPAMUNE 1 mg ,” “RAPAMUNE 0.5 mg” or “RAPAMUNE 2 mg” 
respectively, in bottles containing 100 tablets or cartons containing 10 blister cards each 
with 10 tablets  (0.5 mg and 1 mg formulation s only) .  Each tablet contains sirolimus and 
the following inactive ingredients: sucrose, lac tose, polyethylene glycol 8000, calcium 
sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical glaze, talc, titanium dioxide, 
magnesium stearate, povidone, poloxamer 188, polyethylene glycol 20,000, glyceryl 
monooleate, carnauba wax, and other ingredients.  The 0.5 mg and 2 mg tablets also 
contain yellow iron (ferric) oxide and brown iron (ferric) oxide.  Sirolimus tablets should 
be stored at 20  to 25C (68 - 77F).  Cartons should be used to protect blister cards and 
strips from light.  Sirolimus tablets sh ould be dispensed in a tight, light -resistant 
container.   Sirolimus tablets should not be split  or crushed . 
 
3) Pharmacology : 
The absorption of sirolimus is rapid after administration of Rapamune Oral Solution, 
with a mean T max of 1-2 hours in different s tudy populations. Oral bioavailability is only 
14% in stable renal transplant patients due to first pass metabolism in the liver and the 
intestinal wall, plus countertransport in the gut lumen by P -glycoprotein. Mean 
bioavailability of sirolimus after admi nistration of the tablet is about 27% higher relative 
to the oral solution. However, clinical equivalence has been demonstrated for the 2 -mg 
dose.  Coadministration with high fat meals leads to reduced C max, prolonged T max and 
increased AUC, meaning that s irolimus should be taken consistently with or without 
food. The distribution of sirolimus is notable for extensive partitioning into blood cells 
and approximately 92% is bound to human plasma proteins.  Sirolimus is a substrate for 
CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotei n, and is extensively metabolized by O -demethylation and/or 
hydroxylation to at least 7 major metabolites.  The parent compound contributes to more 
than 90% of the immunosuppressive activity.  The excretion of Sirolimus is 91% fecal 
and only 2.2% via the u rine. 
 
Whole blood sirolimus trough levels in renal transplant recipients who were administered 
daily doses of 2 mg or 5 mg at 4 hours after Neoral®) were 8.59 ± 4.01 ng/mL and 17.3 ± 
7.4 ng/mL, respectively , as measured by LC/MS/MS.  Whole blood trough le vels 
significantly correlated with steady state AUC (r2=0.96).  Six days of multiple dosing 
were required to achieve steady state.  Alternatively, a loading dose of three times the 
maintenance dose will provide near steady state concentrations within one d ay in most 
patients.  
 
The mean  SD terminal elimination half life (T 1/2) of sirolimus after multiple dosing in 
stable renal transplant patients was 62  16 hours.  The mean T 1/2 increased from 79  12 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-20 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function to 113   41 hours in patients with 
impaired hepatic function.  Dosage reduction is recommended for patients with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment.  Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in pediatric 
patients with chronically impaired renal function but i ndicates similar T max (0.62 -1.6 h) 
and T 1/2 (31-111h).  Clearance is slower in males compared to females but dose 
adjustments based on gender are not recommended.  There were no differences between 
African Americans and non -African Americans.  
 
2.8.1.2.  Tacrolimus ( FK-506, Prograf®)  
 
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis  that 
inhibits T -lymphocyte activation, although the exact mechanism of action is not known.  
Experimental evidence suggests that tacrolimus binds to an int racellular protein, FKBP -12. A 
complex of tacrolimus -FKBP -12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the 
phosphatase activity of calcineurin inhibited.  This effect may prevent the dephosphorylation and 
translocation of nuclear factor of a ctivated T -cells (NF -AT), a nuclear component thought to 
initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines like interleukin -2 and gamma 
interferon.  The net result is the inhibition of T -lymphocyte activation.  Tacrolimus may also 
inhibit cellul ar activities such as nitric oxide synthetase activation and apoptosis, and may 
potentiate the action of corticosteroids in these processes.  
 
1) Oral capsules :  
Tacrolimus (Prograf®) is available as oblong shaped, light yellow (0.5 mg), white (1 
mg), or gr ayish -red (5 mg) capsules supplied in bottles containing 100 capsules or cartons 
containing 10 blister cards each with 10 capsules.  Capsules should be stored at 25 C 
(77F). 
 
2) IV solution :  
Tacrolimus IV solution is supplied in 1 mL ampoules that contai n 5 mg of anhydrous 
tacrolimus (concentration of 5 mg/mL) and should be stored between 5 C to 25C (41F 
– 77F). 
 
Tacrolimus Injection must be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% 
Dextrose Injection before use to a concentration between 0.004  mg/mL and 0.02 mg/mL. 
Diluted infusion solution should be stored in glass or polyethylene containers and should 
be discarded after 24 hours.  The polyoxyethylated castor oil contained in the concentrate 
for intravenous infusion can cause phthalate strippi ng from PVC .  It is strongly 
recommended that glass bottles and non -PVC tubing be used to minimize patient 
exposure to phthalates .  Due to the chemical instability of tacrolimus in alkaline media, 
Tacrolimus Injection should not be mixed or co -infused with  solutions of pH 9 or greater 
(e.g., ganciclovir or acyclovir).  
 
3) Pharmacology : 
The absorption of tacrolimus after oral administration is incomplete and variable and 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-21 absolute bioavailability was 17 -23% and the T max was 1.5 -3 hours in different study 
populations.  The rate and extent was greatest under fasted conditions and least with high 
fat or high carbohydrate meals.  Tacrolimus binding to plasma proteins is 99% which is 
independent of concentrations ranging from 5 -50 ng/mL.  Tacrolimus is also highly  
associated with erythrocytes.  Tacrolimus is a substrate for mixed -function oxidase 
system, primarily CYP3A4, and is extensively metabolized by demethylation and 
hydroxylation to a possible 8 major metabolites.  The parent compound is primarily 
responsibl e for the immunosuppressive activity.  The excretion of orally administered 
tacrolimus is 92% fecal and 2.3% via the urine.  Typical whole blood tacrolimus trough 
levels after the recommended oral doses of 0.1 -0.2 mg/kg/day were 5 -20 ng/mL as 
measured by L C/MS/MS.   The mean terminal elimination half life (T 1/2) of tacrolimus 
after multiple dosing in different study populations was 11 -34 hours.  The T 1/2 in children 
was generally at the lower range and showed that children needed higher doses than 
adults to achieve similar trough concentrations.  The mean T 1/2 was reduced by 2 -3-fold 
in patients with impaired hepatic function.  Dosage reduction is recommended for 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  A  retrospective comparison of 
African America n and Caucasian kidney transplant patients indicated that African 
American patients required higher tacrolimus doses to attain similar trough 
concentrations; there were no gender -based differences.  
 
2.8.1.3.  Cyclosporine  
 
Cyclosporine is a cyclic polypeptide immuno suppressant agent produced by the fungus species 
Beauveria nivea .  While the molecular structure of cyclosporine is distinct from tacrolimus, their 
mechanism of action is almost indistinguishable and involves inhibition of calcineurin and the 
resulting act ivation cascade leads to inhibition of T cell signaling (see Section 2.8.1.2 ).  
Cyclophilin is the cytosolic binding protein for cyclosporine that is distinct from FK -binding 
protein.  
 
1) Oral formulations :  
Cyclosporine is most commonly prescribed as soft  gelatin capsules (Neoral®) or 
modified oral solution (Neoral® Oral Solution) that have increased bioavailability in 
comparison to the less commonly used Sandimmune formulations.  Neoral® and 
Sandimmune® cannot be used interchangeably and care must be exer cised when 
converting from high doses of Sandimmune® to Neoral®.  Neoral® capsules are 
available in two strengths: 25 mg (oval, blue -gray) or 100 mg (oblong, blue -gray) 
imprinted in red. Neoral® Oral solution is available in 50 mL bottles of yellow liquid 
containing 100 mg/mL of cyclosporine.  Both Neoral® formulations contain 11.9% v/v 
alchohol.  Neoral® capsules and oral solution should be stored at 20 -25C (68F -77F) 
and not in the refrigerator.  Sandimmune® capsules are available in two strengths: 25  mg 
(oblong, pink) or 100 mg (oblong, dusty rose), in unit dose packages of 30 capsules that 
should be stored at 25 C (77F).  Sandimmune® Oral solution is available in 50 mL 
bottles of yellow liquid containing 100 mg/mL of cyclosporine.  Both Sandimmune® 
formulations contain ~12.5% v/v alcohol.   
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
2-22 2) IV solution :  
Sandimmune® IV solution is supplied in 5 mL ampoules that contain 50 mg of 
cyclosporine per mL, Cremaphor and 32.9% alcohol v/v.  It should be stored at 
temperatures below 30 C (86F) but not in the refrigerator and should be protected from 
light.  
 
3) Pharmacology : 
The absorption of cyclosporine after oral administration is incomplete ly dependent on the 
individual patient, patient population and the formulation.  Cyclosporine is excreted in 
human  milk.  The absolute oral bioavailability of Sandimmune® was 10% -89% in adults 
and had not been determined for Neoral®.  Mean cyclosporine AUC is generally 20% -
50% greater, and C max 40%-106% greater, with Neoral® compared to Sandimmune®, 
respectively.  The  Tmax following oral administration of Neoral® is 1.5 -2 hours.  The rate 
and extent of absorption were lower with low or high fat meals.  Cyclosporine binding to 
plasma proteins is 90%, primarily lipoproteins.  Cyclosporine is 33% -47% in the plasma, 
4%-9% in lymphocytes, and 41% -58% in erythrocytes.  Cyclosporine is extensively 
metabolized CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney.  At 
least 25 metabolites have been identified in bile, feces, blood and urine but the parent 
compo und is primarily responsible for the immunosuppressive activity.  Elimination is 
primarily biliary with only 6% of the dose excreted in urine. The mean terminal 
elimination half life (T 1/2) of cyclosporine is 8.4 hours (range 5 -18 hours).  The T 1/2 in 
children was generally at the lower range and showed that children needed higher doses 
than adults to achieve similar trough concentrations.  The mean T 1/2 was reduced by 2 -3-
fold in patients with impaired hepatic function.  Dosage reduction is recommended for  
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  A  retrospective comparison of 
African American and Caucasian kidney transplant patients indicated that African 
American patients required higher tacrolimus doses to attain similar trough 
concentrations; there were no gender -based differences.  
 
2.8.1.4.  Glucocorticoids  
 
Naturally occurring glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects which include 
modification of the body’s immune system.  
 
The most commonly used glucocorticoid formulations for the tr eatment of chronic GVHD are 
prednisone tablets which are available in a variety of strengths ranging from 1 mg up to 50 mg. 
The most commonly used intravenous formulation is methylprednisolone.

3. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
3.1. Definition of High -Risk vs. St andard -Risk  
 
The definition of high -risk and standard -risk patients is as follows:  
1) High -risk defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria:  
a) Patients with platelets < 100,000  
b) Patients > 50% skin involvement  
c) Patients with bronchiolitis obliter ans 
d) Patients receiving prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) at the time of cGVHD 
diagnosis  
2) Standard -risk not meeting the high -risk criteria above.  
 
3.2. Primary Endpoint  
 
Treatment success will be defined according to the local physician’s response.  
 
Phase II Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is a comparison of the proportion of treatment successes in patients at 6 
months after randomization in both study arms.  Treatment success is defined as a study subject 
who is alive and who achieved a complete or part ial response .  The subject  did not receive 
secondary systemic immunosuppressive therapy and had  no subsequent progression or 
additional secondary immunosuppressi ve therapy added through 6 months after 
randomization.   Relapse is considered a competing risk and is not included in the primary 
endpoint definition.  
 
Phase III Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is a comparison of the proportion of treatment success in patients at 24 
months after randomization in both study arms.  Treatment success is defined as a stud y subject 
who is alive and who achieved complete resolution of all reversible manifestations at 24 
months after randomization and did not receive secondary systemic immunosuppressive 
therapy .   
 
3.3. Secondary Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints will explore cli nically relevant presumed associations with the primary 
endpoint of response.  These will be evaluated at baseline, and between 2 months and 3 years 
after the start of therapy depending on the specific endpoint.

Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
3-2 3.3.1.  Prednisone Sparing  
 
The percent reduction  in the average daily dose of prednisone (or equivalent) will be calculated 
at 6 and 12 months (Phase II/III) and, additionally at 24 and 36 months (Phase III) after study 
entry based upon the prednisone doses that will be captured on case report forms up to 36 
months from randomization.  
 
3.3.2.  Use of Secondary Therapy  
 
Treatment failure is defined at the time any secondary systemic therapy is added to control 
manifestations of chronic GVHD .  Secondary systemic therapy includes any intervention 
intended to contr ol chronic GVHD through an immunosuppressive effect from oral or parenteral 
administration of any systemic medication not originally given under the auspices of this 
protocol for treatment of chronic GVHD.  Examples include, but are not limited to the foll owing:  
cyclosporine or tacrolimus(Study Arm 1 only), and extracorporeal photopheresis , mycophenolate 
mofetil, azathioprine, rituximab, infliximab, daclizumab, etanercept, antithymocyte globulin, 
pentostatin, thalidomide,  and hydroxy chloroquine  (Arms 1 and  2). 
 
Any increase in the dose of prednisone (or equivalent) and any resumption of treatment with 
prednisone, after previous discontinuation following the diagnosis of chronic GVHD for any 
reason is not considered as secondary systemic therapy.  However, p rednisone pulses exceeding 
2 mg/kg/day are considered secondary therapy.  
 
Any increase in the dose of CNI or sirolimus, or resumption of treatment with CNI or sirolimus 
after previous discontinuation for any reason is not considered as secondary systemic t herapy, if 
the drug in question was included in the immunosuppressive regimen when treatment for chronic 
GVHD was started.  
 
A change in treatment from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa because of drug toxicity is 
not considered as secondary treatme nt, but any such change made because of uncontrolled 
chronic GVHD is considered as secondary treatment.   Sirolimus may  be discontinued for 
toxicities without counting as treatment failure unless a new systemic therapy is added for 
control of GVHD . 
 
Topical  therapy, including glucocorticoid creams, topical tacrolimus, oral beclomethasone or 
budesonide, topical azathioprine and ophthalmic glucocorticoids, is not considered as secondary 
systemic therapy.  
 
3.3.3.  Symptomatic  Patient -Reported  Chronic GVHD   
 
Symptomatic  chronic GVHD will be defined as severity of chronic GVHD symptoms  as reported 
by patients on the Patient Surveys.  Prevalence rates will be calculated and compared between 
groups at 1 and 2 years (Phase II/III) and, additionally at 3 years for Phase III co mponent.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
3-3 3.3.4.  Permanent Discontinuation of all Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy  
 
Cumulative incidence curves of discontinuation of all systemic IST at 1 and 2 years (Phase II/III) 
and, additionally at 3 years for the Phase III component, will be calculated based upon the time 
that all systemic IST has been discontinued after resolution of all reversible manifestations of 
chronic GVHD.  Death or drop out with lack of follow -up information after resolution of all 
reversible manifestations of chronic GVHD and d iscontinuation of all systemic IST but before 
the final analysis is expected to occur infrequently and will be categorized as successful 
discontinuation of IST for the purposes of this study since the treatment had been successful in 
controlling chronic GV HD.  Discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications for the purpose 
of inducing an anti -tumor response after the development of recurrent or secondary malignancy 
will not be counted as successful discontinuation of IST.   If a patient requires only physio logical 
doses of glucocorticoid to treat adrenal insufficiency when the final immunosuppressive agent is 
discontinued then it is acceptable to assign the designation: “permanent discontinuation of all 
systemic immunosuppressive therapy”.  
 
3.3.5.  Overall Survival  
 
Overall survival  probabilities will be  compared between treatment arm s adjusting for  
significantly imbalanced covariates.  Patients are considered a failure of this endpoint if they die 
from any cause.  The time to this event is the time from randomizatio n to death, loss to follow up 
or end of study whichever comes first.  Overall survival will be assessed 1 and 2 years from the 
time of randomization (Phase II/III) and, additionally at 3 years for the Phase III component.   
 
3.3.6.  Progression -Free Survival  
 
Prog ression -free survival will be assessed 1 and 2 years from the time of randomization (Phase 
II/III) and, additionally at 3 yea rs for the Phase III component.  Progression of a cancer is 
defined as any clinical evidence of progression or relapsed disease, or  any therapy used to treat 
persistent, progressive, or relapsed disease including withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy 
or DLI.    
 
3.3.7.  Biomarkers  
 
T-regs, B -cell and plasma BAFF levels will be enumerated at baseline and months two and six 
after randomizatio n as long as patients do not start secondary therapy.  If secondary systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy is  prescribed, samples should be drawn for T regs,  B cell, and 
plasma BAFF  levels prior to initiation of secondary therapy.  
  
3.3.8.  NIH and Other New Response Instruments  
 
An important secondary endpoint of this study will be to test more objective, clinically relevant 
CR and PR criteria using instruments that have been recommended along the lines of the NIH 
Consensus guidelines52  A comprehensive assessment of organ involvement using the NIH 
Consensus response assessment tools and other study instruments will be performed at baseline, 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
3-4 2 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years (Phase II/III) and additionally at 3 years ( Phase III), and 
in the event that a subject prematurely discontinues the study.  
 
3.3.9.  Quality of Life  
 
Health Related Quality of Life will be described prior to the initiation of therapy for patients 
utilizing the FACT -BMT self report, transplant specific quest ionnaire and the generic quality of 
life tool, the SF -36.  The questionnaires will be scored according to standard procedures.   They 
will be due at baseline and months 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36. 
 
3.4. Safety  Endpoints  
 
Monitoring of several safety endpoints will be conducted monthly and be used to form the basis 
of the stopping guidelines  detailed in Section 5.4.  The key safety endpoint is mortality at 56  
days after randomization .  Two additional non -hematological toxicities will also be monitored:  
Thrombotic Microa ngiopathy (TMA) and Pneumonitis  (NIP).   
 
3.4.1.  Mortality  
 
The rate of mortality will be monitored up to 56 days post -randomization.  Monitoring will be 
performed monthly beginning after the third month of enrollment until enrollment is closed.  At 
least three ev ents must be observed in order to trigger review.  
 
3.4.2.  Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)  
 
This complication might be expected to occur more frequently in the sirolimus and calcineurin -
inhibitor containing arm than in the other arm  (see Section 2. 5.1.4). 
 
3.4.3.  Pneumo nitis (NIP)  
 
Sirolimus associated NIP is poorly understood but has been reported after solid organ 
transplantation.  NIP appears to be uncommon although the exact incidence is unknown.  NIP 
should be suspected if a patient develops fatigue, fever and/or dy spnea within weeks to months 
after starting sirolimus; especially in patients > age 40 years, when patients have been converted 
from CNI -based IST to sirolimus -based IST, and when sirolimus levels have exceeded 
12 ng/mL.  Radiological pulmonary infiltrates  are invariably observed and often resemble 
bronchiolitis obliterans -organizing pneumonia (BOOP) , more currently referred to as crytogenic 
organizing pneumonia (COP) .  Sirolimus associated NIP symptoms are generally readily 
reversible within 14 -28 days whe n sirolimus is stopped ; although , pulmonary infiltrates may take 
3-6 months to resolve.  Sirolim us should not be restarted if sirolimus -associated NIP is 
diagnosed.

4. PATIENT REGISTRATION , RANDOMIZATION AND ENROLLMENT  
 
4.1. Approaching Patients, El igibility Screening and Obtaining Consent  
 
Subjects will be approached for this protocol after they have developed chronic GVHD. 
Transplant physicians will evaluate patient eligibility for randomization on to this protocol (see 
Section 2.3).  If the patien t has already been discharged from the transplant center, the patient’s 
current managing physician may contact the transplant center to determine patient eligibility for 
randomization.  Eligibility criteria will be verified and ineligible patients will pro ceed off study 
and no further follow -up will be obtained.  Eligible patients willing to potentially participate in 
the trial will have a thorough discussion about the protocol with a transplant center physician 
who is an investigator or sub -investigator.  If necessary, this discussion may take place by 
telephone.  The patient (or guardian) will be given a copy of the IRB -approved consent 
document to review before this discussion.  During the discussion, the purposes of the study, 
procedures and alternative forms of therapy will be presented as objectively as possible, and the 
potential benefits and risks of participation will be explained.  The patient (or guardian) will be 
given a copy of the entire signed consent document to keep.  The last page of the con sent 
document must be signed by the patient (or guardian) and by the physician who discussed the 
protocol.  Transplant center personnel will record the documentation of patient consent in 
EMMES AdvantageEDCSM (Electronic Data Capture, an Internet -based dat a entry system) and 
patients will be enroll ed through AdvantageEDC.  
 
4.2. Randomization  
 
Once the subject is deemed eligible and has given written informed consent, and the transplant 
center has confirmed patient eligibility  in AdvantageEDC , randomization occu rs.  See Section 
5.1.2  for further details on the randomization process.  
 
4.3. Treatment Scheduling  
 
Treatment scheduling begins as soon as possible after a patient has undergone baseline screening 
evaluations and randomization in AdvantageEDC (see Section 4. 4, and in particular, baseline 
screening Section 4.4.1.1 ). 
 
4.4. Study Monitoring  
 
4.4.1.  Patient Assessments  
 
A) Study Endpoint  Assessments  are study specific and include comprehensive NIH style 
evaluations of chronic GVHD and blood for biomarkers as shown in Table 4. 4a.  Results of 
these assessments will be recorded on Case Report Forms. A recommended target day range for 
these visits ( Table 4. 4b.) is computed based on date of signed written consent and is displayed 
for printing in AdvantageEDC.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
4-2  
Patients who discontin ue therapy early will still be followed through the duration of the study for 
the scheduled Study Endpoint Assessments (Table 4. 4a.) and Clinical Assessments (Table 4. 4b) 
relevant to analysis of secondary endpoints.  
 
B) Clinical Assessment Visits  that are considered standard care for the average patient being 
treated with CNI and/or sirolimus based therapy for chronic GVHD.  Assessments include 
history, physical exam, height, weight, directed evaluation of GVHD/toxicity, CBC and platelets, 
blood chemistry p anel, serum lipids, pulmonary function tests, drug levels, and prednisone dose 
as shown in Table 4. 4a.  A recommended target day range for these visits ( Table 4. 4c.) is 
computed based on date of signed written consent and is displayed for printing in 
Advan tageEDC.  However, the visit frequency and target day range should be dictated mainly by 
good clinical practice with a focus on safe delivery of immunosuppressive therapy as 
recommended by the monitoring approach in Table 2. 5b. and/or the form entitled: “S irolimus & 
CNI Therapy Physician Guide .”

5-1 CHAPTER 5  
 
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
5.1. Study Design  
 
The protocol is designed as a combined Phase II/III, randomized, open label, multicenter, 
prospective comparative study o f sirolimus plus prednisone (SP) versus sirolimus/calcineurin -
inhibitor plus prednisone (SPC) for the treatment of chronic GVHD.  The target enrollment is 
300 patients across both phases of the study.   
 
After 50 patients per study arm in the  Phase  II stud y have been accrued ( 100 total) and followed 
for the 6 month CR+PR rate, a decision will be made about whether  to continue in the Phase  III 
study.  At this point an additional 200 patients will be randomized on the Phase  III study, so that 
the final sample  size for the Phase  III comparison will be 300 patients.  A schema illustrating this 
study design is given in the Protocol Synopsis.  
 
5.1.1.  Accrual  
 
It is estimated that 7 years of accrual (3 years for phase II study) will be necessary to enroll the 
targeted sam ple size.  Both Core and Affiliate  Centers will enroll patients on this study.  Accrual 
will be reported by race, ethnicity, gender, age (children defined as < 17 years).  Accrual will not 
be halted while waiting for the 6 -month response assessment on the last patient enrolled in the 
Phase II study; over -run of the Phase II accrual target is considered acceptable as long as there 
are no safety concerns.  
 
5.1.2.  Randomization  
 
All patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using random block sizes for the two arms.   
Randomization will be stratified by transplant center.   
 
5.1.3.  Primary Endpoint  
 
Treatment success will be defined according to the local physician’s response.  
 
Phase II Endpoint : The proportion of subjects with complete or partial responses after 
6 months of  therapy .   
 
Phase III Endpoint : The proportion of subjects with complete resolution of all 
reversible manifestations at 24 months after starting therapy in 
both study arms.   
 
The primary analysis will be performed using the intent -to-treat principle so t hat all randomized 
patients will be included in the analysis.   
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
5-2 5.1.4.  Primary Hypotheses  
 
The primary hypothesis is that avoidance of a calcineurin inhibitor in the treatment of chronic 
GVHD might facilitate the development of tolerance and improve the CR/PR ra tes at 6 months 
and ultimately the 24 month CR rates compared to immunosuppressive therapy regimens that 
contain a calcineurin inhibitor (the comparator arm, denoted SPC).  We are testing the null 
hypothesis .  
 
H0:p SP= p SPC  
 
Against the alternatives  
 
H1: pSP >pSPC 
 
Where p refers to the CR/PR rate at 6 months in the initial Phase  II study and to the CR rate at 
24 months for the subsequent Phase  III study.  
 
5.2. Details of Study Design and Interim Monitoring Plan for Efficacy and Futility  
 
The primary objective  of the Phase II component is to estimate the CR/PR rate for each treatment 
arm, and determine whether the SP arm is sufficiently promising to expand the trial into a Phase 
III study .  In the Phase  II trial, the Z statistic for comparing the CR/PR rates at  6 months between 
the two treatments will be computed.  The SP treatment will not be considered further if the Z 
statistic comparing its CR/PR rate to the SPC arm is ≤ 0.9.  This is approximately equivalent to 
rejecting the SP treatment for further conside ration if its CR/PR rate is not at least 9% better than 
the SPC arm, assuming an approximately 40% baseline CR+PR rate.  If the Z statistic comparing 
the CR/PR rates at 6 months is at least 3.53, then we will consider this sufficient evidence of 
efficacy t hat we will not continue randomizing patients in a Phase III trial, but will just follow 
the patients already enrolled for the 2 -year CR rate.  This corresponds approximately to a 35% 
observed improvement in CR+PR rates compared to the SPC arm.   
 
If the Phase II stud y progresses to Phase  III, the primary endpoint of the study will be switched 
to the proportion of patients in CR at 24 months.  Additional interim analyses based on this new 
primary endpoint are planned, after approximately 50 and 100 patients  per arm have been 
followed for two years, and the target final sample size is 150 patients per arm.  Although these 
interim analyses will likely not have an effect in terms of stopping accrual to the study, they are 
put into place to monitor whether the s tudy results are sufficiently strong or futile to indicate 
early presentation of study results.  This is especially important if accrual is lagging.  The 
stopping boundaries to be used and the decision algorithm for this study are given in Table 5.2.

5.2.1.  Details of Stopping Boundary Calculations  
 
Stopping boundaries for the comparison of 24 month CR rates are based on an error sp ending 
approach, using the error spending function 
3( ) min( , )tt   , which is similar to an O’Brien -
Fleming boundary.  These will be conservative since they ignore the impact of the aggressive 
futility boundary in the phase II trial on the overa ll type I error rate.  However, they provide 
control of the type I error rate even if the futility boundary is not followed exactly.  We also add 
an option for stopping the study early for efficacy at the end of the phase II study.  This is meant 
to accoun t for unexpectedly large differences in the 6 month CR+PR rate, which are unlikely to 
disappear when looking at the 24 month CR rate.  This additional stopping rule is designed very 
conservatively, and therefore has negligible impact on the type I error ra te under the overall null 
hypothesis that there is no difference between the treatments on either outcome . 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
5-4 For the futility boundary after the initial Phase II look, we use a stopping rule based on 
conditional power of less than 5% at the estimated effect  size. 
 
These boundary values are shown in Table 5.2 above for the proposed monitoring schedule using 
Monte Carlo integration, but they may be recalculated using the error spending function if the 
timing of the analyses do not match up with the planned sch edule.   
 
5.3. Operating Characteristics and Power Considerations  
 
Simulations were performed to study the operating characteristics of the study design and 
monitoring algorithm.  Binary observations modeling the 6-month CR+P R rate for the first 100 
patients we re generated according to the vector of probabilities in each group 
p(6)=(p SPC(6),p SP(6)).  Binary observations for all 300 patients analyzed in the Phase  III trial 
were generated according to 24-month CR probabilities p(24)=(p SPC(24),p SP(24),).  Note that  100 
patients will have both the 6-month and the 24-month binary outcomes, so that a model for the 
association between these must be postulated.  Odds ratios (OR) between these outcomes ranging 
from 1 (independent) to 5 to 100 (strongly positively associat ed) were used in simulations.  
Baseline 6-month CR+PR rates were expected to be approximately 40%, while baseline 24-
month CR rates were expected to be around 28% , although we also considered rates as high as 
40%.  Several type I error rate scenarios were investigated to demonstrate control at a 2.5% one -
sided level, in which p(6), p(24), and the odds ratio were modified.  For each scenario in Table 
5.3a. the stopping probabilities for futility or efficacy at each interim analysis, as well as the 
overall t ype I error rate, are given.  Note that the type I error rate is maintained conservatively in 
all situations  as expected .  Also worth noting is that if there is no difference in 6-month CR+PR 
rates, there is a n 82% chance that the study will stop at the end  of the Phase  II component  and an 
18% chance that the study will proceed to Phase III .

Next we simulated the power to identify a true difference.  Note that for a difference in outcomes 
to be detectable, it needs to be present in both the 6-month CR+PR rate a nd the 24-month CR 
rate.  The power to detect a 20% improvement in both outcomes is given in Table 5.3b . below 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
5-5 for several configurations of outcome proportions and odds ratios measuring association between 
outcomes.  This study design has at least 80% pow er to identify a 20% improvement in both 6 -
month CR+PR rates and 24-month CR rates  between the SP arm and the SPC arm .  Also worth 
noting , if the SP arm is 20% better than the SPC arm on the 6-month CR+PR rate, there is only a 
13% chance of stopping the st udy for futility at the first Phase  II analysis.

5.4. Safety Stopping Guidelines  
 
Monitoring of several  safety endpoint s will be conducted monthly, and if rates significantly 
exceed pre -set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that th e DSMB can be advised.  
Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  
The stopping guideline s serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review.  
The key safety endpoint to be monitored is m ortality.  Two additional non -hematological 
toxicities also will be monitored: Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) and Pneumonitis (NIP).  
Each outcome will be monitored using a Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) as described 
below.  A version for censo red exponential data will be used for monitoring mortality up to 56 
days, while a version for binary data will be used for monitoring the incidence of the other 
outcomes by 56 days.  The SPRT conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly 
examinati ons.  No additional control of the type I error across multiple toxicity outcomes or 
across multiple treatment groups will be used.  
 
5.4.1.  Mortality  
 
The rate of mortality will be monitored up to 56 days post -randomization.  Monitoring will be 
performed monthly beginning after the third month of enrollment until enrollment is closed.  At 
least three events must be observed in order to trigger review.  Each month, the null hypothesis 
that the 56 -day mortality rate is less than or equal to 20% is tested, separately  for each of the 
treatment arms.  This is based on a cohort of 76 high -risk patients (thrombocytopenia and 
progressive onset) out of 170 patients with cGVHD at the University of Minnesota.  An 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
5-6 extension of the SPRT for censored exponential data will be use d for monitoring, as described in 
greater detail below and in Appendix D.  
 
This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly 
examinations.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each monthly interim analysis, t he 
total time on study is plotted against the total number of endpoints (e.g., patients experiencing 
death).  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by two parallel lines.  Only the lower 
boundary will be used for monitoring to protect against exce ssive 56 -day mortality.  If the graph 
falls below the lower boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there 
are more events than predicted by the observed time on study.  Otherwise, the SPRT continues 
until enrollment reaches the m aximum of 150 patients for a treatment continuing in Phase  III. 
 
This procedure assumes a censored exponential distribution for the time until death during the 
first 56 days, and censors follow -up time after 56 days.  Only deaths that occur on or before th e 
patient has been followed for 56 days are counted.  Total time on study is computed as time from 
registration to death, or to 56 days, whichever comes first, summed for all patients on study.  
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error pr obabilities  and  of rejecting 
H0 when  = 0 and of accepting H 1 when  = 1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|i).  The test for overall mortality  was developed from the following SPRT:   
• A SPRT contrasting 20% versus 35% 56 -day rate of m ortality results in decision 
boundaries with a common slope of 6.336 and a lower intercept of –24.049, with nominal 
type I and II errors of 7% and 15%, respectively.  
 
The actual operating characteristics of the truncated test, shown in Table 5.4.a , were de termined 
in a simulation study that assumed uniform accrual of 150 individuals over a seven -year time 
period, and exponential time to failure after randomization.

the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5% of the  time when the true 56 -day mortality rate 
is 20%, and 76% of the time when the rate is 30%.  This corresponds to a type I error rate of  = 
0.05 and a type II error rate of  = 0.24.  When the true 56 -day mortality rate is 30%, on average, 
the DSMB will be  consulted 45 months after opening, when 24 events have been observed in 81 
patients.  For a treatment arm which only enrolls up to 50 patients, the stopping rule will have 
87% power to reject the null hypothesis when the Day 56 mortality rate is 40%.  
 
5.4.2.  Non-hematological Toxicities  
 
The cumulative incidences (C.I.) of Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) and Pneumonitis (NIP) 
at Day 56 will be monitored separately for each arm.  Definitions of TMA and NIP are detailed 
in Section 3.3 ( Safety  Endpoints).   Each mon th, the null hypothesis that the cumulative 
incidences  of TMA or NIP is  10% will be tested against the alternative that it is > 10%.  This 
will be done using a SPRT for binary outcomes.   As above, the SPRT can be represented 
graphically.  At each interim  analysis, the total number of patients enrolled is plotted against the 
total number of patients who have experienced toxicity.  The continuation region of the SPRT is 
defined by two decision boundaries.  Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring  the 
study to protect against high incidences of toxicity.  If the graph falls above the upper boundary, 
the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that the toxicity rate is higher than predicted 
by the observed number of patients enrolled on stud y.  Otherwise, the SPRT continues until 
enrollment reaches the target goal.   
 
The tests for TMA and NIP are identical and were developed from the following SPRT:   
• A SPRT contrasting 10% versus 25% 56 -day incidence, which results in decision 
boundaries wi th a common slope of 0.166 and an upper intercept of 2.413, with nominal 
type I and II errors of 6% and 15%, respectively.  
 
The actual operating characteristics of this truncated test, shown in Table 5.4.b , were determined 
in a simulation study that assume d uniform accrual of 150 individuals over a seven -year time 
period.

For example, the testing procedure for a treatment which continues into Phase III testing rejects 
the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5% of the time when the true 56 -day TMA rate is 
10%, and 86% of the time when the rate is 20%.  T his corresponds to a type I error rate of  = 
0.05 and a type II error rate of  = 0.14.  When the true 56 -day TMA rate is 20%, on average, the 
DSMB will be consulted 36 months after opening, when 12 events have been observed in 62 
patients.  For a treatme nt arm which only enrolls up to 50 patients, the stopping guidelines  will 
have 82% power to reject the null hypothesis when the Day 56 TMA rate is 25%.  Operating 
characteristics for NIP are identical, since the monitoring guidelines  are the same.  
 
5.5. Demogra phics and Baseline Characteristics  
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, primary disease, risk status, 
donor age, and donor gende r, conditioning intensity, donor type, peripheral blood versus marrow, 
time from transplant to enrollment, time f rom start of immunosuppressive therapy to enrollment, 
and percent of  patients with high risk  cGVHD .  Between group comparisons will be performe d 
for continuous variables via a Kruskal -Wallis Test and for categorical variables, via the Chi-
Square Test. 
 
5.6. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
1. Prednisone Sparing : The median percent reduction in average daily dose among 
survivors will be estimated for each  treatment with a 95% confidence interval by 6 and 
12 months after transplant for the Phase  II component and additionally by 24 and 36 
months for the Phase  III component.  These will be compared between treatments using 
the Kruskal -Wallis Test. 
2. Use of Seco ndary Therapy : The proportion of patients  who received secondary therapy 
at months 6, 12, 24, and 36 will be computed and compared using a Chi -Square test.    
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
5-9 3. Patient -Reported Symptomatic Chronic GVHD  Symptoms : The proportion of 
patients with symptomatic ch ronic GVHD will be estimated for each treatment with a 
95% confidence interval at 1 and 2 years for the Phase  II component and additionally at 
3 years for the Phase  III component.  These proportions will be compared between 
groups using the Chi-Square Test. 
We will also estimate the correlation between patient -reported symptoms on the Patient 
Survey and physician -reported symptoms on the Provider Survey.  
4. Discontinuation of all Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy : The cumulative 
incidence of discontinuation o f all systemic IS therapy will be estimated by treatment 
with a 95% confidence interval at 1 and 2 years for the Phase  II component and 
additionally at 3 years for the Phase  III component.  Death will be considered the 
competing risk.  Cumulative incidence  curves will be compared between groups using 
Gray’s Test.   
5. Survival and Progression -free Survival : Survival and progression -free survival from 
time of randomization will be computed using the Kaplan -Meier estimates along with a 
95% confidence interval fo r each group at 1 and 2 years for the Phase  II component and 
additionally at 3 years for the Phase  III component.  Survival curves will be compared 
across treatment using the Logrank Test.   
6. Biomarkers : T regulatory cell numbers, B cell numbers, and plasma  BAFF levels will 
be enumerated.   BAFF to B cell ratios will also be computed.   T reg numbers and BAFF 
to B cell ratios will be compared to respective values within groups using the Paired T-
Test, or between groups using the Two Sample T-Test.  Biomarker d ata will also be 
correlated with CR+PR status at 6 months using logistic regression . 
7. NIH Consensus Clinically Relevant Adjudicated CR and PR Rates: The proportion 
of patients experiencing a CR or PR according to the NIH consensus definition will be 
estimat ed for each treatment with a 95% confidence interval.  They will be compared 
between treatment arms similar to the comparison of the primary endpoint.  Agreement 
between the NIH consensus guidelines CR/PR evaluation and the CR/PR outcome based 
on the prima ry endpoint will be computed using the Kappa statistic.  As feasibility of 
this outcome is also of interest, the proportion of patients with complete data for this 
evaluation will also be estimated.   
Two-sided tests will be used throughout.  A p-value of 0.05 or less will be considered 
statistically significant.  
8. Health Quality of Life: Health quality of life will be compared between both treatment 
groups utilizing the FACT -BMT self report, transplant specific questionnaire and the 
generic quality of lif e tool, the SF -36.  Only English speaking patients are eligible to 
participate in the HQL component of this trial.   The HQL assessments will be performed 
at baseline, months two and six, then at one, two and three years after randomization.   
Pairwise t -tests at each time point will be used as a descriptive analysis.   Reasons for 
missing data will be explored, and linear mixed models will be used to model QOL after 
accounting for data missing at random.   We will also consider missing data models for 
QOL cond itional on survival at each time point, using methods of Kurland  and 
Heagerty .56

B-3 Introduction  
You are invited to join a research study.  The primary goals of this study are to compare two 
treatments for chronic graft -versus -host disease (GVHD), and evaluate how well your chronic 
GVHD responds to treatment.   
 
This study will be done over three  years.  One hundred  people will participate at up to 50 clinics.  
Each clinic in this study will offer two study treatments.  We will explain the two study 
treatments for your clinic in this Consent Form.  Every clinic will report their results, so w e can 
compare the two  treatments at the end of the study.   
 
The standard treatment for chronic GVHD is a corticosteroid (such as prednisone) and a 
calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus).   Patients who have chronic GVHD that is not 
controlled by  the standard treatment usually have other drugs added to their treatment.  Or less 
often, they may receive other drugs instead of standard treatment.  
 
In this study chronic GVHD will be treated with  another drug (sirolimus) in addition  to either:  
▪ A cortic osteroid , or 
▪ A corticosteroid and a calcineurin inhibitor, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus  
 
Sirolimus will be added to both treatments because research suggests that it may have positive 
effects on immune cells and improve GVHD treatment.  
 
You will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two following treatments:  
 
2-Drug Treatment  3-Drug Treatment  
▪ A corticosteroid (such as prednisone)  
▪ Sirolimus  ▪ A corticosteroid  
▪ A calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or 
tacrolimus)  
▪ Sirolimus  
 
This study will try t o learn if  it is better to add sirolimus to standard treatment or to replace a 
calcineurin inhibitor with sirolimus.  
 
This Consent Form will tell you about the purpose of the research, its possible risks and benefits, 
other options available to you, and yo ur rights as a participant in the study.  Please take your time 
to make your decision.  
 
Everyone who takes part in research at [insert facility name] should know that:  
▪ Being in any research study is voluntary.  
▪ You may or may not benefit from being in the study.  Knowledge we gain from this study 
may benefit others .

1. Background  
 
This research study is sponsored by The National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the Blood 
and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN).  This study is being done to 
compare two treatments for chronic GVHD in people who have had an allogeneic tran splant.  
 
Chronic GVHD  
Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that can become very serious.  Chronic GVHD is a 
common development after allogeneic transplant.  It happens when the donor cells attack and 
damage your tissues.   
 
Chronic GVHD may cause:  
▪ Skin ra shes 
▪ Mouth pain or dryness  
▪ Eye dryness  
▪ Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) or diarrhea  
▪ Liver inflammation  
▪ Damage to other organs, such as the lungs, throat, and vagina  
 
Treatments for chronic GVHD  
Corticosteroid (or steroid) medications  are the most basi c treatment for chronic GVHD.  
However, less than half of patients will become free of chronic GVHD when steroid treatment is 
used alone.  Several other drugs are often added to steroids to help treat chronic GVHD, 
including a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclos porine or tacrolimus) and/or sirolimus.  
 
Information from earlier research suggests that different combinations of sirolimus, cyclosporine 
or tacrolimus, and steroids may help to reduce chronic GVHD.   
 
Sirolimus, cyclosporine and tacrolimus all work by bl ocking the growth of new immune cells 
that can cause chronic GVHD.  Research suggests that sirolimus also supports the growth of 
other immune cells called “T -regs” which limit the immune response that causes GVHD. 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
Information & Informed  Consent Form   Initials   
B-5 Cyclosporine and tacrolimus may slow the g rowth of these immune cells.  eSirolimus, 
cyclosporine and tacrolimus are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
prevent rejection after organ transplantation .  They have been used for years as treatments for 
GVHD that do not respond to  standard steroid therapy, or to prevent GVHD after allogeneic 
transplant . 
 
 
2. Purpose  
 
You are invited to join this research study because you have chronic GVHD that needs treatment .  
 
The primary goals of this study are to compare two treatments for chron ic GVHD and evaluate 
how well your chronic GVHD responds to your treatment.  We will also collect extra blood 
samples for future research on GVHD.  
 
 
3. Right to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw  
 
You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time.  I f you have questions about 
your rights as a participant or you want to leave the study, please contact:  
[Insert contact info]  
 
Being in this study is voluntary.  You can choose to not be in this study, or leave this study at 
any time.  
 
If you choose to no t take part or to leave this study, your regular medical care will not be 
affected in any way.  This includes standard care for your chronic GVHD.   If you decide to leave 
this study after taking the study treatment, or are asked to leave by your doctor for  medical 
reasons, you will be asked to come back to the doctor’s office for tests for your safety.   
 
Even if you withdraw from the study, the information collected from your participation will be 
included in the study evaluation, unless you specifically a sk that it not be included.  
 
Your study doctor and study staff will be available to answer any questions that you may have about 
your participation in, or your withdrawal from this study.  
 
 
4. Procedures  
 
Your study participation will last for 3 years, and in cludes your treatment and follow -up.  One 
hundred  patients will participate at up to 50 clinics around the country.   
 
The number of required clinic visits during this time will depend on your treatment and the 
combination of drugs you receive.  You will n eed to have health evaluations before you start 
treatment and for several years after you finish your treatment.  These tests and examinations are 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801

B-6 standard care for patients with chronic GVHD and would be done even if you were not part of 
this study.  
 
One of the objectives of this study is to evaluate how the treatment affects the quality of the 
patient’s life and whether there is a difference between the treatment arms.  Therefore, all 
patients will be asked to complete questionnaires asking about their  chronic GVHD symptoms 
and quality of life at study entry, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months.  It will take you approximately half 
an hour to complete the questionnaires.  
 
If you decide to join, we will ask you to sign this Consent Form, and you will get a copy of t he 
signed form to keep.  
 
Before You Start Your Treatment  
Before you join the study, we will evaluate your general health, medical history, and your current 
medications.   It is important that you do not participate in the study if you suffer from an allergy  
to any of the drugs used in this study; or if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or are likely to 
become pregnant during the study.  
 
You will have at least one clinic visit before you start your treatment for this study.  This visit 
will collect information about your:  
▪ Physical health (including history, height, weight and temperature)  
▪ Comprehensive Chronic GVHD assessment [to include provider survey, patient survey, 2 
minute walk  (optional) , grip test (optional) and Schirmer’s eye exam  (optional )] 
▪ Lung func tion  
▪ Cancer re -staging (if appropriate)  
▪ Organs affected by GVHD  
▪ Routine blood tests, including cell counts, cholesterol, liver and kidney function, and 
levels of GVHD treatment medications in your blood (if it applies to you)  
▪ Blood samples (4-5 teaspoons,  or 3-4 teaspoons for patients under 90 pounds) for 
protocol -defined GVHD studies  
▪ Pregna ncy test (if applicable ) 
 
Study Participation  
You will receive either the 2-drug treatment or the 3-drug treatment.

Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
Information & Informed  Consent Form   Initials   
B-7 If you are assigned to the 2-drug treatment, you w ill receive:  
2-Drug Treatment  
▪ Prednisone : once each day until 2 weeks improvement in 
GVHD symptoms is observed , and then slowly lowered and 
then stopped    
▪ Sirolimus : once each day until all prednisone has stopped.  
After up to 3 months of stable improvem ent is observed, the 
amount of sirolimus will be slowly lowered and then stopped  
 
If you are assigned to the 3 -drug treatment, you will receive:  
3-Drug Treatment  
▪ Prednisone : once each day until 2 weeks improvement in  
GVHD symptoms is observed , and then s lowly lowered and 
then stopped .   
▪ Sirolimus : once each day.  
▪ CNI: two times each day.  
 
Depending on how well you respond to the treatment, you may need to visit the clinic every 
week for another 24 weeks.  Your visits may drop to once each month, if your doctor feels it is 
appropriate.  You may need to take your assigned treatment for up to two years.  Your doctor 
will lower the amount of drugs you will need to take, as your chronic GVHD symptoms get 
better.   
 
Once you stop taking your assigned treatment,  the study team will follow your health for up to 2 
years.  Your total length of study participation may last up to 3 years, including follow -up once 
you finish your treatment.  
 
Study Evaluations  
We will evaluate your health at specific points during your study participation:  
1. History, physical exam, and weight at 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36  months . 
2. Comprehensive Chronic GVHD assessment [to include provider survey, patien t survey, 
2 minute walk  (optional) , grip test (optional) and Schirmer’s eye exam (optional )] to 
measure your response to treatment at 2, 6, 12, 24 and 36  months . 
3. Routine blood tests, including: cell counts, and liver and kidney function, at least weekly 
for the first 4 weeks . 
4. Cholesterol tests at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months . 
5. Lung (pulmonary) functio n tests at 3, 6 and 12 months . 
6. Blood tests to check sirolimus levels will be done at least every week for the first 4 
weeks and potentially twice a week if you are taking cyclosporine or tacrolimus.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
Information & Informed  Consent Form   Initials   
B-8 Sirolimus levels from Week 5 to the end of your treatmen t are then done weekly to 
monthly, depending on your treatment.  
7. Blood tests to check cyclosporine or tacrolimus levels are done at least weekly for the 
first 4 weeks and then at least monthly after Week 5 based on your treatment.   
8. Blood samples (4-5 teasp oons, or 3-4 teaspoons for patients under 90 pounds) for 
protocol -defined GVHD studies at 2 months and 6 months or when any new oral or 
injected medication is added to treat your GVHD . 
 
Randomization  
A computer will randomly assign you to receive either th e standard treatment or the study 
treatment.  This means that you will be put into a group by chance.   It is like flipping a coin or 
drawing names out of a hat.  You will have an equal chance of being chosen for either treatment.  
 
Additional Health Evaluat ions and Procedures  
Before and after photographs may be taken to document your chronic GVHD.  
 
 
5. Alternative Treatments  
 
Current available treatments which may be used to treat graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) 
include:  
▪ Corticosteroids (prednisone) with or wi thout cyclosporine or tacrolimus (standard 
treatment for GVHD)  
▪ Other medications  
▪ Participation in another clinical trial (if available, check with your doctor)  
 
Every treatment option has benefits and risks.  Your study doctor will discuss these options wi th 
you.  If you decide not to participate in this research study, your medical care will not be affected 
in any way.  
 
 
6. Risks and Discomforts  
 
It is very important that you do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice.  Grapefruit 
has an ingredient calle d bergamottin, which can affect some of the treatment drugs used in 
this study.  Common soft drinks that have bergamottin are Fresca , Squirt , and Sunny  Delight . 
a.) Side Effects of Study Drugs and Treatments  
All drugs can have side effects, including the stand ard therapy for GVHD (steroids) and 
the other drugs being tested in this study.  Your doctor will watch you carefully and will 
change your treatment if side effects develop.  
Please see Table: Risks and Side Effects of Study Drugs and Treatments  at the end  of this 
section for more information on the drugs used in the study treatments.

Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
Information & Informed  Consent Form   Initials   
B-9 b.) Infections  
Because chronic GVHD is caused by an immune attack on your tissues from the 
transplanted donor cells, all treatments for chronic GVHD include drugs to control 
(supp ress) that immune attack.  There is a higher risk of infection in patients with chronic 
GVHD and in people who take steroids like prednisone or methylprednisolone, the 
standard therapy for chronic GVHD.   
You will need to take several antibiotics to preven t infection.  You will also be watched 
carefully for any infections while you are being treated for chronic GVHD. Tell your 
doctors promptly if you get a fever, chills, cough or any other symptoms that might be a 
sign of an infection.  
c.) Risks of Other Proced ures Including Blood Draws   
There are no major risks associated with drawing blood.  Having your blood drawn can 
be uncomfortable and can sometimes cause a bruise.  In rare cases, a blood draw can 
cause fainting.  Only trained people will draw your blood.  
d.) Reproductive Risks  
The drugs used in this research study, including sirolimus  and CNIs  may cause injury or 
birth defects if you take them during pregnancy. Because of this, it is important that you 
are not pregnant or breast -feeding and do not become preg nant during the course of the 
study.  
If you are a woman and pregnancy is a possibility, you will need to take a pregnancy test 
before you start the study.  You should discuss ways to not become pregnant while you 
are participating on the study.  
e.) Unforeseen  Risks  
New risks might appear at any time during the study that are different from the risks

Blood and DNA Samples for Research  
Please note: This section of the Informed Consent Form is about an additional research 
study that will be don e with people who are taking part in the main study.  You may take

Information & Informed  Consent Form   Initials   
B-16 part in this additional study if you want to.  You can still be a part of the main study even if 
you say ‘no’ to take part in this additional study.  
 
Your blood and cells have a material kn own as DNA.  This is a molecule that holds a person’s 
genetic information.  
 
We ask for your permission to collect and store extra blood and DNA. These samples will be 
used for future research.  
 
DNA from your stored blood and DNA samples and your health in formation might be used in 
genome -wide association (GWA) studies for a future project either done or supported by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH).   
 
Genome -wide association studies are a way for scientists to identify genes involved in human 
disea se.  This method searches the genome for small genetic changes that are more common in 
people with a particular disease than in people without the disease.   Each study can look at 
hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time.  Researchers use data from this type 
of study to find genes that may add to a person’s risk of developing a certain disease.  
 
If your coded genetic and clinical information is used in such a study, the researcher is required 
to add the DNA test results and non -identifying information into a public research database.  
This public database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed by 
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  The NCBI will never have any 
information that would identif y you, or link you to your information or research samples.  
 
A new federal law (2009), called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 
generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 
15 or more p ersons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Health 
insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we 
get from this research.  This means that they m ust not use your genetic information wh en making 
decisions regarding insurability.  Be aware that this new federal law will not protect you against 
genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long -term 
care insurance.  
 
Procedures  
▪ We will collect extra blood samples at the same time you have routine blood tests done 
on 3 study visits; before you start treatment (baseline), 2 months and 6 months . 
▪ The amount of blood collected from you is small – about 2 teaspoons (10mL) each time.  
▪ We will also collect sam ples of your DNA by swabbing four sections of the inside of 
your cheeks with cotton swabs.  
▪ Your blood and DNA samples will be collected confidentially and your name will not be 
on the containers.  
▪ These samples may be stored indefinitely  for future research .

If you agree to allow your blood and DNA samples to be used for research, you can change your 
mind at any time.  If you change your mind, please contact [the Principal Investigator at your 
transplant center] in writing to state that you are  withdrawing permission for your blood to be 
used for research.  His/her mailing address is on the first page of this Consent Form.  Any unused 
samples will be destroyed if you withdraw your permission.  If you choose not to participate in 
this additional research there will be no change in your care.    
 
Benefits  
You will not benefit directly from providing blood and DNA samples for this study.  
 
Risks  
There are no major risks associated with drawing blood.  Having your blood drawn can be 
uncomfortable and c an sometimes cause a bruise.  In rare cases, it can cause fainting.  Only 
trained people will draw your blood.  There are no major risks with swabbing the inside of your 
cheeks.  
 
Confidentiality and Your Medical Information  
The results of GVHD research don e with your blood and DNA will not be part of your medical 
record and will not be shared with you.  
 
If you agree to allow your blood and DNA samples to be used for research, they will be collected 
confidentially and your name will not be on the tubes.  On ly the study doctors or staff working 
with them will study the results from your blood and DNA samples.  
 
Information gained from research on your blood and DNA may be used to develop diagnostic 
procedures or new treatments for GVHD in the future.  Your blo od will not be sold to any 
person, institution, or company for financial gain or profit.

of Chronic Graft -versus -Host -Disease . 
 
Protocol : 0801 
 
 
A. Why am I here ? 
We are inviting you to join our stud y because you have chronic graft -versus -host disease 
(GVHD).  
 
Chronic GVHD happens when donor cells from your transplant attack parts of the body like 
your skin, stomach or liver.  Both children and adults can get chronic GVHD.  It can be a 
very serious pr oblem for some people.   
 
 
B. Why are you doing this study ? 
We want  to compare two ways to treat  chronic GVHD .  This will help us learn which may be 
a better treatment.  
 
 
C. What will happen to me?  
If you say you want  to be in the study, we will ask you for seve ral things:  
▪ Permission to  let us read your medical records and x -rays.  
▪ Check -ups with the study doctors .  
▪ Some blood from you  (about 3-5 teaspoons) .  A very small needle will be used to get 
blood.  
▪ Answer some questions about how you feel.

B-20 You will be as signed to have either Treatment #1 or Treatment #2. The doctors will use a 
computer to decide who goes into each group.  Each treatment uses a different mix of drugs.  
 
Treatment #1  Treatment #2  
▪ A steroid  
▪ Cyclosporine or tacrolimus   
▪ Sirolimus  ▪ A steroid  
▪ Sirolimus  
 
We will watch you carefully for fevers, any sign of infection or other problems.  
 
 
D. Will it hurt?  
When you have your blood taken with a needle, it may feel like a pinch.  It will hurt for a 
minute and sometimes the place where the needle went might  be red and sore.  You might get 
a little bruise where the blood was taken but it goes away in a few days.  
 
 
E. Will the study  help me?  
We don’t know if the study will help you or not.  Your GVHD may stay the same, it may get 
better, or it may get worse.  
 
 
F. What if I have questions ? 
You can ask any questions that you have about the study.   If you forget to ask a question and 
think of it later, you can call me [insert office number].  You can also ask your question the  
next time you see me.  
 
You can call the st udy office at any time to ask questions about the study.  
 
 
G. Do I have to be in this study?  
If you don’t want to be in the study, you need to tell us and your parent or guardian.  Your 
doctor will not be angry or upset if you don’t want to join.   
 
Whether y ou are in the study or not, you will still need to have treatment for your GVHD.  
 
You can say yes now and change your mind at any time.   
 
Please talk this over with your parent  or guardian  before you decide if you want to  be in the 
study.  We will also as k your parents to give their permission for you to join this study.

Background – The Sequential Probability Ratio Test  
 
Let 
)(.,f be the density function for random variable X.  According to Neyman and Pearson, 
the most powerful test of 
o H:0  versus
1 1: H  decides in favor of 
1H  or 
0H if 
c Ln  
or 
c Ln , respectively, where 
n
ii i n xf xf L );(/);(0 1  is the likelihood ratio, and 
c is 
determined to have the size 
 .  When the sample size is not fixed in advance, further 
improve ment is possible by using Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).  The SPRT 
continues to sample as long as 
A LBn  for some constant 
A B1 , stops sampling and 
decides in favor of 
1H as soon as 
A Ln , and stops sampling and decides in favor of 
0H as soon 
as 
B Ln . 
 
The usual measures of performance of such a procedure are the error probabilities 
 and
 of 
rejecting 
0H when 
0 , and of accepting 
0H when 
1 , respectively, and the expected 
sample size

the SPRT with error probabilities

D-2 Derivation of the SPRT for Uncensored Exponential Survival Times  
 
For example, we wish to construct a sequential test for the composite null hypothesis that the rate 
of tre atment -related mortality (TRM) at 100 days is less than or equal to 30% versus the 
alternative hypothesis that it is greater than or equal to 50%.  For the derivation of the 
uncensored SPRT, we will require that the type I error of the test be less than 5% , and that the 
test provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis under a specified alternative that the true 
rate is 50%.  A maximum sample size of 50 patients will be permitted.  
 
Let us assume that the survival times, 
nT TT ,...,,2 1 , are comp letely observed (uncensored) and are 
i.i.d. with exponential density function 
Te Tf),( .  These assumptions will be relaxed to 
incompletely observed data subsequently.  In the exponential parameterization, a 100 -day 
survival rate of 70% tran slates into a mean survival of 0.768 years (
0 1.303), and 50% 
translates into a mean survival of 0.395 years (
1 2.532).  
 
The SPRT is derived with reference to a simple null and alternative hypothesis, in this cas e, 
o H:0
 1.303 versus
1 1: H  = 2.532.  However, since the log -likelihood ratio for the 
exponential, 
    n

monotone function of 
n
iiT , the power of the test is non -decreasing in  
.  Thus the SPRT is a 
one-sided level .05 test of a composite null (
303.1 :0o H ) versus a composite alternative 
(
303.1 :1o H ), with power of 
80. 1  at the selected alternative 
1 2.532.  
 
The SPRT can be represented graphically.  The continuation region is bounded by two parallel 
lines with common slope 
  ) /() log (log1 0 1 0  0.541, and intercepts 
) /( log1 0A -2.256 
and 
) /( log1 0B 1.270, for th e lower and upper bounds, respectively.  As each individual unit 
is put on trial and observed to fail, the cumulative sum of failure times,
n
iiT , is recomputed, and 
plotted against the current sample size, 
n .  When  this graph crosses the lower boundary, the null 
hypothesis is rejected.  
 
The maximum sample size of 50 patients requires that the SPRT be truncated.  We choose to 
truncate the SPRT by declaring that if the test has failed to terminate after 50 patients, t hat the 
null hypothesis will be accepted.  Since the probability that the untruncated SPRT would reject 
the null at a sample size of 50 is negligible, it makes little difference how the final boundary 
value is selected, and this rule is chosen for simplici ty.   
 
Derivation of a Modified SPRT for Censored Exponential Data  
 
The assumption of uncensored exponential survival times is flawed.  However, we consider it 
reasonable to assume the hazard for TRM is constant over the first 100 days post -transplant, and  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Chronic GVHD Therapy – Protocol 0801  
Version 6.0 dated July 9, 2012  
 
 
D-3 we will restrict our attention to this time interval.  Furthermore, it is not practical to conduct a 
clinical study by putting each individual on trial, and waiting until that individual is observed to 
fail.  We relax our assumptions as follows.  Firstly,  each individual’s time on study will be 
computed as time from transplant to failure, or to the 100 day time point, whichever comes first.  
Secondly, we will put individuals on trial as soon as they become available, without waiting for 
the previous indivi dual to fail.  
 
Let us consider the impact of relaxing these assumptions one at a time.  In a fixed sample size 
trial with uncensored exponential failure times, mean survival time is estimated by the sample 
mean of the failure times, or total time on study divided by the number of individuals enrolled.  
When censoring is introduced, the estimate becomes the total time on study divided by the 
number of observed (non -censored) failures.  This suggests that in an exponential SPRT test 
modified to incorporate ce nsoring, we replace the observed failure times, 
nT TT ,...,,2 1 , with 
censored failures times, 
nx xx ,...,,2 1 , and the current sample size, 
n , with the number of observed 
failures, 
d .   
 
Now we relax the second assumption, and put individuals on trial as soon as they become 
available, without waiting for the previous individual to fail.  Assume that three years are 
required for accrual of 50 patients to the study, and that the final analysis t akes place 100 days 
after the last patient is entered.  Putting all of this together, we propose a modified truncated 
SPRT, where at any interim time point, 
s , ranging from 0 to 3 years 100 days, the sum of 
observed time on study, 
n
iisX)( is plotted against the number of observed failures, 
)(sd .  In 
practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the start of enrollment to the study.  A 
further modification to the SPRT was to only use the lower  boundary for stopping since the 
primary focus of the monitoring is to protect against unacceptable 100 -day TRM rates.  
 
Operating Characteristics of the Modified SPRT Test for Censored Exponential Data  
 
Recall that the uncensored SPRT targeted a drop in su rvival at Day 100 from 70% to 50%, with 
type I and II errors of 5% and 20%.  Since only the lower boundary is used for monitoring, the 
continuation region of the test was bounded below by a line with a slope of 0.541 and intercept 
of –2.256.  The effect of  truncation is to reduce the power of the test.  In order to compensate for 
this, we raise the lower boundary to make it easier to cross.  Under the further assumption of 
uniform accrual over a three year period, and monthly interim analyses over the cours e of the 
study, the operating characteristics of the modified SPRT were obtained from a simulation study.  
These simulation show that an intercept of –1.741, corresponding to setting parameters 
  and 

to 10% an d 15%, result in empirical type I and II error rates of  about 5% and 20%.

Mean # Patients Enrolled  48 45 40 33 26 
 
While the motivation for this testing procedure  is largely heuristic rather than theoretical, the 
simulation results validate the approach.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 100 was 
30%, the test crossed the lower boundary in 7119 of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type I 
error rate of  7%.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 100 was 50%, the test failed to 
cross the boundary in 14226 of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type II error rate of 14%.  
And on average, the boundary will be crossed at 18.5 months, when 26 patients  will be enrolled 
to the study.  
 
It is interesting to note that the SPRT derived above for exponential failure times with censoring 
at 100 days, has operating characteristics which are similar to those of a more traditional SPRT, 
derived for binomial varia tes with success probability equal to the 100 day failure rate.  Using 
time to failure rather than a simple binary indicator of failure, leads to little improvement in 
power when failure times are censored relatively soon after entry on study.  We speculat e that if 
the constant hazard rate over the first 100 days were high, the exponential test would reject faster 
than the binomial test, but have not conducted simulation studies to demonstrate this.

END OF PHASE II DECISION MAKING CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
The adaptive Phase II/III design of Protocol 0801 allows efficient transition from Phase II to 
Phase III, given certain outcomes in the Phase II stage of the trial.  The Phase II stage may res ult 
in a variety of outcomes , not all of which  would favor  proceeding directly to the Phase III as 
written.  This Appendix outlines the principles that will be used to determine how to proceed at 
the end of Phase II.  Overall response rates (CR+PR) at 6 mo nths for the experimental arm ( SP) 
will be plotted ( see examples plotted as  below) relative to the respective comparator arm 
(SPC) as shown in the figures below.  Assumptions include: 1) the overall response rate for SPC  
is about 40%; and, 2) overall res ponse rates in the experimental arm (SP)  < 40% are not of 
interest to pursue further.  
 
Scenario 1:  The Phase III trial as written is not worth pursuing  
 
SP is inferior  to comparator ( SPC) and the trial end s at Phase II.

E-2 Scenario 2:  The Phase II study  is possibly worth pursuing after further follow -up 
 
The SP arm  might be of sufficient interest to continue int o a future Phase III trial but Phase II 
short term outcome data do es not warrant proceeding directly to Phase III.  In this scenario, both 
arms would have similar CR+PR rates higher than the estimated 40% benchmark  for the SPC 
arm.  In this situation, how to proceed may require more information on longer term endpoints.  
Considerations would also include, in rank order, t oxicity, convenience and cost of both study 
arms, as well as BMT CTN priorities and other available therapies at the time.

E-3 Scenario 4: Experimental Arm (SP) is  substantially superior (≥  35%) to SPC   
 
In this example, w hile the comparator arm ( SPC) exceeds the 40% benchmark, the experimental 
arm (SP) is considered sufficiently more superior over SPC that proceeding direct ly to Phase III 
(SP versus  SPC) may not be  justified .  The DSMB would advise  whether SP and SPC should be 
tested head -to-head in Phase III or if SP should be tested against a novel therapy of interest.  
Considerations would also include, in rank order, toxicity, convenience and cost of all study 
arms, as well as BMT CTN priorities and other available therapies at the time.

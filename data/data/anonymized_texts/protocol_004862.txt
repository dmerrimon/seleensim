Rationale for this Study:  
Novel drugs are needed for the treatment of relapsed or relapsed  refractory multiple myeloma.  
The combination of  proteasome  inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulating (IMiD) agents has 
produced significant responses. Many patients are exposed  to these classes of drugs earlier in 
the course of therapy, for patients who relapse after agents such as  the PI bortezomib  and the 
IMiD  lenalidomide , newer agents are now available or in development including 
pomalidomide and MLN9708.  Pomalidomide is an  IMiD that is active even in patients who 
are refractory to other IMiDS such as lenalidomide. MLN9708 is a PI that has shown activity 
in patients refractory to bortezomib.  MLN9708 has shown activity in Phase I/II trials and 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone have shown activity in Phase I/II and III trials. Hence 
combining the two agents and including dexamethasone for synergy could potentially induce 
responses in this refractory patient  population . 
Objectives:  
Phase I:  
Primary:  
1) To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)  of MLN9708 when given in 
combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone , in patients with relapsed or 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . 
Secondary:  
2) To evaluate the safety of MLN9708 at each dose level when given as part of a three drug 
combination by assessing the following:  
 - type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration  of adverse events  
 - clinical laboratory tests at various points in the study

 Phase II:  
Primary:  
1. To estimate the response rate and to evaluate the antitumor activity of the three drug 
combination: MLN9708 (at the RP2D), pomalidomide and dexamethasone , in patients with 
relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  
Secondary:  
At the RP2D, for the three drug combination:  
2. To character ize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time 
course and duration.  
3. To obtain estimates of response duration, depth of response, clinical benefit response, and 
survival (overall and progression -free).  
Study Design:  
This study will be conducted as a multicenter phase I/II trial.  
 
The phase I portion will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design , to evaluate  toxicities 
associated with MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone . Two dos es of MLN9708 , 3mg and 4 mg , will be tested  in up to three possible 
dose levels:   
Schedule: Each cycle is 28 days  
Dose Level  Pomalidomide  MLN9708  Dexamethasone * 
-1 3mg daily on days 1 -21 3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
1 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
2 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 4 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
*: Patients >75 years , at the time of trial registration, will receive a dexamethasone starting 
dose of 20mg on the same set schedule.  
 
The RP2D  identified in the phase I portion of the study will be brought forward for activity  
evaluation . 
 
The phase II portion of this study will implement a Gehan  two-stage design to estimate the 
response rate and to evaluate the activity of MLN9708 when given in combination with 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone ( Gehan , 1961 ). 
Endpoints:  
Phase I:  
The primary endpoint is toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -Common 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  5                                                                     
 
 Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) is 
defined in section 7.3 of the protocol.  
Phase II:  
The primary endpoint is response rate ( sCR/CR/VGPR  and PR)  and is based on the 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG ) criteria.  
Sample Size:  
Phase I:  
The phase I study will follow a 3+3 design,  to evaluate toxicities associated with MLN9708 
when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.  Two doses of MLN9708 
(3 mg and 4 mg)  will be tested  in up to three possible dose levels . In the phase I portion of this 
study, the total sample size will depend on the number of dose levels evaluated to determine 
the RP2D. While the phase I study is expected to enroll and treat  9 patients ( 3 patients at do se 
level 1, and another 6 at dose level 2 -assuming the 4mg dose is well tolerated), a maximum of 
18 patients could be treated (6 patients treated at each dose level.  
 
Phase II:  
The phase II portion of the study is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a ma ximum of 25 
patients. The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will count 
toward the 25 patients required; given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients during 
the phase II trial portion. The sample size is based on  the desire to achieve a (promising ) 
target response rate of >30%.   
Estimated Duration of the Study  
Accrual, for both phases, is expected to be completed in 26 months; with approximately 2 
patients enrolled each month. Patients will be treated in 28 -day treatment cycles until disease 
relapse, progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or protocol specified 
parameters to stop treatment. Patients  who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease relapse/progression will continue to have disease assessments per International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria  until relapse or progression, initiation of new 
anticancer treatment, or d eath whichever occurs first. Patients will be followed to collect 
further anticancer treatment and survival information until death, loss to follow -up, 
withdrawal of consent, study termination or up to 24 months post treatment.

Statistical Considerations:  
Phase I:  
The primary objective of the phase I study is to determine the recomm ended phase II dose 
(RP2D) of MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in 
patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  
 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017

 The phase I study will follow a 3+3 design for enrollment  with dose escalation , or expansion 
of a cohort on the basis of the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1 . 
Two doses of MLN9708 will be tested in up to three possible dose levels  (dose level -1 and 
dose level 1: 3mg / dose level 2: 4 mg, administered  on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 2 8 day cycle).  
The highest dose level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in cycle 1 will be the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD). The RP2D of MLN9708 and pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it 
may be less than the MTD  based on a review of availa ble data/cumulative toxicities from 
phase I.   
 
Analysis: Observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or 
laboratory determination), severity, time of onset, duration, probable association with the 
study regimen and reversibility or outcome. Baseline information (e.g. the extent of prior 
therapy) and demographic information will be presented as well to describe the patients 
treated in this study.  
 
Phase II:  
The  primary objective is to estimate the response rate and to evaluate the antitumor activity of 
the three drug combination: MLN9708 (at the RP2D), pomalidomide , and dexamethasone , in 
patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  The primary endpoint is a 
confirmed tumor respon se of sCR/CR/VGPR or P R and is based on IMWG Criteria. A single 
cycle  of treatment will be given in a 28 day cycle. Each patient’s disease status will be 
evaluated at baseline. R esponse will be assessed at the end of each cycle/just prior to the start 
of each cycle  and is based  on the IMWG criteria.  
 
Statistics/Sample Size and Accrual:  The phase II portion of this study will implement a 
Gehan  two-stage design to estimate the response rate and to evaluate the activity of MLN9708 
when given in combination with pomalidomide and de xamethasone ( Gehan 1961 ). The phase 
II portion of the study is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 25 patients. 
The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will count toward the 
25 patients required; given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients on the phase II trial. 
The sample size is based on the desire to estimate the response rate with at most 10% standard 
error, and early stopping if the combination is unexpectedly ineffective .  
  
At stage 1, 9 patients will be entered on the study. If 0 responses are seen  in the first 9 patients 
treated , the study will be terminated  and the true regimen response will be declared ≤30% . If 
at least 1 patient respond s, the trial will continue to the second stage. B ecause patients treated 
during the phase I portion of the trial at the dose selected for the phase II trial will be counted 
(n=6), only 3 additional patients will be enrolled at stage 1.  Under this design if the study 
regimen is >30% effective, there would  be ~95.6% chance of at least one success.  
 
At stage 2, 16 additional patients will be entered.  This accrual provides for estimation of the 
response rate with no more than 10% standard error.   
 
Analysis: The overall r esponse rate  will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patien ts that 
have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR or PR; the clinical benefit response rate will be calculated as 
the percent of evaluable patients that have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR/PR/ MR or SD;  exact

 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for these estimates. Response rates will also be 
evaluated based on number and type of prior therapy(ies). Time to response, duration of 
response, and survival will be estimated using the product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier.

1)  Measured at screening only.  
2)  FCBP  - A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorect omy; or 2) 
has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months. Pregnancy tests for FCBP must be performed within 10 to 14 d ays and 
again within 24 hours of initiation of therapy. Repeat pregnancy test every week for the first 4 weeks and then every 28 days  while on therapy and 
during interruptions in therapy and 28 days following discontinuation of pomalidomid e.  Women with irregular menstruation must have pregnancy 
testing every 14 days while on therapy and during interruptions and 14 and 28 days after discontinuation of Pomalidomide.  For Cycle 2 and forward, 
the D15 pregnancy test (if required) can be done l ocally and results faxed to the main institution.  
3)  ECG (12 -Lead) should be performed and read locally.     
4)  All patients must be counseled about pregnancy precautions, risks of fetal exposure and other risks. All patients enrolled in to this trial, mu st be 
registered in and must comply with all requirements of the POMALYST REMS™ program.   
5)  CBC to be performed and reviewed by clinician within 24 hours of day of dosing (first day of each cycle).  Alternately, a STA T CBC may be drawn on 
day of dosing,  however should be reviewed prior to administration of investigational product(s). Serum Chemistry to be performed and reviewe d by 
the investigator within 24 hours of day of dosing (first day of each cycle).  Alternately, a STAT CMP may be drawn on day of dosin g however should 
be reviewed by the investigator prior to administration of investigational product(s).  Chemistry includes: glucose, calcium,  albumin, total protein, 
sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine, ALP, ALT, AST, bilirubin and uric acid (uric aci d to be drawn at screening and then as needed based on tumor 
lysis syndrome risk).  Weight and serum creatinine will be used to calculate creatinine clearance by Cockroft -Gault equation (see appendix 15.2).   
6)  Neurological assessment required at screeni ng and Day 1 of Cycle 2+.  
7)    Extramedullary Disease: prior to study (28 days), testing required only if extramedullary disease is present, every 12 weeks (if present at screening) 
or upon clinical suspicion of progressive disease (if present at screenin g).  This may include CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis, CT or x -ray of the chest, 
ultrasound of the liver/spleen or abdomen.      
8) Skeletal survey (including skull, all long bones, pelvis and chest) with tumor measurements (measurements required if plasmacytomas are present).  
Also required if previous survey >28 days from study entry and at any time when clinically indicated.  
9)  A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is required at screening;  Repeat bone marrow biopsy/aspirate as appropriate to confir m achievement of 
response (aspirate only —biopsy not required).   
10)  Myeloma lab tests: B2Microglobulin (collected at screening only); serum immunoelectrophoresis, immunoglobulin assay, M band q uantitation by 
immunofixation, free light chain and 24 hour u rine collection for Bence Jones protein to be performed at baseline prior to study, prior to each cycle (to 
confirm  complete response and in pat ients with urine only measurable disease) thereafter and at time of end of treatment  (if last tests were > 3 
weeks).  
11) End of study follow -up to be completed every three months for two years to include second primary malignancies, new therapies for the treatment o f 
MM only (not all concomitant medication) and survival.  
12)  Due to the risk of blood clots while  on Pomalidomide, if patient is started on warfarin, routine monitoring of INR should occur  (as per your 
institutuional guidelines).

 1.    BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
1.1    Multiple Myeloma Background  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy that is the second most common 
hematological malignancy. There are approximately 20,000 new cases per year and 10,000 
deaths per year from MM in the United States. 1  Treatment options for relapsed MM includ e 
the following:  
Bortezomib; A drug in the class of proteasome inhibitors, it was approved as monotherapy for 
relapsed MM.2   Given the efficacy and tolerability of the drug it is often used in combination 
with agents such as alkylators ( cyclophosphamide) , immunomodulatory agents (IMiDS), or 
liposomal doxorubicin either in the upfront setting or relapsed setting. 3 
Carfilzomib: Also a proteasome inhibitor, was approved in 2012 for patients who had prior 
therapy with bortezomib and an IMID and were progress ing on or refractory to their most recent 
therapy. It has less peripheral neuropathy than bortezomib and has shown responses in 
bortezomib refractory patients.4  However, there are concerns with potential cardiac, pulmonary 
and renal side effects. Also the  administration schedule of consecutive days of intravenous 
dosing make it a more cumbersome regimen for patients.  
Lenalidomide/Thalidomide: Drugs in the class known as immunomodulatory agents. 
Lenalidomide in conjunction with dexamethasone is approved fo r relapsed myeloma. 5 
Thalidomide is also approved for myeloma therapy but in the United States, lenalidomide is 
used preferentially due to its more favorable side effect profile. Similar to the practice with 
bortezomib both drugs are now commonly used in the upfront induction setting for therapy of 
myeloma in conjunction with dexamethasone for synergy. 6 
Unfortunately even with the advent of these active novel agents and improved response rates of 
combination therapy, all patients with myeloma ultimately r elapse.  However, patients are living 
longer and hence, the goals of MM therapy are not only efficacy but also favorable toxicity 
profiles.7  In addition as these novel agents are being used earlier in the course of myeloma 
therapy, when patients do relaps e, their disease is often refractory to the approved agents. 
Survival for this group of patients, especially those refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide, 
the so called double refractory group is especially poor. 8

 Hence new therapies for patients with relapsed disease are needed. In addition, oral therapies 
have the advantage of ease of administration and the potential for longer term use.  
1.2         MLN9708   
1.2.1     Preclinical Experience  
Please refer to the current MLN9708 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and Safety Management 
Attachment (SMA).  
1.2.2     Clinical Experience  
As of 30 April 2012 , 382 patients have been treated with MLN9708 across 9 enrolling, sponsor -
led phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies evaluating both twice -weekly and weekly dosing schedules.  
MLN9708 is available as an intravenous and oral formulation. Regardless of the route of 
administration in the twice -weekly dosing schedule, MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 
of a 21 -day cycle; in the weekly dosing schedule, the drug is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -
day cycle.  To date, the development of oral MLN9708 has focused on multiple myeloma 
[relapsed and/or refractory and newly diagnosed] and a different yet related plasma cell 
dyscrasia, systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. A clinical pharmacolog y study looking at 
drug-drug interactions, the effect of food, and bioavailability also uses the oral formulation. 
Details of these trials can be found in ClinicalTrials.gov and the MLN9708 IB.    
1.2.3    Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
Clinical IV and PO p harmacokinetic (PK) data show that MLN9708 (measured as the 
biologically active boronic acid form of MLN9708 [MLN2238]) has multi -exponential 
disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over by 4 hours.  Oral MLN9708 is rapidly 
absorbed with a m edian time to first maximum plasma concentration (T max) of approximately 
0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t 1/2 after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 7 days.9  Results of 
a population PK analysis (N = 137) show that there is no relationship between body surface area 
(BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL).  Also, based on stochastic simulations for fixed dose, 
exposures are independent of the individual patient’s BSA.10  Based on these data, a 
recommendation was made for fixed dosing in clinical trials.  An absolute bioavailability of 
67% was determined for MLN9708 using the population PK analysis.  See the IB for 
information on the PK for IV doses of MLN9708.  
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for MLN9708, with negligible urinary 
excretion of the parent drug (<  3% of dose).  In vitro studies of liver microsomes show that 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017

 MLN9708 is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and non -CYP 
enzymes/proteins.  The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of the 5 major h uman 
CYP isozymes is 3A4 (34.2%) >  1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) >  2C9 (12.1%) >  2C19 (<  1%).  
MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor is it a time -dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  The potential for MLN9708 treatment to produce DD Is via CYP 
inhibition is inferred to be low; however, there may be a potential for DDIs with a concomitant 
strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor because of the potential for first -pass metabolism when 
MLN9708 is administered via the PO route and because of the  moderate contribution of 
CYP3A4 - and CYP1A2 -mediated metabolism of MLN9708 in human liver microsomes.  
MLN9708 may be a weak substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP2) ef flux pump transporters.  
MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2.  The potential for DDIs with 
substrates or inhibitors of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, inferred to be low.  
1.2.4     Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of MLN97 08 
In the 7 studies actively enrolling patients to investigate oral MLN9708 in patients with 
differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and 
lymphoma), a total of 242 patients have been treated as of 30 April 2012. The se patients have 
been treated with different doses of MLN9708, either as a single agent treatment or in 
combination with currently clinically available treatments. Information regarding the ongoing

1.2.5      Overvie w of the Oral Formulation of MLN9708  
The emerging safety profile indicates that oral MLN9708 is generally well tolerated with 
predominant toxicities largely reversible, able to be monitored by routine clinical examinations 
and manageable by dose reductions , discontinuation, or standard supportive care. From 
experience from phase 1 through 2 studies the major toxicities can be managed to allow repeat 
treatment cycles over periods extending beyond 24 months.  
In the 4 ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigating single -agent 
oral MLN9708 in patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, 
nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma), a total of 146 patients have been treated as of 30 April 
2012. These patients have been tr eated with different doses of MLN9708 as they are all phase 1 
trials. An overview of the most frequent (at least 10%) AEs occurring in the pooled safety  
population from single -agent oral MLN9708 Studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009)

The clinical experience with MLN9708 also shows early signs of antitumor activity as  
evidenced by at least a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged  disease 
stabilization in others across all ongoing trials. The antitumor activity has been seen  with single -
agent MLN9708, when combined w ith established therapies, and across the  malignancies 
studied (advanced solid tumors  11, non -Hodgkin ’s disease, Hodgkin ’s disease  12, relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma [RRMM ;13,14], relapsed or refractory systemic light  chain 
amyloidosis [RRAL ; 15], and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [NDMM ;16,17,18]) to date.  
 
Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this drug, the  emerging 
data supports the ongoing development of MLN9708.  
 
Of particular relevance to this study (C16011) is the clinical experience from Studies  C16004 
and C16007 in which single -agent MLN9708 is administered weekly in patients  with RRMM or 
RRAL, respectively.  
 
1.2.6     MLN9708 in Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
Study C16004 is an open -label,  dose-escalation, phase 1 study of MLN9708 administered  
weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle in adult patients with RRMM. Patients with  MM 
enrolled in the dose -escalation component of the study have relapsed following at least  2 lines  
of therapy, which must have included bortezomib, tha lidomide (or lenalidomide), and 
corticosteroids. The dose -escalation phase of the trial has completed. In this study, 2 of 3  
patients experienced protocol -defined DLTs (Grade 3 ras h and Grade 3 nausea, vomi ting, and 
diarrhea) at a dose of 3.95 mg/m2. As per protocol, subsequent patients were treated at  1 dose 
level below (2.97mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT (Grade 3 nausea,  vomiting, 
and diarrhea). The MTD of weekly oral MLN9708 was determined  to be  2.97 mg/m2.  
Once the MTD was established, cohorts of patients representing the heterogeneous patient  
population currently seen in clinical practice were enrolled i n order to further evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynami cs of ora l MLN9708. The MTD 
expansion cohorts enrolling are:

4. Velcade -Relapsed expansion cohort  
Final study results are not available for this ongoing trial, but preliminary data suggest  
MLN9708 has antitumor activity in heavily pretr eated MM patients, with durable 
respons es/disease control, and is generally well tolerated.19,20 
As of the 30 April 2012 data cut, these patients are considered heavily pretreated as evidenced 
by a median number of 4 (range 1 –13) prior lines of therapy, with 66% refractory to the last line 
of therapy. Patients have received a median of 2 cycles of the rapy (range, 1 - 11). Five patients 
have achieved objective response: 1 patient achieved a VGPR and 4 patients achieved a PR. 
Additionally, 15 patients achieved durable disease stabilization for up to 9.5 months. At data 
cut-off, 15 patients remain on treat ment; discontinuation of treatment was primarily due to 
progressive disease (69%).  
 
A summary of the safety profile of patients treated in Study C16004 is outlined in Table 1 -4. 
Overall, 92% of patients experienced a TEAE of any grade and of any cause. Per ipheral  
neuropathy was limited to Grade 1/ 2 in 6 patients, with 3 patients reporting baseline Grade 1 
PN at study entry.

* Rash includes preferred terms of rash macular, rash, maculo -papular, ra sh morbilliform, rash pruritic,  
pruritus,, rash erythematous, exfoliative rash, and rash popular  
 
 
Dose reductions required were due to AEs that included rash, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, increase  in serum creatinine, abdominal 
pain, ileus, fatigue, and pneumonia. The AEs reported for the 5 patients who were required to 
discontinue treatment included Grade 2 MLN9708 -related nausea/vomiting in 1 patient treated 
above the MTD, Grade 3 MLN9708 -related  diarrhea in a second patient, related Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia, related Grade 2 dyspnea, and notrelated Grade 4 elevation in creatinine (1 
patient each). There were no on -study deaths.  
Study C16007 is evaluating single agent weekly , Day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, oral 
dosing in patients with RRAL after at least 1 prior therapy. The objectives of this study are to 
determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD, as well as to determine hematologic and organ 
response rates in this patient population. The starting dose level was selected from Study 
C16004 as previously described. In Study C16007 the dose was switched from the BSA -based 
dosing to the fixed dose, thereby the 4.0 mg fixed starting dose in Study C16007 corresponds to 
the 2.23 mg/m2 dose (one do se level below MTD) from Study C16004. This study is currently 
enrolling patients in the dose -expansion portion of the trial.  
As of 30 April 2012, 14 patients have been treated in this study. At the first dose level of 4.0 
mg, 1 of 6 patients experienced a  protocol -defined DLT (that is, thrombocytopenia that lasted 
more than 2 weeks, which met the definition of a DLT due to the delay in starting Cycle 2). As 
per protocol, the dose was escalated to 5.5 mg for the next cohort of patients where 2 of 5 
patients  experienced a DLT (Grade 3 diarrhea, n=1; and Grade 2 dyspnea, Grade 2 acute rise in 
serum creatinine, and Grade 4 cardiac arrest, n=1). The latter patient did not appear to have 
cardiac AL amyloidosis by echocardiogram on study entry, but did have substa ntial renal 
involvement. After the occurrence of this DLT, diagnoses included cardiac involvement and 
CHF. The MTD of weekly oral MLN9708 was determined to be 4.0 mg. Following the 
establishment of the MTD, patients are currently being enrolled in to 1 of 2 cohorts: proteasome 
inhibitor naïve or proteasome inhibitor exposed.21 
As of the 30 April 2012 data cut, the patients enrolled in the study are considered heavily 
pretreated, as evidenced by a median number of 3 prior lines of therapy (range 1 –7), with 3 8%

The potential risks reported with MLN9708 use, pooled from all studies using the oral 
formulations, were antic ipated based on preclinical data and previous experience with 
VELCADE and are noted in the MLN9708 IB, SMA, and ICF documents. Regardless of 
whether MLN9708 is administered on the once weekly or twice weekly dosing schedule, there 
is consistency among the type of TEAEs reported, despite some differences in the frequency and 
severity of the reported events. While the predominant potential toxicities may be severe in 
some cases, they are largely reversible, and can be managed by routine clinical monitoring an d

1.2.7     MLM9708 in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM)  
In Study C16005, MLN9708 is given weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), in combination with 
lenalidomide (Days 1 -21), and dexamethasone (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28 -day cycle.  
Enrollment to this study is closed.   
Clinical data as of 30 April 2012 is available.  The MTD in Study C16005 was determined to be  
2.97 mg/m2 given weekly in a 28 -day cycle with LenDex.  The DLTs were urticarial rash, 
dizziness, nausea, orthostatic hypotension, vomiting, diarrhoea , and syncope.  The 
recommended p hase 2 dose (RP 2D) estimation was established following evaluation of the 
available data from the phase 1 portion of the trial which included, but was not limited to, 
analyses of efficacy results and adverse events (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral 
neuropathy, and treatment discontinuation).  Given that the dose of MLN 9708 at 2.97 mg/m2 
compromised the maximal dosing of lenalidomide and that the dose of 2.23 mg/m2 is very 
tolerable and clinically active, Millennium designated 2.23 mg/m2 as the RP2D after evaluation 
of the data and discussion with investigators.  The RP2 D of 2.23 mg/m2 has been translated into 
a fixed dose of 4.0 mg based on the results from the population PK analysis.   Enrollment in 
this study has been completed; final study results are not available, but preliminary data 
suggests oral MLN9708 given week ly plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in a 28 -day cycle 
appears well tolerated with manageable toxicity and encouraging antitumor activity.   
In Study C16005, 15 of 15 (100%) patients in the dose escalation portion of the study 
experienced at least 1 TEAE  irrespective of grade or causality.  At the MTD across all dose 
expansion cohorts 49 of 53 patients (including 3 patients from the dose escalation cohort [92%]) 
reported at least 1 TEAE irrespective of grade or causality.  In the MTD cohorts, fatigue was the 
most common AE reported (38%).  Other common AEs reported include nausea (32%), 
constipation (30%), upper respiratory infection (23%), and peripheral oedema  (21%).  Skin 
toxicity, primarily erythematous rash, occurred in 62% of patients (of note, rash is an 
overlapping toxicity with MLN9708 and lenalidomide).  Peripheral neuropathy was reported in 
13% of patients; Grade 3 in 1 patient.   
A summary of the overall safety profile of patients treated in Study C16005 is outlined in  Table 
1-6.  Overall, 100% of 65 patients experienced at least one TEAE of any grade and of any cause.

 POMALYST is an immunomodulatory antineoplastic agent. The chemical name is (RS) -4-
Amino -2-(2,6-dioxo -piperidin -3-yl)-isoind oline -1,3­dione and it has the following chemical 
structure:  
 
 
POMALYST is available in 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg capsules for oral administration. Each 
capsule contains pomalidomide  as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: 
mannitol, pregelatinized starch and sodium stearyl fumarate. The 1 mg capsule shell contains 
gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 2, yellow iron oxide, white ink and black ink. The 2 mg 
capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 2, yellow iron oxide, FD&C red 3 
and white ink. The 3 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 2, yellow 
iron oxide and white ink. The 4 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titani um dioxide, FD&C blue 
1, FD&C blue 2 and white ink.  
1.3.1       Mechanism of Action  
Pomalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic 
activity. In in vitro cellular assays, pomalidomide inhibited proliferation and induced  apoptosis 
of hematopoietic tumor cells. Additionally, pomalidomide inhibited the proliferation of 
lenalidomide -resistant multiple myeloma cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both 
lenalidomide -sensitive and lenalidomide -resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis. 
Pomalidomide enhanced T cell - and natural killer (NK) cell -mediated immunity and inhibited 
production of pro -inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF -α and IL -6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide 
demonstrated anti -angiogenic activity in a mo use tumor model and in the in vitro umbilical cord 
model.  
1.3.2     Pharmakokinetics  
Absorption  
Following administration of single oral doses of POMALYST, the Cmax for pomalidomide 
occurs at 2 and 3 hours post dose. The systemic exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide in creases in

Confidential  32                                                                     
 
 an approximately dose proportional manner. In patients with multiple myeloma who received 
POMALYST 4 mg daily alone or in combination with dexamethasone, pomalidomide steady - 
state drug exposure was characterized by AUC(Τ) of 400 ng.hr/ mL and m aximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) of 75 ng/mL. Following multiple doses, pomalidomide has an 
accumulation ratio of 27 to 31 %.  
Distribution  
Pomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at 
steady state. Pomalidomide i s distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of 
approximately 67% of plasma level at 4 hours post -dose (~Tmax) after 4 days of once daily 
dosing at 2 mg. Human plasma protein binding ranges from 12% to 44% and is not 
concentration dependen t. 
Metabolism  
Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. In vitro, 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were identified as the primary enzymes involved in the CYP -mediated 
hydroxylation of pomalidomide, with additional minor contributions from C YP2C19 and 
CYP2D6.  
Elimination  
Pomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half -life of approximately 9.5 hours in 
healthy subjects and approximately 7.5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma. Pomalidomide 
has a mean total body clearance (CL/ F) of 7 -10 L/ hr.  
Following a single oral administration of [14C] -pomalidomide (2 mg) to healthy subjects, 
approximately 73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and feces, 
respectively, with approximately 2% and 8% of the radiolabeled dose eli minated unchanged as 
pomalidomide in urine and feces.  
1.3.3    Non-clinical Toxicology  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of pomalidomide have not been conducted. One of 
twelve monkeys dosed with 1 mg/kg of pomalidomide (an exposure approximately 15 -fold of

 the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/per day) developed acute myeloid 
leukemia in a 9 -month repeat -dose toxicology study.  
Pomalidomide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a bat tery of tests, including the bacteria 
reverse mutation assay (Ames test), the in vitro assay using human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes and the micronucleus test in orally treated rats administered doses up to 2000 
mg/kg/day.  
In a fertility and early embryon ic development study in rats, drug -treated males were mated with 
untreated or treated females. Pomalidomide was administered to males and females at doses of 
25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. When treated males were mated with treated females, there was an 
increase in  post-implantation loss and a decrease in mean number of viable embryos at all dose 
levels. There were no other effects on reproductive functions or the number of pregnancies. The 
lowest dose tested in animals resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 10 0-fold of 
theexposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. When treated males on this study 
were mated with untreated females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls. 
Based on these results, the observed effects were attributed to the treatment of females.  
Pomalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes or any of the transporters in vitro.  
1.3.4    Clinical Studies  
Multiple Myeloma  
The trial that led to the recent approval of pomalidimide  was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized 
open label study in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who were refractory to their last 
myeloma therapy and had received lenalidomide and bortezomib. Patients were considered 
relapsed if they had achieved at le ast stable disease for at least one cycle of treatment to at least 
one prior regimen and then developed progressive disease. Patients were considered refractory if 
they experienced disease progression on or within 60 days of their last therapy. A total of 221 
patients were randomized to receive pomalidomide alone or pomalidomide with Low dose Dex. 
In Trial 1, the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide 4 mg, once daily for 21 of 28 days, until 
disease progression, were evaluated alone and in combination with Lo w dose Dex (40 mg per 
day given only on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 -day cycle for patients 75 years or younger, or 
20mg per day given only on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 -day cycle for patients greater than 
75 years of age). Patients in the pomalido mide alone arm were allowed to add Low dose Dex 
upon disease progression.

 Most common adverse reactions (≥30%) included fatigue and asthenia, neutropenia, anemia, 
constipation, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, upper - respiratory tract infections, back pain and 
pyrexia (6.1).  
A recent phase III randomized trial comparing pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, to high -dose 
dexamethasone alone  in patients with relapse and refractory MM , demonstrated higher response 
rates, PFS and OS in the pomalidomide arm . Ten  percent  (10%) of patients treated on the 
dexamethasone  alone arm achieved an objective response and 31% of the patients on the 
combination arm with pomalidomide and low -dose dex ameth asone achieved a response ; odds 
ratio [OR] 4·22 [2·35 –7·58] p<0·0001 . 26 The treatme nt regimens most commonly used in 
Europe are very different from those used in the United States, as patient access to many of the 
novel agents is more limited in Europe. None of the patients enrolled/treated in that trial had 
been previously treated with carfilzomib or pomalidomide. For this trial, where MLN9708 will 
be added to pomalidomide and dexamethasone,  patients with prior exposure to either of these 
agents would not be excluded. As many patients (>50%) are likely to have been previously 
treated wit h one or both of these agents we consider a response rate of 30% sufficient efficacy to 
justify further development.  
1.4      Study Rationale  
Pomalidomide is the newest immunomodulatory drug that is chemically a combination of 
thalidomide and lenalidomide . It has been studied in phase I -III trials for patients with relapsed 
myeloma.  It has shown activity even in lenalidomide refractory patients and phase III trials 
have demonstrated superior overall and progression free survival (OS/PFS) compared to high 
dose dexamethasone.  22,23 
MLN9708 is a next generation small molecule 20 -s proteasome inhibitor generated with the aim 
of improving the efficacy seen with bortezomib in MM but further improvement in drug 
administration. It has shown activity in the relaps ed and relapsed/refractory MM setting 
including bortezomib refractory patients. 24 Therefore given the synergy seen with IMIDS and 
proteasome inhibitors as well as the activity of both compounds in relapsed MM, this becomes 
an attractive combination for st udy in the relapsed/relapsed refractory setting.  
Dosing Justification  
As mentioned above, the standard FDA approved dose of pomalidomide is 4mg days 1 -21. 
Maximum response is seen when it is combined with dexamethasone. Because of an impetus in 
myeloma the rapy to be relatively steroid sparing, the generally accepted dose of dexamethasone 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  35                                                                     
 
 is a “ Low dose” weekly dosing of 40mg. Data generated from the MLN9708 plus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone trial confirmed the tolerability of this new proteasome inhibito r with an 
IMID. The RP2D of MLN9708 is 4mg d1,8,15.  However, the potential for overlapping 
hematologic toxicity especially in a more advanced disease population with pomalidomide 
(which tends to be more myelosuppressive than lenalidomide) in conjunction w ith MLN9708 
led to the choice of an initial dose of 3mg for MLN9708. Because of the synergy between 
IMIDS and proteasome inhibitors we would still expect to see activity at this dose.  
1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Please refer to the current MLN9708 Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) and the Package Insert for 
pomalidomide.  
MLN9708 is a modified dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor similar to VELCADE,  
which has a known safety profile  [VELCADE PI] .  The most frequent AEs reported to date in 
the ongoing  MLN9708 phase 1 studies were anticipated based on preclinical data and previous  
experience with VELCADE, and are noted in the IB, and the informed consent documents. 
However, it is possible that MLN9708 will have  toxicities that were not previously observe d in 
or predicted from such sources. Patients will  be monitored closely for anticipated toxicities.   
The toxicity profile of MLN9708 and pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is 
unknown and will be evaluated in this trial.  
MLN9708 shows early sign s of antitumor activity as evidenced by at least a 50% reduction in 
disease burden in some patients and prolonged disease stabilization in others across all ongoing 
trials  11,12,13,14,16,17,18. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice (GCP),  
applicable regulatory requirements, and International Co nference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines.

 4.    STUDY DESIGN  
4.1    Overview of Study Design  
4.1.1     Phase I:  
The phase I portion of the study is based on a 3 + 3 dose escalation desi gn, to evaluate toxicities 
associated with MLN9708  when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone . 
Two doses of MLN9708 ( dose level -1 and dose level 1: 3mg; dose level 2: 4mg) will be tested  
in up to three possible dose levels . Based on pre vious combination trials of MLN9708, the 4mg 
dose of MLN9708 is expected to be well tolerated. Given that this is the first study to combine 
MLN9708, with dexamethasone and pomalidomide, patients will initially be treated at a 3mg 
dose.  The maximum tolerat ed dose (MTD)  will be established by evaluating dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 and 
pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it may be less than the MTD  based on a review 
of available data/cu mulative toxicities from phase I. Patients will be treated with oral MLN9708  
on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day cycle and with Dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of 
each 28 day cycle.  Pomalidomide will be given on days 1 -21 of each 28 day cycle. The dose of 
MLN9708 and Pomalidomide administered will depend on the dose level assignment; the dose 
of dexamethasone will be fixed  (Patients >75 years , at the time of trial registration, will receive 
a Dexamethasone starting dose of 20  mg on the same set schedule).  
 
    Phase II  
Patients who enroll during the phase II portion of the trial will  be treated at the same dose and 
schedule of MLN9708, pomalidomide and dexamethasone determined safe during the phase I 
study (the RP2D).  
4.2    Number of Patients  
The phase I study is expected to enroll and treat 9 patients ; 3 patients at dose level 1, and 
another 6 treated at dose level 2 -assuming the 4mg dose of MLN9708  is well tolerated.  The 
phase II portion of the trial is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 25 patients. 
The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will count toward the 25 
patients required; given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients on the phase II trial.  
4.3    Duration of Study  
Accrual, for bo th phases, is expected to be completed in 26 months; with approximately 2 
patients enrolled each month. Patients will be treated in 28 -day treatment cycles until disease 
relapse, progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or protocol spec ified 
parameters to stop treatment. Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease relapse/progression will continue to have disease assessments per International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria until relapse or progression, initiation of new

7.  STUDY TREATMENT  
7.1   Dose and Schedule  
The phase I study will follow  a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design, to evaluate toxicities 
associated with MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone . 
Two doses of MLN9708 (3 mg and 4 mg)  will be tested  in up  to three possible dose levels .  
7.2   Dose Levels to be Tested  
Schedule: Each cycle is 28 days  
Dose  Level  Pomalidomide  MLN9708  Dexamethasone * 
-1 3mg daily on days 1 -21 3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22

*: Patients >75 years , at the time of trial registration, will receive a Dexamethasone dose of 20  
mg on the same set s chedule.  
 
7.3  Dose Limiting Toxicity/Unacceptable Toxicity  
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined  as any of the following toxicities that are at least 
possibly related to either Pomalidomide or MLN9708  that occur during cycle 1. Toxicity will be 
graded according to the NCI -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03. 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  44                                                                     
 
 Note: The Phase II portion of the study will use the same definition to define unacceptable 
toxicity.  
For the purposes of this study, DLT will be def ined as:  
 Grade 4 neutropenia  
 Grade 3 neutropenia with fevers > 38.5°C  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
 Grade 3 or higher non -hematological toxicity will be considered dose limiting with the 
following except ions:  diarrhea, fatigue, nausea or vomiting will only be considered dose 
limiting if, after 48 hours it has not recovered to <Grade 3 (despite maximal medical 
therapy), allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, or electrolyte/metabolic toxicity unable to be 
corrected to <Grade 1  or baseline within 48 hours will be considered dose limiting.  
 Delay in starting cycle 2 on the scheduled day 1 for > 7 days due to treatment related 
toxicity  
 Any dose modification or delay of MLN9708 or Pomalidomide during cycle 1, except 
modifications/d elays done in response to hypo - hyperthyroidism <=Grade 2, herpes 
zoster infection, all considered idiopathic or intrinsic to the underlying myeloma .  
 
7.4    Dose Escalation/Expansion  
DLT  incidence  will be based on toxicity events encountered during the firs t cycle of treatment 
with the combination of MLN9708, pomalidomide and dexamethasone.  
Dose de-escalation, escalation or cohort expansion will only take place after 3 patients are fully 
assessed  using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCA E) of the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) version  4.03 following the  completion of cycle 1.  
Dose escalation will occur according to the following rules:  
 If zero out of 3 evaluable patients has a DLT in cycle 1 then the next dose level of 
combination therapy will be tested.  
 If 1 out of 3 evaluable patients has a DLT in cycle 1, three additional patients will be 
assessed at the same dose level of combination therapy.  
 If 2 out of 3 patients have a DLT in cycle 1, dose escalation will cease and the next 
lower dose level of combination therapy will be expanded.  Note: If 2 of 3 experience 
DLT on dose level -1, the trial will be stopped.  
 If 1 out of 6 evaluable patients has a DLT in cycle 1, then dose escalation to the next 
dose level of combination therapy w ill continue.

  If 2 or more out of 6  patients have a DLT in cycle 1, dose escalation will cease and the 
next lower dose level of combination therapy will be expanded.  Note: If 2 of 6 
experience DLT on dose level -1 the trial will be stopped.  
The highest do se level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in cycle 1 will be the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD).  
Note:  Patients may continue therapy unless there is unacceptable toxicity, disease progression 
or withdrawl of consent.   
7.5   Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)  
The MTD  will be based on the assessment of DLT during cycle 1 (see section 7.4). The MTD 
will be defined as the highest dose at which  ≤ 1/6  patients in a cohort experience DLT. The 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 and pomalidomide will generally be the 
MTD, but it may be less than the MTD  based on a review of available data/cumulative 
toxicities from phase I.    
7.6    Study Drug Administration   
All protocol -specific criteria for administration of study drug must be met and documented 
before drug administrati on.  Study drug will be administered  or dispensed  only to eligible 
patients under the supervision of the investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients 
should be monitored for toxicity, as necessary, and doses of study drug should be modified as 
needed to accommodate patient tolerance to treatment; this may include symptomatic treatment, 
dose interruptions, and a djustments of dose . 
7.6.1    MLN9708  Administration  
Patients should be instructed to swallow MLN9708 capsules whole, with water, and not to 
break, chew, or open the capsules.  MLN9708  should be taken on an empty stomach (no food or 
drink) at least 1 hour before or 2  hours after a meal.  Each capsule should be swallowed 
separately with a sip of water.  A total of approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of  water should be 
taken with the capsules.   
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers if the next scheduled dose is 
72 hours or more away.  A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.  If the 
patient vomits after taking  a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume 
dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.

 7.6.2     Pomalidomide Administration  
Pomalidomide  capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or 
opened.  Pomalidomide shou ld be taken without food, at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a 
meal.  Pomalidomide capsules may be taken with water.   
If a dose of pomalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If 
it is missed for the entire day, it  should not be made up, rather it should be taken at the next 
scheduled time point.  Similarly, if the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not 
repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.  
Patients who t ake more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide should be instructed to seek 
emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.   
Pomalidomide (POMALYST®) will be provided to research patients for the duration of their 
participation in  this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Pomalidomide will 
be provided in accordance with the Celgene  Corporation’s POMALYST REMS™  program.  
Per the standard   POMALYST REMS™ program requirements, all physicians who prescribe 
pomali domide for research patients enrolled into this trial, and all research patients enrolled into 
this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the POMALYST 
REMS™ program.   
Drug will be shipped on a per patient basis by the contract pharmacy to the clinic site for IND 
studies.  Only enough pomalidomide for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient 
each cycle.  This is in accordance with the POMALYST REMS™ program.  
Special Handling Instructions  
Female caregivers of childbearing potential should not handle or administer pomalidomide 
unless they are wearing gloves.  
7.6.3     Dexamethasone Administration  
Dexamethsone is commercially available and commercial supplies will be u sed for this study.  
Oral d examethasone will be give n on an outpatient basis. Missed doses of dexamethasone will 
not be made up.  Similarly, i f the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat 
the dose but should resume dosing at the ti me of the next scheduled dose.  Procedures for dose 
reductions and d elays are summarized in Section 7.9.2 .

 7.6.4   Growth Factor A dministration  
For the Phase I portion of the study, g rowth factors, granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G -
CSF],  may be given  prophylactically for at least two days on days 21 – 26 during or beyond 
cycle 2. For the Phase II portion of the study, G -CSF may be given prophylactically for at least 
two days on days 21 -26 during or beyond cycle 1 . It will be administered subcutaneousl y at a 
dose of 5ug/kg or per institutional standard practice dosing either daily or every other day for a 
minimum of two doses.  If patients experience neutropenia or dosing delays, we would 
recommend consideration of growth factor in subsequent cycles.  
7.7    Dose Modification Guidelines   
Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each visit with the NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria, Version 4.03 used as a guide for the grading of severity.   
As defined in section 7.3, d uring the p hase I  portion of the stud y, any toxicity related dose 
modification or delay of MLN9708 or Pomalidomide during cycle 1 except 
modifications/delays done in response to hypo - hyperthyroidism <=Grade 2, herpes zoster 
infection, all considered idiopathic or intrinsic to the underlying myeloma is  a DLT.  No dose 
escalations are permitted in any given patient once a dose level has been assigned.  While 
patients experiencing DLT during Cycle 1 may continue on therapy, if toxicity can be managed 
according to the dose modification guidelines  outlined below,  the DLT event will contribute to 
the assessment of MTD for that given cohort. Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity 
if they receive any study drug. Patients will be considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity if 
they rece ive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide and MLN9708  and are followed for the full 28 
days during cycle 1  or experience a DLT. For the phase II portion, as part of the primary 
analysis, patients will be considered evaluable for response if they are eligible,  have baseline 
disease assessments, and receive any protocol treatment. As part of a secondary analysis, 
patients will be considered evaluable for response if they have baseline disease assessments, 
receive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide  and MLN9708 during the first cycle of therapy and 
have had their disease re -evaluated.    
Dose modifications may be performed in all subsequent cycles of treatment regardless of which 
phase of study the patient  is enrolled on.  If toxicities cannot be ma naged by dose modification 
or the patient cannot tolerate the lowest dose of study drug, the patient is to be discontinued 
from study treatment.  However, patients that have achieved a plateau of response to study

7.10    Criteria for Beginning or Delaying a Subsequent Treatment Cycle  
For a new cycle of treatment to begin, the patient must meet the followi ng criteria:  
• ANC must be ≥ 1,000/mm3.  
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3 or  > =50,000/mm3 for patients with baseline 
platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 but <75,000/mm3. 
• All other nonhematologic  toxicity (except for alopecia) must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 
or to the patient’s baseline condition  
If the patient fails to meet the above -cited criteria for initiation of the next cycle of treatment, 
dosing should be delayed for 1 week. At the end of t hat time, the patient should be re -evaluated 
to determine whether the criteria have been met. If the patient continues to fail to meet the 
above -cited criteria, delay therapy and continue to re evaluate. The maximum delay before 
treatment should be discont inued will be 3 weeks or at the discretion of the Principal 
Investigator.

study.   
 Fluid deficits should be corrected before and throughout treatment.  
7.11.3   Required/Recommended Concomitant Therapy  
 Pomalidomide  increases the risk of thromboembolism. Anti -coagulation prophylaxis is 
required after an assessment of each patient’s underlying risk factors, unless there is an 
excess risk of bleeding.  
 Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir is recommended for herpes prophy laxis.   
 For the Phase I portion of the study, g rowth factors, granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor [G -CSF],  may be given  prophylactically for at least two days on days 21 – 26 
during or beyond cycle 2. For the Phase II portion of the study, G -CSF may be given 
prophylactically for at least two days on days 21 -26 during or beyond cycle 1 . It will be 
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 5ug/kg or per institutional standard practice 
dosing either daily or every other day for a minimum of two doses.  If pa tients 
experience neutropenia or dosing delays, we would recommend consideration of growth 
factor in subsequent cycles.  
 Allopurinol is recommended for patients with high tumor burden due to the possibility of 
tumor lysis syndrome.

 7.11.4    Pregnancy  
It is not kn own what effects MLN9708 has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo 
or fetus.  Pomalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Therefore, 
female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male pa tients 
should avoid impregnating a female partner.  Females of child bearing potential* and male 
patients should use effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after 
study treatment as specified below.  
A female of child bearing p otential is any sexually mature female who:  
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or  
2) has  not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had 
menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
7.11.4.1    Females  
Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual 
sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control simultaneously (one highly 
effective form of contraception – tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, 
hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants) or partner’s vasectomy and one additional effective 
contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm or cervical cap. 
Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment, during therapy, during dose 
interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following di scontinuation of pomalidomide or 90 days 
following discontinuation of MLN9708. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there 
has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Females of reproductive potential 
should be referred to a qua lified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed.  
Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating 
therapy. The first test should be performed within 10 -14 days, and the second test within 24 
hours prior to presc ribing pomalidmide and MLN9708. Once treatment has started and during 
dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly 
during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks i n 
females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing 
should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient 
misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrua l bleeding.  Treatment with 
pomalidomide and MLN9708 must be discontinued during this evaluation. All study

 participants must be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS™ program, and be 
willing and able to comply with the requirements of the POMALYST R EMS™ program.  
7.11.4.2    Males  
Pomalidomide is present in the semen of males who take pomalidomide . The effects of 
MLN9708 are unknown. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during 
any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide or 
MLN9708 and for up to 28 days after discontinuing pomalidomide or 90 days after 
discomtinuation of MLN9708, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male 
patients taking pomalidmide or MLN9708 must not donate sperm.  All study participants must 
be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS™ program, and be willing and able to 
comply with the requirements of the POMALYST REMS™ program.  
7.12   Management of Clinical Events  
Adverse drug reactions such as thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and rash 
have been associated with MLN9708 treatment. Man agement guidelines regarding these events 
are outlined below. Further details of management of MLN9708 AEs are described  the  
MLN9708 IB.  
Prophylaxis Against Risk of Infection  
If lymphopenia is noted, patients may be at an increased risk of infection.  In particular, 
lymphopenia can be associated with reactivation of herpes zoster and herpes simplex viruses.  
Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir may be initiated as clinically indicated.  
Other antivirals are also acceptable.  
Nausea and/or Vom iting 
Standard anti -emetics, including 5 -HT3 antagonists, are recommended for emesis occurring 
upon treatment initiation; prophylactic anti -emetics may also be considered.  Dexamethasone 
should not be administered as an anti -emetic.  Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation 
of study drug and during treatment.  
Diarrhea  
Diarrhea should be managed according to clinical practice, including the administration of 
antidiarrheals once infectious causes are excluded.  Fluid intake should be maintained to  avoid 
dehydration.  Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation of treatment  and during 
treatment . Prophylactic antidiarrheals are not generally recommended.

 Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus  
As with VELCADE, rash with or without pruritu s has been reported with MLN9708, primarily 
at the higher doses tested. The rash may range from some erythematous areas, macular and/or 
small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body or more 
generalized, has been transient  and has resolved either spontaneously or with standard 
symptomatic measures such as oral or topical steroids and/or antihistamines. Prophylactic 
measures should also be considered if a patient develops a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free 
emollient cre am on dry areas of the body).  In the case of rash, the use of a topical or oral steroid 
(eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day or equivalent) is permitted.   A rare risk is Steven s-Johnson 
Syndrome, a severe, life -threatening or deadly rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which 
should be managed symptomatically according to standard medical practice.   
Thrombocytopenia  
Thrombocytopenia has been reported to date primarily at the higher doses tested .  Blood counts 
should be monitored regularly as outlined in the p rotocol with additional testing obtained 
according to standard clinical practice.  Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been 
manageable with platelet transfusions according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia 
nadirs commonly recover without i ntervention by the beginning of the next scheduled cycle. 
MLN9708 administration should be modified as noted as per dose modi fication 
recommendations when thrombocytopenia occurs.  A rare risk is thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (TTP), a rare blood diso rder where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout 
the body characterized by thrombocytopenia, petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious signs 
and symptoms. TTP should be managed symptomatically according to standard medical 
practice.  
Neutropen ia 
Neutropenia  has been reported with MLN9708  and pomalidomide .  Blood counts should be 
monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional testing obtained according to 
standard clinical practice.  Neutrop enia may be severe but has been manage able with G-CSF 
Neutropenic nadirs commonly recover without intervention by the beginning of the next 
scheduled cycle or with a short delay in treatment.  MLN9708 administration should be 
modified when neutropenia occurs, as noted in the dose modification recommendations . Given 
that MLN9708 will be administered in combination with pomalidomide, with overlapping 
toxicity of neutropenia,  G -CSF will be used prophylactically in this protocol.

 Fluid Deficits  
Dehydration should be avoided  because  MLN9708 may cause vomiting, diarrhea , and 
dehydration .  Acute  renal failure has been reported with MLN9708.  Fluid deficits should be 
corrected before initiation of study drug  and during treatment  and as needed during therapy .   
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induced prevalence of nephrotoxicity is 
relatively low; however, given the wide use of these agents many persons are at risk, including 
for example, patients with cardio -renal disease, dehydration, and the aging kidney. NSA IDs 
should be avoided with impaired renal function given reported NSAID -induced renal failure in 
patients with decreased renal function. Until further information is available, intake of NSAIDs 
while on this protocol should be avoided.  
Hypotension  
Symptoma tic hypotension and orthostatic hypotension have been reported with MLN9708. 
Blood pressure should be closely monitored while the patient is on study treatment and fluid 
deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of concomitant sympto ms such as 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage 
their blood pressure (for either hypo - or hypertension) should be managed according to standard 
clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustments of their concomitant medications 
during the course of the trial.   
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported with 
MLN9708.  While this case ultimately resolved , PRES has also been reported rarely with 
another proteasome inhibitor, Velcade.  PRES is characterized by headache, seizures and visual 
loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure.  Prompt diagnosis and initiation of 
antihypertensive and anticonvul sant therapy are important to prevent irreversible end -organ 
damage.  
Anticoagulation Consideration   
Pomalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or with a 
history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with othe r drugs known to cause thrombosis.

 Consideration should be given to the requirement of aspirin (81 or 325 mg) or some other form 
of prophylaxis as deemed appropriate. Low molecular weight heparin may be utilized in patients 
that are intolerant to ASA. Cou madin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  
8.  STUDY DRUG

The study drug MLN9708 capsules will be provided by Millennium.  The study drug will be 
labeled and handled as open -label material, and packagi ng labels will fulfill all requirements 
specified by governing regulations.   
MLN9708 capsules should  be stored unopened at 2°C to 8°C (36°F -46°F).  The capsules are 
individually packaged in cold form foil -foil blisters in a child -resistant package.  The 0.5-, 2.3-, 
3.0-, and 4.0 mg capsules are supplied as a 1 x 3 blister card in a child -resistant cardboard 
wallet.   
8.1.2    Pomalidomide  
Pomalidomide capsules will be provided by Celgene Corporation as 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mg  
capsules for oral administration.   
Pomalidomide (POMALYST®) will be provided to research patients for the duration of their 
participation in this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Pomalidomide will 
be provided in accordance with the  Celgene Corporation’s POMALYST R EMS™  program.  
Per the standard   POMALYST REMS™ program requirements, all physicians who prescribe 
pomalidomide for research patients enrolled into this trial, and all research patients enrolled into 
this trial, must be registered in and must comply with  all requirements of the POMALYST

 handled by FCBP unless wearing gloves.  All bottles will contain the following warning label:  
“WARNING: POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN BIRTH DEFECTS.”  
The study drug label must be clearly visible.  Additional labels must not cover the Celgene 
label.  
8.2  Storage, Handling, and Accountability  
MLN9708 and pomalidomide  are anticancer drugs and as with other potentially toxic 
compounds caution should be exercised when handling MLN9708 and pomalidomide capsules.  
8.2.1    MLN9708  
Upon receipt at the investigative site, MLN9708 should remain in the blister and carton 
provided unt il use or until drug is dispensed. The container should be stored at the investigative 
site refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C). Ensure that the drug is used before the retest expiry 
date provided by Millennium. Expiry extensions will be communicated a ccordingly with 
updated documentation to support the extended shelf life.  
In countries where local regulations permit, MLN9708 capsules dispensed to the patient for 
take-home dosing should remain in the blister packaging and refrigerated as noted above unt il 
the point of use. The investigative site is responsible for providing the medication to the patient 
in the correct daily dose configurations. Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the 
patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedur es. Patients who are receiving take -
home medication should be given only 1 cycle of medication at a time. Patients should be 
instructed to store the medication refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C) for the duration of 
each cycle. Patients should be instr ucted to return their empty blister packs to the investigative 
site, rather than discarding them. Reconciliation will occur accordingly when the patient returns 
for their next cycle of take -home medication. Any extreme in temperature should be reported as 
an excursion and should be dealt with on a case -by-case basis.  
Because MLN9708 is an investigational agent, it should be handled with due care. Patients 
should be instructed not to chew, break, or open capsules. In case of contact with broken 
capsules, rai sing dust should be avoided during the clean -up operation. The product may be 
harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Gloves and protective clothing should be 
worn during cleanup and return of broken capsules and powder to minimize skin conta ct.

 The area should be ventilated and the site washed with soap and water after material pick -up is 
complete. The material should be disposed of as hazardous medical waste in compliance with 
federal, state, and local regulations.  
In case of contact with th e powder (eg, from a broken capsule), skin should be washed 
immediately with soap and copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. In case of contact 
with the eyes, copious amounts of water should be used to flush the eyes for at least 15 minutes. 
Medical personnel should be notified. Patients are to be instructed on proper storage, 
accountability, and administration of MLN9708, including that MLN9708 is to be taken as 
intact capsules.  
Investigational MLN9708 (expired or end of study) should be destroy ed on site according to the 
institution’s standard operating procedure.  Be sure to document removal and destruction on 
drug accountability logs.  
8.2.2    Pomalidomide  
Care should be e xercised in handling of pomalidomide. Pomalidomide  capsules should not be 
opened or crushed. If powder from pomalidomide contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately 
and thoroughly  with soap and water. If  pomalidomide contacts the mucous membranes, flush 
thoroughly with water.   
 
The Investigator or desig nee is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of 
pomalidomide received, and comparing it with the accompanying study drug accountability 
form.  The Investigator or designee will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign 
and dat e it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to Celgene or its representative.    
 
Storage  
At the study site, all pomalidomide  will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized 
access.  The study drug should be stored at room temperat ure away from direct sunlight and 
protected from excessive heat and cold.  
 
Unused study drug supplies  
Celgene will instruct the Investigator  or designee  on the return or destruction of unused 
pomalidomide .  If any pomalidomide is lost or damaged, its dispo sition should be documented 
in the source documents.  Pomalidomide supplies will be retained at the clinical site pending 
instructions for disposition by Celgene.  Patients will be instructed to return empty bottles or 
unused capsules.   
 
Only enough pomal idomide capsules for 1 cycle of therapy may be provided to the patient

the investigator or identified sub -investigator(s).  The appropriate study personnel will maintain 
records of study drug receipt and dispensing.  
9.1   Treatment Assignment   
Patients will be assigned at the time of enrollment (per section 6.0) to a given dose level during 
the p hase I portion of the study or to the recommended p hase II dose as determined during the 
phase I portion of the study .  
9.2   Termination of Treatment and/or Study Participation  
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason, wit hout prejudice to their medical care.  The investigator also has the right to withdraw 
patients from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 Adverse event  
 Lack of Protocol adherence  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Progressive disease  
 Study termination   
At the time o f withdrawal, all study procedures outlined for the End of Treatment  visit should 
be completed. The primary reason for patient’s withdrawal from the study will be recorded in 
the source documents and CRF.  
The Lead Principal Investigator or designee must b e notified within 24 hours if a patient is 
withdrawn from the study by the Data Coordinating Center or designee.  
If the reason for withdrawal is the occurrence of an AE, the Investigator will follow the patient  
until such events resolve, stabilize, and ac cording to the Investigator’s judgment, there is no 
need of further follow up.

 10.    STATISTICAL AND QUAN TITATIVE ANALYSES  
10.1    Statistical Methods  
10.1.1      Determination of Sample Size  
Phase I: The phase I study will follow a 3+3 design,  to evaluate toxicities associated with 
MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.  Two doses of 
MLN9708 (dose level -1 and dose level 1: 3 mg; dose level 2: 4 mg)  will be tested  in up to three 
possible dose levels; there will be no dose redu ctions below the 3mg dose of MLN9708. In the 
phase I portion of this study, the total sample size will depend on the number of dose levels 
evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). While the phase I study is expected 
to enroll and treat  9 patients ( 3 patients treated on dose level 1 and 6 additional patients treated 
at dose level 2 -assuming the 4mg dose is well tolerated), a maximum of 18 patients could be 
treated (6 patients per dose level ). The highest dose level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in  cycle 1 
will be the MTD. (See section 7.4  for dose expansion/escalation rules.)  The recommended 
phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 and pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it may be 
less than the MTD  based on a review of available data/cumulative to xicities from phase I.  
Phase I I: For this trial, where MLN9708 will be added to pomalidomide and dexamethasone,  
patients with prior exposure to either of these agents would not be excluded , unlike the patients 
treated on the randomized phase III study of c omparing pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, to 
high-dose dexamethasone alone. As many patients (>50%) are likely to have been previously 
treated with one or both of these agents  we consider a response rate of 30% sufficient efficacy to 
justify further develo pment.26 In addition, t he estimation of response in this refractory/ high-risk 
population is of equal importance. Given this, t he phase II portion of the trial, will use a Gehan 
two stage design (Gehan, 1961). The phase II trial is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a 
maximum of 25 patients. The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study 
will count toward the 25 patients required. Given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients 
on the phase II trial. The sample size is based on the desire to estimate the response rate  with at 
most 10% standard error, and early stopping if the combination is unexpected ly ineffective . The 
primary endpoint is confirmed tumor response ( sCR/CR/VGPR or  PR).  
At stage 1, 9 patients will be entered on the study. If 0 responses are seen in the first 9 patients 
treated, the study will be terminated and the true regimen response will be declared ≤30%. If at 
least 1 patient responds, the trial will continue t o the second stage. Because patients treated 
during the phase I portion of the trial at the dose selected for the phase II trial will be counted

 (n=6), only 3 additional patients will be enrolled at stage 1. Under this design if the study 
regimen is >30% e ffective, there would be ~95.6% chance of at least one success.  At stage 2, 16 
additional patients will be entered.  This accrual provides for estimation of the response rate with 
no more than 10% standard error.    
10.1.2        Populations for Analysis  
Phase I  (Evaluable for Toxicity) : Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity if they 
receive any study drug. Patients will be considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity if they 
receive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide and MLN9708  and are followed for the full 28 days  
during cycle 1  or experience a DLT.  All patients who are not evaluable for dose limiting 
toxicity will be replaced.  
Phase II (Evaluable for Toxicity):  Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity if they 
receive any study drug.  Pat ients in Phase II will not be replaced based on toxicity.   
Phase  I and  II (Evaluable for Response) : For the phase II portion, as part of the primary 
analysis, patients will be considered evaluable for response if they are eligible, have baseline 
disease assessments, and receive any protocol treatment. As part of a secondary analysis,  
patients will be considered evaluable for response if they have baseline disease assessm ents, 
receive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide and MLN9708 during the first cycle of therapy and 
have had their disease re -evaluated. Patients will have their response classified according to the 
IMWG response criteria. All patients in phase II and those treated at the RP2D in phase I, who 
are not evaluable for response will be replaced.  
10.1.3     Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, medical history, and

descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, standard deviation, standard error, median (range) will 
be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.  
10.1.4           Efficacy Analysis  
A primary activity endpoint is not defined for the Phase I study. The primary activity endpoint 
for the Phase II study is response rate. Response rates (overall, clinical benefit) and depth of 
response will be calculated as the percent of  evaluable pat ients that have confirmed 
sCR/CR /VGPR or PR  (overall) or sCR/CR /VGPR /PR/MR or SD (clinical benefit) , exact 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated for these estimates. Response rates will also be evaluated

 based on number and type of prior therapy(ies). Response defined  as per modified IMWG 
criteria. Time to response, duration of response, and survival (overall and progression -free) will 
be estimated using the product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier.  
10.1.5     Safety Analysis  and Stopping Rules for Excessive Toxicity  
Toxicity information recorded will include the type, severity, and the probable association with 
the study regimen. Tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by severity 
and type  of toxicity.  
The following table will be consulted as relevant toxicities are encountered.  The early stopping 
rule for safety /toxicity  will be assessed for each patient after cycle 1 . The expected rate  of 
unacceptable toxicity  should not be ≥33 %. Note: Un acceptable toxicity is defined in section 7.3 
of the protocol. See the table below for detailed early stopping rules. These rules are in addition 
to the quarterly review of all toxicities submitted to the COH DSMC. Patients with ongoing 
toxicity ( cycle 1 t oxicity persisting beyond day + 28) will be followed until resolution or 
stability.  If more than the specified number of patients has significant treatment related 
toxicities, patient accrual will be halted and a full review of the data by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be mandated. Patient accrual will not resume until 
approved by the DSMC  to do so.

the cumulative # of patients reaches or exceeds the specified limits.  
We recognize that these stopping rules represent the overall stoping rules including the patient 
evaluated on a given dose during the Phase I portion. As such, these rules represent the stopping 
probabilities of a dose with the above toxicity rates, inclu ding stopping during the phase I dose 
finding portion. Once the MTD has been selected, and additional patients are accrued 
(presumably at the MTD), the probability of early stopping is less (e.g. 26% of chance of early 
stopping at 12 patients if the true p robability of unacceptable toxicity is 33%, and a 44% chance

stopping conditional on passing the criteria for MTD selection (0 or 1 out of 6).  
11.    DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING    
11.1    Definition of Risk Level  
This is a Risk Level 4 study, as defined in the “City of Hope Data and Safety Monitoring Plan”, 
http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Pages/forms -and-procedures.aspx . City of Hope is sponsor of this 
IND.  
11.2  Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring  
The Protocol Monitoring Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, 
CRC/protocol nurse, sta tistician and COH Data Coordinating Center staff is responsible for 
monitoring the data and safety of this study, including implementation of the stopping rules for 
safety and efficacy.   
 
Beginning with the enrollment of the first patient , the PMT will me et weekly or bi -weekly via 
teleconference for patient and protocol management issues.   
 
This study will utilize  the Phase I tracking log to monitor  data and safety for  dose escalation, 
recording doses administered, and resultant adverse events .  The track ing log will contain  dose 
levels administered, DLT -defining adverse events, and documentation that the data from a dose 
level is complete before dose escalation.   Those d ata and safety elements will be reported to the 
COH DSM C as applicable within the PMT report, which will be submitted quarterly from the 
anniversary date of activation, as noted in Table 1 below .

11.3  Definitions  
11.3.1     Pretreatment Event Definition  
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has signed 
informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study medication; it 
does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation .  For serious pre -
treatment events, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the even t to the study procedures.  
11.3.2        Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily 
have a causal relationsh ip with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has

 increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.   When possible, signs 
and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one 
comprehensive event.  
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clin ically significant change from baseline.   
11.3.3        Unexpected Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a) ] 
An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed ; is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an expected natural progression of 
any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant 
experiencing the AE.  
11.3.4        Expected Adverse Event  
Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected event OR is an expected natural 
progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the 
research participant experiencing the AE.  
 
         11.3.5    Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as any expected or 
unexpected AE  that, at any dose,   results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Results in death . 
 Is life-threatening  (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk  of death at 
the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe);  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization  (except scheduled hospitalizations fo r non -acute, unrelated 
cause such as an elective surgery) ;

  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  (Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions).   
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Secondary malignancy , or 
 Any other AE that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  (examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse).  
11.3.6      Unanticipated problem  – Any incident, experience or outcome that meets all 
three  of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol -related do cuments such as the IRB 
approved research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure 
(IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly rela ted means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may 
have been caused by the drugs, devices or procedures involved in the research); 
AND  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously 
known or recognized.  
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe 
in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are  NOT synonymous.  The 
general term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache).  This is NOT the same as serious , whi ch is based on patient/event outcome or action 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  71                                                                     
 
 criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be 
considered serious.  F or example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is 
considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations . 
AEs which are serious must be  reported to Celgene and Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee) from the date the participant signs Informed Consent through 30 days after 
administration of the last dost of pomalidomide or MLN9708. Any SAE that occurs at any time 
after completion of  MLN9708/pomalidmide treatment or after the designated follow -up period 
that the sponsor -investigator and/or sub -investigator considers to be related to any study drug 
must be reported to Millennium/Celgene Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  In addition, new 
primary malignancies that occur during the follow -up periods must be reported, regardless  of 
causality to study regime n, for a minimum of  three  years  after the last dose of the investigational 
product, starting from the first dose of study drug. All new cases of primary malignancy must be 
reported to Millennium/Celgene Pharmacovigilance (or designee).    
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedur es for an illness or disease that existed before 
the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition 
deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or 
later than planned).  All  SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly 
determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness (es). Each 
Investigator is also responsible for reviewing their institutional guidelines and reporting locally 
based on those guidelines (i.e., unanticipated problems).  
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by the investigator or sub -
investigator by responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE  
is associated with the study drug(s)?

Unanticipated Problems:  Most unanticipated problems must be reported to the COH 
DSMC and IRB  within 5 calendar days according  to definitions and guidelines at

 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female patient  occurring while the patient is on MLN9708 or pomalidomide, 
or within 90 days  of the patient ’s last dose of therapy), are considered immediately reportable 
events. MLN9708 and pomalidomide are to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported. The investigator must notify 
the sponsor -investigator and the COH DCC immediately by phone and by completing and 
faxing the Notification of Unanticipated Problem/Serious Adverse Event/Pregnancy Form 
(attached as an Appendix 15.3).  The sponsor -investigator through the COH DCC will be 
responsible f or notifying Millennnium Pharmacovigilence(through Millennium Pregnancy Form 
attached as Appendix 15.4.4)//Celgene Drug Safety.   
 
The female patient should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one  
experienced in reproductive toxicity fo r further evaluation and counseling.  
 
The Investigator will follow the female patient  until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the sponsor -investigator and the COH DCC immediately phone and by completing by 
completing and faxing the Notification of Unanticipated Problem/Serious Adverse  
Event/Pregnancy Form (attached as an Appendix 15.3).  The sponsor -investigator through the

Millennium Pregnancy Form attached as Append ix 15.4.4)//Celgene Drug Safety immediately 
about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy 
Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or t herapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any 
of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE. The investigator must notify the sponsor -

All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, and PD) require two consecutive assessments made at anytime 
before the institution of any new therapy; complet e response and PR and SD categories also require no 
known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.  VGPR and 
CR categories require serum and urine studies regardless of whether disease at baseline was measurable 
in serum, urine both or either.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed.  For progressive disease, serum M -
component increases of ≥ I gm/dl are sufficient to define respons e if starting M -component is ≥ 5 g/dl.     
 
IMWG clarification for coding PD:  Clarified that Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be used only in 
patients without measurable disease by M protein and by FLC levels.  Clarified that 25% increase refers 
to M pr otein, FLC, and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, soft tissue plasmacytomas 
or hypercalcemia.  Note the lowest response value does not need to be a confirmed value.

contained in the subject’s medical record.  
2. When completing the in itial eligibility checklist, participating sites are asked to print and 
use bla ck ink.  
3. The subject must not be identified by name on any study document.  If a form such as a 
radiographic report or lab report is submitted, the subject’s name must be obliter ated and 
replaced with the subject’s initials and registration number.  
4. All dates must be verifiable by source documents.   
 
Data Transmission:  
 
1. Registration documents including eligibility checklist, demographics and corresponding 
source documentation wil l be sent to the Data Coordinating Center via fax or via City of 
Hope’s Secure Mail system in order to ensure proper registration/randomization of each 
subject.  As this information may contain identifiers (patient name, medical record 
number, date of birt h, sex, race, ethnicity, zip code as required for internal registration), it 
is imperative that participating sites either fax this data OR use the Secure Mail route  by 
typing #secure# in the email subject line .  All participating sites will be sent out the City 
of Hope Secure Mail guide.

information but will always refer to the protocol specific patient number.  
 
Data Analysis :  
 
Joycelynne M. Palmer, PhD, is responsible for data analysis. Details regarding the study design 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential    106 and planned analyses can be found in section 10.0 of the protocol docum ent. 
 
Quality Assurance and Monitoring  
 
1. The COH Data Coordinating staff will monitor each protocol conducted at participating 
sites to verify that the rights and well -being of human subjects are protected, the 
reported trial data are accurate, complete and  verifiable from source documents, and 
that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s) with the GCP and with applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
COH Data Coordinating Center will determine the appropria te extent and nature of the 
monitoring based on considerations such as study objective, purpose, design, 
complexity, blinding, size and endpoints of the trial.  A trial may require onsite 
monitoring at the participating site or may be subject to remote mon itoring.  Remote 
monitoring will involve the participating site submitting de -identified source 
documentation to the COH Data Coordinating Center.  Monitoring of that data will be 
done at COH by assuring the data captured onto CRFs is the same as the sourc e 
documentation submitted.   
2. Each IRB approved protocol will undergo monitoring evaluations by the COH Data 
Coordinating Center staff at varying time points as determined by the Division of 
Clinical Research Information Support.  A trial may require onsite  monitoring at the 
participating site or may be subject to remote monitoring.  Remote monitoring will 
involve the participating site submitting de -identified source documentation to the COH 
Data Coordinating Center.  Monitoring of that data will be done at  COH by assuring the 
data captured onto CRFs is the same as the source documentation submitted.  
3. In addition, COH research personnel from the Office of Clinical Research Auditing & 
Monitoring may audit protocol compliance  at participating sites at intervals decided by 
the coordinating center and  their office.  Auditing is dependent upon the protocol’s phase, 
accrual rate, IND stat us, and results of previous evaluations.   
4. Participating sites will be informed of intended mon itoring evaluations in a timely 
manner prior to the proposed visit and/or request for remote monitoring.  When informed 
of an impending monitoring evaluation (either onsite or remotely) by COH staff, the 
participating site is required to prepare for the vi sit by including but not limited to:  1) 
providing adequate, private space for COH staff to conduct the evaluation, 2) having a 
contact person available for periodic questions, 3) providing the medical record or 
applicable documentation for each subject mo nitored on the day of the visit, 4) providing 
an organized collection of regulatory documents pertaining to the study,  5) flagging all 
source documents pertinent to data collections; and/or 6) de -identifying and submitt ing to 
the Data Coordinating Center all source documentation for subjects.  Following any

Rationale for this Study:  
Novel drugs are needed for the treatment of relapsed or relapsed  refractory multiple myeloma.  
The combination of  proteasome  inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulating (IMiD) agents has 
produced significant responses. Many patients are exposed  to these classes of drugs earlier in 
the course of therapy, for patients who relapse after agents such as  the PI bortezomib  and the 
IMiD  lenalidomide , newer agents are now available or in development including 
pomalidomide and MLN9708.  Pomalidomide is an  IMiD that is active even in patients who 
are refractory to other IMiDS such as lenalidomide. MLN9708 is a PI that has shown activity 
in patients refractory to bortezomib.  MLN9708 has shown activity in Phase I/II trials and 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone have shown activity in Phase I/II and III trials. Hence 
combining the two agents and including dexamethasone for synergy could potentially induce 
responses in this refractory patient  population . 
Objectives:  
Phase I:  
Primary:  
1) To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)  of MLN9708 when given in 
combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone , in patients with relapsed or 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . 
Secondary:  
2) To evaluate the safety of MLN9708 at each dose level when given as part of a three drug 
combination by assessing the following:  
 - type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration  of adverse events  
 - clinical laboratory tests at various points in the study

 Phase II:  
Primary:  
1. To estimate the response rate and to evaluate the antitumor activity of the three drug 
combination: MLN9708 (at the RP2D), pomalidomide and dexamethasone , in patients with 
relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  
Secondary:  
At the RP2D, for the three drug combination:  
2. To character ize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time 
course and duration.  
3. To obtain estimates of response duration, depth of response, clinical benefit response, and 
survival (overall and progression -free).  
Study Design:  
This study will be conducted as a multicenter phase I/II trial.  
 
The phase I portion will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design , to evaluate  toxicities 
associated with MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone . Two dos es of MLN9708 , 3mg and 4 mg , will be tested  in up to three possible 
dose levels:   
Schedule: Each cycle is 28 days  
Dose Level  Pomalidomide  MLN9708  Dexamethasone * 
-1 3mg daily on days 1 -21 3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
1 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
2 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 4 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
*: Patients >75 years , at the time of trial registration, will receive a dexamethasone starting 
dose of 20mg on the same set schedule.  
 
The RP2D  identified in the phase I portion of the study will be brought forward for activity  
evaluation . 
 
The phase II portion of this study will implement a Gehan  two-stage design to estimate the 
response rate and to evaluate the activity of MLN9708 when given in combination with 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone ( Gehan , 1961 ). 
Endpoints:  
Phase I:  
The primary endpoint is toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -Common 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  5                                                                     
 
 Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) is 
defined in section 7.3 of the protocol.  
Phase II:  
The primary endpoint is response rate ( sCR/CR/VGPR  and PR)  and is based on the 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG ) criteria.  
Sample Size:  
Phase I:  
The phase I study will follow a 3+3 design,  to evaluate toxicities associated with MLN9708 
when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.  Two doses of MLN9708 
(3 mg and 4 mg)  will be tested  in up to three possible dose levels . In the phase I portion of this 
study, the total sample size will depend on the number of dose levels evaluated to determine 
the RP2D. While the phase I study is expected to enroll and treat  9 patients ( 3 patients at do se 
level 1, and another 6 at dose level 2 -assuming the 4mg dose is well tolerated), a maximum of 
18 patients could be treated (6 patients treated at each dose level.  
 
Phase II:  
The phase II portion of the study is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a ma ximum of 25 
patients. The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will count 
toward the 25 patients required; given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients during 
the phase II trial portion. The sample size is based on  the desire to achieve a (promising ) 
target response rate of >30%.   
Estimated Duration of the Study  
Accrual, for both phases, is expected to be completed in 26 months; with approximately 2 
patients enrolled each month. Patients will be treated in 28 -day treatment cycles until disease 
relapse, progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or protocol specified 
parameters to stop treatment. Patients  who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease relapse/progression will continue to have disease assessments per International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria  until relapse or progression, initiation of new 
anticancer treatment, or d eath whichever occurs first. Patients will be followed to collect 
further anticancer treatment and survival information until death, loss to follow -up, 
withdrawal of consent, study termination or up to 24 months post treatment.

Statistical Considerations:  
Phase I:  
The primary objective of the phase I study is to determine the recomm ended phase II dose 
(RP2D) of MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in 
patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

 The phase I study will follow a 3+3 design for enrollment  with dose escalation , or expansion 
of a cohort on the basis of the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1 . 
Two doses of MLN9708 will be tested in up to three possible dose levels  (dose level -1 and 
dose level 1: 3mg / dose level 2: 4 mg, administered  on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 2 8 day cycle).  
The highest dose level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in cycle 1 will be the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD). The RP2D of MLN9708 and pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it 
may be less than the MTD  based on a review of availa ble data/cumulative toxicities from 
phase I.   
 
Analysis: Observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or 
laboratory determination), severity, time of onset, duration, probable association with the 
study regimen and reversibility or outcome. Baseline information (e.g. the extent of prior 
therapy) and demographic information will be presented as well to describe the patients 
treated in this study.  
 
Phase II:  
The  primary objective is to estimate the response rate and to evaluate the antitumor activity of 
the three drug combination: MLN9708 (at the RP2D), pomalidomide , and dexamethasone , in 
patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  The primary endpoint is a 
confirmed tumor respon se of sCR/CR/VGPR or P R and is based on IMWG Criteria. A single 
cycle  of treatment will be given in a 28 day cycle. Each patient’s disease status will be 
evaluated at baseline. R esponse will be assessed at the end of each cycle/just prior to the start 
of each cycle  and is based  on the IMWG criteria.  
 
Statistics/Sample Size and Accrual:  The phase II portion of this study will implement a 
Gehan  two-stage design to estimate the response rate and to evaluate the activity of MLN9708 
when given in combination with pomalidomide and de xamethasone ( Gehan 1961 ). The phase 
II portion of the study is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 25 patients. 
The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will count toward the 
25 patients required; given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients on the phase II trial. 
The sample size is based on the desire to estimate the response rate with at most 10% standard 
error, and early stopping if the combination is unexpectedly ineffective .  
  
At stage 1, 9 patients will be entered on the study. If 0 responses are seen  in the first 9 patients 
treated , the study will be terminated  and the true regimen response will be declared ≤30% . If 
at least 1 patient respond s, the trial will continue to the second stage. B ecause patients treated 
during the phase I portion of the trial at the dose selected for the phase II trial will be counted 
(n=6), only 3 additional patients will be enrolled at stage 1.  Under this design if the study 
regimen is >30% effective, there would  be ~95.6% chance of at least one success.  
 
At stage 2, 16 additional patients will be entered.  This accrual provides for estimation of the 
response rate with no more than 10% standard error.   
 
Analysis: The overall r esponse rate  will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patien ts that 
have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR or PR; the clinical benefit response rate will be calculated as 
the percent of evaluable patients that have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR/PR/ MR or SD;  exact

 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for these estimates. Response rates will also be 
evaluated based on number and type of prior therapy(ies). Time to response, duration of 
response, and survival will be estimated using the product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier.

1)  Measured at screening only.  
2)  FCBP  - A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorect omy; or 2) 
has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months. Pregnancy tests for FCBP must be performed within 10 to 14 d ays and 
again within 24 hours of initiation of therapy. Repeat pregnancy test every week for the first 4 weeks and then every 28 days  while on therapy and 
during interruptions in therapy and 28 days following discontinuation of pomalidomid e.  Women with irregular menstruation must have pregnancy 
testing every 14 days while on therapy and during interruptions and 14 and 28 days after discontinuation of Pomalidomide.  For Cycle 2 and forward, 
the D15 pregnancy test (if required) can be done l ocally and results faxed to the main institution.  
3)  ECG (12 -Lead) should be performed and read locally.     
4)  All patients must be counseled about pregnancy precautions, risks of fetal exposure and other risks. All patients enrolled in to this trial, mu st be 
registered in and must comply with all requirements of the POMALYST REMS™ program.   
5)  CBC to be performed and reviewed by clinician within 24 hours of day of dosing (first day of each cycle).  Alternately, a STA T CBC may be drawn on 
day of dosing,  however should be reviewed prior to administration of investigational product(s). Serum Chemistry to be performed and reviewe d by 
the investigator within 24 hours of day of dosing (first day of each cycle).  Alternately, a STAT CMP may be drawn on day of dosin g however should 
be reviewed by the investigator prior to administration of investigational product(s).  Chemistry includes: glucose, calcium,  albumin, total protein, 
sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine, ALP, ALT, AST, bilirubin and uric acid (uric aci d to be drawn at screening and then as needed based on tumor 
lysis syndrome risk).  Weight and serum creatinine will be used to calculate creatinine clearance by Cockroft -Gault equation (see appendix 15.2).   
6)  Neurological assessment required at screeni ng and Day 1 of Cycle 2+.  
7)    Extramedullary Disease: prior to study (28 days), testing required only if extramedullary disease is present, every 12 weeks (if present at screening) 
or upon clinical suspicion of progressive disease (if present at screenin g).  This may include CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis, CT or x -ray of the chest, 
ultrasound of the liver/spleen or abdomen.      
8) Skeletal survey (including skull, all long bones, pelvis and chest) with tumor measurements (measurements required if plasmacytomas are present).  
Also required if previous survey >28 days from study entry and at any time when clinically indicated.  
9)  A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is required at screening;  Repeat bone marrow biopsy/aspirate as appropriate to confir m achievement of 
response (aspirate only —biopsy not required).   
10)  Myeloma lab tests: B2Microglobulin (collected at screening only); serum immunoelectrophoresis, immunoglobulin assay, M band q uantitation by 
immunofixation, free light chain and 24 hour u rine collection for Bence Jones protein to be performed at baseline prior to study, prior to each cycle (to 
confirm  complete response and in pat ients with urine only measurable disease) thereafter and at time of end of treatment  (if last tests were > 3 
weeks).  
11) End of study follow -up to be completed every three months for two years to include second primary malignancies, new therapies for the treatment o f 
MM only (not all concomitant medication) and survival.  
12)  Due to the risk of blood clots while  on Pomalidomide, if patient is started on warfarin, routine monitoring of INR should occur  (as per your 
institutuional guidelines).   
13)  After the patient has been on Dexamethasone over one year, the patient can discontinue Dexamethasone at their next sc heduled visit.

 *Additional tests to be performed at the beginning of each cycle and at any reasonable time point during treatment if indicat ed for monitoring of drug 
profile/safety or, for disease/health status at the discretion of the clinical investigator .  Starting with Cycle 2 and forward, the patient is not required to 
come to the main hospital/institution for a Day 15 visit.  The patient can be seen locally by their physician at their discre tion.

 1.    BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
1.1    Multiple Myeloma Background  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy that is the second most common 
hematological malignancy. There are approximately 20,000 new cases per year and 10,000 
deaths per year from MM in the United States. 1  Treatment options for relapsed MM includ e 
the following:  
Bortezomib; A drug in the class of proteasome inhibitors, it was approved as monotherapy for 
relapsed MM.2   Given the efficacy and tolerability of the drug it is often used in combination 
with agents such as alkylators ( cyclophosphamide) , immunomodulatory agents (IMiDS), or 
liposomal doxorubicin either in the upfront setting or relapsed setting. 3 
Carfilzomib: Also a proteasome inhibitor, was approved in 2012 for patients who had prior 
therapy with bortezomib and an IMID and were progress ing on or refractory to their most recent 
therapy. It has less peripheral neuropathy than bortezomib and has shown responses in 
bortezomib refractory patients.4  However, there are concerns with potential cardiac, pulmonary 
and renal side effects. Also the  administration schedule of consecutive days of intravenous 
dosing make it a more cumbersome regimen for patients.  
Lenalidomide/Thalidomide: Drugs in the class known as immunomodulatory agents. 
Lenalidomide in conjunction with dexamethasone is approved fo r relapsed myeloma. 5 
Thalidomide is also approved for myeloma therapy but in the United States, lenalidomide is 
used preferentially due to its more favorable side effect profile. Similar to the practice with 
bortezomib both drugs are now commonly used in the upfront induction setting for therapy of 
myeloma in conjunction with dexamethasone for synergy. 6 
Unfortunately even with the advent of these active novel agents and improved response rates of 
combination therapy, all patients with myeloma ultimately r elapse.  However, patients are living 
longer and hence, the goals of MM therapy are not only efficacy but also favorable toxicity 
profiles.7  In addition as these novel agents are being used earlier in the course of myeloma 
therapy, when patients do relaps e, their disease is often refractory to the approved agents. 
Survival for this group of patients, especially those refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide, 
the so called double refractory group is especially poor. 8

 Hence new therapies for patients with relapsed disease are needed. In addition, oral therapies 
have the advantage of ease of administration and the potential for longer term use.  
1.2         MLN9708   
1.2.1     Preclinical Experience  
Please refer to the current MLN9708 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and Safety Management 
Attachment (SMA).  
1.2.2     Clinical Experience  
As of 30 April 2012 , 382 patients have been treated with MLN9708 across 9 enrolling, sponsor -
led phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies evaluating both twice -weekly and weekly dosing schedules.  
MLN9708 is available as an intravenous and oral formulation. Regardless of the route of 
administration in the twice -weekly dosing schedule, MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 
of a 21 -day cycle; in the weekly dosing schedule, the drug is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -
day cycle.  To date, the development of oral MLN9708 has focused on multiple myeloma 
[relapsed and/or refractory and newly diagnosed] and a different yet related plasma cell 
dyscrasia, systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. A clinical pharmacolog y study looking at 
drug-drug interactions, the effect of food, and bioavailability also uses the oral formulation. 
Details of these trials can be found in ClinicalTrials.gov and the MLN9708 IB.    
1.2.3    Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
Clinical IV and PO p harmacokinetic (PK) data show that MLN9708 (measured as the 
biologically active boronic acid form of MLN9708 [MLN2238]) has multi -exponential 
disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over by 4 hours.  Oral MLN9708 is rapidly 
absorbed with a m edian time to first maximum plasma concentration (T max) of approximately 
0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t 1/2 after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 7 days.9  Results of 
a population PK analysis (N = 137) show that there is no relationship between body surface area 
(BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL).  Also, based on stochastic simulations for fixed dose, 
exposures are independent of the individual patient’s BSA.10  Based on these data, a 
recommendation was made for fixed dosing in clinical trials.  An absolute bioavailability of 
67% was determined for MLN9708 using the population PK analysis.  See the IB for 
information on the PK for IV doses of MLN9708.  
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for MLN9708, with negligible urinary 
excretion of the parent drug (<  3% of dose).  In vitro studies of liver microsomes show that

 MLN9708 is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and non -CYP 
enzymes/proteins.  The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of the 5 major h uman 
CYP isozymes is 3A4 (34.2%) >  1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) >  2C9 (12.1%) >  2C19 (<  1%).  
MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor is it a time -dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  The potential for MLN9708 treatment to produce DD Is via CYP 
inhibition is inferred to be low; however, there may be a potential for DDIs with a concomitant 
strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor because of the potential for first -pass metabolism when 
MLN9708 is administered via the PO route and because of the  moderate contribution of 
CYP3A4 - and CYP1A2 -mediated metabolism of MLN9708 in human liver microsomes.  
MLN9708 may be a weak substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP2) ef flux pump transporters.  
MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2.  The potential for DDIs with 
substrates or inhibitors of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, inferred to be low.  
1.2.4     Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of MLN97 08 
In the 7 studies actively enrolling patients to investigate oral MLN9708 in patients with 
differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and 
lymphoma), a total of 242 patients have been treated as of 30 April 2012. The se patients have 
been treated with different doses of MLN9708, either as a single agent treatment or in 
combination with currently clinically available treatments. Information regarding the ongoing 
studies, patient populations, and doses investigated are i ncluded  in Table 1 -1.

1.2.5      Overvie w of the Oral Formulation of MLN9708  
The emerging safety profile indicates that oral MLN9708 is generally well tolerated with 
predominant toxicities largely reversible, able to be monitored by routine clinical examinations 
and manageable by dose reductions , discontinuation, or standard supportive care. From 
experience from phase 1 through 2 studies the major toxicities can be managed to allow repeat 
treatment cycles over periods extending beyond 24 months.  
In the 4 ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigating single -agent 
oral MLN9708 in patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, 
nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma), a total of 146 patients have been treated as of 30 April 
2012. These patients have been tr eated with different doses of MLN9708 as they are all phase 1 
trials. An overview of the most frequent (at least 10%) AEs occurring in the pooled safety  
population from single -agent oral MLN9708 Studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009)

The clinical experience with MLN9708 also shows early signs of antitumor activity as  
evidenced by at least a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged  disease 
stabilization in others across all ongoing trials. The antitumor activity has been seen  with single -
agent MLN9708, when combined w ith established therapies, and across the  malignancies 
studied (advanced solid tumors  11, non -Hodgkin ’s disease, Hodgkin ’s disease  12, relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma [RRMM ;13,14], relapsed or refractory systemic light  chain 
amyloidosis [RRAL ; 15], and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [NDMM ;16,17,18]) to date.  
 
Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this drug, the  emerging 
data supports the ongoing development of MLN9708.  
 
Of particular relevance to this study (C16011) is the clinical experience from Studies  C16004 
and C16007 in which single -agent MLN9708 is administered weekly in patients  with RRMM or 
RRAL, respectively.  
 
1.2.6     MLN9708 in Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
Study C16004 is an open -label,  dose-escalation, phase 1 study of MLN9708 administered  
weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle in adult patients with RRMM. Patients with  MM 
enrolled in the dose -escalation component of the study have relapsed following at least  2 lines  
of therapy, which must have included bortezomib, tha lidomide (or lenalidomide), and 
corticosteroids. The dose -escalation phase of the trial has completed. In this study, 2 of 3  
patients experienced protocol -defined DLTs (Grade 3 ras h and Grade 3 nausea, vomi ting, and 
diarrhea) at a dose of 3.95 mg/m2. As per protocol, subsequent patients were treated at  1 dose 
level below (2.97mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT (Grade 3 nausea,  vomiting, 
and diarrhea). The MTD of weekly oral MLN9708 was determined  to be  2.97 mg/m2.  
Once the MTD was established, cohorts of patients representing the heterogeneous patient  
population currently seen in clinical practice were enrolled i n order to further evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynami cs of ora l MLN9708. The MTD 
expansion cohorts enrolling are:

Final study results are not available for this ongoing trial, but preliminary data suggest  
MLN9708 has antitumor activity in heavily pretr eated MM patients, with durable 
respons es/disease control, and is generally well tolerated.19,20 
As of the 30 April 2012 data cut, these patients are considered heavily pretreated as evidenced 
by a median number of 4 (range 1 –13) prior lines of therapy, with 66% refractory to the last line 
of therapy. Patients have received a median of 2 cycles of the rapy (range, 1 - 11). Five patients 
have achieved objective response: 1 patient achieved a VGPR and 4 patients achieved a PR. 
Additionally, 15 patients achieved durable disease stabilization for up to 9.5 months. At data 
cut-off, 15 patients remain on treat ment; discontinuation of treatment was primarily due to 
progressive disease (69%).  
 
A summary of the safety profile of patients treated in Study C16004 is outlined in Table 1 -4. 
Overall, 92% of patients experienced a TEAE of any grade and of any cause. Per ipheral  
neuropathy was limited to Grade 1/ 2 in 6 patients, with 3 patients reporting baseline Grade 1

Dose reductions required were due to AEs that included rash, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, increase  in serum creatinine, abdominal 
pain, ileus, fatigue, and pneumonia. The AEs reported for the 5 patients who were required to 
discontinue treatment included Grade 2 MLN9708 -related nausea/vomiting in 1 patient treated 
above the MTD, Grade 3 MLN9708 -related  diarrhea in a second patient, related Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia, related Grade 2 dyspnea, and notrelated Grade 4 elevation in creatinine (1 
patient each). There were no on -study deaths.  
Study C16007 is evaluating single agent weekly , Day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, oral 
dosing in patients with RRAL after at least 1 prior therapy. The objectives of this study are to 
determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD, as well as to determine hematologic and organ 
response rates in this patient population. The starting dose level was selected from Study 
C16004 as previously described. In Study C16007 the dose was switched from the BSA -based 
dosing to the fixed dose, thereby the 4.0 mg fixed starting dose in Study C16007 corresponds to 
the 2.23 mg/m2 dose (one do se level below MTD) from Study C16004. This study is currently 
enrolling patients in the dose -expansion portion of the trial.  
As of 30 April 2012, 14 patients have been treated in this study. At the first dose level of 4.0 
mg, 1 of 6 patients experienced a  protocol -defined DLT (that is, thrombocytopenia that lasted 
more than 2 weeks, which met the definition of a DLT due to the delay in starting Cycle 2). As 
per protocol, the dose was escalated to 5.5 mg for the next cohort of patients where 2 of 5 
patients  experienced a DLT (Grade 3 diarrhea, n=1; and Grade 2 dyspnea, Grade 2 acute rise in 
serum creatinine, and Grade 4 cardiac arrest, n=1). The latter patient did not appear to have 
cardiac AL amyloidosis by echocardiogram on study entry, but did have substa ntial renal 
involvement. After the occurrence of this DLT, diagnoses included cardiac involvement and 
CHF. The MTD of weekly oral MLN9708 was determined to be 4.0 mg. Following the 
establishment of the MTD, patients are currently being enrolled in to 1 of 2 cohorts: proteasome 
inhibitor naïve or proteasome inhibitor exposed.21 
As of the 30 April 2012 data cut, the patients enrolled in the study are considered heavily 
pretreated, as evidenced by a median number of 3 prior lines of therapy (range 1 –7), with 3 8%

The potential risks reported with MLN9708 use, pooled from all studies using the oral 
formulations, were antic ipated based on preclinical data and previous experience with 
VELCADE and are noted in the MLN9708 IB, SMA, and ICF documents. Regardless of 
whether MLN9708 is administered on the once weekly or twice weekly dosing schedule, there 
is consistency among the type of TEAEs reported, despite some differences in the frequency and 
severity of the reported events. While the predominant potential toxicities may be severe in 
some cases, they are largely reversible, and can be managed by routine clinical monitoring an d

1.2.7     MLM9708 in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM)  
In Study C16005, MLN9708 is given weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), in combination with 
lenalidomide (Days 1 -21), and dexamethasone (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28 -day cycle.  
Enrollment to this study is closed.   
Clinical data as of 30 April 2012 is available.  The MTD in Study C16005 was determined to be  
2.97 mg/m2 given weekly in a 28 -day cycle with LenDex.  The DLTs were urticarial rash, 
dizziness, nausea, orthostatic hypotension, vomiting, diarrhoea , and syncope.  The 
recommended p hase 2 dose (RP 2D) estimation was established following evaluation of the 
available data from the phase 1 portion of the trial which included, but was not limited to, 
analyses of efficacy results and adverse events (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral 
neuropathy, and treatment discontinuation).  Given that the dose of MLN 9708 at 2.97 mg/m2 
compromised the maximal dosing of lenalidomide and that the dose of 2.23 mg/m2 is very 
tolerable and clinically active, Millennium designated 2.23 mg/m2 as the RP2D after evaluation 
of the data and discussion with investigators.  The RP2 D of 2.23 mg/m2 has been translated into 
a fixed dose of 4.0 mg based on the results from the population PK analysis.   Enrollment in 
this study has been completed; final study results are not available, but preliminary data 
suggests oral MLN9708 given week ly plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in a 28 -day cycle 
appears well tolerated with manageable toxicity and encouraging antitumor activity.   
In Study C16005, 15 of 15 (100%) patients in the dose escalation portion of the study 
experienced at least 1 TEAE  irrespective of grade or causality.  At the MTD across all dose 
expansion cohorts 49 of 53 patients (including 3 patients from the dose escalation cohort [92%]) 
reported at least 1 TEAE irrespective of grade or causality.  In the MTD cohorts, fatigue was the 
most common AE reported (38%).  Other common AEs reported include nausea (32%), 
constipation (30%), upper respiratory infection (23%), and peripheral oedema  (21%).  Skin 
toxicity, primarily erythematous rash, occurred in 62% of patients (of note, rash is an 
overlapping toxicity with MLN9708 and lenalidomide).  Peripheral neuropathy was reported in

1.3 Pomalidomide  
Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue indicated for patients with multiple myeloma who 
have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and bortezomib a nd have 
demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. 
Approval is based on response rate.

 POMALYST is an immunomodulatory antineoplastic agent. The chemical name is (RS) -4-
Amino -2-(2,6-dioxo -piperidin -3-yl)-isoind oline -1,3­dione and it has the following chemical 
structure:  
 
 
POMALYST is available in 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg capsules for oral administration. Each 
capsule contains pomalidomide  as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: 
mannitol, pregelatinized starch and sodium stearyl fumarate. The 1 mg capsule shell contains 
gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 2, yellow iron oxide, white ink and black ink. The 2 mg 
capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 2, yellow iron oxide, FD&C red 3 
and white ink. The 3 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&C blue 2, yellow 
iron oxide and white ink. The 4 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titani um dioxide, FD&C blue 
1, FD&C blue 2 and white ink.  
1.3.1       Mechanism of Action  
Pomalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic 
activity. In in vitro cellular assays, pomalidomide inhibited proliferation and induced  apoptosis 
of hematopoietic tumor cells. Additionally, pomalidomide inhibited the proliferation of 
lenalidomide -resistant multiple myeloma cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both 
lenalidomide -sensitive and lenalidomide -resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis. 
Pomalidomide enhanced T cell - and natural killer (NK) cell -mediated immunity and inhibited 
production of pro -inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF -α and IL -6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide 
demonstrated anti -angiogenic activity in a mo use tumor model and in the in vitro umbilical cord 
model.  
1.3.2     Pharmakokinetics  
Absorption  
Following administration of single oral doses of POMALYST, the Cmax for pomalidomide 
occurs at 2 and 3 hours post dose. The systemic exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide in creases in 

  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  32                                                                     
 
 an approximately dose proportional manner. In patients with multiple myeloma who received 
POMALYST 4 mg daily alone or in combination with dexamethasone, pomalidomide steady - 
state drug exposure was characterized by AUC(Τ) of 400 ng.hr/ mL and m aximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) of 75 ng/mL. Following multiple doses, pomalidomide has an 
accumulation ratio of 27 to 31 %.  
Distribution  
Pomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at 
steady state. Pomalidomide i s distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of 
approximately 67% of plasma level at 4 hours post -dose (~Tmax) after 4 days of once daily 
dosing at 2 mg. Human plasma protein binding ranges from 12% to 44% and is not 
concentration dependen t. 
Metabolism  
Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. In vitro, 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were identified as the primary enzymes involved in the CYP -mediated 
hydroxylation of pomalidomide, with additional minor contributions from C YP2C19 and 
CYP2D6.  
Elimination  
Pomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half -life of approximately 9.5 hours in 
healthy subjects and approximately 7.5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma. Pomalidomide 
has a mean total body clearance (CL/ F) of 7 -10 L/ hr.  
Following a single oral administration of [14C] -pomalidomide (2 mg) to healthy subjects, 
approximately 73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and feces, 
respectively, with approximately 2% and 8% of the radiolabeled dose eli minated unchanged as 
pomalidomide in urine and feces.  
1.3.3    Non-clinical Toxicology  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of pomalidomide have not been conducted. One of 
twelve monkeys dosed with 1 mg/kg of pomalidomide (an exposure approximately 15 -fold of

 the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/per day) developed acute myeloid 
leukemia in a 9 -month repeat -dose toxicology study.  
Pomalidomide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a bat tery of tests, including the bacteria 
reverse mutation assay (Ames test), the in vitro assay using human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes and the micronucleus test in orally treated rats administered doses up to 2000 
mg/kg/day.  
In a fertility and early embryon ic development study in rats, drug -treated males were mated with 
untreated or treated females. Pomalidomide was administered to males and females at doses of 
25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. When treated males were mated with treated females, there was an 
increase in  post-implantation loss and a decrease in mean number of viable embryos at all dose 
levels. There were no other effects on reproductive functions or the number of pregnancies. The 
lowest dose tested in animals resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 10 0-fold of 
theexposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. When treated males on this study 
were mated with untreated females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls. 
Based on these results, the observed effects were attributed to the treatment of females.  
Pomalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes or any of the transporters in vitro.  
1.3.4    Clinical Studies  
Multiple Myeloma  
The trial that led to the recent approval of pomalidimide  was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized 
open label study in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who were refractory to their last 
myeloma therapy and had received lenalidomide and bortezomib. Patients were considered 
relapsed if they had achieved at le ast stable disease for at least one cycle of treatment to at least 
one prior regimen and then developed progressive disease. Patients were considered refractory if 
they experienced disease progression on or within 60 days of their last therapy. A total of 221 
patients were randomized to receive pomalidomide alone or pomalidomide with Low dose Dex. 
In Trial 1, the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide 4 mg, once daily for 21 of 28 days, until 
disease progression, were evaluated alone and in combination with Lo w dose Dex (40 mg per 
day given only on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 -day cycle for patients 75 years or younger, or 
20mg per day given only on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 -day cycle for patients greater than 
75 years of age). Patients in the pomalido mide alone arm were allowed to add Low dose Dex 
upon disease progression.

 Most common adverse reactions (≥30%) included fatigue and asthenia, neutropenia, anemia, 
constipation, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, upper - respiratory tract infections, back pain and 
pyrexia (6.1).  
A recent phase III randomized trial comparing pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, to high -dose 
dexamethasone alone  in patients with relapse and refractory MM , demonstrated higher response 
rates, PFS and OS in the pomalidomide arm . Ten  percent  (10%) of patients treated on the 
dexamethasone  alone arm achieved an objective response and 31% of the patients on the 
combination arm with pomalidomide and low -dose dex ameth asone achieved a response ; odds 
ratio [OR] 4·22 [2·35 –7·58] p<0·0001 . 26 The treatme nt regimens most commonly used in 
Europe are very different from those used in the United States, as patient access to many of the 
novel agents is more limited in Europe. None of the patients enrolled/treated in that trial had 
been previously treated with carfilzomib or pomalidomide. For this trial, where MLN9708 will 
be added to pomalidomide and dexamethasone,  patients with prior exposure to either of these 
agents would not be excluded. As many patients (>50%) are likely to have been previously 
treated wit h one or both of these agents we consider a response rate of 30% sufficient efficacy to 
justify further development.  
1.4      Study Rationale  
Pomalidomide is the newest immunomodulatory drug that is chemically a combination of 
thalidomide and lenalidomide . It has been studied in phase I -III trials for patients with relapsed 
myeloma.  It has shown activity even in lenalidomide refractory patients and phase III trials 
have demonstrated superior overall and progression free survival (OS/PFS) compared to high 
dose dexamethasone.  22,23 
MLN9708 is a next generation small molecule 20 -s proteasome inhibitor generated with the aim 
of improving the efficacy seen with bortezomib in MM but further improvement in drug 
administration. It has shown activity in the relaps ed and relapsed/refractory MM setting 
including bortezomib refractory patients. 24 Therefore given the synergy seen with IMIDS and 
proteasome inhibitors as well as the activity of both compounds in relapsed MM, this becomes 
an attractive combination for st udy in the relapsed/relapsed refractory setting.  
Dosing Justification  
As mentioned above, the standard FDA approved dose of pomalidomide is 4mg days 1 -21. 
Maximum response is seen when it is combined with dexamethasone. Because of an impetus in 
myeloma the rapy to be relatively steroid sparing, the generally accepted dose of dexamethasone 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  35                                                                     
 
 is a “ Low dose” weekly dosing of 40mg. Data generated from the MLN9708 plus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone trial confirmed the tolerability of this new proteasome inhibito r with an 
IMID. The RP2D of MLN9708 is 4mg d1,8,15.  However, the potential for overlapping 
hematologic toxicity especially in a more advanced disease population with pomalidomide 
(which tends to be more myelosuppressive than lenalidomide) in conjunction w ith MLN9708 
led to the choice of an initial dose of 3mg for MLN9708. Because of the synergy between 
IMIDS and proteasome inhibitors we would still expect to see activity at this dose.  
1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Please refer to the current MLN9708 Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) and the Package Insert for 
pomalidomide.  
MLN9708 is a modified dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor similar to VELCADE,  
which has a known safety profile  [VELCADE PI] .  The most frequent AEs reported to date in 
the ongoing  MLN9708 phase 1 studies were anticipated based on preclinical data and previous  
experience with VELCADE, and are noted in the IB, and the informed consent documents. 
However, it is possible that MLN9708 will have  toxicities that were not previously observe d in 
or predicted from such sources. Patients will  be monitored closely for anticipated toxicities.   
The toxicity profile of MLN9708 and pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is 
unknown and will be evaluated in this trial.  
MLN9708 shows early sign s of antitumor activity as evidenced by at least a 50% reduction in 
disease burden in some patients and prolonged disease stabilization in others across all ongoing 
trials  11,12,13,14,16,17,18. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice (GCP),  
applicable regulatory requirements, and International Co nference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines.

 4.    STUDY DESIGN  
4.1    Overview of Study Design  
4.1.1     Phase I:  
The phase I portion of the study is based on a 3 + 3 dose escalation desi gn, to evaluate toxicities 
associated with MLN9708  when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone . 
Two doses of MLN9708 ( dose level -1 and dose level 1: 3mg; dose level 2: 4mg) will be tested  
in up to three possible dose levels . Based on pre vious combination trials of MLN9708, the 4mg 
dose of MLN9708 is expected to be well tolerated. Given that this is the first study to combine 
MLN9708, with dexamethasone and pomalidomide, patients will initially be treated at a 3mg 
dose.  The maximum tolerat ed dose (MTD)  will be established by evaluating dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 and 
pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it may be less than the MTD  based on a review 
of available data/cu mulative toxicities from phase I. Patients will be treated with oral MLN9708  
on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day cycle and with Dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of 
each 28 day cycle.  Pomalidomide will be given on days 1 -21 of each 28 day cycle. The dose of 
MLN9708 and Pomalidomide administered will depend on the dose level assignment; the dose 
of dexamethasone will be fixed  (Patients >75 years , at the time of trial registration, will receive 
a Dexamethasone starting dose of 20  mg on the same set schedule).  
 
    Phase II  
Patients who enroll during the phase II portion of the trial will  be treated at the same dose and 
schedule of MLN9708, pomalidomide and dexamethasone determined safe during the phase I 
study (the RP2D).  
4.2    Number of Patients  
The phase I study is expected to enroll and treat 9 patients ; 3 patients at dose level 1, and 
another 6 treated at dose level 2 -assuming the 4mg dose of MLN9708  is well tolerated.  The 
phase II portion of the trial is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 25 patients. 
The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will count toward the 25 
patients required; given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients on the phase II trial.  
4.3    Duration of Study  
Accrual, for bo th phases, is expected to be completed in 26 months; with approximately 2 
patients enrolled each month. Patients will be treated in 28 -day treatment cycles until disease 
relapse, progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or protocol spec ified 
parameters to stop treatment. Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease relapse/progression will continue to have disease assessments per International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria until relapse or progression, initiation of new

7.1   Dose and Schedule  
The phase I study will follow  a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design, to evaluate toxicities 
associated with MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone . 
Two doses of MLN9708 (3 mg and 4 mg)  will be tested  in up  to three possible dose levels .  
7.2   Dose Levels to be Tested  
Schedule: Each cycle is 28 days  
Dose  Level  Pomalidomide  MLN9708  Dexamethasone * 
-1 3mg daily on days 1 -21 3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15  40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22

*: Patients >75 years , at the time of trial registration, will receive a Dexamethasone dose of 20  
mg on the same set s chedule.  
 
7.3  Dose Limiting Toxicity/Unacceptable Toxicity  
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined  as any of the following toxicities that are at least 
possibly related to either Pomalidomide or MLN9708  that occur during cycle 1. Toxicity will be 
graded according to the NCI -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03. 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  44                                                                     
 
 Note: The Phase II portion of the study will use the same definition to define unacceptable 
toxicity.  
For the purposes of this study, DLT will be def ined as:  
 Grade 4 neutropenia  
 Grade 3 neutropenia with fevers > 38.5°C  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
 Grade 3 or higher non -hematological toxicity will be considered dose limiting with the 
following except ions:  diarrhea, fatigue, nausea or vomiting will only be considered dose 
limiting if, after 48 hours it has not recovered to <Grade 3 (despite maximal medical 
therapy), allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, or electrolyte/metabolic toxicity unable to be 
corrected to <Grade 1  or baseline within 48 hours will be considered dose limiting.  
 Delay in starting cycle 2 on the scheduled day 1 for > 7 days due to treatment related 
toxicity  
 Any dose modification or delay of MLN9708 or Pomalidomide during cycle 1, except 
modifications/d elays done in response to hypo - hyperthyroidism <=Grade 2, herpes 
zoster infection, all considered idiopathic or intrinsic to the underlying myeloma .  
 
7.4    Dose Escalation/Expansion  
DLT  incidence  will be based on toxicity events encountered during the firs t cycle of treatment 
with the combination of MLN9708, pomalidomide and dexamethasone.  
Dose de-escalation, escalation or cohort expansion will only take place after 3 patients are fully 
assessed  using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCA E) of the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) version  4.03 following the  completion of cycle 1.  
Dose escalation will occur according to the following rules:  
 If zero out of 3 evaluable patients has a DLT in cycle 1 then the next dose level of 
combination therapy will be tested.  
 If 1 out of 3 evaluable patients has a DLT in cycle 1, three additional patients will be 
assessed at the same dose level of combination therapy.  
 If 2 out of 3 patients have a DLT in cycle 1, dose escalation will cease and the next 
lower dose level of combination therapy will be expanded.  Note: If 2 of 3 experience 
DLT on dose level -1, the trial will be stopped.  
 If 1 out of 6 evaluable patients has a DLT in cycle 1, then dose escalation to the next 
dose level of combination therapy w ill continue.

  If 2 or more out of 6  patients have a DLT in cycle 1, dose escalation will cease and the 
next lower dose level of combination therapy will be expanded.  Note: If 2 of 6 
experience DLT on dose level -1 the trial will be stopped.  
The highest do se level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in cycle 1 will be the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD).  
Note:  Patients may continue therapy unless there is unacceptable toxicity, disease progression 
or withdrawl of consent.   
7.5   Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)  
The MTD  will be based on the assessment of DLT during cycle 1 (see section 7.4). The MTD 
will be defined as the highest dose at which  ≤ 1/6  patients in a cohort experience DLT. The 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 and pomalidomide will generally be the 
MTD, but it may be less than the MTD  based on a review of available data/cumulative 
toxicities from phase I.    
7.6    Study Drug Administration   
All protocol -specific criteria for administration of study drug must be met and documented 
before drug administrati on.  Study drug will be administered  or dispensed  only to eligible 
patients under the supervision of the investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients 
should be monitored for toxicity, as necessary, and doses of study drug should be modified as 
needed to accommodate patient tolerance to treatment; this may include symptomatic treatment, 
dose interruptions, and a djustments of dose . 
7.6.1    MLN9708  Administration  
Patients should be instructed to swallow MLN9708 capsules whole, with water, and not to 
break, chew, or open the capsules.  MLN9708  should be taken on an empty stomach (no food or 
drink) at least 1 hour before or 2  hours after a meal.  Each capsule should be swallowed 
separately with a sip of water.  A total of approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of  water should be 
taken with the capsules.   
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers if the next scheduled dose is 
72 hours or more away.  A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.  If the 
patient vomits after taking  a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume 
dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.

 7.6.2     Pomalidomide Administration  
Pomalidomide  capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or 
opened.  Pomalidomide shou ld be taken without food, at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a 
meal.  Pomalidomide capsules may be taken with water.   
If a dose of pomalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If 
it is missed for the entire day, it  should not be made up, rather it should be taken at the next 
scheduled time point.  Similarly, if the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not 
repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.  
Patients who t ake more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide should be instructed to seek 
emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.   
Pomalidomide (POMALYST®) will be provided to research patients for the duration of their 
participation in  this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Pomalidomide will 
be provided in accordance with the Celgene  Corporation’s POMALYST REMS™  program.  
Per the standard   POMALYST REMS™ program requirements, all physicians who prescribe 
pomali domide for research patients enrolled into this trial, and all research patients enrolled into 
this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the POMALYST 
REMS™ program.   
Drug will be shipped on a per patient basis by the contract pharmacy to the clinic site for IND 
studies.  Only enough pomalidomide for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient 
each cycle.  This is in accordance with the POMALYST REMS™ program.  
Special Handling Instructions  
Female caregivers of childbearing potential should not handle or administer pomalidomide 
unless they are wearing gloves.  
7.6.3     Dexamethasone Administration  
Dexamethsone is commercially available and commercial supplies will be u sed for this study.  
Oral d examethasone will be give n on an outpatient basis. Missed doses of dexamethasone will 
not be made up.  Similarly, i f the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat 
the dose but should resume dosing at the ti me of the next scheduled dose.  Procedures for dose 
reductions and d elays are summarized in Section 7.9.2 .

 7.6.4   Growth Factor A dministration  
For the Phase I portion of the study, g rowth factors, granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G -
CSF],  may be given  prophylactically for at least two days on days 21 – 26 during or beyond 
cycle 2. For the Phase II portion of the study, G -CSF may be given prophylactically for at least 
two days on days 21 -26 during or beyond cycle 1 . It will be administered subcutaneousl y at a 
dose of 5ug/kg or per institutional standard practice dosing either daily or every other day for a 
minimum of two doses.  If patients experience neutropenia or dosing delays, we would 
recommend consideration of growth factor in subsequent cycles.  
7.7    Dose Modification Guidelines   
Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each visit with the NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria, Version 4.03 used as a guide for the grading of severity.   
As defined in section 7.3, d uring the p hase I  portion of the stud y, any toxicity related dose 
modification or delay of MLN9708 or Pomalidomide during cycle 1 except 
modifications/delays done in response to hypo - hyperthyroidism <=Grade 2, herpes zoster 
infection, all considered idiopathic or intrinsic to the underlying myeloma is  a DLT.  No dose 
escalations are permitted in any given patient once a dose level has been assigned.  While 
patients experiencing DLT during Cycle 1 may continue on therapy, if toxicity can be managed 
according to the dose modification guidelines  outlined below,  the DLT event will contribute to 
the assessment of MTD for that given cohort. Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity 
if they receive any study drug. Patients will be considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity if 
they rece ive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide and MLN9708  and are followed for the full 28 
days during cycle 1  or experience a DLT. For the phase II portion, as part of the primary 
analysis, patients will be considered evaluable for response if they are eligible,  have baseline 
disease assessments, and receive any protocol treatment. As part of a secondary analysis, 
patients will be considered evaluable for response if they have baseline disease assessments, 
receive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide  and MLN9708 during the first cycle of therapy and 
have had their disease re -evaluated.    
Dose modifications may be performed in all subsequent cycles of treatment regardless of which 
phase of study the patient  is enrolled on.  If toxicities cannot be ma naged by dose modification 
or the patient cannot tolerate the lowest dose of study drug, the patient is to be discontinued 
from study treatment.  However, patients that have achieved a plateau of response to study

7.10    Criteria for Beginning or Delaying a Subsequent Treatment Cycle  
For a new cycle of treatment to begin, the patient must meet the followi ng criteria:  
• ANC must be ≥ 1,000/mm3.  
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3 or  > =50,000/mm3 for patients with baseline 
platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 but <75,000/mm3. 
• All other nonhematologic  toxicity (except for alopecia) must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 
or to the patient’s baseline condition  
If the patient fails to meet the above -cited criteria for initiation of the next cycle of treatment, 
dosing should be delayed for 1 week. At the end of t hat time, the patient should be re -evaluated 
to determine whether the criteria have been met. If the patient continues to fail to meet the 
above -cited criteria, delay therapy and continue to re evaluate. The maximum delay before 
treatment should be discont inued will be 3 weeks or at the discretion of the Principal 
Investigator.

study.   
 Fluid deficits should be corrected before and throughout treatment.  
7.11.3   Required/Recommended Concomitant Therapy  
 Pomalidomide  increases the risk of thromboembolism. Anti -coagulation prophylaxis is 
required after an assessment of each patient’s underlying risk factors, unless there is an 
excess risk of bleeding.  
 Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir is recommended for herpes prophy laxis.   
 For the Phase I portion of the study, g rowth factors, granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor [G -CSF],  may be given  prophylactically for at least two days on days 21 – 26 
during or beyond cycle 2. For the Phase II portion of the study, G -CSF may be given 
prophylactically for at least two days on days 21 -26 during or beyond cycle 1 . It will be 
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 5ug/kg or per institutional standard practice 
dosing either daily or every other day for a minimum of two doses.  If pa tients 
experience neutropenia or dosing delays, we would recommend consideration of growth 
factor in subsequent cycles.  
 Allopurinol is recommended for patients with high tumor burden due to the possibility of 
tumor lysis syndrome.

 7.11.4    Pregnancy  
It is not kn own what effects MLN9708 has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo 
or fetus.  Pomalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Therefore, 
female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male pa tients 
should avoid impregnating a female partner.  Females of child bearing potential* and male 
patients should use effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after 
study treatment as specified below.  
A female of child bearing p otential is any sexually mature female who:  
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or  
2) has  not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had 
menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
7.11.4.1    Females  
Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual 
sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control simultaneously (one highly 
effective form of contraception – tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, 
hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants) or partner’s vasectomy and one additional effective 
contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm or cervical cap. 
Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment, during therapy, during dose 
interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following di scontinuation of pomalidomide or 90 days 
following discontinuation of MLN9708. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there 
has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Females of reproductive potential 
should be referred to a qua lified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed.  
Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating 
therapy. The first test should be performed within 10 -14 days, and the second test within 24 
hours prior to presc ribing pomalidmide and MLN9708. Once treatment has started and during 
dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly 
during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks i n 
females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing 
should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient 
misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrua l bleeding.  Treatment with 
pomalidomide and MLN9708 must be discontinued during this evaluation. All study

 participants must be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS™ program, and be 
willing and able to comply with the requirements of the POMALYST R EMS™ program.  
7.11.4.2    Males  
Pomalidomide is present in the semen of males who take pomalidomide . The effects of 
MLN9708 are unknown. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during 
any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide or 
MLN9708 and for up to 28 days after discontinuing pomalidomide or 90 days after 
discomtinuation of MLN9708, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male 
patients taking pomalidmide or MLN9708 must not donate sperm.  All study participants must 
be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS™ program, and be willing and able to 
comply with the requirements of the POMALYST REMS™ program.  
7.12   Management of Clinical Events  
Adverse drug reactions such as thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and rash 
have been associated with MLN9708 treatment. Man agement guidelines regarding these events 
are outlined below. Further details of management of MLN9708 AEs are described  the  
MLN9708 IB.  
Prophylaxis Against Risk of Infection  
If lymphopenia is noted, patients may be at an increased risk of infection.  In particular, 
lymphopenia can be associated with reactivation of herpes zoster and herpes simplex viruses.  
Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir may be initiated as clinically indicated.  
Other antivirals are also acceptable.  
Nausea and/or Vom iting 
Standard anti -emetics, including 5 -HT3 antagonists, are recommended for emesis occurring 
upon treatment initiation; prophylactic anti -emetics may also be considered.  Dexamethasone 
should not be administered as an anti -emetic.  Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation 
of study drug and during treatment.  
Diarrhea  
Diarrhea should be managed according to clinical practice, including the administration of 
antidiarrheals once infectious causes are excluded.  Fluid intake should be maintained to  avoid 
dehydration.  Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation of treatment  and during 
treatment . Prophylactic antidiarrheals are not generally recommended.

 Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus  
As with VELCADE, rash with or without pruritu s has been reported with MLN9708, primarily 
at the higher doses tested. The rash may range from some erythematous areas, macular and/or 
small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body or more 
generalized, has been transient  and has resolved either spontaneously or with standard 
symptomatic measures such as oral or topical steroids and/or antihistamines. Prophylactic 
measures should also be considered if a patient develops a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free 
emollient cre am on dry areas of the body).  In the case of rash, the use of a topical or oral steroid 
(eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day or equivalent) is permitted.   A rare risk is Steven s-Johnson 
Syndrome, a severe, life -threatening or deadly rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which 
should be managed symptomatically according to standard medical practice.   
Thrombocytopenia  
Thrombocytopenia has been reported to date primarily at the higher doses tested .  Blood counts 
should be monitored regularly as outlined in the p rotocol with additional testing obtained 
according to standard clinical practice.  Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been 
manageable with platelet transfusions according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia 
nadirs commonly recover without i ntervention by the beginning of the next scheduled cycle. 
MLN9708 administration should be modified as noted as per dose modi fication 
recommendations when thrombocytopenia occurs.  A rare risk is thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (TTP), a rare blood diso rder where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout 
the body characterized by thrombocytopenia, petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious signs 
and symptoms. TTP should be managed symptomatically according to standard medical 
practice.  
Neutropen ia 
Neutropenia  has been reported with MLN9708  and pomalidomide .  Blood counts should be 
monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional testing obtained according to 
standard clinical practice.  Neutrop enia may be severe but has been manage able with G-CSF 
Neutropenic nadirs commonly recover without intervention by the beginning of the next 
scheduled cycle or with a short delay in treatment.  MLN9708 administration should be 
modified when neutropenia occurs, as noted in the dose modification recommendations . Given 
that MLN9708 will be administered in combination with pomalidomide, with overlapping 
toxicity of neutropenia,  G -CSF will be used prophylactically in this protocol.

 Fluid Deficits  
Dehydration should be avoided  because  MLN9708 may cause vomiting, diarrhea , and 
dehydration .  Acute  renal failure has been reported with MLN9708.  Fluid deficits should be 
corrected before initiation of study drug  and during treatment  and as needed during therapy .   
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induced prevalence of nephrotoxicity is 
relatively low; however, given the wide use of these agents many persons are at risk, including 
for example, patients with cardio -renal disease, dehydration, and the aging kidney. NSA IDs 
should be avoided with impaired renal function given reported NSAID -induced renal failure in 
patients with decreased renal function. Until further information is available, intake of NSAIDs 
while on this protocol should be avoided.  
Hypotension  
Symptoma tic hypotension and orthostatic hypotension have been reported with MLN9708. 
Blood pressure should be closely monitored while the patient is on study treatment and fluid 
deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of concomitant sympto ms such as 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage 
their blood pressure (for either hypo - or hypertension) should be managed according to standard 
clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustments of their concomitant medications 
during the course of the trial.   
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported with 
MLN9708.  While this case ultimately resolved , PRES has also been reported rarely with 
another proteasome inhibitor, Velcade.  PRES is characterized by headache, seizures and visual 
loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure.  Prompt diagnosis and initiation of 
antihypertensive and anticonvul sant therapy are important to prevent irreversible end -organ 
damage.  
Anticoagulation Consideration   
Pomalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or with a 
history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with othe r drugs known to cause thrombosis.

 Consideration should be given to the requirement of aspirin (81 or 325 mg) or some other form 
of prophylaxis as deemed appropriate. Low molecular weight heparin may be utilized in patients 
that are intolerant to ASA. Cou madin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.

“WARNING: POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN BIRTH DEFECTS.”  
The study drug label must be clearly visible.  Additional labels must not cover the Celgene 
label.  
8.2  Storage, Handling, and Accountability  
MLN9708 and pomalidomide  are anticancer drugs and as with other potentially toxic 
compounds caution should be exercised when handling MLN9708 and pomalidomide capsules.  
8.2.1    MLN9708  
Upon receipt at the investigative site, MLN9708 should remain in the blister and carton 
provided unt il use or until drug is dispensed. The container should be stored at the investigative 
site refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C). Ensure that the drug is used before the retest expiry 
date provided by Millennium. Expiry extensions will be communicated a ccordingly with 
updated documentation to support the extended shelf life.  
In countries where local regulations permit, MLN9708 capsules dispensed to the patient for 
take-home dosing should remain in the blister packaging and refrigerated as noted above unt il 
the point of use. The investigative site is responsible for providing the medication to the patient 
in the correct daily dose configurations. Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the 
patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedur es. Patients who are receiving take -
home medication should be given only 1 cycle of medication at a time. Patients should be 
instructed to store the medication refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C) for the duration of 
each cycle. Patients should be instr ucted to return their empty blister packs to the investigative 
site, rather than discarding them. Reconciliation will occur accordingly when the patient returns 
for their next cycle of take -home medication. Any extreme in temperature should be reported as 
an excursion and should be dealt with on a case -by-case basis.  
Because MLN9708 is an investigational agent, it should be handled with due care. Patients 
should be instructed not to chew, break, or open capsules. In case of contact with broken 
capsules, rai sing dust should be avoided during the clean -up operation. The product may be 
harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Gloves and protective clothing should be 
worn during cleanup and return of broken capsules and powder to minimize skin conta ct.

 The area should be ventilated and the site washed with soap and water after material pick -up is 
complete. The material should be disposed of as hazardous medical waste in compliance with 
federal, state, and local regulations.  
In case of contact with th e powder (eg, from a broken capsule), skin should be washed 
immediately with soap and copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. In case of contact 
with the eyes, copious amounts of water should be used to flush the eyes for at least 15 minutes. 
Medical personnel should be notified. Patients are to be instructed on proper storage, 
accountability, and administration of MLN9708, including that MLN9708 is to be taken as 
intact capsules.  
Investigational MLN9708 (expired or end of study) should be destroy ed on site according to the 
institution’s standard operating procedure.  Be sure to document removal and destruction on 
drug accountability logs.  
8.2.2    Pomalidomide  
Care should be e xercised in handling of pomalidomide. Pomalidomide  capsules should not be 
opened or crushed. If powder from pomalidomide contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately 
and thoroughly  with soap and water. If  pomalidomide contacts the mucous membranes, flush 
thoroughly with water.   
 
The Investigator or desig nee is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of 
pomalidomide received, and comparing it with the accompanying study drug accountability 
form.  The Investigator or designee will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign 
and dat e it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to Celgene or its representative.    
 
Storage  
At the study site, all pomalidomide  will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized 
access.  The study drug should be stored at room temperat ure away from direct sunlight and 
protected from excessive heat and cold.

 10.    STATISTICAL AND QUAN TITATIVE ANALYSES  
10.1    Statistical Methods  
10.1.1      Determination of Sample Size  
Phase I: The phase I study will follow a 3+3 design,  to evaluate toxicities associated with 
MLN9708 when given in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.  Two doses of 
MLN9708 (dose level -1 and dose level 1: 3 mg; dose level 2: 4 mg)  will be tested  in up to three 
possible dose levels; there will be no dose redu ctions below the 3mg dose of MLN9708. In the 
phase I portion of this study, the total sample size will depend on the number of dose levels 
evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). While the phase I study is expected 
to enroll and treat  9 patients ( 3 patients treated on dose level 1 and 6 additional patients treated 
at dose level 2 -assuming the 4mg dose is well tolerated), a maximum of 18 patients could be 
treated (6 patients per dose level ). The highest dose level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in  cycle 1 
will be the MTD. (See section 7.4  for dose expansion/escalation rules.)  The recommended 
phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 and pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it may be 
less than the MTD  based on a review of available data/cumulative to xicities from phase I.  
Phase I I: For this trial, where MLN9708 will be added to pomalidomide and dexamethasone,  
patients with prior exposure to either of these agents would not be excluded , unlike the patients 
treated on the randomized phase III study of c omparing pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, to 
high-dose dexamethasone alone. As many patients (>50%) are likely to have been previously 
treated with one or both of these agents  we consider a response rate of 30% sufficient efficacy to 
justify further develo pment.26 In addition, t he estimation of response in this refractory/ high-risk 
population is of equal importance. Given this, t he phase II portion of the trial, will use a Gehan 
two stage design (Gehan, 1961). The phase II trial is expected to enroll a minimum of 9 and a 
maximum of 25 patients. The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study 
will count toward the 25 patients required. Given this, we expect to enroll only 19 new patients 
on the phase II trial. The sample size is based on the desire to estimate the response rate  with at

primary endpoint is confirmed tumor response ( sCR/CR/VGPR or  PR).  
At stage 1, 9 patients will be entered on the study. If 0 responses are seen in the first 9 patients 
treated, the study will be terminated and the true regimen response will be declared ≤30%. If at 
least 1 patient responds, the trial will continue t o the second stage. Because patients treated 
during the phase I portion of the trial at the dose selected for the phase II trial will be counted

 (n=6), only 3 additional patients will be enrolled at stage 1. Under this design if the study 
regimen is >30% e ffective, there would be ~95.6% chance of at least one success.  At stage 2, 16 
additional patients will be entered.  This accrual provides for estimation of the response rate with 
no more than 10% standard error.    
10.1.2        Populations for Analysis  
Phase I  (Evaluable for Toxicity) : Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity if they 
receive any study drug. Patients will be considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity if they 
receive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide and MLN9708  and are followed for the full 28 days  
during cycle 1  or experience a DLT.  All patients who are not evaluable for dose limiting 
toxicity will be replaced.  
Phase II (Evaluable for Toxicity):  Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity if they 
receive any study drug.  Pat ients in Phase II will not be replaced based on toxicity.   
Phase  I and  II (Evaluable for Response) : For the phase II portion, as part of the primary 
analysis, patients will be considered evaluable for response if they are eligible, have baseline 
disease assessments, and receive any protocol treatment. As part of a secondary analysis,  
patients will be considered evaluable for response if they have baseline disease assessm ents, 
receive at least 75% of both Pomalidomide and MLN9708 during the first cycle of therapy and 
have had their disease re -evaluated. Patients will have their response classified according to the 
IMWG response criteria. All patients in phase II and those treated at the RP2D in phase I, who 
are not evaluable for response will be replaced.  
10.1.3     Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, medical history, and 
prior therapy, will be summarize d using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, 
descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, standard deviation, standard error, median (range) will 
be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.  
10.1.4           Efficacy Analysis  
A primary activity endpoint is not defined for the Phase I study. The primary activity endpoint 
for the Phase II study is response rate. Response rates (overall, clinical benefit) and depth of 
response will be calculated as the percent of  evaluable pat ients that have confirmed 
sCR/CR /VGPR or PR  (overall) or sCR/CR /VGPR /PR/MR or SD (clinical benefit) , exact 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated for these estimates. Response rates will also be evaluated

 based on number and type of prior therapy(ies). Response defined  as per modified IMWG 
criteria. Time to response, duration of response, and survival (overall and progression -free) will 
be estimated using the product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier.  
10.1.5     Safety Analysis  and Stopping Rules for Excessive Toxicity  
Toxicity information recorded will include the type, severity, and the probable association with 
the study regimen. Tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by severity 
and type  of toxicity.  
The following table will be consulted as relevant toxicities are encountered.  The early stopping 
rule for safety /toxicity  will be assessed for each patient after cycle 1 . The expected rate  of 
unacceptable toxicity  should not be ≥33 %. Note: Un acceptable toxicity is defined in section 7.3 
of the protocol. See the table below for detailed early stopping rules. These rules are in addition 
to the quarterly review of all toxicities submitted to the COH DSMC. Patients with ongoing 
toxicity ( cycle 1 t oxicity persisting beyond day + 28) will be followed until resolution or 
stability.  If more than the specified number of patients has significant treatment related 
toxicities, patient accrual will be halted and a full review of the data by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be mandated. Patient accrual will not resume until 
approved by the DSMC  to do so.

1: For each unacceptable toxicity , halt enrollment and evaluate if 
the cumulative # of patients reaches or exceeds the specified limits.  
We recognize that these stopping rules represent the overall stoping rules including the patient 
evaluated on a given dose during the Phase I portion. As such, these rules represent the stopping 
probabilities of a dose with the above toxicity rates, inclu ding stopping during the phase I dose 
finding portion. Once the MTD has been selected, and additional patients are accrued 
(presumably at the MTD), the probability of early stopping is less (e.g. 26% of chance of early 
stopping at 12 patients if the true p robability of unacceptable toxicity is 33%, and a 44% chance

 of early stopping at 18 patients in that scenario). This represents the probability of early 
stopping conditional on passing the criteria for MTD selection (0 or 1 out of 6).  
11.    DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING    
11.1    Definition of Risk Level  
This is a Risk Level 4 study, as defined in the “City of Hope Data and Safety Monitoring Plan”, 
http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Pages/forms -and-procedures.aspx . City of Hope is sponsor of this 
IND.  
11.2  Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring  
The Protocol Monitoring Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, 
CRC/protocol nurse, sta tistician and COH Data Coordinating Center staff is responsible for 
monitoring the data and safety of this study, including implementation of the stopping rules for 
safety and efficacy.   
 
Beginning with the enrollment of the first patient , the PMT will me et weekly or bi -weekly via 
teleconference for patient and protocol management issues.   
 
This study will utilize  the Phase I tracking log to monitor  data and safety for  dose escalation, 
recording doses administered, and resultant adverse events .  The track ing log will contain  dose 
levels administered, DLT -defining adverse events, and documentation that the data from a dose 
level is complete before dose escalation.   Those d ata and safety elements will be reported to the 
COH DSM C as applicable within the PMT report, which will be submitted quarterly from the 
anniversary date of activation, as noted in Table 1 below .

11.3  Definitions  
11.3.1     Pretreatment Event Definition  
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has signed 
informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study medication; it 
does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation .  For serious pre -
treatment events, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the even t to the study procedures.  
11.3.2        Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily 
have a causal relationsh ip with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has

 increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.   When possible, signs 
and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one 
comprehensive event.  
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clin ically significant change from baseline.   
11.3.3        Unexpected Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a) ] 
An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed ; is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an expected natural progression of 
any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant 
experiencing the AE.  
11.3.4        Expected Adverse Event  
Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected event OR is an expected natural 
progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the 
research participant experiencing the AE.  
 
         11.3.5    Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as any expected or 
unexpected AE  that, at any dose,   results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Results in death . 
 Is life-threatening  (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk  of death at 
the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe);  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization  (except scheduled hospitalizations fo r non -acute, unrelated 
cause such as an elective surgery) ;

  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  (Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions).   
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Secondary malignancy , or 
 Any other AE that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  (examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse).  
11.3.6      Unanticipated problem  – Any incident, experience or outcome that meets all 
three  of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol -related do cuments such as the IRB 
approved research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure 
(IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly rela ted means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may 
have been caused by the drugs, devices or procedures involved in the research); 
AND  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously 
known or recognized.  
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe 
in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are  NOT synonymous.  The 
general term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache).  This is NOT the same as serious , whi ch is based on patient/event outcome or action 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential  71                                                                     
 
 criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be 
considered serious.  F or example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is 
considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations . 
AEs which are serious must be  reported to Celgene and Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee) from the date the participant signs Informed Consent through 30 days after 
administration of the last dost of pomalidomide or MLN9708. Any SAE that occurs at any time 
after completion of  MLN9708/pomalidmide treatment or after the designated follow -up period 
that the sponsor -investigator and/or sub -investigator considers to be related to any study drug 
must be reported to Millennium/Celgene Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  In addition, new 
primary malignancies that occur during the follow -up periods must be reported, regardless  of 
causality to study regime n, for a minimum of  three  years  after the last dose of the investigational 
product, starting from the first dose of study drug. All new cases of primary malignancy must be 
reported to Millennium/Celgene Pharmacovigilance (or designee).    
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedur es for an illness or disease that existed before 
the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition 
deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or 
later than planned).  All  SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly 
determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness (es). Each 
Investigator is also responsible for reviewing their institutional guidelines and reporting locally 
based on those guidelines (i.e., unanticipated problems).  
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by the investigator or sub -
investigator by responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE  
is associated with the study drug(s)?  
 
11.2  Reporting of Unanticipated Problems and Adverse Events  
Unanticipated Problems:  Most unanticipated problems must be reported to the COH 
DSMC and IRB  within 5 calendar days according  to definitions and guidelines at

 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female patient  occurring while the patient is on MLN9708 or pomalidomide, 
or within 90 days  of the patient ’s last dose of therapy), are considered immediately reportable 
events. MLN9708 and pomalidomide are to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported. The investigator must notify 
the sponsor -investigator and the COH DCC immediately by phone and by completing and 
faxing the Notification of Unanticipated Problem/Serious Adverse Event/Pregnancy Form 
(attached as an Appendix 15.3).  The sponsor -investigator through the COH DCC will be 
responsible f or notifying Millennnium Pharmacovigilence(through Millennium Pregnancy Form 
attached as Appendix 15.4.4)//Celgene Drug Safety.   
 
The female patient should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one  
experienced in reproductive toxicity fo r further evaluation and counseling.  
 
The Investigator will follow the female patient  until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the sponsor -investigator and the COH DCC immediately phone and by completing by 
completing and faxing the Notification of Unanticipated Problem/Serious Adverse  
Event/Pregnancy Form (attached as an Appendix 15.3).  The sponsor -investigator through the 
COH DCC will be responsible for notifying Millennnium Pharmacovigilence(through 
Millennium Pregnancy Form attached as Append ix 15.4.4)//Celgene Drug Safety immediately 
about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy 
Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or t herapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any 
of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE. The investigator must notify the sponsor -
investigator and the COH DCC immediately phone and by completing by completing and faxing 
the Notification of Unanticipated Problem/Serious Adverse Event/Pregnancy Form (attached as 
an Appendix 15.3).  The sponsor -investigator through the COH DCC will be responsible for

 notifying Millennnium Phar macovigilence(through Millennium Pregnancy Form attached as 
Appendix 15.4.4)//Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to MLN9708 and pomalidomide shou ld also be reported. The 
investigator must notify the sponsor -investigator and the COH DCC immediately phone and by 
completing by completing and faxing the Notification of Unanticipated Problem/Serious 
Adverse Event/Pregnancy Form (attached as an Appendix 15.3).  The sponsor -investigator 
through the COH DCC will be responsible for notifying Millennnium

All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, and PD) require two consecutive assessments made at anytime 
before the institution of any new therapy; complet e response and PR and SD categories also require no 
known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.  VGPR and 
CR categories require serum and urine studies regardless of whether disease at baseline was measurable 
in serum, urine both or either.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed.  For progressive disease, serum M -
component increases of ≥ I gm/dl are sufficient to define respons e if starting M -component is ≥ 5 g/dl.     
 
IMWG clarification for coding PD:  Clarified that Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be used only in 
patients without measurable disease by M protein and by FLC levels.  Clarified that 25% increase refers 
to M pr otein, FLC, and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, soft tissue plasmacytomas 
or hypercalcemia.  Note the lowest response value does not need to be a confirmed value.

Quality Assurance and Monitoring  
 
1. The COH Data Coordinating staff will monitor each protocol conducted at participating 
sites to verify that the rights and well -being of human subjects are protected, the 
reported trial data are accurate, complete and  verifiable from source documents, and 
that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s) with the GCP and with applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
COH Data Coordinating Center will determine the appropria te extent and nature of the 
monitoring based on considerations such as study objective, purpose, design, 
complexity, blinding, size and endpoints of the trial.  A trial may require onsite 
monitoring at the participating site or may be subject to remote mon itoring.  Remote 
monitoring will involve the participating site submitting de -identified source 
documentation to the COH Data Coordinating Center.  Monitoring of that data will be 
done at COH by assuring the data captured onto CRFs is the same as the sourc e 
documentation submitted.   
2. Each IRB approved protocol will undergo monitoring evaluations by the COH Data 
Coordinating Center staff at varying time points as determined by the Division of 
Clinical Research Information Support.  A trial may require onsite  monitoring at the 
participating site or may be subject to remote monitoring.  Remote monitoring will 
involve the participating site submitting de -identified source documentation to the COH 
Data Coordinating Center.  Monitoring of that data will be done at  COH by assuring the 
data captured onto CRFs is the same as the source documentation submitted.  
3. In addition, COH research personnel from the Office of Clinical Research Auditing & 
Monitoring may audit protocol compliance  at participating sites at intervals decided by 
the coordinating center and  their office.  Auditing is dependent upon the protocol’s phase, 
accrual rate, IND stat us, and results of previous evaluations.   
4. Participating sites will be informed of intended mon itoring evaluations in a timely 
manner prior to the proposed visit and/or request for remote monitoring.  When informed 
of an impending monitoring evaluation (either onsite or remotely) by COH staff, the 
participating site is required to prepare for the vi sit by including but not limited to:  1) 
providing adequate, private space for COH staff to conduct the evaluation, 2) having a 
contact person available for periodic questions, 3) providing the medical record or 
applicable documentation for each subject mo nitored on the day of the visit, 4) providing 
an organized collection of regulatory documents pertaining to the study,  5) flagging all 
source documents pertinent to data collections; and/or 6) de -identifying and submitt ing to 
the Data Coordinating Center all source documentation for subjects.  Following any 
evaluation, an estimate of the next monitoring visit (whether onsite or remote) will be 
given to the participating site staff.   
5. The DCC will compare the subject’s records and other supporting documents  with the 
data entered on the CRFs (paper or electronic).     
6. The DCC will ensure:  
 
a. That the information recorded is complete and accurate . 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential    107 b. That there are no omissions of specific data elements such as the administration to 
any subject of concomitant test articles or the development of an intercurrent 
illness.  
c. Missing visits and examinations are noted in the records.  
d. Subjects failing to complete the study and the reason for each failure are noted.  
e. There is an original fully executed informed consent document in the subject 
record.  
f. That study subjects initial (and subsequently thereafter, if applicable) met 
protocol mandated eligibility cr iteria for study participation.  
g. That proper procedures were followed in obtaining informed consent from study 
subjects, as dictated by local regulatory guidelines (and may be subject to 
differences internationally).  
h. That source data/documents and other tri al records are accurate, complete, up -to-
date and maintained.  
i. That the participating site investigator provides all the required reports, 
notification, applications and submissions.  
j. That these documents are accurate, completely, timely, legible and dated.  
 
7. The Data Coordinating center will specifically verify that:  
 
a. The data required by the protocol are reported accurately on the CRF and are 
consistent with the source data/documents . 
b. Any dose and/or therapy modifications are well documented for each of the trial 
subjects . 
c. Adverse events, serious adverse events, concomitant medications and inter -
current illnesses are reported in the CRFs in accordance with the protocol.  
d. That study procedures were performed in adherence to the protocol document and 
that deviat ions from written procedures were discovered and properly reported to 
the IRB.  
 
8. The findings from the visit (whether on -site or remote) will be presented to the 
participating site in the form of a detailed, written report.  This report will include a 
summa ry of what was reviewed and any findings concerning significant deficiencies and 
actions recommended for compliance.  The report will be provided to appropriate 
participating site staff within 21 days of the evaluation completion.  The participating site 
staff is required to provide a written response to the findings with the corrective plan of 
actions within 14 days upon receipt of the report (if corrective action is suggested).  
 
Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event/Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
 
1. The Data  Coordinating Center will be responsible for tracking, reporting and maintaining 
documentation of all serious adverse events and unanticipated problems and 
dissemination of the information to participating sites.  
2. The Data Coordinating Center will be respon sible for reporting of adverse event data to 
the study sponsor  (as required) . 
3. The participating sites are responsible for reporting all adverse events as required in 
  
Version 6.0 March 3, 2017  
Confidential    108 Section  11.0 of the protocol , as well as to report per their local institutional guideline s. 
4. The Data Coordinating Center will be r esponsible for distributing DSMC 
findings/updates/reviews to the participating sites for submission as per their local 
guidelines (if applicable).

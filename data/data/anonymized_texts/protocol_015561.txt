Study Treatment Brigatinib (AP26113)
Protocol Title A Phase 3 Multicenter Open -label Study of Brigatinib (AP26113) versus Crizotinib in 
Patients with ALK -positive Advanced Lung Cancer 
Development Phase Phase 3
Summary and Study 
RationaleActivating gene rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been 
identified as driver mutations in approximately 2% to 7% of patients with non -small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ( Kwak et al, 2010; Wong et al, 2009 ). Crizotinib 
(XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc. ) has demonstrated clinical efficacy in ALK+ NSCLC. 
Results from a phase 1 study and a phase 2 single -arm study  of crizotinib 
demonstrated objective response rates (ORRs) of 61% and 50%, respectively 
(XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc. ). These 2 studies served as the basis for accelerated 
approval of crizotinib for treatm ent of ALK+ advanced NSCLC in the United States 
(US) in 2011 and conditional marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) in 
2012. The efficacy of crizotinib in ALK+ NSCLC patients has also been investigated 
in a randomized active -control study again st chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) 
(XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc. ). A statistically significant improvement in 
progression -free survival (PFS) was observed in patients treated with crizotinib 
compared with patients treated with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI: 0.37 
to 0.64; p<0.001). A median PFS of 7.7 months was seen with crizotinib versus 
3.0months with chemotherapy. Regular approval for crizotinib was granted by the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on the basis of this study, in 201 3. In a 
separate randomized active -control study of crizotinib against pemetrexed-platinum 
doublet chemotherapy in patients with advanced previously untreated non -squamous 
ALK+ NSCLC, median PFS was 10.9 months in the crizotinib arm and 7.0 months in 
the c hemotherapy arm (hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 
95% CI: 0.35 to 0.60; p<0.001) ( Solomon et al, 2014 ). Currently, two tests are FDA -
approved for detection of ALK+ NSCLC: the Vysis®ALK Break -Apart fluorescence 
in situ hybridiza tion (FISH) Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular, Inc.) and the Ventana ALK 
(D5F3) CDx Assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.), an immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) assay. 
Although crizotinib is an effective treatment for ALK+ NSCLC, almost half (39% and 
52%, respectively) of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the two trials that supported its 
accelerated approval failed to achieve a response. For those patients who did respond, 
the benefit was relatively short with a median duration of response of 11 months 
(XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc .). In many patients, loss of response to crizotinib 
manifests as systemic progression, but in some patients the disease progresses only 
within the brain, possibly as a result of low central nervous system (CNS) penetration 
of crizotinib (Camidge et al, 2012; Costa et al, 2011 ).
The underlying reason for failure to achieve a response to crizotinib (primary 
resistance) is difficult to identify, but suboptimal potency of the agent against the 
targeted o ncogene could be a contributing factor. The mechanisms un derlying loss of 
response (secondary or acquired resistance) to crizotinib are becoming more clear 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AP26113 -13-301
Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 8of 104(Camidge et al, 2012 ). Emerging data suggest that an important acquired resistance 
mechanism is the emergence of point mutations in the kinase domain of ALK 
(Katay ama et al, 2012 ). Mutations that confer resistance to crizotinib (such as the 
gatekeeper mutant L1196M, as well as L1152R, G1269A, S1206Y, F1174L, 
D1203N, C1156Y, T1151Tins, and G1202R mutations) may act by reducing the 
binding affinity of crizotinib to ALK ( Bang, 2012 ).
In some patients, loss of response to crizotinib may also have a pharmacologic basis, 
with inadequate drug exposure resulting from dose modifications, or changes in drug 
metabolism or transport over time. In all of these scenarios, a rational approach to 
overcoming resistance is the use of a more potent ALK inhibitor with a broader 
therapeutic window that suppresses the emergence of resistance mutations in ALK 
and that can also achieve deep and prolonged target inhibition both systemic ally and 
in the CNS (for patients with brain metastases).
Brigatinib is a novel, synthetic, orally -active ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
discovered and developed at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Brigatinib has 
demonstrated potent in -vitro inhibitory act ivity against activated ALK (approximately 
10-fold more potent than crizotinib) and pan - inhibitory activity against all 17 ALK 
resistance mutants identified to date, including the L1196M gatekeeper mutation and 
the G1202R mutation.
The phase 1/2 clinical study of brigatinib (Study AP26113 -11-101) consists of a 
phase 1 dose escalation portion in multiple tumor types, followed by a phase 2 
expansion portion with defined clinical cohorts. Daily doses from 30 mg to 300 mg 
were investigat ed in 137 patients, including 79 ALK+ NSCLC patients, of which 71 
(90%) had previously been treated with crizotinib. Three regimens were evaluated in 
phase 2: 90 mg QD, 90 mg QD for 7 days followed by escalation to 180 mg QD (90 
mg QD →180 mg QD), and 180 m g QD. 
As of 17 February 2015, the median time on treatment for all patients and ALK+ 
NSCLC patients was 7.4 months and 12.6 months, respectively. Median dose 
intensity  for patients receiving the phase 2 doses explored in this study —90 mg QD 
(n=18), 90 mg QD
→180 mg QD (n=32), and 180 mg QD (n=44) —was 90 mg/day, 
177 mg/day, and 177 mg/day, respectively. For the 90 mg QD, 90 mg QD →180 mg 
QD, and 180 mg QD cohorts, 0%, 25%, and 14% of patients had dose reductions due 
to AEs and 17%, 25%, and 43% of patients ha d dose interruptions ( ≥3 days), 
respectively. A total of 13 patients (9.5%) discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
The most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in ≥15% of 
patients who received the 90 mg QD →180 mg QD (n=32) regimen we re diarrhea 
(44%), fatigue (44%), nausea (41%), headache (28%), cough (28%), arthralgia (28%), 
amylase increased (25%), lipase increased (25%), constipation (22%), back pain 
(22%), hy pertension (22%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (19%), decreased 
appetite (16%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), insomnia (16%), 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (16%), and joint swelling (16%). Grade 3 or greater 
TEAEs reported in 2 or more patients (>5%) who received the 90 mg QD →180 mg 
QD (n=32) regimen include d: increased lipase (9%), hypertension (9%), pericardial 
effusion malignant (9%), dyspnea (6%), and alanine aminotransferase increased (6%). 
During dose escalation and initial phase 2 expansion, patients were observed to 
experience pulmonary AEs such as d
yspnea, hypoxia, pneumonia, and pneumonitis 
within the first 7 days of treatment at starting doses of 180 mg QD and higher. Many 
of these early pulmonary AEs occurred within 24 to 48 hours after initiating 
treatment. Based on these safety observations, 2 additional regimens were tested in 
the phase 2 portion (90 mg QD and 90 mg QD →180 mg QD). In the study overall, 
there were 13/137 (9%) patients with these early onset pulmonary events within the 
first 7 days of treatment: 2/2 (100%) patients at 300 mg QD, 2 /10 (20%) patients at

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 9of 104240 mg QD, 6/44 (14%) patients at 180 mg QD, 1/11 (9%) patients at 120 mg QD, 
and 2/50 (4%) patients at starting at 90 mg QD (including 90 mg QD and 90 mg 
QD→180 mg QD). The addition of a 90 mg QD 7 day lead in to therapy with 180 mg 
QD appears to lessen the incidence of early onset pulmonary events. Of 32 patients 
started at 90 mg for 7 days and then escalated to 180 mg, none (0%) experienced 
these early onset pulmonary symptoms within the first 7 days at 90 mg or after 
escalation to 180 mg. 
In evaluable ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with prior crizotinib, a 71% (50/70) 
overall response rate (ORR) was observed, including 4 complete responses (CRs). 
The ORR for the cohort that received 90 mg QD →180 mg QD was 81% (22/27 
evaluable). An ORR of 100% was observed for crizotinib naïve patients (8/8), 
including 3 CRs. Median PFS was 13.4 months for patients treated with prior 
crizotinib. Median PFS was not reached for the crizotinib -naive patients, with a 
median time on treatment of 62 weeks (ma x: 134 weeks, ongoing) and 6/8 patients 
ongoing without progression. 
To evaluate the potential for brigatinib anti tumor activity in the CNS, a blinded 
independent radiological review of intracranial response was performed in ALK+ 
NSCLC patients with intr acranial CNS metastases at baseline. In patients with 
measurable metastases, 53% (8/15) had an intracranial response; in those with only 
nonmeasurable metastases, 35.5% (11/31) had an intracranial response. Among 
patients who had no prior brain radiotherap y (n=21), intracranial ORR was 5/9 
(55.6%) for patients with measurable lesions and 7/12 (58.3%) for those with only 
nonmeasurable lesions. For patients with a follow up scan (n=46), median intracranial 
PFS was 15.6 months.
Based on the findings of Study AP26113 -11-101, a pivotal 2 -arm, open -label, phase 2 
study of brigatinib in ALK+ NSCLC patients whose disease has progressed on 
therapy  with crizotinib was designed (AP26113 -13-201, “ALTA”). This study 
randomizes patients in a 1:1 fashion to one of two bri gatinib regimen: 90 mg QD and 
90mgQD→180 mg QD. The study is currently enrolling patients with a target 
accrual of 218 patients.
In summary, brigatinib was generally tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile 
for the stage of development up to regime ns including 90 mg→180 mg QD. 
Brigatinib exhibited substantial anticancer activity in patients with ALK+ NSCLC, 
including patients who were crizotinib -naïve. Brigatinib is active in ALK+ brain 
metastases with frequent responses of clinically meaningful dur ation. There is strong 
rationale to evaluate brigatinib in the treatment of TKI -naïve ALK+ NSCLC.
Study Design This is a phase 3, randomized, open -label, comparative, multicenter, international 
study in w hich ALK+ NSCLC patients who have not previously received an 
ALK -targeted TKI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive brigatinib (Arm A) 
or crizotinib (Arm B). Patients will be stratified by the presence of intracranial CNS 
metastases at baseline (Yes versus No) and prior chemotherapy use for loca lly 
advanced or metastatic disease (Yes versus No). For the purposes of stratification, 
prior chemotherapy is defined as completion of ≥1full cycle of chemotherapy in the 
locally advanced or metastatic setting.
Patients will be treated until they experien ce progressive disease (PD) assessed by the 
blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC), intolerable toxicity, or another 
discontinuation criterion is met. Continuation of brigatinib beyond progression is 
permitted, at the investigator’s discretion, if the re is evidence of continued clinical 
benefit. Crossover in Arm B (crizotinib) to brigatinib is also permitted, at the 
investigator’s discretion with the sponsor’s medical monitor approval, for patients 
who have experienced objective progression assessed by the BIRC.

Approximate Number of 
PatientsApproximately 270 patients total (135 in Arm A, 135 in Arm B)
Approximate Duration of 
Patient ParticipationPatients will continue to be treated with brigatinib (Arm A) or crizotinib (Arm B) 
until they  experience disease pro gression assessed by the BIRC or intolerable toxicity. 
Treatment with brigatinib may be continued after progression, at the discretion of the 
investigator, if there is still evidence of clinical benefit. At the discretion of the 
investigator with the spons or’s medical monitor approval, patients who experience 
disease progression assessed by the BIRC while on crizotinib therapy may crossover 
to treatment with brigatinib. All patients who crossover to brigatinib from crizotinib 
must have a washout period of a t least 10 days between treatments. On average, a 
patient is expected to participat e inthis study for approximately 4years.
Approximate Duration of 
StudyThetotal estimated duration of the study isapproximately 4. 5years, including 
1.5years to accrue patients, with at least 3 yearsfor treatment and follow -up of the 
last patient. Since the study met the statistical significance at the first interim analysis 
and the primary endpoint was consistent at the second interim analysis, the study will 
be close d approximately 3 years after thelast patient enroll ed. 
Approximate Number of 
Study CentersApproximately 150 centers
Study Drug 
Administration and 
ModificationPatients will be randomized to receive brigatinib or crizotinib in a 1:1 fashion. 
Patients will be stratified by the presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline 
(Yes versus No) and prior chemotherapy use for locally advanced or metastatic 
disease (Yes versus No). For the purposes of stratification, prior chemotherapy is 
defined as comple tion of ≥1full cycle of chemotherapy in the locally advanced or 
metastatic setting.
Arm A (brigatinib):
Brigatinib will be administered orally at a dose of 90 mg QD for 7 days, then 180 mg 
QD, continuously, with or without food. Patients will take the pre scribed dose with 
water (recommended 240 mL).
Arm B (crizotinib):
Crizotinib will be administered as 250 mg o rally BID, with or without food. Patients 
will take the prescribed dose with water (recommended 240 mL).
Dose Modifications
Dose interruptions or r eductions should be implemented for patients who experience 
treatment -related AEs, based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Criteria for 
dose modifications of brigatinib for drug- related toxicity are described in the protocol. 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) for crizotinib ( XALKORI®SmPC, Pfizer, Inc. ) will be used as a guideline 
for dose modification of patients in the crizotinib arm and is detailed in the protocol.
Concomitant Treatment Pallia tive therapy and supportive care are permitted during the study for management 
of sy mptoms and underlying medical conditions that may develop during the study. 
Patients with CNS lesions requiring local radiotherapy such as SRS are allowed to 
continue briga tinib after appropriate interruption, as determined by the investigator 
with sponsor agreement; however, for analysis purposes, these patients will be 
considered to have progressive disease (PD).

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 15of 104The following concurrent medications or procedures are prohi bited for the duration of 
the study :
1.Any other sy stemic anticancer therapy, including, but not limited to: 
chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy, biological response modifiers 
(excluding growth factors), radiotherapy, and/or systemic hormonal therapy 
(with the exception of local therapies, such as SRS, used for palliative or 
symptomatic control of existing lesions, with appropriate treatment 
interruption at the discretion of the investigator). Use of any other 
investigational drug or device;
2.Medications that are known to be associated with the development of 
Torsades de Pointes (see Appendix E). Medications that prolong the QT 
interval, but are not known to be associated with Torsades de Pointes, should 
be avoided but are not prohibited;
3.Extensive surgery requiring inpatient care (patients may have an interruption 
in therapy for 14 days should emergency surgery be required).
Brigatinib
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
2C8 and CYP3A4 are involved in the human metabolism of brigatinib. Medications 
and dietary  (grapefruit -containing products) or herbal products (St John’s Wort) that 
are strong inhi bitors or inducers of CYPs, in particular CYP2C8 or CYP3A4, should 
be avoided (see Appendix D).
Brigatinib is not a reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2 B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 
3A4/5, with IC 50values of >70 μM. Brigatinib is also not a metabolism -dependent or 
a time -dependent inhibitor of the CYPs tested. Hence, drug-dr ug interactions (DDIs) 
due to inhibition of CYPs by brigatinib are unlikely.
Crizo tinib
Crizotinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of 
crizotinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases crizotinib plasma concentrations. 
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors, including, but not limited to, 
atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, and voriconazole. 
Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may also increase plasma concentrations of 
crizotinib. Exercis e caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
Crizotinib inhibits CYP3A both in vitro and in vivo . Coadministratio n of crizotinib 
with strong CYP3A inducers decreases crizotinib plasma concentrations .Avoid 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers, including, but not limited to, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John's Wort.
Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range, 
including, but not limited, to alfentanil, cyclosporine, di hydroergotamine, ergotamine, 
fentany l, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus in patients taking crizotinib. 
If concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range is 
required in patients taking crizotinib, dose reductions of th e CYP3A substrates may 
be required due to adverse reactions.
Efficacy Evaluation Tumo r response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks and evaluated per 
RECIST v1.1 by the BIRC and the investigator until BIRC -assessed disease 
progression. Tumor respo nse (CR or partial response [PR]) should be confirmed 
≥4weeks after initial response. For patients in Arm A who continue brigatinib beyond 
disease progression, tumor assessments will continue to be performed ever y 8weeks. 
Crossover in Arm B (crizotinib) to brigatinib treatment (Crossover Phase) is

Version 4.0 12 May 2020 Page 16 of 104permitted, at the investigator’s discretion, for patients who have experienced objective 
progression assessed by the BIRC. For these patients, the tumor response assessment with BIRC-assessed progression will be re-evaluated per RECIST v1.1 criteria as a new baseline for the Crossover Phase. Tumor response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks and evaluated per RECIST v1.1 by the BIRC and the investigator until BIRC-assessed disease progression.
OS will be followed for approximately 3 years after the last patient has been 
randomized. 
Safety Evaluation Safety assessments will include physical and laboratory examinations, vital signs, and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs). Adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE v4.0. 
Pharmacokinetic EvaluationsSparse plasma brigatinib concentration data obtained from this study will be included 
in integrated population PK analyses,  along with data from study AP26113-11-101 
and study AP26113-13-201, with the objective of further characterizing the plasma PK of brigatinib in the intended patient population, and to assess exposure-response (for efficacy) and exposure-safety relationships in patients receiving brigatinib.
Exploratory Biomarker Evaluations in Tissue and Blood
Patient-Reported Symptoms and Quality of Life AssessmentsPatient-reported symptoms and HRQoL will be collected by administering the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 (v3.0) and EORTC QLQ-LC13 (v3.0) questionnaires, which have been studied extensively, are validated, and are suitable for use in global clinical studies. The questionnaires will be administered to patients in their local language.
Statistical Methods The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using a 2-sided 
stratified log-rank test (stratification factors: presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline [yes versus no], and prior chemotherapy use for locally advanced or metastatic disease [yes versus no]) to comp are the BIRC-assessed PFS of patients 
randomized to brigatinib with the BIRC-assessed PFS of patients randomized to crizotinib. The overall (2-sided) Type I error rate will be controlled at 0.05. The primary analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. PFS will be estimated for each treatment arm using the Kaplan-Meier method ( Kaplan and Meier, 
1958 ). Additionally, hazard ratios will be estimated using the Cox regression model 
with the stratification factors as covariates.
Two interim analyses are planned after approximately 50% and 75% of the total 
expected events (progression or death) have been observed. An O’Brien-Fleming Lan-DeMets ( DeMets and Lan, 1994 ) alpha spending function will be used to control 
the overall alpha level at 0.05 2-sided.
The first interim analysis will be performed after the first 99 events have been 
observed. The primary endpoint of PFS will be tested at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.0042. A second interim analysis will be performed after 149 events and the primary endpoint will be tested at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.0194. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed after 198 ev ents have been observed or at End-of-
Study, whichever comes first, and will be  tested at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.043. If CCI

assigned treatments unless a survival advantage is noted. 
Further details of statistical analyses including the data handling rules will be 
provided in the Statis tical Analysis Plan (SAP).
Rationale for Number of 
PatientsFor the purposes of this sample size calculation, the median PFS for crizotinib is 
estimated as 10 months. Approximately 270 patients will be randomized in a 
1:1fashion to receive brigatinib or crizotinib. A total of 198 events (progression or 
death amo ng the randomized patients) will provide 90% power to detect a 6 -month 
improvement in PFS (hazard ratio=0.625). This power projection is based on a 
2-sided log -rank test and is controlled at the 2 - sided 0.043 level , adjusting for the 
proposed interim analysis plan . The number of events is fixed, but the enrollment 
number may change based on an assessment of the overall event rate pooled across 
treatment groups (prior to the close of enrollment).

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 27of 1047 INTRODUCTION
Background 7.1
Activating gene rearrangements in anaplast ic lympho ma kinase (ALK) have been ident ified as 
driver m utations in approximately  2% to 7% of patients wi th non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) ( Kwak et al, 2010; Wong et al, 2009 ). Cri zotinib ( XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc. ) has 
demonstrated clinical efficacy in ALK+ NSCLC. Results fro m a pha se1 study  and a phase 2 
single -arm study  of crizotinib demonstrated object ive response rates (ORRs) of 61% and 50%, 
respectively  (XALKORI®USPI, Pfi zer, Inc. ). These 2 studi es served as the basis for accelerated 
approval  of crizotinib for treatment of ALK + advanced NSCLC in the United States (US) in 
2011 and condit ional marketing authorizat ion in the European Unio n (EU) in 2012. The efficacy 
of crizotinib in ALK+ NSCLC pat ients has also been invest igated in a rando mized active -control  
study  against chemoth erapy (pem etrexed or docetaxel) ( XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc. ). A 
statist ically significant improvement in progression -free survival (PFS) was observed in pat ients 
treated with crizotinib co mpared with pat ients treated wi th chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.49;
95% CI: 0.37 to 0.64; p<0.001). A median PFS of 7.7 months was seen with crizotinib versus 
3.0months wit h chemotherapy. Regular approval for crizotinib was granted by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), on the basis o f this study , in 2013. In a se parate randomized 
active -control  study  of crizotinib against pemetrexed -platinum doublet chemotherapy in pat ients 
with advanced previously  untreated non -squamous ALK+ NSCLC, median PFS was 
10.9 months in the crizotinib arm and 7.0 months in the chemotherap y arm  (hazard rati o for 
progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.60; p<0.001) ( Solomon et al , 2014 ). 
Current ly, two tests are FDA -approved for detection of ALK+ NSCLC: the Vysis®ALK Break -
Apart fluorescence in situ hybridizat ion (FISH ) Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular, Inc.) and the 
Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.), an immunohistochemistry  
(IHC) assay . 
Although crizotinib is an effect ive treatment for ALK+ NSCLC, almo st half (39% and 52%, 
respectively ) of ALK+ N SCLC pat ients in the two trials that supported its accelerated approval 
failed to achieve a response. For those patients who did respond, the benefit was relat ively short 
with a median durati on of  response of 11 months (XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc .). In man y 
patients, l oss of response to cri zotinib manifests as sy stemic progressi on, but in so me pat ients the 
disease progresses only within the brain, possibly as a result of low central nervous system 
(CNS) penetration of crizotinib ( Camidge et al , 2012; Costa et al, 2011 ).
The underlying reason for failure to achieve a response to crizotinib (primary resistance) is 
difficult to ident ify, but suboptimal potency o f the agent against the targeted oncogene could be a 
contributing factor. The mechanisms underlying l oss of response (secondary  or acqui red 
resistance) to crizotinib are becoming more clear ( Camidge et al , 2012 ). Em erging data suggest 
that an important acquired resistance mechanism is the emergence of point mutations in the 
kinase domain of ALK ( Katay ama et al, 2012 ). Mutati ons that confer resistance to crizotinib 
(such as the gatekeeper mutant L1196M, as well as L1152R, G1269A, S1206Y, F1174L, 
D1203N, C1156Y, T1151Tins, and G1202R mutations) may  act by  reducing the binding affinit y 
of crizotinib to ALK ( Bang, 2012 ).
In some patients, loss of response to crizotinib may also have a pharmaco logic basis, wi th 
inadequate drug exposure result ing from dose m odificat ions, or changes in drug metabo lism or

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 28of 104transport over time. In all o f these scenarios, a rational a pproach to overcoming resistance is the 
use of a more potent ALK inhibitor with a broader therapeutic window that suppresses the 
emergence of resistance mutations in ALK and that can also achieve deep and prolonged target 
inhibit ion both sy stemically and i n the CNS (for patients with brain metastases).
Nonclinical Summary 7.2
7.2.1 Nonclinical Activity Against ALK
Brigatinib is a novel, synt hetic, orally -active ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) discovered and 
developed at ARIAD Pharmaceut icals, Inc. In nonclinical studi es, brigat inib has been shown to:
 Inhibit growth of ALK+ human tumor -derived cell lines with potency and select ivity 
approximately  10-fold greater than that of crizotinib
 Potently  inhibi t all 17 ALK secondary mutations ident ified to date that confer r esistance 
to cri zotinib or the second generation ALK inhibit ors, ceri tinib, and alect inib. Mean 
brigatinib concentrations in pat ients dosed at 90 or 180 mg daily, corrected for the 
funct ional effects of protein binding, were found to exceed the IC 50values for native 
echinoderm microtubule- associ ated protein -like 4 (EML4) -ALK and 16 resistance 
mutants by  at least 2 -fold. The only except ion was the G1202R mutant, whose IC 50was 
substant ially exceeded by  brigatinib levels achieved at 180 mg but not 90 mg dail y 
dosing.
 Suppress the emergence of any resistant ALK mutant in an in vitro mutagenesis assay, at 
concentrations that can be achieved clinically
 Induce regressio ns or inhibit growth of tumor xenografts driven by nat ive ALK or mutant 
variants that confer clinical  resistance
 Prolong survival  of mice in an ALK -dependent orthotopic brain tumor model 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a more comprehensive presentation of the nonclinical 
data.
7.2.2 Nonclinical Activity Against Other Targets
In vitro kinase assa ys have revealed that brigat inib has potent inhibitory act ivity against kinases 
including activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutants commonly observed in 
NSCLC (e.g. exon 19 delet ion, L858R, and act ivated EGFR mutants containing the T790M 
gatekeeper mutation), ROS1, CHK2, and insulin -like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF -1R).
Brigatinib Clinical Summary 7.3
Two company -sponsored clinical studies with brigatinib are being conducted in pat ients:
 A phase 1/2 study  of the safet y, tolerabili ty, pharmacok inetics (PK) and preliminary  
antitumor activit y of brigat inib in advanced malignancies, including ALK+ NSCLC 
(study AP26113 -11-101)
 A pivotal phase 2 study  in pat ients with advanced or m etastati c ALK+ NSCLC whose 
disease has progressed on therapy  with crizotinib (study  AP26113 -13-201; ALTA)

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 29of 1047.3.1 Phase 1/2 Trial: Study AP26113-11-101
The phase 1/2 clinical study  of brigatinib (Study AP26113-11- 101) consists of a phase 1 dose 
escalat ion porti on in mul tiple tum or types, fo llowed by  a phase 2 expansio n porti on wi th defined 
clinical cohorts. Daily  doses from  30 m g to 300 mg were investigated in 137 patients, including 
79 ALK+ NSCLC pat ients, of which 71 (90%) had previously  been treated wi th crizoti nib. Three 
regimens were evaluated in phase 2: 90 mg QD, 90 mg QD for 7 day s followed by escalat ion to 
180mg QD (90 mgQD→180 mg QD), and 180 mg QD. 
As of 17 February  2015, the m edian t ime on treatment for all pat ients and ALK+ NSCLC 
patients was 7.4 m onths and 12.6 months, respectively. Median dose intensit y for pati ents 
receiving the phase 2 doses explored in this study —90 mg QD (n=18), 90 mg QD →180 mg QD 
(n=32), and 180 mg QD (n=44) —was 90 mg/day, 177 mg/day, and 177 mg/day , respect ively. 
For the 90 mg QD, 90 mg QD →180 mg QD, and 180 mg QD cohorts, 0%, 25%, and 14% of 
patients had dose reductions due to AEs and 17%, 25%, and 43% of pat ients had dose 
interrupti ons ( ≥3days), respectively. A total of 13 patients (9.5%) di scont inued treatment due to 
an AE.
The m ost comm only reported treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in ≥15% of patients 
who received the 90 mg QD →180 mg QD (n=32) regimen were diarrhea (44%), fat igue (44%), 
nausea (41%), headache (28%), cough (28%), arthralgia (28%), amylase increased (25%), lipase 
increased (25%), const ipation (22%), back pain (22%), hy pertensi on (22%), aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (19%), decreased appetite (16%), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(16%), inso mnia (16%), peripheral sensory  neuropathy
 (16%), and j oint swelling (16%). Grade 3 
or greater TEAEs reported in 2 or more patients (>5%) who received the 90 mg QD →180 mg 
QD (n=32) regimen included: increased lipase (9%), hy pertensio n (9%), pericardial effusio n 
malignant (9%), dyspnea (6%), and alanine aminotransferase increased (6%). 
During dose escalat ion and init ial phase 2 expansion, patients were observed to experience 
pulmo nary AEs such as dyspnea, hypoxia, pneumo nia, and pneumo nitis within the first 7 day s of 
treatm ent at starting doses of 180 mg QD and higher. Many  of these early pulmo nary AEs 
occurred within 24 to 48 hours after init iating treatment. Based on these safet y observations, 
2additional regimens were tested in the phase 2 porti on (90 mg QD and 90 mgQD→180 mg 
QD). In the study  overall, there were 13/137 (9%) patients with these early onset pulmo nary 
events within the fi rst 7 day s of treatm ent: 2/2 (100%) patients at 300 mg QD, 
2/10 (20%) patients at 240 mg QD, 6/44 (14%) patients at 180 mg QD, 1/11 (9%) patients at 
120mg QD, and 2/50 (4%) patients at starting at 90 mg QD (including 90 mg QD and 90 mg 
QD→180 mg QD). The addit ion of a 90 mg QD 7 -day lead-in to therapy  with 180 mg QD 
appears to l essen the incidence of early  onset pulmonary  events. Of 32 patients started at 90 mg 
for 7days and then escalated to 180 mg, none (0%) experienced these early onset pu lmonary 
symptoms within the first 7 days at 90 mg or after escalat ion to 180 mg. 
In evaluable ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with prior crizotinib, a 71% (50/70) overall response 
rate (ORR) was observed, including 4 complete responses (CRs). The ORR for the cohort that 
received 90 mgQD→180 mg QD was 81% (22/27 evaluable). An ORR of 100% was observed 
for crizotinib-naïve pat ients (8/8), including 3 CRs. Medi an PFS was 13.4 months for patients 
treated with prior crizotinib. Median PFS was not reached for the c rizotinib -naive pat ients, with a 
median time on treatment of 62 weeks (max: 134 weeks, ongoing) and 6/8 patients ongoing 
without progressi on.

A pivotal phase 2 study  of patients with advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC whose disease 
has progressed on therapy  with crizotinib (Study  AP26113 -13-201; ALTA) is ongo ing. This 
study  rando mizes pat ients in a 1: 1 fashio n between 2 brigatinib treatment regimens: 90 mg QD 
(Arm  A) and 90 mg QD →180 mg QD (Arm B). A total of 218 patients are planned to be 
enrolled.
As of 15 June 2015, 69 and 71 patients in Arm A and Arm B, respectively, were inc luded an 
interim analysis o f the safet y popul ation. Median duration of treatment was 89 days (range: 3 to

Rationale for the Phase 3 Study of Brigatinib in ALK -inhibitor -naive ALK+ 7.4
NSCLC
There continues to be a need to explore new treatment options for patients with ALK+ NSCLC 
who are naïve to treatment with an ALK -targeted TKI. Although crizotinib is an effect ive 
treatm ent for ALK+ NSCLC, almost half of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the pivotal trials that 
supported i ts accel erated approval failed to achieve a response. PFS was relat ively short in the 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AP26113 -13-301
Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 32of 1042randomized phase 3 trials, wi th a median durati on of  7.7 to 10.9 months. Chemotherapy  is also 
used al though i t is not specifically approved for use in ALK+ NSCLC patien ts, wi th median PFS 
durati on of  7.0months wit h first line plat inum doublet chemotherapy. New therapies are needed 
to improve response rates, provide greater durabilit y of response, and to overcome potential 
mechanisms of resistance to ALK -targeted therapy , including the emergence o f secondary  
resistance mutations in ALK and progression in the CNS. 
Based on the promising act ivity profile of brigat inib in vitro and in vivo and the clinical act ivity 
demonstrated in the phase 1/2 study  (Study  AP26113 -11-101) and Phase 2 study  (Study  
AP26113 -13-201, ALTA), this phase 3 study  will evaluate brigat inib in an ALK+ NSCLC 
patient popul ation not previ ously treated wi th an ALK inhibitor. 
Rationale for Proposed Phase 3 Dose 7.5
Brigatinib has an acceptable safet y profile a t starting doses of 90 mg QD (including dose 
escalat ion to 180 mg QD after 1 week). The 7 -day run-in period at 90 mg QD prior to escalat ion 
to 180 mg QD reduced the frequency of pulmo nary toxicity observed wi th a starting dose of 
180mg, and pulmo nary toxicity has not been seen upon escalation to 180 mg. Taken together, 
the preliminary safet y data from study  AP26113 -13-201 and l onger fo llow up safet y data in 
study AP26113 -11-101 show that the AE profile of the 90 mg QD →180 m g QD i s similar 
qualitat ively and quant itatively to that of 90 mg QD. Mean plasma concentrations in pat ients 
dosed at 90 or 180 mg QD in study AP26113 -11-101 were found to exceed the IC 50values for 
native EML4 -ALK and all 17 resistance mutants tested by at least 2 -fold, with the except ion of 
the G1202R mutant, whose IC 50was substantially exceeded by brigatinib levels achieved at 
180mgQD but not 90 mg QD dosing. This suggests that the higher 180 mg QD dose may 
prevent the emergence o f a broader arra y of ALK resistance mutations than 90 mg QD. 
Importantly, wi th likely higher CNS exposure, the 180 mg QD dose may also provide increased 
activit y against brain metastases. In order to optimize PFS and control CNS disease there is 
strong rationale to use t he highest safe dose of brigatinib (90 mg QD for 7 day s followed by

Exploratory Objectives 8.3
9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
Overall Study Design and Plan 9.1
This is a phase 3, randomized, open-label, comparativ e, multicenter, international study in which 
ALK+ NSCLC patients who have not previously received an ALK-targeted TKI will be 
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive brigatinib (Arm A) or crizotinib (Arm B). 
Patients will be stratified by the presence of CNS metastases at baseline (Yes versus No) and 
prior chemotherapy used for locally advanced  or metastatic disease (Yes versus No). For the 
purposes of stratification, prior chemotherapy is defined as completion of ≥1 full cycle of 
chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. An estimated 270 patients (135 in 
Arm A, 135 in Arm B) will be enrolled at approximately 150 centers.
Patients will be treated until they experience progressive disease (PD) assessed by the blinded 
Independent Review Committee (BIRC), intolerable toxi city, or another discontinuation criterion 
is met. Continuation of brigatinib beyond progression is permitted, at the investigator’s 
discretion, if there is evidence of continued clinical benefit. Crossover from Arm B (crizotinib) 
to brigatinib is also permitted, at the investig ator’s discretion with the sponsor’s medical monitor 
approval, for patients who have experienced objective progression assessed by the BIRC. 
Throughout the study, AEs will be assessed and categorized by the US National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), v4.0 (see Appendix A) . 
Patients will be evaluated according to the Schedule of Events in Section 11.1.  Patients will be 
supplied study drug until they discontinue from the study.CCI

Randomization 9.2
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  receive either brigatinib 90 mg once daily (QD) 
orally for 7 days followed by 180 mg QD orally continuously (Arm A) or crizotinib 250 mg 
twice daily (BID) orally (Arm B). Patients will  be stratified by the following 2 factors, each 
having 2 levels:
1. Intracranial CNS metastases at baseline (yes versus no) 
2. Prior chemotherapy use for locally advanced or metastatic disease (yes versus no). For 
the purposes of stratification, prior chemotherapy is defined as completion of ≥1 full 
cycle of chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting.
Specific instructions for randomization will be supplied in the Study Reference Manual. 
Randomization procedures should be performed following completion of eligibility assessments 
and prior to the initiation of treatment. This study is unblinded; patients, investigators, and the 
sponsor will know the identity of each patient’s study drug.CCI

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 38of 104Study Procedure Descriptions 11.1
The stud y procedures to be performed at screening and throughout the Rando mized Phase o f the 
study  are listed in Table 3(Schedule of Events), which is meant to provi de a convenient display  
of the timing and scope of required assessments expected at each visit, but does not provide a 
comprehensive descript ion of each assessment. A complete list of all study -related assessments 
as well as a detailed description of what i s expected in the assessment is included below. 
Invest igators must be familiar with the details of this section and use it in conjunction wit h the 
table to adequately  carry  out the requi red study  assessments. All study  assessments shoul d occur 
within ±3days of the scheduled study  visit unless otherwise noted in the Schedule of Events 
descri ptions or table. A cycle is defined as 28 days. 
Crossover in Arm B (cri zotinib) to bri gatinib is permitted, at the invest igator’s discret ionwith 
the sponsor’s medical monitor approval , for pati ents who have experienced objective progression 
docum ented by  BIRC or the invest igator . Patients who crossover fro m crizotinib to bri gatinib 
treatm ent (Crossover Phase) will adhere to the Schedule of Events listed in Table 4. All 
assessments for the Crossover Phase will be performed as described below for the Rando mized 
Phase, except as noted.
The fo llowing list describes the footnotes for Table 3andTable 4.
1. Screening
Patients wi th known l ocally  advanced or m etastatic ALK+ NSCLC and no history  of prior 
ALK -targeted TKI treatment can be considered for screening. Screening assessments must 
be performed no more than 14 days pri or to Day 1,with the except ion of tumor imaging 
assessment, where the allowable window is 21 days prior to first dose of study  drug 
(Cycle1, Day  1). However, whenever feasible, baseline imaging should be performed as 
close as possible to Cycle 1, Day  1. 
Screening p hysical examinat ion, ECOG Performance Status assessments, and clinical 
laboratory  assessments (hematol ogy, chemistry , testosterone [male patients], insulin, and 
pregnancy test) do not need to be repeated on Cy cle 1, Day  1 if they were performed for 
screeni ng wi thin 7 days pri or to Cycle 1, Day 1 AND, in the opinio n of the investigator, 
there is no reason to believe they have substant ially changed. The pregnancy test may  be 
repeated at any  time during the study  if the patient or the invest igator has cause to believe 
that the patient may be pregnant. If screening laboratory assessments need to be repeated 
on Cy cle 1, Day  1, they  shoul d be obtained before starting treatment.

A co mplete physical examinat ion must be performed at screening, the extent of which 
shoul d be consistent wi th medical  history  and the pati ent’s underlying disease. Subsequent 
physical examinat ions m ay be di rected to rel evan t findings. Of note, due to adverse 
reacti ons reported during treatment with crizotinib and brigat inib, investigators are 
cauti oned to m onitor pati ents f or signs of  visio n dysfunct ion. For new or worsening severe 
visio n disorders, ophthalmo logical  evaluat ion consist ing of best corrected visual acuit y, 
retinal photographs, visual fields, optical coherence tomography  (OCT) and other 
evaluat ions shoul d be perform ed. The End- of-Treatm ent physical examinat ion should be a 
complete physical examinat ion. The physic al examinati on 30 days after l ast dose m ay be 
directed to any  relevant findings.
10. Vital Signs

In male pat ients, serum testosterone should be measured at screening and throughout the 
study  per the Schedule of Events. 
16. Electrocardiogram 
All ECGs must be 12 -lead ECGs and will be assessed per the Schedule of Events 
throughout the study . 
Addit ional ECGs may be performed at the invest igator’s discretion to ensure patient safet y. 
In parti cular, ECG m onitoring shoul d be performed during the study  if a pat ient has, during 
the study , been prescribed medicat ion that can prolong the QT interval or medicat ion that 
can potenti ally alter the QT interval  (other than medi cations explicit ly prohibi ted).
For consistency, the Fridericia correction (QTcF = QT interval/(RR)1/3interval) method 
must be used for all calculat ions of heart rate -corrected QT (calculated) (QTc) intervals. 
17. Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) are to be recorded continuously throughout the entire study  until at 
least 30 days after the last dose of study drug and graded per NCI CTCAE v4.0 (See 
Appendix A). It is expected that new and updated AEs and concomitant medicat ions 
reported within the treatment period, ongoing AEs thought to be at least possibly 
study -drug rel ated, and all ongo ing SAEs should be fo llowed at least every  4 weeks unt il 
they resolve to baseline (or to NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade ≤1), stabilize, or are considered to 
be chronic/irreversible.
18. Concomitant Medications
Concomitant treatments for all ongo ing medical history  condi tions or AEs, as well as 
prophylact ic treatments and supplements, must be reported from the date the informed 
consent is signed unt il at least 30 Days After Last Dose, and for all conco mitant treatm ents

until pat ient contact di scont inues.
19. Pregnancy Test
The pregnancy test must be a beta- human chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG) test, a nd either 
urine or serum can be used. Wo men who are not of childbearing potential (status 
post-hysterectomy, status post -bilateral oophorectomy, or post -menopausal [defined as 
amenorrhea for at l east 12 months]) and m en do not need to have the test perform ed. The 
test m ust be known to be negat ive prior to the study drug administration and be performed 
within 7 days pri or to fi rst study drug administration (Cycle 1, Day  1). Wom en of 
childbearing potential at study  start m ust al so compl ete the pregnancy test once every  
12weeks thereafter and at the End -of-Treatm ent. Addit ional pregnancy  testing shoul d be 
perform ed if recommended or required per local guidelines or regulat ions.

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 42of 10420. Disease Assessment CT/MRI, Brain MRI
At screening, disease assessment must include imaging of the chest and abdo men 
(including adrenal glands), using appropriate radiological procedures (computed 
tomography  [CT] scans or m agnet ic resonance imaging [MRI] with contrast, unless contrast 
media is contraindicated). Con trast-enhanced MRI of th e brain (such as gadolinium) is 
requi red at screening for all pat ients. All radiographic images (e.g., CT scan, MRI) 
perform ed during the study  will be submi tted to the imaging core l aboratory  for central  
review. Patients must have at least 1 measurable le sion per RECIST v1.1. Previously 
irradi ated l esions m ay not be used for target lesio ns, unless there is unambiguous 
radiological  progressi on after radi otherapy . Brain lesio ns may be used as target lesio ns 
provi ded they  are ≥10mm and have not been: 1) previo usly treated with whole brain 
radiation therapy  (WBRT) wi thin 3 months, or 2) previously treated by  stereotacti c 
radiosurgery  (SRS) or surgical resect ion.
Disease assessment by  CT and MRI scans will be performed at screening and at 8- week 
intervals there after (on Day 28 [±3 days] of every  even -numbered cycle), through Cy cle14 
after the ini tial dose of study  drug, and every  3cycles thereafter until End -of-Treatm ent. 
Imaging of chest, abdomen and brain will occur at each assessment for all pat ients. More 
frequent imaging is recommended at any  time if clinically indicated; confirmat ion of CR or 
PR shoul d be perform ed at least 4 weeks after init ial response. Im aging assessment will 
also be performed at End -of-Treatm ent if more than 4 weeks have passed since the last 
imaging assessment. The same imaging modalit y at the same institution should be used at 
each assessment, if possible. 
A pat ient randomized to Arm B (crizotinib) with object ive disease progression assessed by 
the BIRC m ay crossover to bri gatinib t reatment, at the investigator’s discret ion with the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor approval (see Secti on13.1.2 ). The disease assessment which 
docum ents progressi on will  serve as the new baseline for the crossover portion of the 
study . The invest igator will reevaluate the patient for target and non -target l esions, 
according to RECIST criteria, based on the disease assessment scans showing t he initial 
progression. A crossover patient need not repeat imaging assessments before Crossover 
Cycle 1, Day 1, unless the di sease assessment is incomplete, or occurred >21 days prior to 
Crossover Cy cle1, Day 1 (in which case, disease assessments must be repeated and will 
serve as the new baseline). If the disease assessment is inco mplete, the site will obtain any  
missing radiographic imaging (e.g., MRI of the brain) prior to init iation of treatment with 
brigatinib. Disease assessment by  CT and MRI scans will be perform ed at 8 -week intervals 
thereafter (on Day 28 [±3 days] of every even -numbered cycle), through Cy cle14 after the 
initial dose of brigat inib, and every 3 cycles thereafter unt il End-of-Treatm ent. Im aging 
assessment will also be performed at E nd-of-Treatment if more than 4 weeks have passed 
since the l ast imaging assessment. The same imaging modalit y at the same inst itution 
shoul d be used at each assessment, if possible.
For pati ents who discont inue the study drug due to a reason other than pro gressive disease, 
additional tumor assessment should be documented, if available, unt il disease progression

confirm progressive disease.
21. Tumor Tissue Samples
Mandatory Tumor Tissue From All Patients at Screening:
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue that was acquired prior to 
randomization must be provided for exploratory molecular genetic analysis. This tissue can 
be from the primary tumor or from a biopsied metastasis. A pathologist should assess the 
tissue sample to ensure adequate tumor tissue is available based on the minimum 
requirements described in the Study Reference Manual. 
For patients who do not have a prior positive result from the Vysis®ALK Break-Apart 
FISH Probe Kit or Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay, this sample will be used for central 
testing by an FDA-approved test and exploratory biomarker studies. For patients with a 
prior positive result for one of the FDA-approved tests, this sample will be used for 
exploratory biomarker studies. 
Optional Tumor Tissue at Time of Disease Progression:
For patients who consent, a biopsy will be performed at the time of progression on 
brigatinib (for patients in Arm A) or crizotinib (for patients in Arm B) and at the time of subsequent progression on brigatinib (for patients in Arm B after crossover to brigatinib). 
FFPE tumor tissue should be sent to the central laboratory. This tumor tissue will be used 
for exploratory molecular genetic analysis.

Version 4.0 12 May 2020 Page 44 of 10424. Quality of Life Assessments
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLC-LC13 questionnaires will be administered at 
baseline, per the Schedule of Events throughout the study, and at the 30 days after last dose 
visit. The questionnaires should be administer ed to patients when they arrive for their 
scheduled visits, prior to any clinical measurements, assessments, evaluations, or 
procedures being performed.
25. End-of-Treatment Randomized Phase (Arms A and B)/Crossover Phase (Arm B Only)
The End-of-Treatment visit s hould be pe rformed within 2 weeks (14 days) of the patient’s 
last dose of study drug or the patient/investig ator decision to disc ontinue study drug—
whichever occurs later. Physical examinations, laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, 
and insulin), and ECG may be omitted if they had been previously performed within 
2 weeks since the last assessments and if, in the investigator’s judgment, significant change is unlikely.
Patients in Arm B (crizotinib) who crossover to brigatinib should complete the assessments 
for the End-of-Treatment visit for crizotinib. These assessments will serve as baseline 
assessments for the Crossover Phase. After a minimum 10-day washout period, and a 
maximum of 28 days, the patient will start brigatinib treatment on Crossover Cycle 1, 
Day 1, and will follow the schedule of events for the crossover phase as described in  Table 
4. For these patients, End-of-Treatment assessments must also be performed within 2 
weeks (14 days) of the patient’s last dose of bri gatinib or the patient/investigator decision 
to discontinue study drug—whichever occurs later.
26. 30 Days After Last Dose
The 30 Days After Last Dose assessments must  be performed 30 days (±7 days) after the 
last dose of study drug. Physical examinations and laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, 
and insulin), and ECG can be omitted if the visit occurs within 10 days of the 
End-of-Treatment assessment and there have been no clinically significant findings. Any 
new systemic anticancer therapies that the patient has begun receiving since the end of 
treatment should be reported at this visit. F or both the End-of-Treatment and 30 Days After 
Last Dose assessments, information may be collected from tests performed for the study or 
as part of the patient’s routine medical care.
Patients in Arm B (crizotinib) who crossover to brigatinib will not be required to have a 
30 Days After Last Dose visit after discon tinuing crizotinib. A 30 Day After Last Dose 
visit will be required when brigatinib is discontinued.
27. Follow-up
Patients will be followed throughout the study, as per  Table 3 and Table 4.  The follow-up 
assessments (i.e., contacting the patient for survival and subsequent anticancer therapy) 
must be performed every 12 weeks (±14 days) after the End-of-Treatment for the last st udy CCI

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 48of104Screening Period 11.2
The screening period begins when the informed consent form is signed, and cont inues unt il 
rando mizat ion. See Section 11.1 for further details.
Screen Failures 11.3
Patients who have signed informed consent and subsequent ly fail to m eet the inclusio n and/or 
exclusio n criteria are defined as screen failures. Once the invest igator determines that screening 
will not continue for a patient and th e pati ent will not be enro lled in the study, the screen failure 
shoul d be docum ented on the Eligibilit y Cri teria eCRF wi thin 5days. For all screen failures, the 
investigator i s to m aintain a screening log that documents the patient init ials and reason(s) for 
screen failure. A copy  of the l og shoul d be retained in the invest igator’s study files. Patients who 
screen fail may later be re -screened wit h prior sponsor approval. 
Treatment Through 30 Days after Last Dose of Study Drug 11.4
This period begins when the patient receives the first dose of study  drug.
Assessments required during this period for the Rando mized Phase and the Crossover Phase are 
shown in Table 3and Table 4, respectively . A detailed descript ion of procedures and timing is 
provi ded in Section11.1.
Note: clinical laboratory  assessments do not need to be repeated on Cy cle1, Day 1 if they  were 
performed for screening within 7days pri or to Cy cle1, Day 1.
End-of-Treatment or Early Termination 11.5
End-of-Treatm ent is defined as the point when or the pat ient and invest igator decide to end study  
drug (whi ch may  be after a dose interrupti on). Assessments required at Randomized Phas e 
End-of-Treatm ent are shown in Table 3. A detailed descript ion of procedures and timing is 
provi ded in Section11.1.
Patients in Arm B (cri zotinib) who crossover to brigatinib should complete the assessments for 
the End -of-Treatment vi sit for cri zotinib. These assessments will serve as baseline assessments 
for the Crossover Phase. After a minimum 10 -day washout peri od, the patient will start brigat inib 
treatm ent on Crossover Cycle 1, Day 1, and will follow the schedule of events for the crossover 
phase as described in Table 4. 
30 Days After Last Dose 11.6
Assessments required at 30Days After Last Dose for the Rando mized Phase and the Crossover 
Phase are shown in Table 3and Table 4, respectively . A detailed d escript ion of procedures and

Study Duration 11.8
11.8.1 Approximate Duration of Patient Participation
Patients will  cont inue to be dosed with brigat inib (Ar mA) or crizotinib (Arm B) unt il they 
experience BIRC -assessed disease progression or intolerable toxicit y. Treatm ent wi th brigat inib 
may be continued after progression, at the discret ion of the invest igator, if there is st ill evidence 
of clinical benefit. At the di scret ion of the invest igator wi th the sponsor’s medical mo nitor 
approval , pati ents who experience BIRC -assessed di sease progressi on on cri zotinib may 
crossover to treatment with brigat inib (see Section13.1.2 for details on treatment continuat ion 
after progressi on). On average, a patient is expected to participate in this study  for approximately  
4years.
11.8.2 Approximate Duration of Study
The total  estimated duration of the study is approximately 4. 5years, including 1.5years to 
accrue pati ents, wi th approximately  3years for treatment and fo llow-up of  the last pati ent. Since 
the study  met the stati stical sign ificance at the first interim analysis and the primary endpo int 
was consistent at the second interim analysis, the study  will be cl osed approximately 3 years 
after the last patient enroll ed. Patients will be allo wed to receive brigatinib beyo nd the 3-year 
treatm ent peri od until they  experi ence disease progressio n, they  discontinue treatment for other 
reasons, or the study  is closed . 
Patient Discontinuation 11.9
Patients in the Rando mized Phase will be discontinued fro m further study drug administration 
(brigatinib or cri zotinib) in the event of any o f the following:
 Intol erable toxi city as determined by  the invest igator
 Progressi on of  disease requi ring an al ternate therapy , in the opinio n of invest igator 
Note: Treatment of patients in Arm A with brigat inib may be cont inued, despite BIRC -
assessed progression by  RECIST v1.1, at the discreti on of  the investi gator, if there is st ill 
evidence of clinical benefit. In this clinical trial, patients in Arm B may not continue 
treatm ent wi th crizotinib bey ond BIRC -assessed progressi on. Crossover of patients in 
Arm B to treatm ent wi th brigatinib may  occur at th e time of BIRC- assessed progressi on 
on cri zotinib, at the discretion of the invest igator wit h the sponsor’s medical mo nitor 
approval .

to:
● The discovery  of a seri ous, unexpected, or unacceptable risk to subjects enro lled in the 
study
● The decisio n on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluat ion, or
development of the study  drug
● Durati on of  the study  extends greater than 3 y ears after the l ast pati ent is randomized
● Submissio n of knowingly  false inform ation from the research facilit y to the sponsor,

Tumor respo nse assessments will be performed every 8 weeks and evaluated per RECIST v1.1 
(see Appendix C) by the BIRC and the invest igator until BIRC -assessed disease progression. 
Tumor response (CR or PR) shoul d be confirmed ≥4weeks after init ial response. For patients 
who discont inue the stud y treatm ent due to a reason other than BIRC -assessed progressive 
disease, addi tional tum or assessment should be documented, if available, until disease 
progression or start of another systemic anti- cancer therapy . For pati ents in Arm A who continue 
brigatinib bey ond disease progressi on, tum or assessments will cont inue to be performed every 8 
weeks. For patients in Arm B who crossover to brigatinib after BIRC -assessed progression on

Version 4.0 12 May 2020 Page 52 of 104crizotinib, the tumor response assessment with BIRC-assessed progression will be re-evaluated 
per RECIST v1.1 criteria as a new baseline for the Crossover Phase unless >21 days prior to 
Crossover C1D1, which will require a new disease assessment prior to starting brigatinib. Tumor 
response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks and evaluated per RECIST v1.1 by the 
BIRC and the investigator until BIRC-assessed disease progression. For patients who discontinue 
the study drug due to a reason other than BIRC-assessed progressive disease, additional tumor 
assessment should be documented, if available, until disease progression or start of another 
systemic anti-cancer therapy.
OS will be followed for approximately 3 years after the last patient has been randomized. 
Safety Assessments 12.2
Safety assessments will include physical and laboratory examinations, vital signs, and ECGs. 
AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 (see Appendix A and the Study 
Reference Manual). Safety assessments and their timing are outlined in Section 11.1.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments 12.3
Sparse plasma brigatinib concentration data obtai ned from this study w ill be in cluded in 
integrated population PK analyses, along with data from study AP26113-11-101 and 
study AP26113-13-201, with the objective of further characterizing the plasma PK of brigatinib in the intended patient population, and to assess exposure-response (for efficacy) and exposure-
safety relationships in patients receiving brigatinib. 
Plasma PK samples may also be used for exploratory biomarker evaluations.
Exploratory Biomarker Evaluations in Tissue and Blood
12.4
Patient Reported Symptoms and Quality of Life Assessments 12.5
Patient-reported symptoms and HRQoL will be collected by administering the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 (v3.0) and the lung cancer-specific module (the QLQ-LC13, v3.0) questionnaires, 
which have been studied extensively, are validated, and are suitable for use in global clinical 
studies. The questionnaires will be administered to patients in their local language, if available.
On the study days they are administered, the questionnaires should be completed by patients 
prior to any testing or discussion with the physician.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-s pecific questionnaire initially tested in lung cancer patients 
(Aaronson et al, 1993) . The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored for 5 functional scales (physical, CCI

(dyspnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, const ipation, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies). 
The LC13 mod ule was constructed in parallel wit h the core QLQ -C30. It comprises 13 questions 
assessing lung cancer associated symptoms (cough, hemopty sis, dyspnea, and site specific pain), 
treatm ent-related side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, a nd alopecia), and 
use of pain medicat ion (Aaronson et al , 1996 ; Bergman et al, 1994 ). It i s scored as a set of single 
items.
Note: Signs and symptoms assessed wit h the patient -reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires will 
not be considered AEs unless entered as such into the eCRF. 
13 STUDY TREATMENTS
Study Drug 13.1
Brigatinib is an invest igational drug that will be administered only to eligible enrolled patients at 
qualified centers (e.g., listed on the FDA Form 1572).
13.1.1 Treatment Administration
Patients will  be randomized 1:1 to receive brigat inib (Arm A) or cri zotinib (Arm B). 
In Arm A, brigat inib will be administered orally at a dose of 90 mg QD for 7 days fo llowed by  
180mgQD cont inuously, wit h or without food. Patients will take the prescri bed dose wi th water 
(recommended 240 mL). 
In Arm B, crizotinib orally will be administered as 250 mg BID, with or without food. Patients 
will take the prescribed dose with water (recommended 240 mL).
Patients who forget to take their scheduled dose of stu dy drug should be instructed not to make 
up the missed dose. A missed dose is defined as a dose not taken within 6 hours of the intended 
scheduled administration. Missed doses should be recorded in an appropriate source record (e.g., 
clinic chart), patient diary card, and study  drug administrati on eCRF.
Study  drug administration will cont inue until the patient dies, meets another reason for treatment 
discontinuat ion, or the tri al ends. 
13.1.2 Continuation of Treatment after Disease Progression
Patients in the Ran domized Phase will continue to be dosed with brigat inib (Arm A) or crizotinib 
(Arm B) unt il they experience BIRC -assessed disease progression or intolerable toxicit y or are 
discontinued for other reasons. In certain circumst ances, at the discretion of the treating 
investigator, brigat inib may be continue dafter progressive disease has been ident ified.
Continued Therapy at the Time of Disease Progression in Arm A
Patients in Arm A who experience BIRC -assessed di sease progressi on may  cont inue to be 
treated with br igatinib if, in the opinio n of the treating invest igator, they cont inue to experience 
clinical benefit. Patients in Arm B may  not continue treatment with crizotinib on study  after 
BIRC-assessed disease progression.

The fo llowing sect ions provide reco mmended dose modificat ion gui delines for treatm ent-
related 
AEs observed with brigatinib and crizotinib administration. 
Dose interruptions or reductio ns should be implemented for patients who experience 
treatm ent-related AEs, upon clinical judgment of the invest igator. Study drug administration may 
be delayed for up to 28 days to allow for improvement or resolut ion of the event. If an AE does 
not resolv e to grade 1 or less after dose interruption for more than 28 days, the sponsor’s medical 
monitor must be contacted. 
Com prehensive assessments of any  study  drug -related AEs (i.e., adverse drug reactions) 
experienced by the patient will be performed throug hout the course of the study . The severi ty of 
the event, as well as clinical judgment, will be utilized to determine appropriate management of 
the pati ent for any  AE experienced while participating in this study .
Any medicat ion, including those administere d for therapy of symptoms considered associated 
with study  drug administration, should be reported on the appropriate concomitant medication 
page of the patient’s eCRF.

Adverse Events i n Patients Receiving Brigatinib (Arm A or Crossover Patients)
13.1.3.1.1 Adverse Events w ithin the First 7 Days of Treatment w ith Brigatinib, Prior to Dose 
Escalation 
Criteria for dose m odificat ion of general treatment -related adverse events (excluding 
pneumo nitis) in the first 7 day s of treatm ent pri or to dose escalat ion are provided in Table 5. 
Criteria for dose m odificat ion of general treatment -related adverse events (excluding

In study  AP26113 -11-101, pulmo nary events occurring wit hin the first 7 days of treatment with 
brigatinib, consistent in so me cases with pneumo nitis, were observed shortly  after treatm ent 
initiation in 4% of patients who had received brigatinib at a startin g dose of 90 mg QD 
(including pat ients who escalated to 180 mg QD after 7 day s). No such events were observed in 
the 7 days after escalat ion to 180 m g QD. Events included the acute onset of symptoms of

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 55of104dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, and fever. Pulmo nary symptom s have been observed after a 
single dose of brigat inib in some patients. The pulmo nary symptoms are associ ated in m ore 
severe cases with hypoxia and chest CT findings of ground glass opacit ies consistent with 
pneumo nitis, and in these cases const ituted SAEs. These events have been managed wit h 
treatm ent interruption and medical management as clinically  indicated (e.g., steroids, 
antibiotics). Most events resolved with interruption or discont inuat ion of brigat inib. Three fatal 
pulmo nary events (includ ing hypoxia, pneumonia, and adult respiratory  distress syndro me) 
starting within the first 7 day s of treatm ent were observed in study  AP26113 -
11-101. Upon 
resum ption of dosing, some pat ients had events recur while others did not have recurrence with 
contin ued dosing. As such, invest igators and patients must be aware that pneumonit is-like events 
may present as early as 24 to 48 hours of init ial dosing. 
Pulmo nary events occurring within the first 7 day s of treatment, including, but not limited to, 
dyspnea, h ypoxia, dry  cough, chest tightness, and presumpt ive lung infect ion (pneumo nia) 
shoul d be m onitored and reported. To reiterate, some events occur after a single dose of 
brigatinib, and physicians should be aware of this possibilit y and discuss it with patie nts. Newly  
developed or worsening of pulmo nary symptoms in the first week of study  drug administration 
specifically wit h hypoxia and ground glass opacit y on radiographic imaging indicative of 
interstit
ial lung disease or pneumonit is could suggest a relatio nship to brigat inib. Other 
etiologies, including pulmo nary embo lism and infecti ous pneumo nia, should be ruled out if 
possible. If no evidence of other etiology  is ident ified, a causal relat ionship to brigat inib shoul d 
be considered. 
The m anagement of new or worsening pulmo nary symptoms wi thin the first 7 day s of bri gatinib 
treatm ent shoul d include drug interruption, monitoring of oxy gen saturati on, radi ographic 
evaluat ion of the chest, and appropriate work up for infect ious or other etio logy, with high dos e 
corticosteroi ds, supplemental  oxygen therapy , and em piric ant ibiotics as indicated. After drug 
interrupti on and workup of symptoms, dose modification should be accomplished according to 
the recommendat ions in Table 5. If the work up reveals documented hypoxia and/or radiologic 
evidence of interstit ia
l or ground gl ass changes, or result in an SAE, the pulmonary  events 
shoul d be treated ac cording to Table 6in Section 13.1.3.1.2 (Pneumonit is).

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 57of10413.1.3.1.2 Pneumonitis
Pneumo nitis and interstit ial lung disease are known side effects of TKIs used in NSCLC, 
generally occurring later in the course of therapy . Crizotinib has been as sociated wi th severe, 
life-threatening, or fatal treatment -related pneum onitis in clinical trials wit h a frequency o f 4 in 
255 (1.6%) patients ( XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc. ). Other TKIs used in the treatment of 
NSCLC have simi lar adverse reactions. Drug -related pneum onitis may be associ ated wi th signs 
and symptoms such as dy spnea, hypoxia, cough, hemopty sis, and fever as well as radio logic 
evidence of parenchymal or interstit ial changes. 
The di agnosis of pneumo nitis and determ ination of causal relat ionship to the drug is often 
confounded by the underlying disease (especially lymphangit ic carcino matosi s) and other factors 
such as lung infection and radiat ion effect due to non -specific signs and symptoms as well as 
similar radio logical appearance. Pneumo nitis should be suspected when such signs and 
symptoms develop or in asymptomat ic patients when a new ground glass opacit y or interstitial 
infiltrat ion is noted in imaging studies. If a patient is considered to have the potential d iagnosis 
of drug -related pneumo nitis, physical examinat ion, assessment of oxy gen saturati on, evaluati on 
for infecti ous eti ologies, and thoracentesis, bronchoscopy , or open l ung bi opsy shoul d be 
considered to reach a diagnosis. If the causalit y is at least possibly related to the study  drug, 
management of pneumo nitis, including dose interruption and potential discont inuat ion, as 
presented in Table 6(during first 7 day s of treatment pri or to escalation to 180 mg QD) and
Table 7(after escalation to 180 mg QD), is required.

13.1.3.1.4 Management of Additional Selected Treatment -Related Adverse Events
Hypertension
Blood pressure shoul d be m onitored and recorded at each visit. Hy pertensio n detected by  at least 
2blood pressure measurements should be graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0, which defines
hypertensio n as a disorder characterized by  a pathol ogical increase in blood pressure: a repeated 
elevation in the blood pressure exceeding 140 mmHg for sy stolic and over 90 mmHg for 
diastolic. For patients who either develop hypertension or experience wo rsening hypertensio n 
during treatment with study  drug, at the discretion of the invest igator, aggressive 
antihypertensive medicat ion shoul d be ini tiated or optimized to achieve target blood pressure 
before interruption or dose reduction of the study  drug. If hypertensio n is persistent despite 
adequate antihypertensive therapy— including titration of antihypertensive medication or 
introducti on of  addi tional antihypertensive medications —or if grade 4 hypertensio n develops, 
dose interruption and reduction is re commended according to Dose Modificat ion Guidelines for 
general nonhematologic AEs in
 Table 5andTable 8.
Bradycardia
Heart rate should be monitored and recorded at each visit. Brigatinib should be avoided in 
combinat ion with other agents known to cause brady cardia (e.g., beta -blockers, non -
dihydropy ridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) to the extent pos sible. For 
symptom atic bradycardia, dose interruption and reduction is recommended according to Table 5
andTable 8.
Nausea and Emesis
Nausea should be treated with standard -of-care anti -emet ics. Prophylact ic ant -emet ics may be 
used.
Diarrhea
For grade 1 diarrhea, sympto matic care such as loperamide (Imodium®, McNEIL -PPC, Inc.) may 
be given, or no intervent ion may be undertaken, according to the investigator’s clinical 
judgment. For grade 2 diarrhea, administer loperamide at 4 mg, then 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours 
until the patient is symptom -free for 12 hours. No dose modificat ion is necessary unless the 
patient does not tol erate bri gatinib or the symptom recurs. For grade ≥3 despite loperamide,

have experienced diarrhea with brigat inib treatment is allowed. Other medicat ions and 
supportive care may be added according to the institut ion’s standard of care. 
Visual Disturbance
In pati ents wi th new onset or worsening severe (grade ≥3) v isual disturbance, ophthalmo logical  
evaluat ion shoul d be perform ed. Visual  disturbance shoul d be m anaged as described in Table 5
and Table 8(under Nonhematologic Toxicit y).
13.1.3.2 Management and Dose Modification Recommendations for Treatment -Related 
Adverse Events in Patients Receiving Crizotinib (Arm B)
13.1.3.2.1 Management of Selected Adverse Events
Hepatotoxicity
Drug -induced hepatotoxicit y with fatal outcom e has occurred in pat ients treated with crizotinib. 
These cases have occurred during crizotinib treatment in less than 1% of patients in clinical 
trials. Con current elevat ions in ALT greater than 3×ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2×ULN 
without elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% patients in clinical 
trials. Grade 3 and 4 elevations in liver funct ion tests were generally revers ible upon dosing 
interrupti on. When hepatotoxicit y occurs, cri zotinib should be temporarily suspended, dose 
reduced, or permanent ly discont inued as described in Table 9.
Interstitial Lung Disease
Severe, life -threatening, or fatal interstit ial lung disease (ILD)/pneumo nitis can occur in pat ients 
treated with crizotinib. These cases generally occurred within 2 mo nths after the init iation of
treatm ent. Pati ents shoul d be m onitored f or pulm onary symptom s indicative o f ILD/pneumo nitis. 
Other potential causes of ILD/pneumo nitis should be excluded, and crizotinib should be 
discontinued in patients diagnosed with drug -related ILD/pneumo nitis.
QT P rolongation
QTc prol ongat ion can occur in patients treated with crizotinib. Crizotinib should be avo ided in 
patients wi th congeni tal long QT syndrom e. Cri zotinib shoul d be discont inued in pat ients who 
develop QTc greater than 500 msec or greater than or eq ual to 60 msec change fro m baseline 
with Torsade de poi ntes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms o f serious 
arrhy thmia. Cri zotinib shoul d be wi thheld in pat ients who develop QTc greater than 500 msec on 
at least 2 separate ECGs until re covery  to a QTc l ess than or equal to 480 msec, then resumed at 
a reduced dose as described in Table 9.
Bradycardia
Symptom atic bradycar dia can occur in patients treated with crizotinib. Crizotinib should be 
avoided in combinat ion with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g., beta -blockers, non -
dihydropy ridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) to the extent possible. H eart 
rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly . Symptom atic bradycardia should be 
managed as described in Table 9.

If brigatinib treatment interruption lasts ≥14 day s, and pri or dose was >90 mg QD, patients 
shoul d resume treatment at 90 mg QD for 7 day s, before escalat ing dose back to 120 mg QD or 
180 mg QD. The dose should not be escalated higher than the prior dose level before treatment 
interrupti on.
13.1.5 Re-Escalation after Dose Modification
Re-escalat ion after dose modificat ion for adverse events is discouraged. However, if in the 
opinio n of the treatin g investi gator re -escalat ion is warranted, this must be undertaken after 
consultation wit h the sponsor. To be a candidate for re -escalat ion, the AE that led to dose 
modificati on must not have recurred, and no other AEs of grade 3 or 4 must have been observ ed 
during the preceding 28 days. 
Prior and Concomitant Treatment(s)/Therapy 13.2
History  of prior cancer therapy  will be recorded at screening, and concomitant cancer therapy  
will be recorded during the study  on the appropri ate eCRF for each pat ient.
Reasonabl e efforts will  be made to collect information on all prior cancer therapy  received by  the 
patient (e.g., surgeries, chemotherapy , radi otherapy , immunotherapy , biologics). The inform ation 
must be obtained from the patient’s medical chart and recorded on the appropri ate eCRF.
Palliat ive therapy and supportive care are permitted during the study for management of 
symptoms and underlying medical condit ions that may develop during the study . Once a pati ent 
has begun treatment, a condit ion may arise that requires the initiation of a new conco mitant 
treatm ent. Pati ents wi th CNS l esions requi ring local radiotherapy  such as SRS are allowed to 
continue study  drug after appropriate interruption, as determined by  the invest igator with sponsor 
agreem ent; however, for ana lysis purposes, these patients will be considered to have PD. 
Concomitant medicat ions for all ongoing medical  history  condi tions or AEs m ust be reported 
from the date the informed consent is signed unt il at least the 30 Days After Last Dose 
assessments, a nd for all conco mitant m edicat ions rel ated to seri ous or study  drug -related 
toxicities unt il the medicat ion is no longer taken or until pat ient contact discontinues.

Potential Drug Interactions 13.4
Brigatinib
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that cy tochrom e P450 (CYP) 2C8 and 
CYP3A4 are invo lved in the human metabo lism of brigatinib. Medicat ions and dietary  
(grapefrui t-containing products) or herbal products (St John’s Wort) that are strong inhibitors or 
inducers o f CYPs, in particular, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4, should be avo ided (see Appendix D).
Brigatinib is not a reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5, 
with IC 50values of >70 μM. Bri gatinib is also not a metabolism -dependent or a time -dependent 
inhibitor of the CYPs tested. Hence, drug -drug interacti ons (DDIs) due to inhibit ion of CYPs by 
brigatinib are unlikely.
Crizotinib (XALKORI®USPI, Pfizer, Inc .) 
Crizotinib is predo minant ly metabo lized by CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of crizotinib wit h 
strong CYP3A inhibitors increases crizotinib plasma concentrations. Avo id conco mitant use of 
strong CYP3A inhibitors, including, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithro mycin, indinavir, 
itraconazo le, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telit hromycin, 
troleando mycin, and voriconazole. Avo id grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may also increase 
plasma concentrati ons of  crizotinib. Exercise caut ion with conco mitant use of m oderate CYP3A 
inhibitors.
Crizotinib inhibits CYP3A both in vitro and in vivo . Coadministration of crizotinib wit h strong 
CYP3A inducers decreases crizoti nib plasma concentrations .Avoid conco mitant use of strong 
CYP3A inducers, including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenyto in, 
rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John's Wort.
Avoid conco mitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow thera peuti c range, including, but not 
limited, to alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimo zide, 
quinidine, siro limus, and tacrolimus in patients taking crizotinib. If conco mitant use of these 
CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeut ic range is required in patients taking crizotinib, dose 
reducti ons of the CYP3A substrates may be required due to adverse reactions.
In vitro studies in human hepatocy tes have indicated that crizotinib may induce pregnane X 
receptor (PXR) -and constitutiv e androstane receptor (CAR) -regul ated enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, UGT1A1). Caution should be exercised in administering 
crizotinib in co mbination wit h medicinal products that are predominant ly metabo lized by these 
enzymes. The effect iveness of conco mitant administration of oral contraceptives may be 
reduced.

14 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
Adverse Events 14.1
14.1.1 Adverse Event Definition
An AE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence in a pati ent or c linical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including

ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AP26113 -13-301
Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 69of104an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated wi th the use of a 
medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any worsening of 
a preexist ing condit ion which is temporally  associated wi th the use of the study  drug (i .e., occurs 
after the first dose of study  drug) is also an AE.
Adverse Events include:
● Abnorm al test findings, according to the following criteria:
o Test resul ts associ ated wi th accom panying symptoms that are considered 
clinically significant in the opinio n of the invest igator.
o Test resul ts that requi re addi tional diagnosti c testing (other than merely repeat ing 
an abnormal test) or medical/surgical intervent ion.
o Test resul ts that l ead to a change in study  drug dosing or di scont inuat ion from the 
study , significant addi tional conc omitant drug treatment, or other therapy .
o Test resul ts consi dered to be an AE by  the invest igator or sponsor.
● Changes in physical examinat ion findings
● Other untoward medical events, regardless of their relat ionship to the study  drug, such as 
injury , events that require surgery , accidents, or apparent ly unrelated illnesses, and
● Hypersensi tivity
Addit ionally , AEs m ay include signs or symptoms result ing from:
● Drug overdose (events occurring from a medicat ion error or overdose of a product or 
products whether a ccidental  or intent ional)
● Drug withdrawal
● Drug abuse
● Drug misuse
● Drug interactions
● Drug dependency
● Exposure during breastfeeding
● Exposure in utero
14.1.2 Performing Adverse Events Assessments
All observed or volunteered AEs, regardless of treatment group or suspe cted causal  relationship 
to the invest igational product(s), will be reported, as described in the fo llowing sect ions. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain informat ion adequate to determine the 
outcom e of the AE and to assess whether it mee ts the cri teria for classificat ion as a serious AE 
(SAE; see Sect ion14.2.1 ) requiring immediate notificat ion to ARIAD Pharmaceut icals, Inc. 
(ARIAD) or its designated representative.
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AP26113 -13-301
Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 70of10414.1.3 Reporting Period
All AEs (serious and non -serious) shoul d be recorded on the AE eCRF for all pat ients beginning 
at the time of signing the informed consent form and concluding 30 days following the l ast dos e 
of the assigned study  drug in the study  or the investigator/patient decisio n to discont inue 
treatm ent, whi chever occurs later. 
Once a pat ient is deemed a screen failure, AE collection is no longer required (see Secti on11.3).
Any ongoing AEs (serious and non- serious) af ter the reporting period should be followed unt il 
they resolve to baseline, stabilize, or are considered to be chronic/irreversible. 
New SAEs after reporting period: There is no requirement to monitor subjects for SAEs after end 
of study . Inves tigators in the European Economic Area (EEA) are obligated to report SAEs that 
they become aware of to the sponsor even after the reporting period (reference European 
Commissio n CT -3 Section 4.4). Invest igators outside the jurisdict ion of the EEA are encouraged 
to report SAEs after the reporting period.
14.1.4 Adverse Event Severity
The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE v4.0 (see Appendix Aand the 
Study  Reference Manual). If the AE is not defined in the CTCAE, the invest igator will determine 
the severit y of the AE based on the fo llowing definit ions:
 Mild (grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine 
activity;
 Moderate (grade 2):The AE interferes with routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic 
therapy  or rest;
 Severe (grade 3):The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine 
activit ies despite symptomat ic therapy;
 Life-Threatening (grade 4):The patient is at immediate risk of death;
 Death (grade 5):The patient dies as a direct result of the complicat ion or condit ion 
induced by  the AE.
14.1.5 Causality
The invest igator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious). An invest igator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists 
a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug (i .e., brigat inib or crizotinib) caused or contributed to 
the AE. 
In addit ion, if the invest igator determines an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relat ionship in the source documents and on the SAE form 
and report such an assessment in accordance wit h the SAE reporting requirements. 
The invest igator will use medical c onsiderati on and use the following categories of causalit y to 
determine the relatedness of an AE with the study  drug based on the fo llowing definit ions. Not 
all criteria in each category  of relatedness m ust be present.

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 72of10414.1.6 Expectedness
The expectedness of an SAE is assessed by the sponsor in the overall classificat ion of SAEs for 
regul atory  reportabili ty. The Investigator Brochure secti on “Summary of Data and Guidance for 
the Invest igator” will be used as the reference for determinat ion of expectedness and risk 
assessment for brigat inib. The current SmPC for Xalkori (crizotinib) will be used as the 
reference safet y informat ion for determinat ion of expectedness for crizotinib.
Serious Adverse Events 14.2
The definit ions and repor ting requirements of ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safet y Data 
Management, Definit ions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A, will be fo llowed. 
14.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Definition
The invest igator or the sponsor may determine the seriousness of an AE based on the fo llowing:
An AE is considered an SAE if at least one of the following condit ions applies:
 Death: An AE that results in death is any pat ient death wi thin 30 days of the last dose of 
study  drug administrati on. The cause of death or AE that r esulted in a fatal  outcom e is the 
SAE.
 Life-threatening AE: An AE that places the patient, in the view of the invest igator or the 
sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., this does not 
include an event that had it occurred i n a m ore severe form  might have caused death)
 Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions : Any substant ial disrupti on of  a person’s abilit y to conduct 
norm al life f unctions
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: Hospitalization 
refers to admission o f a pati ent into a hospi tal for any  length of time.
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect: A fixed, permanent impairment established at or 
before birth
 Cancer:Occurrence or diagnosis of a new cancer during the study  is considered an SAE; 
a new cancer is a cancer that is histopathologically different than the cancer under study 
in the study  (i.e., does not include metastatic or progressive disease)
 Important medical event: Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in 
determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalizat ion. However, if it is 
determ ined that the event may jeopardize the patient and/or may require intervent ion to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above, the important medical 
events shoul d be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalizat ion; or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 73of10414.2.1.1 Progression of the Malignancy Under Study (including signs and symptoms of 
progression)
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  shoul d be reported as AEs in 
the appropriate section of the eCRF. Disease progressio n assessed by measurement of malignant 
lesions on radi ographs or other methods should not be r eported as an AE. 
14.2.1.2 Hospitalizations
Adverse events (reported from clinical studies) that require hospitalizat ion or prolongat ion of 
hospi talizati on are considered serious. Any init ial admissio n (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healt h care facilit y meets t hese criteria. Adverse events that require emergency room care that do 
not resul t in hospital admissio n are not SAEs unless assessed by the invest igator to be an 
important medical event. Hospitalization does not include the fo llowing:
 Hospice facilit ies
 Respite care
 Skilled nursing facilit ies
 Nursing homes
 Routine emergency room admissio ns, and
 Same day  surgeri es (as outpati ent/same day /ambulatory  procedure)
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion in the absence of a precipitating AE is not in 
itself an SAE. Examples include:
 Social admissi on (e.g., pati ent has no pl ace to sleep)
 Protocol -specified admissio n during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by the 
study  protocol )
 Optional admissi on not associ ated wi th a preci pitating AE (e.g., for elective cosmet ic 
surgery  that was pl anned pri or to study  enrollment [appropriate documentation is 
requi red for these cases])
 Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion for scheduled therapy o f the target 
malignancy of the study  is not c onsidered an SAE
14.2.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs m ust be reported (see Section 14.2.4 for the period of observat ion) 
by the investi gator to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance depart ment or designee wit hin 
24hours of becoming aware of the event. This will be done by transmitt ing an electronic data 
capture (EDC) SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feas ible, then a 
facsimile of the co mpleted Takeda paper -based SAE form will be sent. In case of fax, site 
personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n of all pages and include an e -mail address on 
the fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of receipt can be returned via e -mail wit hin 1 
business day. A sample of the paper -based SAE form and processing direct ions are in the Study  
Manual. Information in the SAE report or form must be consistent with the data provided on the 
eCRF.

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 74of10414.2.3 Information to be Provide d by the Investigator for a Serious Adverse Event
The sponsor or designee will require all of the fo llowing informat ion about the patient and the 
event:
 Invest igator ident ificat ion
 Patient identificat ion code (e.g., sex, age, or date of birth)
 Inform ation on study  drug (e.g., start/stop date, dose and frequency  of study  drug 
administered)
 Descript ion of event
In addit ion to the above information, the sponsor will require the invest igator’s assessment of the 
following:
 Severit y of the SAE 
 Relationship of th e SAE to the study  drug
 Outcom e of the SAE 
14.2.4 Follow -up Information on a Serious Adverse Event
The invest igator may be asked to provide addit ional informat ion for any  event submi tted, which 
may include a discharge summary or extracts from the medical record. Informat ion provi ded 
about the event must be consistent with informat ion recorded on the electronic study  case report 
forms (eCRF) where safet y data m ay also be recorded (e.g., AE CRF). The investigator is 
responsible for management of the patients throug h the course of the event. There should be 
routi ne follow-up through and including a minimum 30 days after the l ast administration o f study  
drug or the invest igator/patient decisio n to di scont inue treatment, whichever occurs later, in all 
patients in order to monitor for the occurrence of SAEs. If an SAE continues after the 30 -day 
evaluat ion peri od, then the pat ient must be fo llowed until the event resolves or stabilizes wit hout 
further invo lvement expected. The sponsor’s medical mo nitor may specify a l onger peri od of  
time if required to assure the safet y of the patient.
14.2.5 Expedited Reporting of Suspected Unexpected and Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs)
ARIAD, as study  sponsor, i s responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected and serious adverse 
reacti ons ( SUSARs) invo lving the study drug to all regulatory authorit ies and participating 
investigators in accordance wit h ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory  requi rements, as 
applicable. In addit ion, ARIAD, or authorized designee, will be responsible for the su bmissio n of 
safet y letters to central independent ECs (IECs).
The sponsor will notify invest igators of all reportable SAEs. This notification will be in the form 
of an expedited safet y report. Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and 
retain the notice with other study- related docum entati on.
The invest igator and IRB/EC will determine whether the informed consent requires revisio n. The 
investigator should also comply wit h the IRB/EC procedures for reporting any other safet y 
inform ation.

Other Safety Issues 14.3
14.3.1 Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
Female pat ients of childbearing potential and fert ile male patients will be informed as to the 
potenti al risk of  concepti on while parti cipat ing in this study  and will be advised that they  must 
use highly effect ive contraception listed below (i.e., results in a low failure rate when used 
consistent ly and correctly ) during the dosing peri od and for a period of at least 4 months after the 
end of treatment with brigat inib and at l east 3 m onths after the end of treatment with crizotinib. 
Highly effective method s include: 
intrauterine device (IUD)
bilateral  tubal  occl usion
vasectomised partner
sexual abst inence
Adequate contraception during and after treatment with crizotinib and brigat inib should be used 
as oral  contracepti ves may  be ineffective. A pregnancy te st will be performed on each pre -
menopausal female pat ient of childbearing potential immediately prior to the first dose of study 
drug, once every  three cycles while on treatment, and again at treatment discontinuation during 
the End -of-Treatment vi sit. A negat ive pregnancy test must be documented prior to 
administration of study  drug.
If a patient is confirmed pregnant during the study , study  drug administration must be 
discontinued immediately . The investi gator m ust immediately  notify  the sponsor m edical 
monitor of  this event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy  Form. Initial information 
regarding a pregnancy must be immediately forwarded to ARIAD Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management or i ts desi gnated representative.
The invest igator must immediately report follow -up informat ion to the sponsor regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, regardless of whether the 
patient has discont inued participation in the study. If the pregnancy result s in the birth of a child, 
additional follow-up inform ation may be requested. If the pregnancy result s in spontaneous 
aborti on or stillbirth, the event should be reported as an SAE.
Pregnancy outcomes also must be collected for the female partners of any male pat ients who 
took study  drug in this study . Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
shoul d be obtained from the female partner.
It is not known whether brigat inib passes into the breast milk. Mothers should not breastfeed 
while receiving study  drug.

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 76of10414.3.2 Overd ose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional ingest ion or i nfusing o f any dose of study  
drug that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. 
All overdoses should be recorded on the Overdose Form and forwarded to ARIAD 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management, or its designated representative, within 24 hours. An 
overdose should be reported even if it does not result in an AE. If an overdose result s in an AE, 
the AE should be reported on the AE eCRF. The dose administered should be documented on the 
Study  Drug Administration eCRF. 
15 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
General Considerations 15.1
Descript ive statistics (such as means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges for continuous 
data and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize patient characterist ics, study

crizotinib.
Analysis Populations 15.2
Intent –to-Treat (ITT) Population : The ITT populat ion includes all pat ients rando mized to each 
regimen regardless of whether they  are ALK+ by  the Vysis® ALK Break Apart fluorescence in 
situ hybridizati on (FISH) Probe Kit or the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay , or a l ocal test other 
than FISH and IHC, or whether they  rece ive study  drug or adhere to the assigned dose. The 
primary  analyses of efficacy  will be based on the ITT popul ation.
Treated population : The treated population for each regimen includes all pat ients receiving at 
least one dose of study  drug. 
Safety will b e analyzed using the treated populat ion.
Per-protocol population : The per-protocol population will exclude all pat ients in the treated 
popul ation who do not meet key  entry  criteria,have no measurable disease at baseline, or have 
no adequate post -baseline response assessment unless the reason is death or early  discontinuat ion 
due to disease progressi on. Addi tional analyses may  also be performed excluding patients who 
were not confirmed as ALK+ (locally or centrally ) by an FDA approved test.
Further criteria for the per -protocol population and the sensit ivity analyses of the primary  
endpo int and selected secondary  efficacy  endpoints using this population will be detailed in the 
statist ical analysis plan (SAP).

Secondary endpoints of the study include:
1. Confirmed ORR, as assessed by the BIRC, per RECIST v1.1
2. Confirmed intracranial ORR, as assessed by the BIRC
3. Intracranial PFS, as assessed by the BIRC
4. OS
5. Duration of response, as assessed by the BIRC
6. Time to response, as assessed by the BIRC
7. Disease control rate, as assessed by the BIRC
8. Safety and tolerability
9. Change from baseline scores in global health status/QOL assessed with the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 (v3.0), and time-to-deterioration in dyspnea assessed with the EORTC 
QLQ-LC13 (v3.0)
15.3.3 Exploratory Endpoints
Determination of Sample Size 15.4
For the purposes of this sample size calculation, th e median PFS for crizotinib is estimated as 
10 months ( Solomon et al, 2014 ). Approximately 270 patients will be randomized in a 
1:1 fashion to receive brigatinib or crizotinib. A total of 198 events (progression or death among 
the randomized patients) will provide 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful 6-month 
improvement in PFS (hazard ratio=0.625). This power projection is based on a 2-sided log-rank 
test and is controlled at the 2-sided 0.043 level, adjusting for the proposed interim analysis plan. 
The number of events is fixed, but the enrollment number may change based on an assessment of 
the overall event rate pooled across treatment groups (prior to the close of enrollment).

patients wi thout documented disease progression.
Secondary  efficacy endpo ints for this study  are defined as fo llows (unless otherwi se stated, 
secondary  efficacy endpoints of response will use BIRC assessments with sensit ivity anal yses 
perform ed using the investigator assessments ):
 Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of the patients who are confirmed to have 
achieved CR or PR using RECIST v1.1 in the ITT populat ion. 
 Confirmed intracranial ORR is defined as the proportion of the pati ents who have 
achieved CR or PR in the CNS per RECIST v1.1 in rando mized pat ients with intracranial 
CNS m etastases at baseline. 
 Intracranial PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of rando mizat ion unt il the 
first date at which CNS di sease progressi on is obj ectively docum ented, or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurs first. In tracrani al PFS will be assessed in pat ients with and 
without intracranial CNS metastases at baseline. It will be censored at the last disease 
assessment for pati ents wi thout docum ented CNS di sease progressi on.
 Time to response is defined as the time interval from the date randomization unt il the 
initial observation o f CR or PR.

met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that PD is object ively 
docum ented. 
 Disease control  rate is defined as the proportion of rando mized patients who have 
achieved CR, PR, or SD (in the case of SD, criteria for SD must have been met at least 
once after randomizat ion at a minimum interval of 6 weeks) after randomization. 
 OS is defined as the time interval fro m the date of rando mizat ion unt il death due to any 
cause in the ITT populat ion. It will be censored on the date of last con tact for those 
patients who are alive.
Censoring for time -to-event efficacy endpo ints will be detailed in the SAP. 
15.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
The primary  analysis of the primary  endpoint will be perform ed using a 2 -sided stratified 
log-rank test (stratificat ion factors: presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline [Yes 
versus No], and prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease [Yes versus No])
to com pare the BIRC -assessed PFS of pat ients randomized to brigat inib with the BIRC -assessed 
PFS of patients rando mized to crizotinib. The overall (2 -sided) Ty peI error rate will be 
controlled at 0.05. The primary  analysis will  be based on the ITT populat ion. PFS will be 
estimated for each treatment arm using the Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier, 1958 ). 
Addit ionally , hazard rati os will  be estimated using the Cox regression model wit h the 
stratificat ion factors as covariates.

ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AP26113 -13-301
Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 79of104Sensit ivity analyses of the primary endpo int of PFS will also be performed in the fo llowing 
popul ations:
 Per-protocol populat ion, as assessed by the BIRC
 FDA approved ALK test populat ion, as assessed by the BIRC
 ITT populat ion (all pat ients randomized to a treatment arm), as assessed by the 
investigator. 
Subgroup analy ses will  be perform ed by baseline potential prognostic factors.
Two interim analyses are planned after approximately 50% and 75% of the total expected events 
(progression or death) have been observed. An O’Brien -Fleming Lan -DeMets ( DeMets and Lan, 
1994) al pha spending funct ion will be used to control the overall alpha level at 0.05 2-sided.
The first interim analysis will be performed after the first 99 events have been observed. The 
primary  endpoint of PFS will be tested at a 2 -sided al pha l evel of 0.0042. A second interim 
analysis will be performed after 149 events and the primary endpo int will be tested at a 2 -sided 
alpha level  of 0.0194. The primary  analysis of the primary  endpoint will be performed after 
198events have been observed or at End -of-Study ,whichever comes first , and will be tested at a 
2-sided alpha level o f 0.043. Analyses of OS will also be performed at the time of  the interim 
analysis and at 
End-of-Study, if the pr imary endpoint is met. If the efficacy  boundary  is 
surpassed at an interim analysis, pati ents will  remain on assigned treatments unless a survival 
advantage is noted.
15.5.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
Confirmed ORR will be analyzed with the Mantel -Haenszel test (using the stratification factors) 
on the ITT populat ion to com pare the proporti on of  patients achieving object ive response 
between the 2 treatm ent arms. 
Confirmed intracranial ORR will be analyzed with the Mantel -Haenszel test (using the 
stratificat ion factors) on the subset of subjects with intracranial CNS metastase s at baseline, to 
compare the proportion of pat ients achieving intracranial object ive response between the 
2treatm ent arms. 
Intracranial PFS will be based on the populat ion of pati ents wi th intracranial CNS metastases at 
baseline and analyzed using a 2 -sided stratified log -rank test. Intracranial PFS will be est imated 
using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod. 
Time -to-response and duration of response will be performed on the subset of patients who 
achieve object ive response, using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod. 
Disease control  rate will be analyzed with the Mantel -Hanzel test (using the stratification factors) 
on the ITT populat ion to com pare the proportion of pat ients achieving object ive response and 
CR, PR, or stable disease ≥6weeks, between the 2 treatm ent arm s. 
The primary  analysis of the secondary  endpoint of OS will be performed using a 2- sided 
stratified log -rank test on the ITT populat ion. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method. Addit ional sensit ivity analyses to characterize the impact of patients in Arm B who 
crossover to brigat inib will be performed and documented in the SAP.

Version 4.0 12 May 2020 Page 80 o f104For the secondary efficacy endpoints, subgroup analyses will be performed by baseline potential 
prognostic factors. 
The primary analysis of all secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed at the time of the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint.
Assuming a median OS of 30 months in the crizotinib arm, 150 events will provide 
approximately 20% power to demonstrate a 20% improvement (median OS of 36 months in the 
brigatinib arm), and approximately 14% power to demonstrate a 15% improvement (median OS 
of 34.5 months in the brigatin ib arm). The table below shows the approximate 95% confidence 
intervals for the hazard ratio for each scenario under the design assumptions.

Key secondary endpoints will be tested using a closed testing procedure to control the overall 
type error rate at 0.05. Analysis of a key secondary endpoint will be considered significant if the
test for that endpoint and comparisons of all other secondary endpoints with a smaller rank are 
significant at the two-sided 0.05 significance level.

15.5.5 Data Handling Ru les for Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
A patient will be considered as not evaluable for response at a protocol-specified time point if no 
imaging/measurement is done or only a subset of lesion measurements are made, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would 
not change the assigned time point response (i.e., if new lesions are documented). A patient will 
be considered to have a response if the criteria for response have been met at the CCI

response.
All patients will be assigned to one of the following best response categories: CR, PR, SD, PD, 
death prior to first disease assessment, or unknown (including no measurable disease at baseline, 
inevaluable post-baseline response, and no exposure to study drug after randomization). All 
patients whose best response is not CR or PR will be considered as non-responders in the 
calculation of ORR. Detailed data handling rules for efficacy outcomes as well as sensitivity 
analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
Safety Analysis 15.6
Safety assessments will include physical and laboratory examinations, vital signs, and ECGs.
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. 
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug will be evaluated for safety. For each 
treatment arm, the incidence rates of tr eatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), and serious treatment-emergent adverse events 
(SAEs) will be described by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System 
Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term. The frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, 
categorized by the maximum toxicity grades (sev erity), will also be described. Listings of 
laboratory test results and CTCAE grades will be generated, and descriptive statistics 
summarizing the changes in laboratory tes ts over time will be presented. 
Exposure to study drug over time will be summarized with time on treatment, total amount of 
administrated treatment, dose intensity and relative dose intensity.
15.6.1 Pharmacokin etic Analysis
Summary statistics for steady-state trough (pre-dose) levels will be computed. PK data will be 
used in an exposure-response analysis for safety and efficacy. Details will be provided in the 
SAP.
15.6.2 QTcF Analysis
Descriptive statistics of maximum QTcF and change from baseline will be calculated following 
the ICH-E14 guidelines: the proportion of treated patients with at least 1 on-drug QTcF value 
>450 msec, >480 msec, and >500 msec; and the proportion of treated patients with a maximum 
change in QTcF from baseline >30 msec and >60 msec. 
HRQoL Data Analysis 15.7
The main PRO endpoints of interest will be the Global Health Status/QoL Scale, based upon 
Question 29 and Question 30 , and the Dyspnea Scale, based on the QLQ-LC13 Questions 3-5 . 
The QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 (V3) Scoring Manual 
(Fayers et al, 2001)  including transformation of responses into scores for analysis and the 
handling of missing data. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (V3) Scoring Manual also includes instructions CCI

performed using mixed effects models that include randomized treatment group and the 
stratification factors used in randomization. Worsening on the Dyspnea Scale for a patient will 
be defined as a 50% decline from the baseline score. Time to worsening on the Dyspnea Scale 
will be analyzed using the same methods as for the primary analysis of PFS.
Protocol Deviations/Violations 15.9
To be protocol-compliant, a patient must not have any major protocol deviations during the study 
period. Major protocol deviations w ill be identified prior to database lock and will be listed in 
the clinical study report. 
The investigator should not deviate from the pr otocol, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will 
require deviation from protocol-specified procedure s, the investigator should consult with the 
sponsor or designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. 
There will be no exemptions (a prospectively approved deviation) from the inclusion or 
exclusion criteria.
The site should document all protocol deviations in the subject’s source documents. In the event 
of a significant deviation, the site should noti fy the sponsor or its designee (and IRB or EC, as 
required). Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessment. 
The sponsor will assess any protocol deviation; if it is likely to affect to a significant degree the 
safety and rights of a subject or the reliability and robustness of the data generated, it will be 
reported to regulatory authorities as a serious breach of GCP and the protocol.
16 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
The sponsor performs quality control and assurance checks on all clinical studies that it sponsors. 
Before enrolling any patients into this study, the sponsor personnel or its designee and the 
investigator will review the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, the eCRFs and instructions for 
their completion, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting 
AEs. A qualified representative of the sponsor will monitor the conduct of the study by visiting 
the site and by contacting the site by telephone. During the visits, information recorded in the 
eCRFs will be verified against source documents. The sponsor’s medical monitor will review the 
data for safety information. The sponsor’s clinical data associates or designees will review the 
data for completeness and logical consistency. Additionally, the sponsor’s clinical data 
associates will use automated validation programs to help identify missing data, selected CCI

of any individual assuming the investigator’s responsibilit ies. 
Study Monitoring 16.2
This study  will be m onitored by  representatives o f the sponsor. Site visits are made before the 
study  begins, at regul ar intervals during the study , and at the study  closeout. Comm unicati on by  
telephone, m ail, and e -mail may be used, as needed, to supplement site visits. The investigator 
and study  personnel  will cooperate wi th the sponsor, provide all appropriate docum entati on, and 
be available to discuss the study . The purpose of the site visits is to verify:
 Adherence to the protocol (the invest igator should document and explain any deviat ion 
from the approved protocol).
 The completeness and accuracy of the eCRFs and the dispensing and inventory  record 
(adequate time and space for these visits should be allocated by the invest igator).
 Com pliance wi th regul ations (the verificat ion will require comparison of the source 
docum ents to the eCRFs).

17.4.1 Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee (DMC), consist ing of 3 to 5 members not 
associ ated wi th the conduct of the study , will be established for this study . The committee will 
perform data review quarterly and meet at least twice y early  until  the final  analysis has been 
performed. Ad -hoc DMC meet ings may also be held if a significant issue should arise. 
The DMC will be responsible for evaluat ing the results of safet y analyses and will make 
recommendat ions to the sponsor. Efficacy data can also be request ed, if needed, to evaluate 
risk/benefit before making a recommendation; however, the trial will not be stopped early for 
positive efficacy . The DMC will operate under the DMC charter, which specifies the data to be 
included in each review, rules related to study modificat ion, and protection of the integrit y of the 
data. At each meet ing, the DMC will make reco mmendat ions to either continue the study

discontinuat ion of clinical development of the product). Study  docum ents shoul d be retained for 
a longer peri od if required by applicable regulatory requirements or by  agreement wi th the 
sponsor. Thereaf ter, records will not be destroy ed wi thout giving the sponsor prior written notice 
and the opportunit y to further store such records, at the sponsor’s cost and expense. 
Termination of Study 18.4
The sponsor may terminate the study  at a study  site or in i ts tot ality at any  time for any  of the 
following reasons:
 Failure to enroll pat ients
 Protocol  violations
 Inaccurate or inco mplete data
 Unsafe or unethical pract ices
 Quest ionable safet y of the study  drug
 Suspected lack o f efficacy of the study  drug; or
 Administrative decisio n
In the event of the terminat ion of the Study , by either the sponsor or an invest igator:
 The invest igator will return all study drugs and related study materials to the sponsor.
 A wri tten statem ent describing why  the study  was termin ated prem aturely  will be

cover the cost per included patient, based on the calculated costs of performing the study  
assessments in accordance with the protocol, and the specified terms of payment will be 
described in the contract. The contract should describe whether costs for pharmacy, laboratory , 
and other protocol -requi red services are being paid direct ly or indirectly. Prior to the start of the 
study , invest igators and sub -investigators will release sufficient and accurate information that 
permits the sponsor or sponsor -designated agent to determine that an investigator has no personal 
or professional financial incentive regarding the future approval or non -approval of the study  
drug that his/her research might be biased by such financial incentives. The financial informat ion 
is exclusive of agreements direct ly related to fees associated with the study  being conducted. All 
inform ation provi ded will be regarded as strict ly confidential and will only be disclosed to the 
respective regulatory  authori ty. 
20 PUBLICATION AND DISC LOSURE POLICY
The invest igator must notify the IRB/IEC of the conclusion o f the clinical study . Thi s report 
shoul d be made w ithin 3 months of the co mpletion or terminat ion of the study . The final report 
sent to the IRB/IEC should also be sent to the sponsor and, along with the completed eCRFs, 
constitutes the final summary to the sponsor, thereby fulfilling the invest igator’s r egulatory  
responsibilit y.

response evaluat ion criteria in so lid tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (versio n 1.1). Eu J 
Cancer 2009;45:228 - 247.
Choosing Target Lesions
• Select up to 5lesions (up to 2 per organ)
• Select largest reproducibly  measurable lesio ns
• If the largest lesio n cannot be measured reproducibly, select the next largest lesio n which can 
be
• Add up longest diameters (LD) of non -nodal  lesions (axial plane)
• Add short axis di ameters of nodes
• This is the “sum of the longest diameters” (SLD)
Non-Target Lesions
• All other sites of disease present at baseline and not classified as target lesio ns will be classified 
as non -target l esions, including any measurable le sions that were not chosen as target lesions
• It is possible to record mult iple non-target l esions involving the same organ as a single item on 
the eCRF (e.g., “mult iple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes”)
Determining Response
• Assess at baseline and on study  with consistent modalit ies (CT, MRI, PET/CT)
-Measure target lesions and calculate SLD
-Visually assess non -target l esions
-Search for new lesio ns
-Combine these assessments into the overall response

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 95of104Target Lesion Response
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions.
All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to <10 mm in short 
axis
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters
Progressive Disease (PD) SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study 
(including baseline, if that is the smallest)
The SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
(Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 mm, for example, does not 
qualify )
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD
Non-evaluable (NE) One or more lesions cannot be evaluated due to missing data or poor 
image quality unless a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point response (e.g., PD based on other findings)
Non-Target Lesion Response
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all extranodal non -target lesions
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)
Normalization of tumor marker level
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesions(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (Subjective 
judgment by experienced reader)
Unable to Evaluate (UE) One or more lesions cannot be evaluated due to missing data or poor 
image quality unless a convincing argument can be made that the
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point response (e.g., PD based on other findings)
New Lesions
• Shoul d be unequivocal and not attributable to differences in scanning technique or findings 
which may  not be a tumor (does not have to meet criteria to be “measurable”) 
• If a new lesio n is equivocal, continue to next time point. If confirmed then, PD is assessed at 
the date when the lesio n was first seen. 
• Lesio ns identified in anatomic locations not scann ed at baseline are considered new 
• New l esions on ul trasound shoul d be confirmed on CT or MRI

Amendment 03 Versi on 4.0 12 May  2020
Amendment #2, Protocol Version 3.0
The primary  secti ons of the protocol affected by  the changes in Amendment 2 are indicated. The 
corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol. 
Change #1 . Removed the exception for hormonal contraception fro m the list of prohibited 
concurrent medications and procedures; hormonal contraception is no longer allowed
The primary  change occurs in Section 13.3 Prohibited Treatment(s) Therapy :
Deleted text: “Any other systemi c anticancer therapy  including, but not limited to: 
chemotherapeut ic agents, immunotherapy , biological  response m odifiers 
(excluding
growth factors), radiotherapy , and/or systemic hormo nal therapy  (with the
exception of local therapies, such as SRS, used f or palliat ive or symptomat ic 
control  of exist ing lesions, wi th appropri ate treatment interruption at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator). Hormonal contracepti on is allowed.
Rationale for change : Brigatinib induces CYP3A in vitro and may decrease concentrat ions of 
CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives. Coadministration of brigat inib wit h 
horm onal contraceptives can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy  of hormonal 
contraceptives. 
Secti on 4 Protocol  Synopsis also contains this change.
Change #2 : Removed all forms of hormonal contraception fro m the list of highly  effect ive 
contraception methods.
The primary change occurs in Sect ion 14.3.1 13.3 Pregnancy and Breast feeding.
Deleted text: 
combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibit ion of ovulation:
ooral
ointravaginal
otransderm al
progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation:

CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives. Coadministration of brigat inib wit h 
horm onal contraceptives can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy  of hormonal 
contraceptives. 
Change #3 : Added new protocol deviation language.
The primary  change occurs in Section 15.9 Protocol Deviat ions/Vio lations: 
Added text: The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study  subjects. Should other unexpected 
circumstances arise that will require deviat ion from protocol -specified 
procedures, the i nvest igator should consult with the sponsor or designee (and IRB 
or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio n or 
exclusio n criteria.
The site should docum ent all  protocol  deviat ions in the subject’s source 
docum ents. In the event of a significant deviation, the site should notify  the 
sponsor or its designee (and IRB or EC, as required). Significant deviat ions 
include, but are not limited to, those tha t invo lve fraud or misconduct, increase the 
healt h risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study  assessment. 
The sponsor will assess any protocol deviat ion; if it is likely to affect to a 
significant degree the safet y and ri ghts of  a subject or the reliabilit y and 
robustness of the data generated, it will be reported to regulatory  authori ties as a 
serious breach of GCP and the protocol.
Rationale for Change : Addit ional protocol  deviatio n language was added per the sponsor’s 
updated tem plate.

Version 4.0 12May 20 20 Page 104of1044. Amended wording regarding possible addit ional drug- drug interactions with crizotinib 
andthe possibilit y that the effect iveness of oral contraceptives may be reduced while 
taking crizotinib
5. Amended the recommendations and requirements for monitoring of visio n dysfunct ion 
during treatment with brigat inib and crizotinib and management of visual loss during 
treatm ent wi th crizotinib and visual disturbance during treatment with brigat inib
6. Clarified that pati ents will cont inue to receive study drug until discont inuat ion
7. Clarified the timing of study  procedures:
a. that imaging by  com puted tom ography  (CT) or m agnet ic resonance imaging 
(MRI) shoul d continue until the end of treatment, rather than disease progression, 
as some patients may remain on treatment after progressive disease (PD) 
b. that addi tional pregnancy testing should be performed if recommend ed or 
requi red per l ocal guidelines or regul ations
8. Clarified inclusi on cri terion #1, that pati ents wi th locally advanced or recurrent
Stage IIIB non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may  be included in the study
9. Modified inclusio n criterion #5 to specify that >grade 1 alopecia or peripheral 
neuropathy  related to pri or anti cancer therapy  are all owed if deemed i rreversible
10. Clarified that baseline laboratory tests that need to be repeated on Cy cle 1 Day  1 
(because screening laboratory  tests were performed >7 days prior to the first dose) 
shoul d be obtained before starting treatment
11. Clarified administrative informat ion and processes:
a. the process for invest igator reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs)
b. the process regarding review and approval of protocol amendme nts
c. amended the sponsor contact and signatory  informati on
12. Corrected some ty pographical  and grammat ical errors and inconsistencies throughout 
the protocol
13. Updated Appendix E (Drugs with a Risk of Torsades de Pointes) to be based on a

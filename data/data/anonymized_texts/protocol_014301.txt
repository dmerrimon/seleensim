Introduction
 
 
Cigarette
 
smoking
 
is
 
the
 
leading
 
cause
 
of
 
preventable
 
death
 
and
 
illness
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
and
 
throughout
 
the
 
developed
 
world.
 
Recent
 
work
 
suggests
 
detrimental
 
links
 
between
 
exposure
 
to
 
point-of-sale
 
tobacco
 
marketing
 
(POSTM),
 
increases
 
in
 
cigarette
 
cravings,
 
and
 
the
 
failure
 
to
 
quit
 
smoking.
 
Understanding
 
how
 
individuals
 
are
 
influenced
 
by
 
and
 
react
 
to
 
environmental
 
cues
 
when
 
making
 
health
 
decisions
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
cancer
 
control
 
efforts
 
and
 
policymaking.
 
We
 
propose
 
to
 
use
 
an
 
innovative
 
set
 
of
 
methods
 
to
 
test
 
whether
 
repeated,
 
real-world
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
affects
 
smoking
 
behavior,
 
and
 
whether
 
this
 
is
 
mediated
 
by
 
changes
 
in
 
craving
 
and
 
neural
 
responses
 
to
 
POSTM.
 
Our
 
approach
 
combines
 
mobile-phone
 
based
 
geolocation
 
tracking,
 
ecological
 
momentary
 
assessment
 
(EMA),
 
and
 
functional
 
magnetic
 
resonance
 
imaging
 
(fMRI).
 
Research
 
using
 
geospatial
 
location
 
tracking
 
and
 
surveys
 
suggests
 
that
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
may
 
increase
 
craving;
 
however,
 
correlational
 
studies
 
preclude
 
causal
 
inferences
 
about
 
POSTM
 
effects.
 
Relatedly,
 
laboratory
 
studies
 
have
 
documented
 
neural
 
and
 
behavioral
 
reactivity
 
to
 
standardized
 
visual
 
smoking
 
cues,
 
such
 
as
 
photographs
 
of
 
cigarettes
 
in
 
an
 
ashtray,
 
but
 
the
 
brain’s
 
response
 
to
 
naturalistic
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
explored.
 
By
 
adding
 
the
 
ecological
 
validity
 
of
 
observational
 
field
 
methods
 
to
 
the
 
mechanistic
 
insight
 
of
 
neuroimaging,
 
and
 
causal
 
inferences
 
from
 
an
 
experimental
 
pre-post
 
design,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
significantly
 
advance
 
actionable
 
insight
 
about
 
POSTM
 
effects
 
in
 
cancer
 
control.
 
 
 
1.1
 
Background
 
and
 
Relevant
 
Literature
 
 
 
Summary:
 
The
 
tobacco
 
industry
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
rely
 
increasingly
 
on
 
point-of-sale
 
tobacco
  
marketing
 
(POST-M),
 
with
  
large
 
displays
 
near
 
cash
 
registers
 
in
 
retail
 
outlets
 
such
 
as
 
convenience
 
stores
 
and
 
gas
 
stations
 
[1].
 
Recent
  
work
 
utilizing
 
geospatial
 
location
 
tracking
 
has
 
found
 
that
 
smoking
 
V2025-06
 

 
lapses
 
while
 
smokers
 
are
 
trying
 
to
  
quit
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
on
 
days
 
when
 
smokers
 
are
 
exposed
 
to
 
POST-M,
 
particularly
 
when
 
their
 
general
  
tobacco
 
craving
 
levels
 
are
 
otherwise
 
low
 
[2].
 
This
 
suggests
 
that
 
POST-M
 
exposure
 
may
 
increase
 
craving,
  
making
 
abstinence
 
more
 
difficult.
 
This
 
finding
 
converges
 
with
 
recent
 
survey
 
results
 
demonstrating
 
that
  
during
 
quit
 
attempts,
 
a
 
significant
 
percentage
 
of
 
smokers
 
experience
 
urges
 
to
 
purchase
 
cigarettes
 
when
  
exposed
 
to
 
POST-M,
 
and
 
feel
 
that
 
the
 
removal
 
of
 
POST-M
 
would
 
make
 
quitting
 
easier
 
[3].
 
These
 
reports
  
indicating
 
that
 
incidental
 
exposure
 
to
 
cigarette
 
cues
 
adversely
 
affects
 
smoking
 
abstinence
 
are
 
supported
  
by
 
laboratory
 
studies.
 
A
 
typical
 
laboratory
 
cue
 
reactivity
 
paradigm
 
involves
 
presenting
 
participants
 
with
 
pictures
 
or
 
video
 
of
  
smoking
 
cues,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
hand
 
holding
 
a
 
cigarette,
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
measurement
 
of
 
participants'
 
craving
  
intensity.
 
Smoking
 
abstinence
 
has
 
been
 
found
 
to
 
potentiate
  
self-reported
 
craving
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
cigarette
 
cues
 
[4-7,8],
  
suggesting
 
a
 
mechanism
 
for
 
the
 
finding
 
that
 
exposure
 
to
 
POST-M
 
during
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt
 
leads
 
to
 
poorer
  
outcomes.
 
No
 
studies,
 
however,
 
have
 
experimentally
 
manipulated
 
exposure
 
to
 
POST-M
 
cues
 
in
 
vivo.
 
To
 
this
 
end,
 
we
 
will
 
examine
 
whether
 
assigning
 
smokers
 
to
 
a
 
high
 
or
 
low
 
level
 
of
 
POST-M
 
exposure
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
daily
 
routine
 
affects
  
several
 
smoking
 
outcomes.
 
A
 
location
 
tracking
 
smartphone
 
application
 
(Google
 
Maps)
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
  
document
 
participants’
 
exposure
 
to
 
retail
 
outlets
 
and
 
link
 
each
 
person
 
to
 
the
 
retail
 
environment.
  
Measurements
 
will
 
assess
 
longitudinal
 
tobacco-use
 
patterns
 
and
 
perceptions
 
across
 
the
 
study
 
period,
 
as
  
well
 
as
 
changes
 
in
 
cravings.
 
If
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
case
 
that
 
low
 
POST-M
 
exposure
 
reduces
 
smoking,
 
this
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
further
 
regulation
 
of
 
retail
 
advertising
 
for
  
tobacco.
 
 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
hypotheses
 
and
 
analysis
 
plans
 
described
 
here,
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
has
 
preregistered
 
additional
 
hypotheses
 
and
 
analysis
 
plans
 
which
 
are
 
not
 
the
 
focus
 
of

component
 
of
 
the
 
study.

Background:
 
Tobacco
 
dependence
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
public
 
health
 
problem.
 
Cigarette
 
smoking
 
is
 
the
 
leading
 
cause
 
of
 
preventable
 
death
 
and
 
illness
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
and
 
throughout
 
the
 
developed
 
world
1
.
 
Smoking
 
increases
 
the
 
odds
 
of
 
developing
 
the
 
most
 
frequently
 
diagnosed
 
cancers
 
and
 
other
 
leading
 
causes
 
of
 
death,
 
accounting
 
for
 
1
 
in
 
5
 
deaths
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
each
 
year
 
2,3
.
 
Due
 
to
 
restrictions
 
in
 
other
 
communication
 
outlets,
 
the
 
tobacco
 
industry
 
currently
 
concentrates
 
over
 
80%
 
of
 
its
 
$8.1
 
billion
 
annual
 
marketing
 
budget
 
on
 
retail
 
environments,
 
including
 
point-of-sale
 
tobacco
 
marketing
 
(POSTM)
4–8
.
 
Tobacco
 
advertising
 
and
 
products
 
are
 
placed
 
prominently
 
in
 
“power
 
walls”
 
near
 
or
 
behind
 
cash
 
registers
 
in
 
retail
 
outlets
 
like
 
convenience
 
stores
 
and
 
gas
 
stations
9,10
,
11
,
 
such
 
that
 
all
 
customers
 
are
 
exposed
 
to
 
this
 
marketing.
 
This
 
widespread
 
and
 
frequent
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
in
 
smokers
 
and
 
nonsmokers
 
alike
 
is
 
of
 
great
 
interest
 
in
 
tobacco
 
control
 
and
 
cancer
 
prevention
 
research
 
worldwide,
 
and
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
recent
 
bans
 
of
 
POSTM
 
in
 
42%
 
of
 
countries
 
in
 
Europe
12
.
 
In
 
this
 
study,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
test
 
whether
 
repeated,
 
real-world
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
affects
 
smoking
 
behavior
 
through
 
heightened
 
neural
 
smoking
 
cue
 
reactivity
 
and
 
subjective
 
craving.
 
We
 
will
 
test
 
both
 
correlational
 
(Aims
 
1-2)
 
and
 
causal
 
(Aim
 
3)
 
pathways.
 
To
 
this
 
end,
 
we
 
propose
 
an
 
innovative
 
combination
 
of
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
as
 
an
 
ecologically
 
valid,
 
objective
 
measure
 
of
 
real-world
 
POSTM
 
exposure
13,14
;
  
ecological
 
momentary
 
assessment
 
(EMA)
15
 
to
 
assess
 
real-time
 
behavior
 
and
 
craving;
 
and
 
functional
 
magnetic
 
resonance
 
imaging
 
(fMRI)
 
to
 
assess
 
neural
 
responses
 
to
 
cigarette
 
cues
16–18
.
 
Understanding
 
both
 
the
 
neural
 
(laboratory-based)
 
and
 
behavioral
 
(real-world)
 
consequences
 
of
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
will
 
clarify
 
the
 
mechanisms
 
of
 
POSTM
 
impact,
 
and
 
ultimately
 
aid
 
in
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
more
 
effective
 
cancer
 
prevention
 
and
 
tobacco
 
regulatory
 
policies.
 
 
How
 
are
 
smokers
 
influenced
 
by
 
point-of-sale
 
tobacco
 
marketing
 
(POSTM)?
 
Past
 
work
 
suggests
 
detrimental
 
relationships
 
between
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
and
 
other
 
environmental
 
smoking
 
cues
 
and
 
smoking
 
behavior
 
in
 
individuals
 
(e.g.,
19,20
)
 
and
 
the
 
larger
 
population
 
(e.g.,
21
)
 
V2025-06
 

 
across
 
countries,
 
measures
 
and
 
study
 
designs
 
(for
 
a
 
review:
22
).
 
Within
 
current
 
and
 
recently
 
quit
 
smokers,
 
field
 
work
 
consistently
 
reports
 
associations
 
between
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
in
 
naturalistic
 
settings,
 
and
 
increased
 
smoking
 
cravings,
 
purchase
 
urges,
 
and
 
impulse
 
purchases
23–28
.
 
The
 
density
 
of
 
POSTM
 
in
 
an
 
individual’s
 
neighborhood,
 
a
 
proxy
 
for
 
exposure,
 
also
 
influences
 
smoking
 
behavior
29–33
;
 
for
 
example,
 
longitudinal
 
work
 
finds
 
that
 
smokers
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
relapse
 
during
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt
 
if
 
they
 
live
 
near
 
a
 
POSTM
 
store
34
.
 
In
 
a
 
virtual
 
store
 
study,
 
enclosing
 
the
 
POSTM
 
display
 
reduced
 
smokers’
 
purchase
 
attempts
 
and
 
urges
 
to
 
smoke
35
.
 
This
 
body
 
of
 
research
 
thus
 
suggests
 
that
 
further
 
regulation
 
of
 
POSTM
 
would
 
be
 
beneficial
 
from
 
a
 
cancer
 
control
 
perspective;
 
however,
 
causal
 
evidence
 
linking
 
longitudinal,
 
naturalistic
 
exposure
 
and
 
smoking
 
outcomes,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
neural
 
evidence
 
supporting
 
the
 
mechanisms
 
of
 
cumulative
 
and
 
causal
 
effects,
 
would
 
substantially
 
bolster
 
science-based
 
policy
 
making.
 
 
The
 
significance
 
of
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
and
 
ecological
 
momentary
 
assessment.
 
Geolocation
 
tracking
 
provides
 
the
 
unique
 
ability
 
to
 
objectively
 
and
 
unobtrusively
 
assess
 
participants’
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
outlets.
 
The
 
recent
 
ubiquity
 
of
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
built-in
 
to
 
smartphones
 
provides
 
the
 
opportunity
 
for
 
incorporating
 
this
 
methodology
 
into
 
experimental
 
designs
 
with
 
reduced
 
participant
 
burden.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
improvement
 
over
 
prior
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
work,
 
which
 
is
 
limited
 
by
 
reliance
 
on
 
self-reports
 
of
 
the
 
timing
 
and
 
degree
 
of
 
POSTM
 
exposure,
 
or
 
by
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
initiate
 
or
 
observe
 
single,
 
non-representative
 
exposures.
 
In
 
PA,
 
DE,
 
and
 
NJ,
 
where
 
data
 
collection
 
will
 
take
 
place,
 
obtaining
 
a
 
local
 
cigarette
 
dealer
 
license
 
is
 
mandatory
 
for
 
cigarette
 
retailers
36
 
and
 
listings
 
of
 
licensed
 
outlets
 
are
 
publicly
 
available
 
and
 
updated
 
monthly
37
.
 
Layering
 
smokers’
 
geolocation
 
tracks
 
onto
 
maps
 
of
 
tobacco
 
retail
 
outlets
 
allows
 
objective
 
quantification
 
of
 
an
 
individual’s
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
in
 
their
 
natural
 
environment.
 
38
.
 
In
 
parallel
 
with
 
geolocation
 
tracking,
 
we
 
will
 
sample
 
participants’
 
behaviors
 
and
 
craving
 
throughout
 
each
 
day
 
using
 
EMA,
 
to
 
capture
 
time-sensitive
 
fluctuations
 
in
 
a
 
representative
 
manner
15
.
 
EMA
 
optimally
 
complements
 
the
 
naturalistic
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
data
 
by
 
tagging
 
participants’
 
location
 
history
 
with
 
reports
 
indicating
 
natural
 
smoking
 
behavior
 
and
 
craving
 
on
 
a
 
moment-to-moment
 
basis.
 
Thus,
 
this
 
project
 
will
 
link
 
individuals’
 
smoking
 
cravings
 
and
 
behavior
 
to
 
the
 
POSTM
 
environment
 
in
 
both
 
time
 
and
 
location.
 
Our
 
team’s
 
expertise
 
with
 
mobile
 
device-based
 
EMA
 
collection
41,42
 
makes
 
us
 
uniquely
 
suited
 
to
 
conduct
 
this
 
multi-level
 
integrative
 
research.
 
 
Combining
 
responses
 
to
 
tobacco-related
 
cues
 
in
 
the
 
real
 
world
 
and
 
cue-reactivity
 
in
 
the
 
neuroimaging
 
laboratory
 
will
 
provide
 
a
 
mechanistic
 
understanding
 
of
 
how
 
POSTM
 
influences
 
smokers.
 
The
 
scientific
 
premise
 
for
 
this
 
study
 
derives
 
from
 
theoretical
 
models
 
and
 
empirical
 
studies
 
of
 
addiction,
 
which
 
suggest
 
that
 
exposure
 
to
 
drug-cues,
 
such
 
as
 
images
 
of
 
drug
 
paraphernalia,
 
enhances
 
craving
 
and
 
consumption
 
behavior
 
in
 
drug
 
users,
 
including
 
smokers
43,44
.
 
Laboratory
 
work
 
has
 
shown
 
increased
 
neural
 
activity
 
in
 
regions
 
associated
 
with
 
drug
 
cue-reactivity
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
increased
 
ratings
 
of
 
subjective
 
craving
 
in
 
smokers
 
after
 
exposure
 
to
 
smoking
 
cues
 
such
 
as
 
pictures
 
of
 
cigarettes
16,43
.
 
Craving
 
ratings
 
scale
 
positively
 
with
 
neural
 
cue-reactivity
17,45,46
,
 
and
 
both
 
metrics
 
predict
 
smoking
 
behaviors
 
in
 
a
 
later
 
ad-lib
 
smoking
 
session
 
18,47
.
 
Thus,
 
laboratory
 
experiments
 
implicate
 
neural
 
smoking
 
cue
 
reactivity
 
and
 
cigarette
 
craving
 
as
 
mechanisms
 
linking
 
exposure
 
to
 
smoking
 
cues
 
and
 
behavior.
 
In
 
contrast
 
to
 
many
 
other
 
addictive
 
substances,
 
advertising
 
for
 
cigarettes
 
is
 
professionally
 
produced,
 
legal,
 
and
 
prevalent
 
in
 
smokers’
 
natural
 
environments.
 
Neural
 
cue
 
reactivity
 
effects
 
have
 
been
 
generalized
 
from
 
completely
 
standardized
 
cues
 
to
 
more
 
naturalistic
 
pictures
 
of
 
personal
 
smoking
 
environments,
 
such
 
that
 
exposure
 
to
 
photographs
 
of
 
places
 
where
 
participants
 
often
 
smoke
 
(e.g.,
 
one’s
 
home)
 
evokes
 
stronger
 
neural
 
and
 
behavioral
 
craving
 
responses
 
than
 
exposure
 
to
 
generic
 
environmental
 
photographs
 
(e.g.,
 
an
 
unfamiliar
 
bus
 
stop)
18,48,49
;
 
however,
 
the
 
generalizability
 
of
 
such
 
effects
 
to
 
POSTM
 
cues
 
and
 
complex
 
retail
 
environments
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
tested.
 
We
 
will
 
test
 
whether
 
baseline
 
exposure
 
to
 
photographs
 
of
 
POSTM
 
elicits
 
activation
 
in
 
the
 
V2025-06
 

 
same
 
brain
 
regions
 
as
 
standardized,
 
proximal
 
smoking
 
cues.
 
A
 
recent
 
meta-analysis
 
shows
 
that
 
a
 
specific
 
set
 
of
 
neural
 
regions
 
consistently
 
responds
 
more
 
strongly
 
to
 
standard
 
smoking
 
cues
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
neutral
 
images,
 
including
 
the
 
extended
 
visual
 
system,
 
precuneus,
 
posterior
 
cingulate
 
gyrus,
 
anterior
 
cingulate
 
gyrus,
 
dorsal
 
and
 
medial
 
prefrontal
 
cortex,
 
insula,
 
and
 
dorsal
 
striatum

.
 
 
 
Brain
 
activity
 
as
 
a
 
key,
 
mechanistic
 
indicator
 
of
 
message
 
impact
 
over
 
time.
 
Functional
 
neuroimaging
 
allows
 
an
 
unobtrusive
 
examination
 
of
 
both
 
conscious
 
and
 
unconscious
 
processes
 
induced
 
by
 
exposure
 
to
 
standard
 
smoking
 
cues
16
 
and
 
mediated
 
messages
 
such
 
as
 
marketing
 
materials
50–52
.
 
Our
 
team
 
and
 
others
 
have
 
developed
 
multi-method
 
approaches
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
generalizability
 
and
 
predictive
 
validity
 
of
 
laboratory-based
 
neural
 
effects
 
to
 
real-world
 
behaviors
 
51–69
.
 
This
 
work
 
has
 
shown
 
that
 
neural
 
reactivity
 
to
 
persuasive
 
messaging
 
inside
 
the
 
fMRI
 
scanner
 
reliably
 
predicts
 
health
 
behaviors,
 
including
 
reductions
 
in
 
smoking
 
and
 
sedentary
 
behavior,
 
above
 
and
 
beyond
 
the
 
predictive
 
capacity
 
of
 
commonly
 
used
 
self-reports
 
51,59,60,64,65,70–75
.
 
Further,
 
findings
 
obtained
 
in
 
small
 
groups
 
have
 
been
 
shown
 
to
 
be
 
scalable,
 
such
 
that
 
message-induced
 
neural
 
activity
 
in
 
small
 
samples
 
has
 
been
 
used
 
to
 
predict
 
population-level
 
message
 
impact,
 
including
 
the
 
generation
 
of
 
quitline
 
calls
 
51
 
and
 
sharing
 
of
 
health-related
 
information
 
76,77
.
 
In
 
a
 
past
 
experimental
 
health
 
intervention,
 
our
 
team
 
successfully
 
used
 
brain
 
activity
 
to
 
predict
 
experimental
 
effects
 
on
 
subsequent
 
behavior
 
at
 
timepoints
 
up
 
to
 
a
 
month
 
later
 
62
.
 
 
 
Causal
 
manipulation
 
of
 
exposure
 
to
 
tobacco
 
marketing.
 
Most
 
extant
 
field
 
work
 
focused
 
on
 
POSTM,
 
despite
 
including
 
large
 
samples
 
and
 
naturalistic
 
settings,
 
has
 
been
 
correlational,
 
with
 
a
 
few
 
notable
 
exceptions.
 
For
 
example,
 
Shadel
 
et
 
al
 
created
 
an
 
experimental
 
convenience
 
store,
 
and
 
found
 
that
 
removal
 
of
 
the
 
POSTM
 
power
 
wall
 
reduced
 
susceptibility
 
to
 
future
 
cigarette
 
smoking
 
in
 
adolescents
78
.
 
The
 
current
 
study
 
proposes
 
to
 
significantly
 
extend
 
these
 
findings
 
by
 
manipulating
 
adult
 
smokers’
 
real-world,
 
daily
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
over
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
one
 
month,
 
rather
 
than
 
assessing
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
exposure
 
in
 
one
 
experimental
 
session.
 
After
 
an
 
observation
 
period
 
of
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
and
 
EMA,
 
individuals
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
assigned
 
to
 
1
 
of
 
3
 
groups.
 
Two
 
groups
 
enter
 
and
 
make
 
small,
 
non-tobacco
 
purchases
 
at
 
a
 
store
 
which
 
displays
 
POSTM
 
(tobacco
 
retailer
 
condition)
 
or
 
a
 
store
 
that
 
displays
 
pro-cessation
 
messaging
 
(nontobacco
 
retailer
 
condition).
 
Approaching
 
the
 
register
 
for
 
this
 
purchase
 
constitutes
 
an
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
(tobacco
 
retailer
 
condition)
 
or
 
pro-cessation
 
marketing
 
(nontobacco
 
retailer
 
condition).
 
A
 
third
 
group
 
receives
 
no
 
instruction
 
to
 
change
 
their
 
routine
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM.

4.1
 
Duration
 
of
 
Study
 
Participation
 
 
The
 
target
 
behaviors
 
(smoking
 
frequency,
 
cravings
 
for
 
cigarettes)
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
for
 
an
 
approximately
 
2
 
week
 
baseline
 
period
 
and
 
for
 
an
 
approximately
 
4
 
week
 
intervention
 
period.
 
Thus,
 
total
 
study
 
participation
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
6

participation
 
will
 
thus
 
be
 
approximately
 
2
 
months,
 
with
 
some
 
exceptions
 
(such
 
as
 
pauses
 
in
 
active
 
participation
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
University’s
 
special

flexibility
 
will
 
be

which
 
can
 
be

After

and
 
120

(approximately

we
 
will
 
use

Participants
 
will

If
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
“increased
 
smokers”
 
in
 
the
 
Tobacco
 
retailer
 
condition
 
is
 
significantly
 
(
p≤ 
.01)
 
greater
 
than
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
“increased
 
smokers”
 
in
 
the
 
control
 
condition,
 
this
 
will
 
trigger
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
to
 
reconvene
 
for
 
a
 
reassessment
 
with
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
team,
 
the
 
Primary
 
Investigator,
 
the
 
Co-Investigators
 
who
 
have
 
expertise
 
in
 
tobacco
 
research,
 
and
 
the
 
external
 
stakeholders.
 
This
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
termination
 
of
 
this
 
arm
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
reassignment
 
of
 
future
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
groups.
 
Additionally,
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
review,
 
we
 
will
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
the
 
participants
 
in
 
all
 
conditions
 
who
 
met
 
the
 
criteria
 
for
 
an
 
“increased
 
smoker”
 
to
 
offer
 
additional
 
counseling
 
on
 
smoking
 
cessation
 
resources.
  
The
 
group
 
will
 
further
 
make
 
a
 
plan
 
to
 
mitigate
 
future
 
risks
 
to
 
participants.

Sample
 
Size
 
and
 
Power
 
Determination
 
 
Our
 
initial
 
target
 
was
 
to
 
obtain
 
60
 
complete
 
datasets
 
(meaning
 
that
 
participants
 
finished
 
Online
 
Session
 
3,
 
two
 
fMRI
 
sessions
 
[before
 
and
 
after
 
the
 
intervention
 
period],
 
and
 
also
 
completed
 
all
 
20
 
store
 
visits)
 
per
 
intervention
 
condition
 
(total
 
N
 
=
 
180).
 
Due
 
to
 
pandemic-related
 
resource
 
constraints
 
and
 
time
 
delays,
 
we
 
were
 
unable
 
to
 
reach
 
this
 
goal.
 
We
 
collected
 
the
 
maximum
 
number
 
of
 
participants
 
possible
 
with
 
the
 
resources
 
available
 
from
 
our
 
grant.
 
Prior
 
to
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
data,
 
we
 
elected
 
to
 
randomize
 
more
 
individuals
 
into
 
the
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
than
 
to
 
the
 
control
 
condition,
 
since
 
less
 
than
 
50%
 
of
 
participants
 
typically
 
completed
 
all
 
20
 
store
 
visits
 
and
 
provided
 
fully
 
complete
 
datasets.
 
Before
 
we
 
conducted
 
any
 
hypothesis
 
testing,
 
we
 
reassessed
 
power
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
our
 
study
 
team’s
 
biostatistician
 
to
 
determine
 
which
 
original
 
hypotheses
 
would
 
be
 
adequately
 
powered
 
with
 
the
 
available
 
data
 
and
 
planned
 
analysis

methods.
 
Using
 
PANGEA,
 
we
 
estimated
 
that
 
with
 
at
 
least
 
40
 
complete
 
datasets
 
(participants
 
who
 
completed
 
all
 
20
 
store
 
visits)
 
in
 
each
 
intervention
 
condition,
 
we
 
could
 
detect

effects
 
(time
 
*
 
group)
 
sized
 
d
 
=
 
0.1
 
with
 
95%
 
power.
 
We
 
ultimately
 
randomized
 
105
 
to
 
the
 
Non-tobacco
 
retailer
 
condition,
 
107
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
Tobacco
 
retailer
 
condition,
 
and
 
70
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
Control
 
condition
 
resulting
 
in
 
175
 
complete
 
datasets.
 
We
 
scanned
 
as
 
many
 
participants
 
as
 
we
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
obtain
 
within
 
constraints
 
of
 
the
 
larger
 
study.
 
Power
 
analysis
 
suggests
 
that
 
with
 
N=32
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
10
 
observations
 
per
 
condition
 
in
 
the
 
fMRI
 
dataset,
 
per
 
participant,
 
we
 
have
 
>80%
 
power
 
to
 
detect
 
effects
 
of
 
d

(i.e.,
 
a
 
small

Statistical
 
Parametric
 
Mapping
 
(SPM;
 
Wellcome
 
Trust
 
Centre
 
for

and
 
NiPype.
 
We
 
will
 
examine
 
neural
 
responses
 
to
 
tobacco
 
marketing
 
and
 
to
 
other
 
smoking-related

and
 
how
 
these

relate
 
to

exposure
 
in
 
the
 
real-world,
 
as
 
well
 
as

Prior
 
to

we
 
will

to:
 
(a)

(d)
 
create
 
all

for
 
analysis,
 
and
 
(e)
 
check
 
that
 
appropriate
 
assumptions
 
of

are
 
met.
 
The
 
assumptions
 
underlying
 
the
 
application
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
statistical
 
methods
 
that
 
are
 
used
 
will
 
be
 
examined,
 
principally
 
through
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
standardized
 
residuals,
 
influence
 
diagnostics,
 
and
 
graphical
 
displays.
 
Neuroimaging
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
in
 
nipype
 
and
 
SPM12,
 
beginning
 
with
 
slice-time

Hypothesis
 
1:
 
Reported
 
craving
 
will
 
be
 
higher
 
for
 
those
 
in
 
the
 
Tobacco
 
retailer
 
condition,
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
Control
 
and
 
Nontobacco
 
retailer
 
conditions,
 
during
 
the
 
intervention
 
phase,
 
but
 
not
 
the
 
baseline
 
phase.
 
To
 
test
 
hypothesis
 
1,
 
we
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
linear
 
mixed
 
effects
 
model
 
(in
 
R).
 
To
 
examine
 
associations
 
between
 
study
 
phase
 
and
 
craving,
 
we
 
will
 
create
 
a
 
binary
 
Study
 
Phase
 
variable
 
indicating
 
whether
 
an
 
observation
 
for
 
a
 
participant
 
occurred
 
during
 
the
 
baseline
 
(0)
 
versus
 
intervention
 
(1)
 
phase.
 
To
 
examine
 
associations
 
between
 
condition
 
assignment
 
and
 
craving,
 
we
 
will
 
create
 
two
 
dummy
 
coded
 
variables
 
indicating
 
the
 
condition
 
assignment
 
for
 
each
 
participant.
 
A
 
Control
 
condition
 
variable
 
indicates
 
whether
 
the
 
condition
 
assignment
 
is
 
the
 
Control
 
condition
 
(1)
 
or
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
conditions
 
(i.e.,
 
Tobacco
 
and
 
nontobacco
 
retailer)
 
(0).
 
A
 
Nontobacco
 
retailer
 
condition
 
variable
 
indicates
 
whether
 
the
 
condition
 
is
 
the
 
Nontobacco
 
retailer
 
condition
 
(1)
 
or
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
conditions
 
(i.e.,
 
Control
 
and
 
Tobacco

conditions)
 
(0).
 
Thus,
 
the
 
Tobacco

condition
 
is
 
indicated
 
when
 
both
 
the
 
Control
 
condition
 
and

hypothesis

we
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
linear
 
mixed

model
 
(in
 
R).
 
To
 
examine
 
associations
 
between
 
study
 
phase
 
and
 
cigarettes
 
smoked,
 
we
 
will
 
create
 
a
 
binary
 
Study
 
Phase
 
variable
 
indicating
 
whether
 
an
 
observation
 
for
 
a
 
participant
 
occurred
 
during
 
the
 
baseline

phase.
 
To
 
examine

assignment
 
and

we
 
will
 
create
 
two
 
dummy
 
coded
 
variables
 
indicating
 
the
 
condition
 
assignment
 
for
 
each
 
participant.
 
A
 
Control
 
condition
 
variable
 
indicates
 
whether
 
the
 
V2025-06
 

 
condition
 
assignment
 
is
 
the
 
Control
 
condition
 
(1)
 
or
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
conditions
 
(i.e.,
 
Nontobacco
 
retailer
 
and
 
Tobacco
 
retailer
 
conditions)
 
(0).
 
A
 
Nontobacco
 
retailer
 
condition
 
variable
 
indicates
 
whether
 
the
 
condition
 
is
 
the
 
Nontobacco

condition
 
(1)
 
or
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
conditions
 
(i.e.,

Thus,
 
the
 
Tobacco

when
 
both
 
the
 
Control

and
 
Nontobacco

(SAEs).
 
The

would
 
be
 
complete
 
when
 
180

Assessing
 
Adverse
 
Events:
 
Monitoring
 
for
 
adverse
 
events
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
real
 
time
 
by
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
under
 
the
 
supervision
 
of
 
Dr.
 
Falk
 
and
 
Dr.
 
Cooper.
 
Based
 
on
 
previous
 
experience,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
expect
 
there
 
to
 
be
 
SAEs
 
or
 
persistent
 
adverse
 
events.
 
However,
 
it
 
is
 
possible
 
that
 
injuries
 
will
 
occur
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
fMRI
 
scanning,
 
for
 
example
 
if
 
participants
 
do
 
not
 
fully
 
disclose
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
metal
 
implants
 
in
 
their
 
body.
 
It
 
is
 
possible
 
that
 
our
 
experimental
 
manipulation
 
will
 
have
 
unexpectedly
 
large
 
effects
 
on
 
participant
 
outcomes.
 
As
 
described
 
above,
 
we
 
will
 
institute
 
a
 
stopping
 
rule
 
to
 
protect
 
against
 
unexpected
 
risk
 
to
 
participants.
 
The
 
PI
 
and
 
study
 
team
 
will
 
follow
 
all
 
subjects
 
who
 
are
 
discontinued
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
serious
 
and
 
related
 
adverse
 
event
 
and
 
will
 
refer
 
subjects
 
to
 
a
 
physician
 
(i.e.,
 
specialist)
 
as
 
clinically
 
indicated.
 
All
 
AEs
 
and
 
SAEs
 
will
 
be
 
documented
 
on
 
an
 
Adverse
 
Event
 
Report
 
Form.
 
This
 
information
 
will,
 
in
 
turn,
 
be
 
reported
 
immediately
 
to
 
all
 
necessary
 
regulatory
 
committees.
 
o
 
Adverse
 
Event
 
Reporting:
 
Any
 
serious
 
and
 
related
 
adverse
 
event
 
case
 
will
 
be
 
reviewed
 
by
 
Dr.
 
Falk.
  
After
 
removal
 
of
 
identification
 
information,
 
all
 
serious
 
adverse
 
events
 
will
 
be
 
reported
 
to
 
the
 
University
 
of
 
Pennsylvania
 
Institutional
 
Review
 
Board,
 
the
 
CTSRMC,
 
and
 
the

All
 
adverse

will
 
be
 
recorded.
 
 
 
Incidental
 
Findings:
 
The
 
fMRI
 
scans
 
conducted
 
in
 
this
 
study
 
are
 
not
 
indicated
 
to
 
be
 
clinically
 
diagnostic.
 
However,
 
if
 
any
 
incidental
 
findings
 
are
 
noted
 
by
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
or
 
scanning
 
technician,
 
the

will
 
be
 
advised
 
to

Data
 
Collection
 
and
 
Management
 
 
The
 
team
 
uses
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
tools
 
to
 
protect
 
participant
 
data.
  
We
 
review
 
these
 
by

component,
 
below:
 
●
 
GENERAL:
  
All
 
information
 
collected
 
through
 
this
 
study
 
will
 
be
 
treated
 
as
 
strictly
 
conﬁdential.
 
Identifying
 
information
 
will
 
be
 
removed
 
from
 
the
 
data
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
accessible
 
only
 
to
 
study
 
staff.
 
Data
 
that
 
is
 
de-identiﬁed
 
will
 
be
 
coded
 
using
 
this
 
study’s
 
dual
 
ID
 
system:
 
Survey
 
A
 
automatically
 
assigns
 
a
 
RedCap
 
record
 
ID
 
number
 
to
 
each
 
screen
 
respondent
 
who
 
expresses
 
interest
 
in
 
participating.
 
This
 
number
 
is
 
different
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
ID
 
number,
 
which
 
is
 
only
 
assigned
 
to
 
enrolled
 
participants
 
(those
 
who
 
have
 
signed
 
the
 
full
 
electronic
 
informed
 
consent
 
on
 
RedCap
 
that
 
begins
 
Session

Participants
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
include
 
their

in
 
the

but
 
we
 
will
 
explicitly
 
recommend
 
that
 
they
 
not
 
do
 
so,
 
as
 
sharing
 
contact
 
information
 
to
 
a
 
third-party
 
platform
 
can
 
incur
 
minimal
 
additional
 
risks
 
to
 
conﬁdentiality,
 
and
 
if
 
they
 
choose
 
to
 
include
 
their

they
 
accept
 
that
 
risk.
 
In
 
addition,
 
some
 
of
 
the

Ethical
 
Considerations

Risks
 
 
●
 
There
 
may
 
be
 
a
 
risk
 
of
 
unintentional
 
breach
 
of
 
conﬁdentiality,
 
but
 
we
 
will
 
take
 
all
 
necessary
 
steps
 
to
 
prevent
 
this
 
from
 
happening.
 
Internet
 
data
 
transfers
 
between
 
mobile
 
device
 
users
 
and
 
the
 
study
 
web-server
 
will
 
be
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
session
 
ID
 
unique
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
and
 
the
 
date
 
and
 
time
 
of
 
access.
 
All
 
information
 
collected
 
via
 
the
 
Internet
 
will
 
be
 
kept
 
secure
 
in
 
transit
 
using
 
the
 
Secure
 
Socket
 
Layer
 
(SSL)
 
protocol,
 
the
 
same
 
technology
 
used
 
to
 
encrypt
 
credit
 
card
 
numbers
 
during
 
transmission
 
over
 
the
 
Internet.
 
All
 
data
 
will
 
be
 
stored
 
in
 
a
 
database
 
subject
 
to
 
both
 
physical
 
and
 
electronic
 
protection.
 
 
●
 
Past
 
literature
 
suggests
 
that
 
there
 
may
 
be
 
negative
 
consequences
 
of
 
increased
 
exposure
 
to
 
POST-marketing,
 
such
 
as
 
increased
 
difﬁculty
 
in
 
quitting
 
and
 
increased
 
craving
 
during
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt.
 
However,
 
our
 
manipulation
 
does
 
not
 
involve
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt,
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
go
 
beyond
 
a
 
level
 
of
 
POST-marketing
 
exposure
 
that
 
participants
 
may
 
be
 
expected
 
to
 
have
 
in
 
their
 
normal
 
daily
 
lives.
 
At
 
most,
 
participants
 
are
 
asked
 
to
 
enter
 
a
 
POST-marketing
 
store,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
common
 
convenience
 
store,
 
once
 
per
 
day.
 
Thus,
 
the
 
study
 
design
 
poses
 
risk
 
to
 
participants
 
on
 
par
 
with
 
everyday
 
life.
  
 
●
 
For
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
COVID-19
 
pandemic,
 
entry
 
into
 
retail
 
stores
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
study
 
V2025-06
 

 
may
 
increase
 
participants'
 
risk
 
of
 
being
 
exposed
 
to
 
and
 
spreading
 
SARS-COV-2,
 
the
 
virus
 
that
 
causes
 
COVID-19
 
disease.
 
To
 
reduce
 
transmission
 
risks,
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
will
 
send
 
participants
 
KN95/KF94
 
or
 
N95
 
respirators
 
(masks)
 
in
 
their
 
box
 
of
 
study
 
materials,
 
which
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
strongly
 
encouraged
 
to
 
wear
 
during
 
study-related
 
store
 
visits
 
(in
 
accordance
 
with
 
local
 
guidelines)
 
and
 
in
 
their
 
daily
 
life.
 
Participants
 
are
 
also
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
vaccinated
 
against
 
COVID-19.
 
●
 
For
 
optional
 
fMRI
 
session
 
component:
 
Safety
 
concerns
 
in
 
MR
 
environment:
 
The
 
magnetic
 
field
 
of
 
the
 
MRI
 
environment
 
has
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
cause
 
burns
 
or
 
bodily
 
injury
 
if
 
ferrous
 
metal
 
objects
 
are
 
implanted
 
in
 
the
 
body
 
or
 
if
 
personal
 
articles
 
containing
 
ferrous
 
material
 
are
 
brought
 
into
 
the
 
MR
 
environment.
 
Because
 
we
 
are
 
excluding
 
subjects
 
with
 
contraindications
 
for
 
MR
 
studies
 
(e.g.,
 
metallic
 
implants
 
such
 
as
 
pacemakers,
 
surgical
 
aneurysm
 
clips,
 
or
 
known
 
metal
 
fragments
 
embedded
 
in
 
the
 
body)
 
using
 
a
 
standard
 
screening
 
form,
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
damage
 
due
 
to
 
implanted
 
metal
 
is
 
low.
 
Investigators
 
and
 
personnel
 
of
 
the
 
MRI
 
unit
 
have
 
extensive
 
experience
 
with
 
standard
 
safety
 
precautions,
 
including
 
safety
 
screening
 
on
 
paper
 
and
 
verbally
 
by
 
a
 
trained
 
technologist.
 
These
 
considerations
 
minimize
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
accident
 
or
 
injury
 
in
 
the
 
MR
 
environment.
 
Psychological
 
discomfort
 
secondary
 
to
 
MRI
 
acquisition
 
may
 
occur
 
in
 
some
 
subjects
 
due
 
to
 
claustrophobia.
 
Claustrophobia
 
is
 
also
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
exclusion
 
criteria,
 
and
 
participants
 
are
 
informed
 
that
 
they
 
may
 
stop
 
the
 
study
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
without
 
consequences
 
to
 
them.
 
Risk
 
of
 
discomfort
 
due
 
to
 
fMRI
 
scanner
 
noise
 
will
 
be
 
minimized
 
by
 
providing
 
earplugs
 
for
 
participants.
 
The
 
level
 
of
 
noise
 
is
 
not
 
great
 
enough
 
to
 
pose
 
a
 
health
 
risk,
 
with
 
or
 
without
 
earphones.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
risk
 
that
 
the
 
magnetic
 
resonance
 
image
 
will
 
reveal
 
a
 
minor
 
or
 
significant
 
lesion
 
in
 
the
 
brain,
 
e.g.
 
a
 
tumor,
 
previously
 
unknown
 
to
 
the
 
subject.
 
Structural
 
MRI
 
scans
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
read
 
by
 
a
 
radiologist,
 
and
 
subjects
 
will
 
be
 
informed
 
of
 
this.
 
No
 
diagnostic
 
or
 
clinical
 
information
 
will
 
be
 
provided,
 
and
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
informed
 
of
 
this
 
before
 
consenting
 
to
 
participate.
 
We
 
exclude
 
subjects
 
with
 
contraindications
 
for
 
MR
 
studies
 
(e.g.,
 
metallic
 
implants
 
such
 
as
 
pacemakers,
 
surgical
 
aneurysm
 
clips,
 
or
 
known
 
metal

These

minimize
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
accident

in
 
the
 
MR

Claustrophobia

Thus,
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
discomfort
 
will
 
be
 
minimized.
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
with
 
a
 
hand-squeezable
 
pneumatic
 
signaling
 
device
 
for
 
communicating
 
with
 
investigators
 
during

should
 
they

other
 
than

Participants
 
may
 
beneﬁt
 
from
 
heightened

of
 
the
 
way
 
point-of-sale
 
marketing
 
affects
 
their

10.3
 
Risk
 
Benefit
 
Assessment
 
 
Given
 
the
 
minimal

of
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
the
 
great
 
potential
 
beneﬁt
 
for
 
understanding
 
the
 
relationship
 
between
 
the
 
brain
 
and
 
behavior,
 
the

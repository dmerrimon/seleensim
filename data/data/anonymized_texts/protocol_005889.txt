Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of VT -1161 Oral Capsules in the Treatment of Subjects with Recurrent Vulvovaginal 
Candidiasis  
Protocol Number:  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 
Interim Analysis:  No 
Investigational Medic inal Product : VT-1161 capsules  
Non-Investigational Medic inal Product : Fluconazole  tablets  or capsules

Phase of Development:  3 
Introduction:  
VT-1161 is an orally -available inhibitor of  fungal CYP51  that has shown high potency and selectivity in 
in vitro  studies.  VT-1161 blocks the production of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell 
membrane, which is critical to fungal growth.  In vitro  and in vivo  pharmacology studies have 
demonstrated that VT -1161 is highly active against Candida  albicans , includ ing fluconazole -resistant C. 
albicans , and  non-albicans Candida  species that cause vulvovaginal candidiasis  (VVC) .  VT-1161 is 
highly selective for fungal CYP51 relative to off -target human CYP enzymes, and data to date suggest 
that it may avoid the side -effect profile that limits the use of commonly prescribed azole antifungal 
agents.  
Oral VT -1161 has been evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 studies and shown to be safe, well tolerated , and 
highly effective  in the treatment of vulvovaginal infections caused by Candida  species .  For example, i n 
a Phase 2b study in subjects with recurrent VVC (RVVC) , subjects in the 12-week VT -1161 treatment 
group  (150 mg VT -1161 once daily for 7  days followed by 150 mg VT -1161 once weekly for 11 weeks) 
showed a 4.8% recurrence rate  through Week  48 compared with a 52% recurrence rate in the placebo 
group  in the intent -to-treat analysis .  
RVVC , defined as 3 or mor e acute VVC episode s over a 12 -month period, is experienced by 5 to 
7 million women each year in the US.  Candida albicans is the leading cause of recurrent vulvovaginal 
yeast infections in the United States.  However, there has been an increasing trend in the number of 
vaginal yeast infections attribut able to non -albicans spec ies such as C.  glabrata and C. tropicalis .  In 
addition to the use of topical products to treat VVC, the majority of the women visiting healthcare 
professionals receive fluconazole for the treatment of each acute episode.  A  smalle r percentage are 
prescribed a fluconazole maintenance regimen although fluconazole is not currently approved for the 
treatment of RVVC.  Since some of the C. albicans  and the majority of non -albicans isolates are resistant 
to fluconazole, the management of  RVVC has become even more challenging.   
In both nonclinical studies and clinical trials conducted to date, VT -1161 has demonstrated a favorable 
safety and tolerability profile, with no discernable  adverse effect on liver function.  In reproductive 
toxicit y studies  in pregnant rats or rabbits , VT-1161 was not teratogenic at any exposure studied.  In a 
recent CYP3A4 drug -drug interaction study utilizing midazolam as the substrate, no clinically significant 
inhibition  and only weak induction  of midazolam metabolism was observed.  These data are favorable 
when compared to other oral antifungal agents  such as fluconazole .

6 Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of oral VT -1161 in the treatment of RVVC  through Week  48. 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability  of oral VT -1161 in the treatment of RVVC through 
Week 48 . 
• To evaluate the impact of oral VT -1161 treatment on patient  reported outcome s through 
Week 48 . 
Methodology:  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3, multi center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study.   
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral VT -1161 capsules in the treatment of subjects with 
RVVC.  The impact of oral VT -1161 treatment will also be evaluated us ing data collected from patient 
reported outcome  assessments . 
Subject s must have a h istory of RVVC, defined as at least 3 episodes of acute VVC in the past 12 months , 
as described below:  
• Subjects must have an acute  VVC episode at the time of Screening , with a documented positive 
potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) or Gram stain performed at the investigative site 
• Subjects must also have had 2 or more  additional  episodes of acute VVC in the past 12  months , 
with at least 1 of the episodes documented by a positive confirmatory laboratory test (i.e., culture, 
PCR, Affirm test, KOH test,  Gram stain,  a documented Papanicolaou (Pap) test, or other 
approve d diagnostic test s) 
The study consists of two Phases: 1) an open -label Induction Phase for the treatment of the acute VVC 
episode  with 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of fluconazole, and 2) a Maintenance Phase 
in which subjects will be randomly assigned to receive VT-1161 or placebo  for 7 daily doses followed 
by 11 weekly doses  and will  then enter a 36 -week follow -up period . 
Once subjects have provided informed consent or assent (for those ages 12 to 17), the investigational site 
will evaluate  all subjects by completing a review of pertinent medical history, obtaining vital signs , 
weight and height , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and laboratory tests , reviewing clinical signs and symptoms 
of vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum examination of the 
vagina, perform ing a KOH  wet mount test  or Gram stain  from a vaginal smear  to confirm the presence 
of yeast , and collect ing vaginal swabs to establish a baseline  culture  for identification of fungal species .  
Patient reported outcome survey s (SF-36, EQ-5D-3L or EQ -5D-Y (for ages 12 to 17) , WPAI :SHP , 
PHQ -9) for all regions and questions regarding their RVVC history (US only) will also be administered.  
Eligible subjects must have an acute VVC episode at Screening, defined as a total signs and symptoms 
score of ≥3 and a positive local KOH wet mount preparation  or Gram stain  from a vaginal smear 
revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast cells , and must meet other initial entry 
criteria .  Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will enter the Induction P hase.  During the Induction 
Phase, t he presenting  acute VVC infection  will be treated with 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 
72 hours) of fluconazole.  Subjects will return approx imately  14 days after the first dose of fluconazole

7 for evaluation . If the clinical signs and symptoms of the  acute VVC infection  have resolved (defined by 
a signs and symptoms score of <3), they will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive  either  VT-1161 or 
a matching placebo  regimen .  Day 1  (Baseline)  is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP)  administration and subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive days 
thereafter.  If the acute VVC has not resolved (defined by a signs and symptoms score of ≥3), the subject 
will be considered a screen failure and encouraged to see their physician for follow -up care.  
Study Duration:  
The planned study duration is expected to be approximately 26 months from screening  of the first subject 
until last follow -up of the last subject.  
Subject Participation:  
The duration of individual subject partic ipation will be approximately 50 weeks , including the 2-week  
Induction  Phase .  See Table 1 for the Schedule of Assessments and P rocedures  which will be performed . 
After Screening , subjects wil l return to the clinic on Day  1 (Baseline ), the start of the Maintenance Phase. 
Subjects  will then have visi ts on Day  14 (±2 days), Weeks 6  (±7 days), 12 (±14 days), 18  (±14 days), 
24 (±14 days), 30 (±14  days), 36 (±14 days) , 42 (±14 days) and 48  (±14  days) (end of study [EOS]). 
Subjects who return to the clinic with a recurrent acute VVC  episode  should be evaluated as per the 
unscheduled visit  noted in  the Schedule of Assessment and Procedures.  
Scoring of Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms:  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptom s will be evaluat ed at  Screening  and at each subsequent study visit.  
Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be scored  and the individual scores 
combined , for a maximum score of 18 using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation  
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be graded on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows:  
0 = none (complete absence of any sign or symptom)  
1 = mild (slight)  
2 = moderate ( present ) 
3 = severe (marked, intense)  
Mycology Assessment:  
A local mycological assessment using KOH wet mount followed by microscopy  or Gram stain  will be 
evaluated at the Screening and at any study visit where a recurrent  acute  VVC episode is suspected.  The 
investigative site is to use the same local mycology test (KOH or Gram stain) consistently for al l subjects 
throughout the study.  In  addition, a vaginal swab for culture testing will be obtained and sent to the 
central mycology laboratory  at the Screening and each subsequent study visit.  
Plasma Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples for assay of VT -1161 pla sma concentrations will be collected from subjects at Baseline, 
Day 14, and Weeks  12, 24, 36, 48 and unscheduled visits.

12 Maintenance Phase Reference Product: Matching Placebo capsules  
Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Oral administration of placebo  within 30 minutes after ingestion of the subject’s main meal of the day 
(as determined by the subject and kept consistent throughout the duration of the study).  Approximately 
240 mL (approx.  8oz) of water is to be consumed with each dose of IMP.  
Starting at Baseline (Day 1), loading doses  of placebo  once daily for 7  days, followed by  doses of  placebo  
(1 capsule) once weekly for 11 weeks.  
Duration of Administration : 12 weeks  
Study Populations:  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  Population : All randomized subjects.  
Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who receive d at least 1 dose of IMP.  
Per Protocol Population (PP):  All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Had no deviations to inclusion/exclusion criteria that could impact treatment outcome.  
• Were compliant with the assigned study treatment, defined as ≥80% complian ce during the daily 
dosing phase and ≥50% comp liance during the weekly dosing  phase . 
• Had the Week 48  visit completed within the acceptable time window  (±14 days) . 
• Had no major protocol violations that would impact treatment outcome . 
Modified ITT:  All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Positive  KOH or Gram stain at Screening . 
• Positive culture  at Screening . 
• Negative culture at Baseline.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Clinical and mycological assessments will be conducted as outlined in Table 1. Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
All efficacy analys es will be performed on the ITT , PP, and mITT  Populations.  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects wit h one  or more  culture -verified  
acute VVC episodes  during the Maintenance Phase ( post-randomization  through Week 48 ) in the ITT 
population. An acute VVC episode  during the Maintenance Phase (considered a recurrent episode)  is 
defined as a positive  culture  for Candida  species  and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3.   
The key secondary efficacy outcome measures include the following:  
a. Time to first recurrence of a culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs and symptoms score ≥3 
during the Maintenance Phase . 
b. The proportion  of subjects with at least one positive culture  for Candida during the Maintenance 
Phase .

13 c. The proportion of subjects with  at least one culture -verified  acute VVC episode  with signs and 
symptoms of ≥3  post randomization  through Week 24 . 
d. Change from Screening through Week 48  in the SF -36 mental component score (MCS).  
e. Change  from Screening  through We ek 48  in the SF -36 patient  reported outcome survey total score . 
 
Safety:  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population.  AEs will be collected throughout the 
study.   Physical and vaginal examination findings and vital  signs will be recorded at Screening  and 
throughout the study per Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
ECGs  and safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained throughout 
the study. All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to Screening  through 
the Week 48  (EOS) visit will be recorded in the case repo rt form (CRF).  Pertinent and all major m edical 
conditions will be recorded on the Medical History CRF.  
Subject  who want to  discontinue from the study  should be encouraged to remain in the study for all 
remaining visits  through Week 48  for safety and effi cacy assessments.  All subjects who discontinue 
early from the study should  have all EOS procedures performed  on the day of discontinuation .  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
A statistical analysis plan will be finalized before 50% of subjects are enrolled . 
Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary statistical objective of this study is to determine if there are differences in the proportions 
of subjects with one  or more episodes of culture -verified acute VVC in those receiving VT -1161 
compared to those  receiving placebo  during the Maintenance Phase.  
A sample size of 68 active subjects and 34 placebo subjects provides at least 95% power to detect a 
treatment difference of 35% between the VT -1161 treatment group and the placebo treatment gro up in 
percentage of subjects with at least one or more culture -verified acute VVC episodes during the 
Maintenance Phase ( post randomization through Week 48 ).   (PASS 2008: Fisher ’s exact test, two -sided 
alpha=0.05, and assuming 50% of placebo subjects have recurrence).  Based on an estimated 20 % 
discontinuation rate, approximately 128 total subjects (85 active, 43 placebo) will be necessary for 
randomization to arrive at approximately 102 evaluable subjects.     
Safety Analysis:  
AEs will be code d using  the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s® dictionary.  The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting  treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by system organ class , 
preferred term , and greatest severity  with a breakdown by treatment group.   Mean changes from pre -
treatment in vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory variables will be summarized by treatment group.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
No formal statistical hypothesis testing related to pharmacokinetics will be conducted.   VT-1161 
concentrations will be presented by visit  with descriptive statistics.  The pharmacokinetic data will be

25 1 INTRODUCTION  
Lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), an enzyme essential for fungal growth, catalyzes an early step 
in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, a sterol required for fungal cell membrane formation 
and integrity ( Yoshida, 1988 ).  Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of 14 -methylated 
sterols, some of which are toxic to the fungus.  CYP51 is the molecular target of the class of drugs 
referred to as ‘azole antifungals’.  All currently approved azole drugs contain either an imidazole 
or triazole ring system that binds tightly to the catalytic heme -iron of fungal CYP51 as well as to 
the heme -iron of many off -target mammalian cytochrome P450  enzymes.  This inherent lack of 
selectivity is responsible for many of the side effects associated with the azole antifungals.  
For example, the potent inhibition of one or more human cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes 
found in the liver (e.g. CYP3A4, C YP2C9, CYP2C19) or in the adrenal and sex organs 
(e.g. CYP19, CYP17, CYP21), is the basis for azole drug -drug interactions ( Bates and Yu, 2003 ) 
and reproductive warnings ( Zarn et al., 2003 ), respectively.  Additional azole class toxicities that 
are less well understood but may be related to off -target protein interactions include hepatic 
toxicities, skin photosensitivity, and vision impairment.  In the acute care setting, these dose -
limiting si de effects prevent attainment of plasma drug levels that might reduce the longstanding 
40% mortality rate attributed to invasive fungal infections.  The safety profile of the class similarly 
limits its use for chronic treatment of non -life-threatening fung al infections, such as 
onychomycosis (OM) and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).  A safer antifungal drug 
would also improve treatment options for infections seen in otherwise healthy individuals, such as 
OM and recurrent VVC, which require protract ed treatment in a patient population where 
significant side -effect risks are unacceptable.  
1.1 Background Information  
Mucosal candidiasis, also known as thrush, describes a group of yeast -like fungal infections that 
involve the mucous membranes including the m outh, urinary tract and genitals, notably the vagina 
and surrounding skin in women.  Infection is typically caused by Candida albicans , however more 
rare and difficult -to-treat Candida strains such as  C. glabrata are b ecoming more prevalent.  
Mucosal candidiasis occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients, but may also arise 
in immunocompetent individuals.

26 1.1.1 Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
1.1.1.1  Epidemiology  
Symptoms of vulvovaginitis (inflammation of the vagina and vulva) a re common and are among  
of the most frequent reasons for women’s visits to physicians.  Vulvovaginitis is associated with 
considerable morbidity including genital discomfort, decrease in sexual pleasure, loss of 
productivity, and psychological distress ( Eschenbach, 2004 ).  There are several  etiologies for 
vulvovaginitis; candidiasis being the second most common after bacterial vaginitis.  Vulvovaginal 
candidiasis is a common disorder, with nearly 75% of all adult women hav ing had at least one 
“yeast infection” in their lifetime.  Approximately half of these women experience a recurrence, 
with 5 to 8 % developing recurrent VVC, defined as 3 or more e pisodes in one year ( Sobel, 2016 ).  
Estrogen in creases the glycogen concentration of the vaginal lining; glycogen is a substrate on 
which C. albicans  thrives.  As estrogen levels are significantly lower in both pre -menarcheal and 
post-menopausal females, the incidence of VVC is lower in these populatio ns.  Vulvovaginal 
candidiasis is most common in women aged 25  to 34 years  (Foxman et al., 2013 ). 
1.1.1.2  Pathophysiology  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis occurs when there is an overgrowth of the normal yeast in the vagina.   
Most cases (85%  - 95%) are caused by C. albicans , followed by  C. glabrata , and infrequently by 
C. parapsilosis , C. tropicalis , and C. krusei .  Vulvovaginitis caused by non -albicans Candida 
species, in particular C. glabrata , is clinically indistinguishable from C. albica ns VVC but is more 
resistant to current treatments.  
Candida organisms gain access to the lumen and secretions of the vagina primarily from the 
adjacent perianal region.  Normal anti -candida defense mechanisms allow for long -term 
persistence of Candida as c ommensal organisms in the vagina without signs or symptoms of 
vaginitis.  Factors predisposing to VVC versus asymptomatic colonization include those attributed 
to the health (immunosuppression, use of anti bacterial agents, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes 
mellitus) and behavior (frequent intercourse, orogenital sexual activity, use of oral contraceptives 
or estrogen -based hormonal replacement therapy) of the host.  Other dermatologic conditions such 
as psor iasis, lichen planus, and lichen sclerosus also predispose women to VVC  (Goncalves et al., 
2016 ). 
1.1.1.3  Presentation and Diagnosis  
The clinical array of signs and symptoms of VVC include genital pruritus associated with edema, 
an erythematous rash and excoriation of the vulva and surrounding skin, a burning sensation in the 
vagina and vu lva, and a vaginal discharge.  These symptoms may persist for days to weeks, and

27 may also recur with each menstrual cycle.  Women with VVC typica lly most commonly present 
with acute pruritus and a vaginal discharge, though neither is specific for candidiasis.  
The discharge may range from being watery to quite thick and “cottage -cheese -like”.  
Common  symptoms include vaginal soreness, irritation, v ulvar burning, dyspareunia, and external 
dysuria.  Physical examination typically reveals erythema and edema of the vulva with fissures 
and a pustulopapular rash, vaginal erythema, and a normal cervix.  Symptoms often w orsen the 
week prior to menses.  
The diagnosis of VVC requires more than a history and physical examination as symptoms and 
signs, in particular pruritus, are often non-specific.  Diagnosis is made by microscopic examination 
of a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount showing the presenc e of yeast cells and mycelia 
and the absence of both clue cells (pathognomonic of bacterial infection) and trichomonads.  
The vaginal pH is normal, approximately 4.0.  A vaginal culture should also be performed, 
particularly for women with negative microsc opy, as up to 50% of patients with culture -positive 
VVC will have no findings on microscopy ( Sobel, 2007 ); additionally, a culture will p recisely 
identify the organism . Papanicolaou  (Pap)  smears are also not reliable, typicall y positive in only a 
quarter of patients with VVC.  
As up to 15% of asymptomatic women are colonized with Candida species and are thus culture 
positive, the final diagnosis of VVC requires a comprehensive assessment of clinical findings, 
microscopic examina tion, and vaginal culture.  
1.1.1.4  Treatment and Outcome  
In general, women who are asymptomatic carriers of Candida do not require treatment.  
Acute  VVC in symptomatic women requires individualized treatment, the selected agent and 
duration of therapy being based on whether the VVC is categorized as either:  
• Uncomplicated, defined as having all of the following characteristics: (mild or moderate in 
symptom severity, sporadic in frequency, C. albicans as the infecting organism, in non -
pregnant women with normal immun e function), or  
• Complicated, defined as having any one or more of the following characteristics: severe in 
symptom severity, recurrent, a non -C. albicans  organism as the infecting agent, abnormal 
immune function, or pregnant ( Eschenbach, 2004 ). 
Women with uncomplicated VVC can be treated with single -dose or short -course treatments, while 
those with complicated VVC require longer -term therapy, at least 5 to 7 days and possibly

28 maintenance therapy  up to 6 months  (Sobel et al., 2004 ).  Pregnant women, who are at higher risk 
of developing VVC, can only be treated with topical agents because of the potential teratogenic 
effects of azoles when administered systemically.  T opical agents are limited by local side effects, 
especially burning, and are messy to apply; therefore,  most patients prefer the oral regimens.  
However, the systemically administered azoles listed in Table 2 are characterized by systemic 
toxicities and dr ug-drug-interactions (DDIs) and have poor activity against C. glabrata  and 
fluconazole resistant C . albicans .

Abbreviations: mg  = milligrams; d  = day; q.d.  = once daily ; Rx = prescription . 
 
1.1.1.5  Recurrent, Resistant and Non -Albicans VVC  
Up to 20% of women will develop recurrent, resistant, or complicated VVC.  In a study that 
compared a 6 -month maintenance weekly fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with 
recurrent VVC, the time to recurrence increased from 4.0 to 10.2 months, and the cure rate at 
12 months doubled versus placebo from 22% to 43% (Sobel et al., 2004 ).  However, fewer than 
half of patients remained disease -free after discontinuation of fluconazole which highli ghts the 
unmet medical need for these patients.  
The prevalence of infection with non -albicans species, in particular C. glabrata , is increasing, 
especially in patients who are immunosuppressed and/or are diabetics; C. glabrata  is poorly 
sensitive to curren t azole antifungal agents.  
1.2 VT-1161  
VT-1161 is a novel oral antifungal agent with a lower affinity for heme -iron and a greater affinity 
for the fungal lanosterol 14 α -demethylase (CYP51)  than the currently available azole drugs.  
As a result, VT -1161 more potently inhibits fun gal CYP51  than current azoles and less potently 
inhibits host cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in greater cytochrome selectivity.  
These  properties should translat e to greater efficacy with an improved safety and tolerability 
profile.

29 VT-1161 is being developed for the treatment of patients with mucosal or superficial fungal 
infections.  It is formulated with standard excipients known to be chemically stable when co mbined 
with VT -1161 into capsules for the investigational drug product.  
A detailed description of the non -clinical binding and inhibition, metabolism, microbiology, 
toxicology, safety pharmacology, Phase 1 clinical studies in which 72 subjects were exposed  to 
VT-1161 and Phase 2a proof -of-concept studies, in which 7 8 subjects were exposed to VT 1161 
can be found in the VT -1161 Investigational Brochure.  In the P hase 2b studies, 378  subjects were 
exposed to VT -1161.  These studies are summarized below.  The following section s provide data 
from non -clinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials supporting the use of VT ‑1161 for patients 
with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis  (RVVC) . 
1.2.1 Non-Clinical Pharmacology  
1.2.1.1  Binding and Inhibition  
In vitro  pharmacology studies demonstrated that VT -1161 is a potent inhibitor of fungal CYP51 
and binds more than 2200 -fold more tightly to fungal CYP51 than to human CYP51.  VT -1161 is 
also highly selective for fungal CYP51 versus key human cytochrome P450 enzyme s, non -
cytochrome metalloenzymes, and a broad panel of receptors, ion channels, and transporters.  
1.2.1.2  Metabolism  
VT-1161 was not significantly metabolized when incubated with mouse, rat, dog or human 
hepatocytes.  Only 1 possible metabolite consistent with hyd roxylation and glucuronidation of 
VT-1161 was detected in dog hepatocytes.  No additional metabolites were detected in any of the 
4 species.  
1.2.1.3  Microbiology  
VT-1161 was tested against a broad range of Candida clinical isolates and showed potent activity 
(Table 3) .  It was also active against dermatophytes, including Trichophyton rubrum , 
T. mentagrophytes , and T. tonsurans .

In the Phase 2b RVVC study (VMT -VT-1161 -CL-006), 413 clinical isolates were collected from 
subjects at screening visits until the end of the study.   The minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) ranges for VT -1161 and fluconazole for the isolates collected were; <0.0005  – >0.5 µg/ml 
and <0.06 -32 µg/ml, respectively.  The MIC 50 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole were 
0.004  µg/ml and 0.125 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC 90 values for VT-1161 and fluconazole 
were 0.06 µg/ml and 4 µg/ml, respectively.  These data further demonstrated that VT -1161 has 
potent in vitro  activity against the Candida strains obtained from  clinical strains .  For all tested 
isolates, the VT -1161 demonstrated MIC 50 and MIC 90 that were 5 dilutions lower than those 
demonstrated by fluconazole.   
1.2.1.4  Activity in Animal Models of VVC  
VT-1161 was evaluated as an oral treatment of vaginal candidiasis ( C. albicans ) in a murine model 
(Garvey et a l., 2012 ).  Three days after infection, VT -1161 was dosed orally once daily at 4, 10, 
or 25 mg/kg daily for 4 days.  Fungal burden measured in vaginal lavage fluid was highly 
significantly suppressed (p <0.0002) compared to vehicle -treated controls at all doses and when 
measured 1 or 4 days after treatment ended.  Plasma and vaginal tissue levels of the lowest dose 
of VT -1161 indicated that levels as low as 1 µg/mL resulted in this high degree of efficacy.  
1.2.1.5  Pharmacokinetics  
VT-1161 formulated as a suspension  in carboxymethylcellulose was well absorbed and exhibited 
approximately dose linear pharmacokinetics (PK) and a long plasma half -life in both rats and dogs.  
There was no evidence of an effect of gender on the PK of VT -1161 in either rats or dogs.  
VT-1161 accumulated during repeat -dosing in rats and dogs as expected based on the long 
half-life.  VT -1161 was widely distributed into tissues and was mostly excreted in bile and feces 
in the rat.  In vitro plasma protein binding of VT -1161 is high with approxi mately 99.5% binding 
to rat, dog and human plasma and slightly lower binding in mice (97.6%).  The absolute oral

31 bioavailability of the capsule formulation used in Phase 1 studies administered to dogs was 
approximately 40% in the fasted state and approxima tely 100% when administered in the fed state.  
1.2.1.6  General Toxicology  
Oral VT -1161 was evaluated in general Good Laboratory Practice toxicity studies of up to 
6 months and 9 months in duration in rats and dogs, respectively.  Rats were more sensitive to the 
toxicological effects of oral administration of VT -1161 than dogs.  The no observable adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) for the 6 -month rat toxicity study was determined to be 0.5 mg/kg/day, 
based on an increase in incidence and severity of chronic progressive nephropathy, a rat -specific 
finding.  The NOAEL for liver findings was 1.5 mg/kg, based on adverse findings at the high dose 
of 5 mg/kg/day including a minimal increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and an inc rease in frequency of minimal focal necrosis and 
single cell necrosis.   Findings of liver hypertrophy, sub -capsular necrosis and multinucleated 
hepatocytes were considered rat -specific and associated with metabolic adaptation.   Focal necrosis 
may be an exa ggerated response to hepatocellular hypertrophy which is known to cause 
sub-capsular and single cell necrosis.   The findings were reversible and similar to  the findings 
observed in a prior 28 -day study in the rat, providing support that the increased treatment duration 
in the 6-month  rat study did not result in new findings of clinical concern.  At the 1.5  mg/kg dose 
at steady state on Day 182, maximum plasm a concentration ( Cmax) was 4,055  ng/mL and area 
under the curve ( AUC 0-24) was 81,900 ng·h/mL.  The NOAEL for the 9 -month dog study was 
determined to be the high dose of 17 mg/kg/day (Day 273 C max was 74,700  ng/mL and AUC 0-24 
was 1,675,000 ng·h/mL), as no a dverse findings were identified.  The NOAEL in the previous 
28-day dog study was 10 mg/kg/day, based on decreased body weight and mild effects on 
lymphoid organs including increased 31icromol  body macrophages in the mandibular and 
mesenteric lymph nodes and  in the Peyer’s patches at 30 mg/kg and higher.  These findings were 
largely reversed during the recovery period.  
1.2.1.7  Genotoxicity  
VT-1161 was found to be negative for genotoxicity in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay, 
the chromosome aberration assay i n human peripheral lymphocytes and the in vivo  bone marrow 
micronucleus assay in rats.  
1.2.1.8  Reproductive Toxicology  
VT-1161 at doses resulting in maternal toxicity (clinical signs and decrease in body weights) did 
not cause alterations in uterine and ovarian pa rameters in embryofetal development studies in rats 
and rabbits.  Mean fetal body weights were slightly reduced in rabbits in the high dose group  as a

32 direct result of maternal toxicity and decreased maternal body weights.  No external, visceral and 
skelet al malformations and variations were observed at any of the dose levels evaluated.  
There  were no effects on male or female fertility at clinically relevant doses.  
1.2.1.9  Safety Pharmacology  
The effects of VT -1161 on the neurological and pulmonary systems were ev aluated in 
Sprague -Dawley rats.  The data demonstrated that there were no VT ‑1161 -related effects in either 
the neuropharmacological or pulmonary studies in rats given an oral dose of up to 1 ,000 mg/kg 
VT-1161, the highest dose tested.  
Evaluation of cardi ovascular function in telemetered dogs revealed no treatment -related changes 
in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm or morphology, including the QT/QTc  (Fridericia 
correction)  interval, at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.  
1.2.1.10  In Vitro Cytochrome P450 Interactions  
VT-1161 inhibited cytochrome P450 enzymes with the following potencies:  
CYP1A2  (half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC50] ≥10 µM), CYP2B6 (IC 50 = 4.0 µM), 
CYP2C8 (IC 50 = 1.4 µM), CYP2C9 (IC 50 ≥10 µM), CYP2C19 (IC 50 = 9.7 µM), 
CYP2D6  (IC 50 = 9.4 µM), and CYP3A4 (IC 50 = 9.6 µM [testosterone], IC 50 ≥10 µM [midazolam]).  
Based on the high plasma protein binding of VT -1161, no clinically significant drug -drug 
interactions are expected.  
1.2.1.11  Effects of VT -1161 on Cardiac Repolarization  
An in vitro  human ether -à-go-go related gene study was conducted to assess the potential of 
VT-1161 to inhibit the repolarizing current of the cardiac action potentia l.  VT -1161 i nhibited the 
human ether -à-go-go related  gene potassium current by 94.7 ± 1.3% at 6 µM.  The  IC50 was 
calculated to be 1.9 µM (Hill coefficient = 2).  However, a cardiovascular safety study in dogs 
showed that VT -1161 was well tolerated and did not induce any deleterious cardiovascular effects 
or affect QT intervals at test doses of up to 300  mg/kg, the highest dose tested, with exposures 
reaching 24,000 ± 6,881 ng/mL at 30  hours post -dose.  
1.2.2 Clinical Studies  
1.2.2.1  Phase 1  Studies  
VT-1161 has been evaluated in 4 Phase 1 trials, a single ascending dose  trial, a multiple ascending 
dose trial , a DDI study with midazolam as a sensitive substrate , and an ethnic  PK study comparing 
Japanese and Western subjects .  The primary objectives of these studies were to evaluate the safety

1.2.2.1.1  Single  Dose -Escalation  Study (Stu dy VMT -VT-1161 -CL-001) 
Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-001 was a single -center, Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled, dose -escalating study in healthy adult subjects.  The study was designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of single oral  doses of VT -1161.  Sixty -four subjects (43 males and 
21 females) between 18 and 55 years of age were enrolled in 8 dose groups.  Within each dose -
group, 6 subjects received VT -1161 and 2  subjects  received placebo.  In the first 7  cohorts, 
escalating singl e oral doses (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg) or matching placebo were 
administered in the fasted state.  An 8th cohort received a single 320 mg oral dose of VT -1161 or 
matching placebo after ingesting a high -fat breakfast.  Subjects in Cohorts 1  to 6 were followed 
for 14 days for safety and PK assessments.  Visits on Days 28 and 42 were added for Cohorts 7 
and 8.  Dose escalation proceeded only after safety and PK of the previous dose was determined.   
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SA Es) reported.  There were no treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that led to discontinuation from the study.   
Overall, mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and electrocardiogram [ECG]s) were generally small and were considered not clinically 
significant.  None of the treatment -emergent physical examination abnormalities were of clinical 
significance.  The maximum tolerated dose for the study was the highest dose administered, 
320 mg, administered in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT ‑1161 in the fasted state, median time to reach maximum 
plasma concentration (T max) ranged from 4 to 10 hours.  Overall, C max increased slightly less than 
proportional to dose. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
infinity (AUC inf) values generally increased with increase in dose, ranging from an average of 
16,145 ng•hr/mL at 20 mg to 241,9 71 ng•hr/mL at 320 mg.  The mean half -life ranged from 393  to 
1,467 hours.  Administration of 320 mg VT -1161 with a standard high -fat meal resulted in higher 
plasma concentrations than those observed following 320 mg in the fasted state in a separate group  
of subjects.  Average fasting C max was 338 ng/mL and this increased to 988  ng/mL in the fed state.  
AUC inf also increased from 241,971 ng•hr/mL when subjects were fast ed to 953,119 ng•hr/mL 
with a high -fat meal.

Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-002 was a Phase 1, single -center, randomized, double blind, placebo -
controlled, multiple dose -escalating study in healthy adult subjects.  The study was designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple o ral doses of VT -1161.  In addition to plasma 
PK, concentrations of VT -1161 in nails and skin were assessed.  A total of 32 subjects participated 
in the study and received VT -1161 at 40, 80, 160 or 320 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days after 
ingestion of a high -fat meal.  In each cohort of 8 subjects, 6 subjects received VT -1161, and 2 
subjects received placebo.  Subjects were followed for safety and PK assessments for 42  days after 
the last dose of study drug.  
There were no deaths or SAEs reported.  Most TEAEs were mild in intensity and no severe TEAEs 
were reported.  
Mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, 
vital signs, and ECGs) were generally small and not considered clinically significant.  There w as 
no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -1161 on physical examinations in any dose 
group at any time point.  The maximum tolerated dose for the study was the highest dose 
administered, 320 mg, administered once daily  for 7  days in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT -1161 in the fed state, median T max values ranged from 4 to 
6 hours after dosing.  The increase in mean C max was nearly proportional to dose over the 40 to 
320 mg dose range.  The concentrations were 3 to 4 -fold hi gher on Day 7 than they were on Day  1, 
indicating accumulation during the 7 -day dosing interval, with a mean C max of 3,300  ng/mL on 
Day 7 at 320 mg.  The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing 
interval (AUC τ) values on Day 7 also increased nearly proportionally to dose over the 40 to 320  mg 
dose range.  The mean half -life ranged from 1,905 to 3,046 hours.   
1.2.2.1.3  Drug-Drug Interaction  Study  (Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-007) 
Study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-007 was a Phase 1, single -center, open -label study in healthy adult 
subjects to evaluate the effect of single and multiple oral doses of VT ‑1161 when co -administered 
with single oral doses of midazolam (DDI cohort) and to evaluate the PK of a single oral dose of 
an alternate strength of VT -1161 alone (pharmacokinetic evaluation [PKE] cohort).  All dosing 
was conducted 30 minutes after the start of a high -fat, high -calorie meal.  A total of 36 subjects 
were enrolled in the study.   
In the DDI cohort, 28 subjects were enrolled in a fixed -sequence design to receive a 2 -mg oral 
dose of midazolam on Day 1, followed by 14 daily 600 mg oral doses of VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg

35 tablets) on Day 3 through Day 16 with single 2 mg oral doses of midazolam on D ay 3 and Day  16.  
Subjects were followed for safety, tolerability and PK assessments through Day 17, 1 day after the 
last dose of study drug.  Twenty -four subjects in the DDI cohort completed the study and 4 subjects 
withdrew from the study prior to comple tion; 2 subjects voluntarily withdrew consent and 
2 subjects withdrew due to an AE (discussed in more detail below).   
There were no deaths reported in the study.  One SAE (acute psychosis) was reported in a subject 
in the DDI cohort on Day 11 of the study , leading to discontinuation.  The Investigator determined 
the subject likely had a pre -existing psychiatric condition based on patient report and assessed 
causality as unlikely -related to VT -1161.  One additional subject in the DDI cohort withdrew from 
the study due to an AE of abnormal ECG on Day 3 of the study.  The AE occurred prior to the first 
dose of VT -1161; the Investigator assessed causality as unrelated to study drug.  Otherwise, mean 
changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemis try, coagulation, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and ECGs) in both the DDI and PKE cohorts were generally small and not considered 
clinically significant and there was no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -1161 on 
physical examinations in either  cohort.  
In the DDI cohort, midazolam mean plasma C max increased 30% and AUC inf decreased 15% on 
Day 3 (after the first dose of VT ‑1161) relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  Midazolam mean 
plasma C max decreased 3% and AUC inf decreased 37% on Day 16 (after  14 daily doses of VT ‑1161) 
relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  
In the PKE cohort, 8 subjects were enrolled to receive a single 600 mg oral dose of VT -1161 (2 x 
300 mg tablets) on Day 1.  Subjects in the PKE cohort were followed for safety, tolerability a nd 
PK assessments through Day 2, 1 day after the dose of study drug.  All 8 subjects in the PKE 
cohort completed the study.  VT -1161 mean plasma C max and AUC 0-24 values after a single oral 
administration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (2 x 300 mg) on Day 1 were 1,946 n g/mL and 
28,070  ng•hr/mL, respectively.  These values are similar to VT -1161 mean plasma C max and 
AUC 0-24 values after a single oral administration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg) in the DDI 
cohort (1,994 ng/mL and 25,330 ng•hr/mL, respectively), indicating  the comparative 
bioavailability of the 2 strengths of tablets is similar.

36 oral doses of VT -1161 administered in the fed state.   There w as a total of 51 subjects enrolled. 
In the 300-mg dosage -group, there were 13 Japanese and 14 Western subjects.   In the 600  mg 
dosage group , there were 12 Japanese and 12 Western subjects.   The mean age of subjects was 
36.5 years, ranging from 19 to 55  years  across treatment groups.   The subjects were evenly divided 
by sex across all groups and the race of the Western subjects was evenly divided by white and 
black.   
The study drug was overall well tolerated by both Western and Japanese subjects.  There were n o 
significant differences between the 2 populations in any of the safety assessments.  A slight 
increase in AEs was seen in the 600  mg dosage group as compared with the 300  mg dosage group, 
but no SAEs were observed.   Only 1 subject was withdrawn from the study for a n AE of  rash 
(subject request), which was categorized as an unlikely -related TEAE.  There was 1 pregnancy in 
a subject who was non -compliant with contraception requirements, which was electively 
terminated by the subject.  
Of the 51 subjects enro lled in the study, 11 Japanese subjects from both dose groups and 
12 Western subjects from both dose groups were included in the full PK analysis population. 
Trough concentrations on Days 1 through 14 rose each day; thus, steady -state conditions had not 
been met by Day 14.  Larger differences between the 2 ethnic groups were seen in C max and 
AUC 0-72 following the 300  mg dose compared with the 600  mg dose. At the 300  mg dose, C max and 
AUC 0-72 were approximately 40% higher in Japanese subjects compared with W estern subjects. 
At the 600 -mg dose, C max and AUC 0-72 were approximately 10% higher in Japanese subjects 
compared with Western subjects. However, median T max was similar across doses at 4 hours for 
Japanese subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg dosages an d 6 hours for Western subjects at both 
the 300  mg and 600 mg dosages. The terminal elimination phase was very flat and half-life 
exceeded 1800 hours. Total clearance following the 300 -mg dose was 1.642 L/hr for the Japanese 
subjects compared with 2.332 L/h r for the Western subjects.  Following the 600  mg dose, clearance 
was similar for the Japanese and Western subjects (2.000 and 2.086  L/hr, respectively).

10 days  (high dose ; or 4) placebo matching the VT -1161 treatment regimen.  VT-1161 plasma 
concentrations increased with dose and were as high as 6,230 n g/mL on  Day 14 in the 600  mg 
twice daily/300 mg once daily  dose group.  Subjects were enrolled into the high -dose cohort 
following an interim analysis that included safety data generated through the test of cure ( TOC ) 
visit (Day 42) of the 2 lower dose groups.   
VT-1161 was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow up.  No SAEs 
were reported.  Most AEs reported were mild to moderate in severity  and considered unrelated to 
study drug .  A single VT-1161 treatment related AE was reported (r ash) that was considered by 
the Investigator to be “possibly related.”  The subject discontinued treatment after the first dose, 
and the rash completely resolved by the following day.  There were no clinically significant 
treatment -emergent changes in vita l signs, physical findings, ECGs, or laboratory parameters.  
One subject experienced a significant elevation of creatine kinase ( CK) along with a slight  increase  
in ALT and AST that was associated with a rigorous exercise program.  These changes were 
consi dered unrelated to treatment and all enzyme levels returned to normal at a subsequent follow -
up visit.   
At the Day 42 TOC visit, 42%, 42%, 50% and 0% of subjects receiving low dose, mid -dose or 
high dose VT -1161 or placebo  were determined to have achieved  effective therapeutic cure 
(defined as having a total severity score of ≤2 with no individual severity score of >1, and  also, 
having negative mycology [culture and KOH]) in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population.

VMT -VT-1161 -CL-004 was a randomized Phase 2a, double -blind, dose ranging study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of VT -1161 over -encapsulated tablets compared to fluconazole in the 
treatment of 55 subjects with moderate to severe acute VVC.  A total of 55 subjects with moderate -
to-severe acute VVC (severity score ≥6 and a positive fungal KOH test) participated in the study 
across 4 dose groups: 1) VT  1161 300  mg once daily for 3 days, 2) 600  mg o nce daily  for 3 days, 
3) 600 mg twice daily  for 3  days, or 4) a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg followed by matching 
placebo.  Subjects were enrolled into the high -dose cohort following an interim analysis that 
included safety data generated through the TOC visit (Day 28) of the 2 lower dose groups.  
An additional interim analysis was conducted when the high -dose subjects had completed their 
TOC visit.

38 VT-1161 was determined to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through Day 28.  No SAEs 
were reported and no subjects discontinued because of an AE.   Most AEs reported were considered 
unrelated to study drug and were mild in severity.  There were few treatment -related TEAEs of 
clinical concern.  Most TEAEs were reported in the low - and mid -dose co horts and only 1 TEAE 
(insomnia) was noted in the high -dose cohort.  One subject developed urticaria that was considered 
possibly related to study drug and which resolved with prednisone.  There were no clinically 
significant treatment -emergent changes in vital signs, physical findings, ECGs or laboratory 
parameters.  
The efficacy of VT -1161 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe acute VVC was evaluated at the 
TOC visit in the ITT population (defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least 1 dose of 
study drug) and the per protocol ( PP) population (defined as subjects that were compliant with all 
key aspects of the protocol).  Subjects in the ITT population were rando mized into the 
VT-1161  300 mg once daily  for 3 days (n  = 14), VT -1161 600 mg once daily  for 3  days (n  = 12), 
VT-1161 600 mg twice daily  for 3 days (n  = 14) or fluconazole (n =  15).  Effective clinical cure 
rate (defined as having a total severity score of 0 or 1 and a negative culture) were 29%, 83%, 86% 
and 73%, respectively.  Subjects in t he PP population achieved effective therapeutic cure at a rate 
of approximately 87%, 86%, 86% and 75%, respectively, in the low -dose, mid -dose, or high -dose 
VT-1161 or fluconazole groups at the Day 28 TOC visit.

39 • Matching placebo  
Subjects in all cohorts were followed for 60 weeks.  Consenting subjects were enrolled into an 
extension study to assess the long -term safety and PK of VT -1161 through Week 96.   
The incidence of  adverse events  (AEs) was balanced across the VT -1161 treatme nt arms and 
placebo.    A total of 148 subjects (57%) had at least 1 TEAE, and the frequency was within the 
range of 49% to 67% for all treatment groups.  The majority  of TEAEs were considered by the 
Investigator to be mild or moderate and unrelated to stu dy drug.  Most TEAEs were transient and 
occurred during the first 12  weeks of treatment for all treatment groups, including placebo.   
Nineteen subjects reported related TEAEs through Week 60.  Sixteen subjects were on VT -1161 
and three subjects were on pla cebo.  The only related TEAE reported by more than 2 subjects was 
nausea.  Eleven subjects reported a total of 16 SAEs, which were considered unrelated to study 
drug.   
The incidence of study drug related TEAEs was within the range of 6% to 11% for all tre atment 
groups, with the highest frequency in the 600 mg 24 -week group.  The most common (≥2 total 
subjects) TEAEs that were considered related to VT -1161 were nausea, dysgeusia, dizziness, 
constipation, and decreased appetite.  The most common TEAE that wa s considered related to 
placebo was dizziness.  
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was low, in the range of 0% to 6% 
for all treatment groups.  
There were no clinically -relevant findings noted by the Investigators with vital signs, physical 
exam findings or ECGs.  
There was no obvious clinically -relevant effect of VT -1161 on chemistry, hematology or urinalysis 
parameters.  
Overall, VT -1161 was safe and well -tolerated at all doses and treatment durations including the 
highest dose and longest duration evaluated of 600 mg 24 -week treatment group.  The TEAEs 
were typical of the subject population being studied and were generally balanced across the 
VT -1161 treatment and placebo group.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was complete cure at Wee k 48.  The proportion of subjects in the 
ITT population with complete cure at Week 48 ranged from 32% to 42% in the VT -1161 treatment 
groups, with the lowest rate in the 300 mg 12 –week treatment group and the highest rate in the

40 600 mg 12 –week treatment gr oup. No subjects receiving placebo experienced complete cure at 
Week 48.   The proportion of ITT subjects with complete cure was statistically significantly higher 
for all VT -1161 treatment groups compared with placebo at Week 48 (p<0.001).  
Overall, the eff icacy at Week 48 was clearly demonstrated in all the VT -1161 treatment groups, 
with little to no improvement seen in the placebo group.

In this Phase 2b study, the safety, tolerability, P K and efficacy of VT -1161 in subjects with 
recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis was evaluated.   A total of 215 subjects participated in the study , 
were randomized to 5 treatment  groups and were administered either:  
• Low dose 12 -week: Loading doses of 150 mg o nce daily for 7 days , then 150 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks.  
• Low dose 24 -week: Loading doses of 150 mg once daily for 7 days , then 150 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• High dose 12 -week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7  days, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks.  
• High dose 24 -week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7 days , then 300 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• Matching placebo  
In general,  the incidence of AEs was balanced across the VT -1161 treatment arms and placebo. 
Two subjects discontinued VT -1161 because of a TEAE.  Of these two, only one TEAE was 
considered related to VT-1161  by the study investigator .  Most TEAEs were considered unrelated 
to study drug and were mild or moderate in severity.  Six SAEs were reported  through Week 48 
of the study, none of which were considered related to study drug by the investigator.  Interestingly, 
a higher incidence of bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections was reported in the placebo 
arm.   
There were no clinically -relevant findings noted by the investigators  regarding  vital signs, physical 
exam findings or ECGs.  There was no obvious clinically -relevant effect of VT -1161 on chemistry, 
hematology or urinalysis p arameters.

41 The primary efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -
verified acute VVC episodes during the Maintenance Phase through Week 48 of the study  in the 
ITT population.   Culture -verified acute VVC was defined as a positive fungal culture for Candida 
species associated with a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3.   The proportion of su bjects 
with one or more culture -verified acute VVC episode through Week 48 was lower in VT -1161 
dosing regimens : 4.8%  in 150 mg 1 2 weeks, 7.0% in 150 mg 24 weeks, 0.0% in 300 mg 12 weeks, 
and 4.9% in 300 mg 24 weeks, treatment group s compared with 52.2%  in the placebo group . 
The difference was statistically significant in the VT -1161 dosing regimens compared with 
placebo (p<0.0001).  
In conclusion, VT -1161 was determined to be efficacious, safe and well tolerated at all dose levels 
through the final visit at Week 48 of the study.  
1.3 Study Rationale  
RVVC  can be treated with topical and/or oral agents  and patients may  receive m aintenance 
treatment for up to 6 months or longer once the acut e infection has resolved.  F or most patients, 
available agents do not provide the desired delay to recurrence of an acute VVC episode, 
underlining the need for more effective treatments for RVV C.  Fluconazole has been used to treat 
acute VVC episodes in patients with recurrent disease. However , fluconazole has relatively lesser  
activity against  some  non-albicans species that are more common in patients with complicated 
VVC.  
While oral antifungal  agents offer better efficacy, they suffer from safety issues associated with 
their narrow therapeutic windows and off target toxicity.   Several properties  of VT -1161 suggest 
that it has the potential to be a best -in-class oral agent for the treatment of R VVC , including its 
ability to effectively inhibit growth of causative fungal pathogens at achievable plasma levels .  
The in vitro potency against Candida species is greater than fluconazole.  Also, because it is much 
more selective for fungal CYP51 and CYP  metabolizing enzymes than currently used oral agents, 
the probability of both hepatotoxicity and DDIs should be significantly reduced.  Its  PK profile 
and extended half -life should also limit recurrence of VVC.   A weekly dosing regimen after the 
loading d ose may improve patient compliance.  
1.3.1 Rational e for Induction Phase Treatment  
Fluconazole is an approved  treatment for  acute VVC and is used off -label to treat patients with 
recurrent disease.  The proposed dose regim en of 3 doses of fluconazole tak en 72 hours apart 
corresponds to a  regimen that is often used as the standard of care and has been regularly employed

42 during the induction phase of similar clinical studies designed to study RVVC .  Treatment of the 
acute infection with fluconazole in t he Induction Phase allows for a more controlled assessment of 
recurrence in the VT -1161 treatment group versus placebo.  
1.3.2 Dosing Regimen for VT -1161 and Matching Placebo  
Following cure of the acute infecti on by 3 doses of fluconazole every 72 hours, subjects wil l be 
randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatment groups :  
• VT-1161: Loading dose of 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150  mg once weekly for 
11 weeks.  
• Placebo: Matching VT -1161 capsule s. 
The rational e for dose selection is provided in Section 4.4 , Design Justification .     
1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits of Participating in the Study  
The Phase 1, Phase 2a , and Phase  2b studies with VT -1161 incorporated monitoring for AEs often 
reported with other azole antifungal drugs.  No clinically significant study drug related AEs were 
observed in clinical studies with VT -1161 , suggesting that it may be better tolerated than 
comm only used azole agents.

45 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, paral lel-group study. 
The stud y is designed to  evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral VT -1161 capsules in the treatment 
of subjects with RVVC.  The impact of oral VT -1161 treatment  on the quality of life  will also be 
evaluated us ing data collected from patien t reported outcome assessments.  
Subject s must have a history of RVVC , defined as at least 3 episodes of acute VVC in the past 
12 months , as described below:   
• Subjects must have an acute  VVC episode at the time of Screening,  with a documented positive 
KOH  or Gram stain  performed at the  investigative  site 
• Subjects must also have had 2 or more  additional  episodes of acute VVC in the past 12 months , 
with at least 1 of the episodes documented by a positive confirmatory laboratory test (i.e., 
cultur e, PCR, Affirm test, KOH test, Gram stain, a documented Pap  test, or other approved 
diagnostic test)  
The study consists of two Phases: 1) an open -label Induction Phase for the treatment of the acute 
VVC infection with 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of fluconazole, and 
2) a Maintenance Phase in which subjects will be randomly assigned to receive VT-1161 or 
placebo  for 7 daily doses followed by 11 weekly doses  and then enter a 36 -week follow -up period . 
Once subjects hav e provided informed con sent or assent ( for those ages 12 to 17), the 
investigational site will evaluate all subjects  by completing a review of pertinent medical history, 
obtaining vital signs,  weight and height, ECG and laboratory tests,  reviewing clinical signs and 
symptoms of vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum 
examination of the vagina, perform ing a KOH wet mount test or Gram stain from a vaginal smear  
to confirm the presence of yeast , and collect ing vaginal swabs to establish a baseline  culture  for 
identif ication of fungal species . Patient reported outcome survey s (SF-36, EQ-5D-3L or EQ -5D-
Y [for ages 12 to 17 ], WPAI :SHP , PHQ -9) for all regions and questions regarding their RVVC 
history (US only) will also be administ ered. Eligible subjects will have a composite vulvovaginal  
signs and symptom score of ≥3  as outlined in Section 9.1.7 , a positive local KOH or Gram stain 
that confirmed the presence of yeast, and must meet other ini tial entry criteria .  
Once eligibility is confirmed, sub jects will enter the Induction P hase.  During the Induction Phase, 
the presenting acute VVC infection  will be treated with 3 se quential 150 mg oral doses

fluconazole for evaluati on and, if the acute VVC infection  has resolved (defined by a signs and 
symptoms score of <3), they will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either VT -1161 or a 
matchi ng placebo regimen .  Day 1  (Baseline)  is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP)  administration and subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive 
days thereafter.   If the acute VVC has not resolved  (define d by a signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3), 
the subject will be considered a screen failure and encouraged  to see their physician for further 
evaluation and follow -up care . 
4.2 Treatment Arms and Duration of Study  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VT-1161 or placebo.  
The duration of individual subject participation will be approximately 50 weeks: including the 
2-week Induction Phase  with fluconazole administration , followed by 12 weeks for IMP 
administration, and 36  weeks of follow -up. Assessments and procedures will be performed as 
outlined in   Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  Subjects  who return to the clinic 
for a recurrent VVC episode should be evaluated as per the unscheduled visit  noted in  the Schedule 
of Assessment and Procedures . 
The planned study duration is 26 months from Screening of the first subject until the last follow -up 
of the last subject.  
4.3 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 600 screened and 300 randomized subje cts are planned for this study.  Assuming 
a 20% discontinuation rate for the remainder of the study, approximately 240  subjects are expected 
to complete the study.  
Subjects will be enrolled at 60 to 80  sites in  North America  and Europe.  
4.4 Design Justification  
The VT -1161 dose and duration selection in the planned Phase 3 studies is based primarily on the 
results of VMT -VT-1161 -CL-006; “A Phase 2, Randomized, Double Bli nd, Placebo -Controlled, 
Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of VT -1161 Oral Tablets in the Treatment 
of Patients with Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis .”   The study was designed to be consistent 
with the principles put forth in the ICH  E4 Guideline, “Dose -Response Information to Support 
Drug Registration.”

47 Given VT -1161’s large therapeutic window and favorable safety profile as demonstrated in the 
single - and multiple -ascending dose Phase 1 studies as well as Phase 2a studies, the Pha se 2b 
RVVC study was designed to demonstrate prolonged remission following short courses of 
VT-1161 dosing.    
The proportion of subjects in the ITT population with one or more culture verified acute VVC 
episodes through Week 48 was lower in  the VT 1161  dose groups; 4.8% in the 150 mg/12 -week, 
7.1% in the 150 mg/24 -week, 0.0% in the 300 mg/12 -week, and 4.9% in the 300 mg/24 -week 
treatment group s, compared to 52.2% in the placebo group.  This difference was statistically 
significant in all VT -1161 groups com pared to placebo (p<0.0001) .  However, the study was not 
designed to demonstrate a statistical  difference between the VT -1161 dosing regimens.  
In the PP population, the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -verified acute VVC 
episodes through We ek 48 in VT -1161 dos e groups were 3.3% in the 150 mg/12 -week, 10.7% in 
the 150 mg/24 -week, 0.0% in the 300 mg/12 -week, and 0.0% in the 300 mg/24 -week treatment 
groups, compared to 65.6% in the placebo group, indicating a numerically higher rate of recurren ce 
in the lower VT -1161 dose groups.   A similar trend was observed in subjects wit h one or more 
positive  cultures through Week 48; 13.3% in the 150 mg/12 -week; 25.0% in the 150 mg/24 -week; 
16.1% in the 300 mg/12 -week ; and 3.2% in the 300 mg/24 -week treatment groups, compared to 
84% in the placebo group.  The mean plasma concentra tions for the VT -1161 150 mg/12 -week 
treatment group was 1.3 µg/mL at the start of weekly dosing (Day 7), 2.6 µg/mL at the end of the 
dosing phase (Week 12), and was followed  by a slow decay to reach 0.75 µg/mL at Week 48. 
Based on the PP analysis , it appears that the 150 mg/12 -week treatment group is at or near a 
minimally effective dose and duration of therapy.  
In the Kaplan -Meier analysis  (ITT population) , most recurrent ep isodes occurred in the early phase 
of the study.  In total, 7 subjects across all the VT -1161 dose groups exhibited a  culture -verified 
recurrence  while on study  with 5 of 7 subjects having a recurrence in the first 5 weeks of the study.  
Notably, 3 of the se 5 subjects (all in the 150 mg group) experienced a recurrence by Day 7.   
Taken  together, the data suggest  that these subjects in the VT-1161 low dose (150  mg) treatment 
groups may have not attain ed effective therapeutic drug levels early enough to preve nt the early 
recurrences .  Therefore, a lower  than 150 mg  VT-1161 starting dose cannot be justified given the 
potential that more patients would experience recurrence, especially for less susceptible non -
albicans  strains.    
The dose selection for the Phase  3 study is further supported by the safety and tolerability profile 
of VT -1161.   The frequency of AEs across all VT -1161 treatment groups in the Phase  2b study

48 was similar to the placebo group.  There were  also no meaningful differences observed between 
placebo and the VT-1161 treatment  groups  in other safety parameters including chemistry, 
hematology and ECG analyses .  To that end, from a safety  perspective  any of the dosing group s 
tested in the Phase 2b study could be potentially selected for the Phase 3 studies.  This  is important 
since, in addition to exhibiting excellent safety and tolerability, all VT -1161 treatment groups also 
achieved clinical outcomes that were far superior to fluconazole historic data where approximately 
60% of RVVC patient s experienced one or more acute  culture -verified  VVC recurrences within 6 
month s after the cessation of weekly prophylactic/maintenance therapy .  (Sobel et al. 2004 ).    
The proposed dosing regimen for the Phase 3 studies, inc orporates a 7 -day 150 mg loading  dose 
phase  to minimize early breakthroughs, followed by a 150 mg once weekly maintenance dose  
phase  for 11 weeks .  Based on the PK results from the Phase 2b study, the proposed dosing regimen 
of 150 mg daily for 7 days foll owed by a 150 mg once weekly maintenance dose is expected to 
provide a mean plasma concentration of approximately 2.5 µg/m L at the end of the dosing period 
(Week 12).  
4.4.1 Justification for Inclusion of Adolescents in the Study  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis , and esp ecially RVVC, is  rare in pre -menarch eal girls (typically pre -
adolescents less than 12 years of age) and epidemiological data is generally lacking for this 
population.  
Adolescent females  (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive)  represent a menarch eal population that is 
newly influenced by reproductive hormones. The changes in  reproductive hormones in adolescents 
cause  vast changes in tissues and may increase the  susceptibility to VVC . In this population, cases 
of VVC and RVVC exist but are substantial ly less common than in adult females. While 75% of 
healthy women will likely experience one episode of VVC  in their lifetime , and potentially 9% 
will be characterized as having recurrent disease , the prevalence of symptomatic acute VVC in 
adolescents is le ss than 2% of the population  and there is  no publish ed data that address es the 
incidence of RVVC in this patient population  (Fidel, 200 2; Blostein, 2017; Barousse, 2004 ). 
Presenting symptoms of VVC in menarch eal adolescents are similar to those in the adult 
population, and treatment typically consists of topical antifungal preparations  while  oral antifungal  
agents are prescribed  only in severe or complicated cases  (Joishy, 2005 ). The dose  and 
administration of the agents used in adolescents are the same as those used in adult females with 
VVC and RVVC.

49 The United States FDA Draft Guidance Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: Developing Drugs for 
Treatment  states that while uncomplicated VVC is unlikely to occur in healthy pre -menarch eal 
girls, post-menarch eal adolescent girls with VVC should be included in Phase 3 trials. 
Accordingly, the present study  will follow guidance  received by the  United States FDA reviewers  
and will allow  enrollment of subjects 12 to 17 years of age (inclusive) to collect as much 
information as possible on the treatment of the adolescent population with RVVC . 
In Hungary , Romania,  Ukraine, and Czech Republic, only subjects 18 years of age or older will 
be enrolled in the study .

57 7 TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
7.1 Investigational Medicinal Product Administration and Dosing Schedule  
7.1.1 Induction Phase (Screening to  Day 1  Pre-Randomization ) 
All subjects will receive 3 sequential 150 mg doses of fluconazole that are administered 72 hours 
apart.  
Regarding the dosing of fluconazole in adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age, inclusive), 
fluconazole exposure  at the planned dose is anticipated to be similar to that in adults and 
proportional to weight. AEs associated with fluconazole would also be expected to be similar in 
adolescents as in adults. There are currently no United States  FDA - or European -approved dose s 
or regimen s of fluconazole for treatment of VVC or RVVC in adolescents. While the U nited States 
FDA -approved  labeling for fluconazole ( Diflucan, Pfizer 2017 ) is silent on treatment of 
adolescents with VVC, the European  prescribing information for fluconazole ( Diflucan® Summary 
of Product Characteristics [2017 ]) provides the following guidance ; “If treatment is imperative in 
adolescents (from 12 to 17 years old), the posology should be the same as in the adult population.”  
Therefore, a dolescent subjects (ages 12 to 17 years) enrolled in the study will receive the same 
150 mg doses of fluconazole as adult subjects.  
In Hungary , Romania,  Ukraine, and Czech Republic,  only subjects 18 years of age or older  will 
be enrolled in  the study.  
7.1.2 Maintenance Phase ( Day 1 Post Randomization  to Week 12)  
Subjects will receive either:  
• 150 mg once daily dose of VT -1161 for 7 days followed by a 150-mg once weekly dose of 
VT-1161 for 1 1 weeks, or  
• a matching placebo regimen for 12 weeks.   
All subjects will take  1 capsule  once daily on Days 1 to 7 and 1 capsule  once weekly starting at 
Week 2  (7 days after the completion of daily dosing) through Week 12 of the study.   
Subjects will be instructed  to take the doses of VT -1161 within 30 minutes after ingestion of the 
subject’s main meal  (as determined by the subject) , at approximately the same time of the day 
consistently  throughout the study .  Subjects should consume approximately 240 mL 
(approximately 8 oz.) of water with each dose of IMP.

58 Using similar  rationale as above for fluconazo le, the exposure after dosing of VT -1161 at 150 mg 
doses is anticipated to be similar in adolescents as in adults and proportional to weight. Therefore, 
adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years)  enrolled into the study  will receive the same dosing regimen as 
adult  subjects. It should also be noted that the U nited States FDA has reviewed this protocol and 
accepted  the planned dosing regimen  for fluconazole and  VT-1161 in adolescent subjects . 
7.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Each s ubject who completes  the study Screening  assessments, meets all eligibility criteria, and is 
accepted for the study will be assigned a unique sequential identification number and will receive 
the corresponding treatment according to the randomization scheme described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  For more information on subject randomization, see Section 7.7.  
7.3 Dose Interruptions and Modifications  
If any subject experiences a Grade 3 AE that is considered possibly  related , or related to IMP , 
dosing  will be discontinued in that subject and the AE will be followed until resolution  (refer to  
Section 9.2  for AE reporting ).  Dosing of IMP will not be  re-initiated in any subject who 
experiences a possibly related or related Grade 3 AE.  Although these subjects should stop the 
study drug, they are encouraged to return for their remaining study visits.  Elevation in laboratory 
values that do not require medical or surgical treatment or discontinuation from the study will not 
be considered AEs (Section 9.2.1 ). 
If any subject experiences a  Grade 4 AE that is considered possibly related or related to IMP,  the 
subject  may be unblinded  at the discretion of the Investigator  and dosing of IMP will be 
discontinued and the AE will be followed until resolution.  Dosing of IMP will not be re -initiated 
in any subject who experiences a possibly related or related Grade 4 AE. 
7.4 Prohibited  and Permitted  Medications/Non -Medications  
All medications taken 30 days prior to the Screening visit including all prescription and non -
prescription medications (e.g., herbal and/or vitamin supplements), t hrough the End of Study 
(EOS ) visit will be recorded  for each subject .  
All concomitant therapies and  proce dures (including any surgical and  diagnostic procedures) that 
were performed 72 hours prior to Screening  through the EOS visit will be recorded  for each 
subject .

59 7.4.1 Prohibited Medications/Non -Medications  
The following prescription and over -the-counter drug products are prohibited during the study  and 
will be considered a protocol deviation : 
1. Topical or oral antifungal drugs ( with the exception of fluconazole when prescribed by the 
Investigator to treat a  subject with a recurrent  VVC episode ; refer to Section 8.1.12  on 
treatment options if fluconazole is ineffective) .  
2. Topical products applied to the vulva or vagina (e.g. antibiotic, antitrichomonal, 
corticosteroid s, or anti -inflammatory  agents ). 
3. Oral antib acterial or antitrichomonal agents for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, 
trichomonas, or other concomitant (urogenital) infection unless prescribed by the Investigator.  
4. Oral or injectable corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drugs for the duration of t he study. Use 
of topical (no vulvar or vaginal steroids), inhaled, ophthalmic, collunarium/nasal, or 
intraarticular and intralesional steroids is permitted.  
5. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolized by CYP3A4  and sensitive to the 
induction  of CYP3A4  (carbamazepine,  cyclosporine, fentanyl, quinidine, sirolimus and 
tacrolimus).  
6. Vaginal douches or benzalkonium chloride disinfectant during the study.  
7.4.2 Permitted Medications/Non -Medications  
The Investigator may prescribe  a single dose of fluconazole to treat an acute VVC recurrence  
during the Maintenance Phase , when confirmed by a positive local KOH  or Gram stain  showing 
presence of yeast and  clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3. 
Medications to treat any AEs the subject  experiences during the study are permitted .  If a subject 
is unable to comply with the excluded medications criteria  (Section 7.4.1 ), the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be re -evaluated by the Investigator , in consultation with Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor.

60 7.6 Replacement of Study Subjects   
Any subject who receives ≥1 dose of study drug will be considered evaluable and will not be 
replaced.  
7.7 Randomization and Blinding  
A randomized design through an interactive web response system  (IWRS)  will be used to assign 
subjects in a 2:1 ratio to the dose regimen  of VT -1161 or placebo.  Day 1  (Baseline)  is defined as 
the first day of VT -1161/Placebo administration and subsequent study days are defined by the 
number of consecutive days thereafter.  
The subjects, study I nvestigators and their staff, all clinical staff  members within Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals , the clinical study monitor, the study p roject team, and the study Medical 
Monitor (s) will remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until  the co mpletion of the 
study.  The Unblinded Statistician responsible for creating the final randomization list and the 
IWRS personnel responsible for loading the final randomization list into the IWRS  will be 
unblinded to the treatments .  The bioanalytica l personnel responsible for assay of VT -1161 in 
plasma samples will also  be unblinded to subject treatments.  
7.8 Conditions for Breaking the Blind  
In the event the breaking of the blind is required, the following will apply:  
• The Investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an 
emergency  (i.e., a Grade 4 AE)  OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge 
of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the 
subject as judg ed by the Investigator  (ICH GCP 4.3.1 ). If the SAE requires that an expedited 
regulatory report be sent to 1 or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the 
subject’s treatment assignment, may be sent to Investigators in accordance with local 
regulations.  
• The Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor or appropriate Mycovia  Pharmaceutic als 
study personnel to communicate the reasons for  unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment  
immediately after the unblinding occurred  (ICH GCP 4.7) . 
• If unblinding is required, t he Mycovia Pharmaceuticals’  Medical Monitor  and Investigator  will 
be provided with the treatment assigned to the subject. The Investigator  must NOT disclose 
the treatment assignment to the subjec t and/or other study personnel including other site

77 If a subject has a recurrent acute VVC episode prior to  the end of treatment at Week 12 , the 
subject will continue her as signed treatment through Week 12  and will receive one dose of 
fluconazole  to treat her acute VVC  infection .  Throughout the Maintenance Phase, the 
Investigator is to prescribe one dose of fluconazole to treat the acute VVC episode , once 
confirmed by a  positive  KOH or Gram stain to show  presence of yeast  and if the  clinical signs 
and symptoms  score is ≥3.  If the subject  fails to respond to fluconazole treatment, the 
Investigator may employ treatment options corresponding  to the site’s standard of care 
treatment for treating the infection upon consult ation  with the Medical Monitor.  
If a subjec t comes in for an unscheduled visit to repeat  a procedure  (i.e., ECG, safety labs, 
etc.), only those  specific  procedures need to be performed, along with collection of any changes 
in medical treatments, medications and collection of any AEs. 
If subjects experience any AEs other than a potential recurrent VVC episode they may be 
evaluated at the site at the Investigators discretion.  
8.2 Exercise  
Subjects  will be encouraged, if possible, to avoid engaging in strenuous activity within 
48 hours prior to study visits .  Walking at a normal pace during these periods is acceptable.

79 9.1.5 Laboratory Determinations  
After the Baseline (Day 1)  visit, laboratory test values that fall outside the reference range on 
the laboratory reports and are d eemed clinically significant by  the Investigator may be repeated 
at the discretion of the Investigator.   Those values deemed clinically significant should be 
followed until resolution  or permanent documented change in medical history.     
The following labo ratory samples will be obtained at times specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures  and analyzed by the central laboratory : 
9.1.5.1  Pregnancy Testing  
All WOCBP  must undergo urine and serum  pregnancy testing at Screening and Baseline to 
assess protocol eligibility.  Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at every  study visit.  
Serum pregnancy tes ts will be performed  periodically throughout the study  as specified in the  
Schedule of Assessments and Procedures . 
9.1.5.2  Immunology  
HIV antibody, H bsAg, anti -HCV at Screening.  Laboratory results are not required prior to

A local KOH wet mount test or Gram stain will be  performed locally at the Screening  visit and 
at unscheduled visits where a recurrent VVC episode  is suspected .  The investigative site is to 
use the same local mycology test (KOH  wet mount  or Gram stain) consistently for all subjects 
throughout the study.    
A vaginal fungal culture will be obtain ed at Screening and all subsequent visits and sent to the 
central mycology laboratory for fungal identification and susceptibility testing according to 
approved C linical Laboratory Standards Institute  methods.  Subjects  should not be 
menstruating at time o f the study visits to ensure proper sample collection of the vaginal fluid.

81 9.1.7 Vulvovaginitis Clinical Assessment  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be evaluated at the Screening and each subsequent 
study visit.  Each of the following vulvovaginal signs a nd symptoms will be scored  and the 
individual scores combined for a maximum score of 18,  using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation  
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be objectively defined on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows:  
0 = none (complete absence of any signs or symptoms)  
1 = mild (slight)  
2 = moderate ( definitely present)  
3 = severe (marked, intense)  
9.2 Adverse Event  Reporting  
9.2.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
Monitoring of all AEs will be conducted throughout the study as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
An AE is any untoward, undesired, unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, symptoms, 
disease, or laboratory or p hysiological observations occurring in a human participating in a 
clinical study wi th a Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  product, regardless of causal relationship.  
A “pre-existing” condition is one that is present prior to the start of IMP administration  and is 
reported as part of the subject ’s medical history.   Pre-existing conditions should be reported as 
AEs only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre -existing condition worsens during 
the study.  
Any abnormal safety assessments , such as ECGs, radiol ogical  scans, vital sign measurements,  
that are judged by the I nvestigator to be clinically significant should be recorded as an AE or 
SAE provided it meets one of those definitions.   Laboratory abnormalities generally are not 
considered AEs unless they ar e associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical 
intervention.  A laboratory abnormality (e.g., a clinically significant change detected on 
clinical chemistry, hematology) that is independent from a known underlying medical 
condition and th at requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to IMP interruption or 
discontinuation, should  be considered an AE.

82 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied are not considered AEs unless their severity is greater 
than expected in the judgement of the Investigator .  
In addition, t he following apply:  
• All AEs, including clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities, will be documented as 
an AE and followed until resolution.  
• All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of taking  the first dose of  fluconazole  
until the last foll ow-up visit of the study, at the time points specifie d in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
• Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of fluconazole  but after obtaining informed 
consent should be reco rded in the medical history section of the eCRF.  
• Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects.  
However, if the Investigator  learns of an SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject 
has been discharged from t he study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to 
the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator  must promptly notify Mycovia 
Pharmaceuticals . 
9.2.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE occurring after the first administration  of fluconazole  that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Deatha 
• Is a life -threatening experienceb 
• Requires in patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacityc 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening , or 
require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to

83 prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above .  Example:  allergic bronchospasm requ iring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home.  
NOTES:  
a. “Death” is an outcome and is NOT the AE.  In the event of death, the cause of death should 
be recorded as the SAE.  The only exception is “sudden death” when the cause is unknown.  
b. Life-threa tening SAEs include any adverse drug experience, which, in the view of the 
Investigator, places the subject  at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurs.  It 
does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have c aused 
death.  
c. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
All SAEs, regardless of causal relation ship, must be reported to Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals 
(or designee) within 24 hours of the site’s know ledge of the event.   The initial report must be 
captured in the electronic SAE CRFs within 1 business day.  
The SAE report should provide as much of the required information as is available at the time.  
The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE:  subject  identification  
number , reporting source, and an event outcome.   Supplemental information may be entered 
into the electronic SAE CRFs  and should not delay the initial report.   Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  
(or designee) may contact the i nvestigational site to solicit additional information or to follow -
up on the event.  
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information will be 
treated as an SAE for the purposes of this protocol.  
All SAEs will be follow ed unt il resolution, return to b aseline (when worsening of a pre -existing 
condition is reported), or permanent documented change in medical history.  
All relevant documentation pertaining to the SAE (additional laboratory tests, consultation 
reports, discharge su mmaries, post -mortem reports, etc .) will be provid ed by the Investigator 
to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  (or designee) in a timely manner.

84 9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
Subjects should be instructed to report all AEs to the Investigator.  In addition, the Investigator 
should seek to elicit any clinical or objective reactions by open -ended questioning (“How have 
you been feeling?”) and, as appropriate, by examination.  All AE information obtained during 
the subject que stioning should be documented in the subjects’ clinical records and enter ed into 
the CRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed 
because of an AE should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis.  The 
component parts of the diagnosis may be listed for verification.  If the AE is a laboratory 
abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the 
syndrome or diagnosis rather than the individual laboratory abnormali ty.  It should also be 
documented, verbatim, dir ectly on the laboratory report.  
To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all AEs should be recorded in standard 
medical terminology on the CRF and on the medical record rather than in the subject ’s own 
words.   Each AE will also be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, 
association with the IMP, action(s) taken, and outcome.  
9.2.4 Severity of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be assessed by the Investigator or MD designee for severity, according 
to the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) Adult Toxicity Table, (Draft, 
November 2007) Appendix A .  For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value which is 
not addressed in the DMID Adult Toxicity Table, the most recent version of the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 published by the National Cancer 
Institute will be used.  
Where discrepancies in the ULN  and lower limit of normal  (LLN)  laboratory ranges occur 
between those included in the DMID and those of the central laboratory that performs the 
assays, the values provided by the central laboratory will be used for assignment of s everity 
grade.  
For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value not addressed in the DMID Adult 
Toxicity Table, the following general scale may be used with I nvestigator discretion to assign 
severity:  
• GRADE 1 Mild : An event easily tolerated by the subje ct; transient or mild discomfort 
(usually <  48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 IND 111675  
    Ver. 6 U.S. Only , 01 October 2019  
 
85 • GRADE 2 Moderate : An event that may interfere with normal, everyday activities; some 
assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy requi red. 
• GRADE 3 Severe : An event that prevented the subject  from performing their normal, 
everyday activities; some assistance usually required; medica l intervention/therapy 
required;  hospitalizations possible.  
• GRADE 4 Life -threatening : At the time of the eve nt the subject  was at risk of death or 
the event resulted in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• GRADE 5 Death : An event that resulted in death.  
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity category changes over 
several  days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
NOTE: An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity of an event (such as mild, moderate, o r severe 
myocardial infarction).  However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance, (such as a severe headache), and both AE(s) and SAE(s) can be assessed as 
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in  Section 9.2.2.  
Where discrepancies in the ULN  and lower limit of normal of laboratory ranges occur between 
those included in the DMID tables and those of  the central laboratory that performs the assays, 
the values provided by the central laboratory will be used for assignment of severity grade.  
9.2.5 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the IMP and the occurrence of 
each AE or SAE by using his or her best clinical judgment.   It should be clearly documented 
in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and that they are the ones providing 
the assessment of causality.  Other elements to be considered, such as the history of the 
underlying disease, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of 
the event to the IMP will be considered and investigated.   The Inv estigator will also consult 
the VT -1161 Investigat ional  Brochure  and the s tudy Medical M onitor  in estimating the 
relationship.

86 An SAE may be recorded when the Investigator has minimal information to include in the 
initial report.  However, the Investigator must always make an assessment of causality for every 
event prior to repor ting the SAE report.  The Investigator may change his or her opinion of the 
causality upon evaluation of  follow -up information  or discussions with the study Medical 
Monitor with subsequent amendment of the SAE report.  Causality assessment is one of the 
criteria used to determine regulatory reporting requirements and should not be left blank.  
For each reported adverse reaction, the Investigator must assess  the relationship of the event 
to the IMP using the following scal e: 
Unrelated:  
• Does not follow a known response pattern to the suspect IMP (if response pattern is 
previously known).  
• Can clearly be explained by the known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Unlikely Related:  
• The temporal sequence from administration of the IMP suggests that a relationship is 
unlikely.

10.1 Sample Collection and  Handling  
Blood samples for determination of VT -1161 plasma concentra tions will be collected at visits 
specified  in Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  Timing of samples will be with respect 
to the day and time study drug is administered.   The initial PK sample must be drawn prior to 
the first dose of study drug (placebo/VT -1161). The date and time of each PK sample will be 
recorded in the CRF.  PK samples should be stored frozen at -20°C or colder.  Detailed shipping 
instructions will be pr ovided  in the lab manual.  
10.2 Analytical Procedures  
Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of VT-1161 using a validated , 
specific and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method  at a 
bioanalytical laboratory  designated by Mycovia Pharmaceuticals .  Pharmacokinetic samples 
may be retained for future analysis of the metabolite profile for a period of up t o 15 years, after 
which time the samples will be destroyed.  
10.3 Pharmacokinetic  Parameters  
For subjects in the VT -1161 treatm ent arm, VT -1161 concentrations will be presented by visit 
with descriptive statistics.  The PK data may be used in a cross -population PK analysis that

11.1 Screening/Baseline  Failures  
Subjects who sign and date the informed consent form  or assent  (for those ages 12 to 17) but 
fail to  be randomized  are defined as screen failures.   Site personnel should maintain 
documentation for all subjects who sign an inform ed consent  or assent . 
11.2 Subject Withdrawal or Premature Discontinuation from the Study  
The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The site must attemp t to contact the subject and re schedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible.  
• The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• In cases where the subject  is deemed ‘lost to follow -up’, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain  contact with the subject ( e.g., multiple telephone calls  on 
various dates/time, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address , or 
equivalent meth ods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s source 
documents . 
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will they be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow -up”. 
A subject m ay withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral , or 
administrative reasons.   If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction 
of any laboratory samples taken, and the Investigator  must document this in the site study 
records and communicate this request to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals . 
A subject may be withdrawn due  to lack of tolerability or safety concerns, including study 
drug-related AEs or development of clinically -significant study drug -related laboratory 
abnormalities.  If a subject is withdrawn from treatment, the subject must be followed clinically 
until the  event is resolved or deemed stable. A subject must be discontinued from the study

× ULN and serum total bilirubin is > 2.0 ULN. (Refer to 7.3). 
Subject who want to discontinue from the study should be encouraged to remain in the study 
for all remaining visits through Week 48 for safety and efficacy assessments.  All subjects wh o 
do discontinue early from the study should  have all EOS procedures performed on the day of 
discontinuation.  
If a subject is prematurely discontinued from study treatment for any reason  other than 
withdrawal of consent , the Investigator (or designee) should  request that the subject continues 
to participate in the study, attending all remaining visits in accordance with the  Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . Subjects who prematurely di scontinue study medication , but 
remain in the study , may be treated according to the standard local practice.  If the subject does 
not agree to remain in the study , the Investigator (or designee) must make every effort to 
perform  the early withdrawal visit /EOS visit procedures . 
11.3 Subject and Study Completion  
A completed subject is one who has completed all visits , Screening through Week 48 (EOS),  
as defined in the  Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  Study completion is defined as

94 clinically meaningful separation.  Thus, the sample size was powered to pick up at least a 35% 
separation between the treatment groups.   
While 102 t otal subjects will provide more than 90% power to detect reasonable differences 
between treatment groups in most of the pre -specified key secondary endpoints  a sample size 
of 160 active subjects and 80 placebo subjects is needed to provide 80% power to det ect a 
treatment difference of 3.9 between the VT -1161 treatment group and the placebo group in the 
change from screening through Week 48 in the SF -36 MCS with a standard deviation of 10 
points. (PASS 2008: two -sample t -test, alpha = 0.05).  Therefore, with the expected 
discontinuation rate, approximately 300 subjects will be necessary for randomization to arrive 
at approximately 240  evaluable subjects.   Approximately 600 subjects will be screened to 
randomize approximately 300 subjects that w ould meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria.  
12.2 Analysis Populations  
ITT Population : All randomized subjects.  
Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who receive d at least 1 dose of IMP.  
PP Population:  All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Had no deviations to  inclusion/exclusion criteria that could impact treatment outcome.  
• Were compliant with the assigned study treatment, defined as ≥80% complian ce during the 
daily dosing phase and ≥50% complian ce during the weekly dosing  phase . 
• Had the Week 4 8 visit completed within the  acceptable time window  (±14 days) . 
• Had no major protocol violations that would impact treatment outcome . 
Modified ITT:  All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Positive  KOH or Gram stain at Screening.  
• Positive culture  at Screening.  
• Negative culture at Baseline.  
All statistical populati ons will be defined in the SAP.

Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics and study drug exposure will be 
summarized by treatment group . 
12.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Clinical and mycological assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion  of subjects with one or more  culture -
verified  acute VVC episode s during the Maintenance Phase (post randomization  through Week  
48 of the study ) in the ITT population.  An acute VVC episode  in the Maintenance Phase 
(considered a recurrent episode)  is defin ed as a positive culture  for Candida species  and a 
clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3.  
The primary method of analysis is a Chi -square test for active treatment versus placebo based 
on the ITT population.   
 
 
The number and percentage of subjects with one or more culture -verified acute VVC episodes 
with signs and symptoms of ≥3 post random ization through Week 48 will be summarized 
across treatment groups including a 95% exact confidence interval and odds ratio.  
The percentages will also be plotted by treatment group.  
The key secondary efficacy outcome measures include the following:  
• Time t o first recurrence of  a culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs and symptoms 
score ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase . 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture  for Candida species  during the 
Maintenance Phase . 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one  culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs 
and symptoms ≥3 post randomization  through Week 24 . 
• Change from Screening through Week 48  in the SF -36 patient mental component score 
(MCS) .

total score . 
Subject s who want to discontinue from the study should be encouraged to  remain in the study  
for all remaining visits  through Week 48  for safety and efficacy assessments .  Subjects  who do 
discontinue  early from the study should have all Week 48/ EOS assessments performed on the 
day of discontinuation .  
Every effort will be made to obtain required data at each scheduled evaluation from all subjects 
who have been randomized, including those who discontinue the study prior to the EOS  Week 
48 visit.      
For scheduled visits where the investigator’s assessment of clinical signs and symptoms or the 
culture result is missing, missing values will be imputed using the method of multiple 
imput ation.  For subjects who discontinue the study early and have missing assessments for all 
visits after discontinuation, the missing values for the expected scheduled visits will be 
imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  The missing values will b e imputed using 
the following auxiliary information: region, treatment, baseline BMI, baseline age, ethnicity, 
and visit.  The procedure PROC MI in SAS will be used to generate 10 possible imputed 
datasets.  Using these multiple imputation datasets, determ ination of meeting t he primary 
endpoint of a culture -verifi ed acute VVC episode  during the Maintenance Phase will be 
derived.  Subjects with a culture -verified acute VVC episode at any point from post 
randomization through Week 48 (including unscheduled vi sits) will be counted as having an 
episode when calculatin g the primary endpoint.  The multiple datasets containing the primary 
endpoint will be analyzed using a Chi -square test and the results will be combined using PROC 
MIANALYZE to obtain an inferential  result.   Sensitivity analyses will be performed for the 
primary endpoint to assess the impact of missing/censored data on the results  using different 
time to event and censoring calculations.  Further details on the steps of these analyses are 
presented i n the VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 SAP.  
12.5 Safety Analyses  
To meet the safety dataset  requirement, approximately 600  subjects will be scree ned to 
randomize approximately 3 00 subjects that would meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. 
Assuming a 20% discontinuation rat e, it i s expected that approximately 24 0 subjects will 
complete the study.

97 All subjects who receive at least one dose of IMP will be included in the safety analyses. 
Subjects will be analyzed as per the treatment they receive.   The number and percentage of  
subjects having TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term with a 
breakdown by treatment group.  Mean changes from pre -treatment in vital signs, ECGs, and 
clinical laboratory variables will be summarized by treatment group.  
AEs will be collected from the date of the f irst dose of  fluconazole  through Week 48  (EOS).   
Physical examination findings, vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory tests (hematology and 
chemistry) will be obtained throughout the study as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
and Procedures .  All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to 
Screening through the Week 48 (EOS) visit will be recorded in the CRF.  Pertinent and all 
major medical cond itions will be recorded on the Medical H istory CRF.   
For subjects discontinuing early from the study, every effort will be made for all EOS 
procedures to be performed as outlined in the  Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
AEs will be coded with the Medical Dictionar y for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA®) version

AEs will be tabulated by system organ class and MedDRA® preferred term with a breakdown 
by treatment group.  Mean chang es from pre -treatment in vital signs, ECG, and clinical 
laboratory variables will be summarized by treatment group.  The AE profile will be 
characterized with severity and relationship to IMP.  SAEs and AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of IMP will be ident ified.  
Treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory test results will be identified.  Treatment -emergent 
abnormal laboratory tests results are those in which the baseline value is within normal 
laboratory limits and at least 1 post -baseline value is outside norm al laboratory limits.   Baseline 
will be defined as the last clinical laboratory result obtained before the first dose of IMP.  
Per protocol, the baseline for laboratory values should be obtained at the Day 1 (Baseline) visit.   
Change from baseline to the minimum, maximum, and final vital sign value after first dosing 
will be summarized descriptively.   
ECG measurements will include heart rate, QT interval, QT c interval, PR interval, and QRS 
interval.  Baseline for ECG measurements is defined per protocol as the value pre -dosing at 
the Day 1 (Baseline) visit.  Change from baseline will be summarized descriptively at each 
scheduled evaluation.  Subjects with clin ically significant changes in ECG rhythm or 
waveform will be identified.  Subjects who meet each of the following criteria from ICH

institution (where applicable).   When feasible, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will provide advance 
notification to the Investigator or head of the medical institution (where applicable) of the 
impending action.   If the study is suspended or prematurely dis continued for safety reasons, 
Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals  will promptly inform all Investigators, heads of medical institutions 
(where applicable), and/or institutions conducting the study.   Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals  will 
also promptly inform the relevant regula tory authorities of the suspension or premature 
discontinuation of the study and the reason(s) for the action.   If required by applicable 
regulations, the Investigator must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for 
the suspension or prematu re discontinuation.  
13.8 Records Retention  
Following closure of the study, the Investigator must maintain all site study records (except 
for those required by local regulations to be maintained elsewhere), in a safe and secure 
location.   The records must be mai ntained to allow easy and timely retrieval when needed (e.g., 
for a Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals  audit or regulatory inspection) and must be available for review 
in conjunction with the assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and relevant site staff.  
When permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of the records can 
be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); 
however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken.   The Investigator must 
ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original and

116 Appendix C: Child -Pugh Classification of Hepatic Impairment  
 
The Child - Pugh classification is a means of assessing the severity of liver cirrhosis.  
Score  1 2 3 
bilirubin (micromol/l)  <34 34 – 50 >50 
albumin (g/l)  >35 28 – 35 <28 
PT (s prolonged)  <4 4 – 6 >6 
encephalopathy  none  mild marked  
ascites  none  mild marked  
If there is primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis then bilirubin is classified as <68  =1; 6 
– 170 = 2; >170  = 3. 
The individual scores are summed and then grouped as:  
• <7 = A (Mild impairment)  
• 7 – 9 = B (Moderate impairment)  
• >9 = C (Severe impairment)  
A C classification forecasts a survival of less than 12 months.

OBSERVATIONAL EXTENSION STUDY:  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 
1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
Several properties of VT -1161 suggest that it has the potential to be a best -in-class oral agent for 
the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), to effectively inhibit growth of 
causative fungal pathogens at achievable plasma levels.  Its p harmacokinetic profile and extended 
half-life should limit recurrence of VVC. The purpose of this twelve -month Observational 
Extension Study is to gain additional insight into the ability of VT -1161 to prevent VVC beyond 
Week 48 in RVVC subjects yet to exp erience a recurring episode on completion of study VMT -
VT-1161 -CL-012.This is an observational study; there will be no active treatment.  The Sponsor 
may choose, prior to the end of study, to extend this Extension Study for an additional period for 
subject s willing to continue.   
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to evaluate changes in culture -verified acute VVC episode recurrence 
rates through Week 96 in subjects free of a recurring VVC episode upon completi on of their Week 
48 vis it in study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012 and who have qualified for the Extension, in an 
observational study.  
3.0  STUDY DESIGN  
Approximately 1 00 subjects in the United States who completed the ir Week 48 (EOS) visit and 
did not have a RVVC  episode during the Maintenanc e Phase (post -randomization through Week 
48 for study VMT -VT-1161 -CL-012) will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an observational 
Extension Study. The Extension Study will monitor for recurring episodes of VVC for an 
additional 48 Weeks, for a total study participation of 96 weeks.  
Subjects must sign the Extension Study informed consent form (ICF) , or assent,  at the Week 48 
(EOS) visit  prior to any Extension Study procedures. Subjects will be contacted approximately 
every 6 weeks to monitor for recurrence of VVC. Subjects experiencing a suspected recurrent 
episode of VVC will return to the investigational site for evaluation at an unscheduled vis it.

145 be retained for future analysis for a period of up to 1 5 years, after which time the samples will be 
destroyed.  
A local KOH wet mount test will be performed at the unscheduled clinic visit where a recurrent 
VVC episode is suspected.  (If the Investigator site used the Gram stain test instead of the KOH 
test in  the main study, they may continue to use it in the Extension Study).  
Subjects  should not be menstruating at time of the study visits to ensure proper sample collection 
of the vaginal fluid.   
6.2.3 Vulvovaginal Exam and Clinical Assessment  
A vulvovaginal exam and clinical assessment of signs and symptoms will be evaluated at the 
unscheduled clinic visit.  Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be scored 
and the individual scores combined for a maximum score of 18, using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation  
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be objectively defined on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows:  
0 = none (complete absence of any signs or symptoms)  
1 = mild (sli ght) 
2 = moderate (definitely present)  
3 = severe (marked, intense)  
7.0 PHARMACOKINETIC ASSE SSMENTS  
Assays to measure VT -1161 concentrations in plasma PK samples will be performed using a 
validated bioanalytical assay at a laboratory designated by Mycovia Phar maceuticals.

146 8.0 STUDY TERMINATION AN D SUBJECT DISCONTINU ATION  
8.1 Extension Study Screen Failures  
Subjects who sign and date the Extension Study consent (or assent, if applicable)  but fail to 
meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are defined as entry failures.  Site personnel need to 
maintain a screening log to document all subjects who sign a  consent (or assent) . A copy of 
the log should be retained in the Investigator’s study  files. Additionally, site personnel must 
complete the eCRF “Termination Extension” page.  
8.2 Early Termination Conditions  
If the Investigator suspects the subject is experiencing a recurrent episode , at any time during 
the Extension Study, the subject should be examined. The suspected RVVC  episode will be 
documented on an ‘unscheduled visit’ eCRF and considered the subject’s End of Extension 
Study (EOES) visit ONLY  if the signs and symptoms score is ≥3 and the KOH is positive . 
The Investigator is to perform all unscheduled  visit procedures, including submission of 
vaginal mycology swab to central lab for culture analysis. Upon diagnosis of a recurrent 
episode, the Investigator should :  
a. offer the subje ct standard of care treatment options.   
b. Complete the “unscheduled visit” and “Termination Extension” eCRF pages.  
An unconfirmed RVVC episode is one where the subject self -treats or sees a (non -Investigator 
Site) health care professional and does not have d ocumentation of the visit including the 
required study signs and symptoms and a positive KOH.  
8.3 Subject Withdrawal and Premature Discontinuation from the Extension 
Study  
Appropriate actions should be taken to ensure subjects complete each study visit within  the 
protocol specified window and do not become lost to follow -up.  
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at her own request or may be withdrawn at 
any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, or administrative reason s.  If a 
subject withdraws her consent from the study participation, she may request destruction of any 
laboratory samples taken, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records and 
communicate this request to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals.  
Reasons for subject discontinuation of the Extension Study at the investigative site may include, 
but are not limited to, the following:

150 The Investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
clinical study monitor, direct access to all relevant documents.  
Relevant documents or source documents are defined as the results of original observations and 
activities of a clinical investigation.  Source documents may include, but are not limited to, study 
progress notes, e -mail correspondences, computer printouts, laboratory data, and drug 
accountability records.  
10.4 Quality Assurance  
To ensure compliance with GCP /ICH E6(R2) and all applicable regulatory requ irements, Mycovia 
Pharmaceuticals may conduct a quality assurance assessment and/or audit of the site records, and 
the regulatory agencies may conduct a regulatory inspection at any time during or after the 
completion of the study. In the event of an asses sment, audit or inspection, the Investigator (and 
institution) must agree to grant the advisor(s), auditor(s), and inspector(s) direct access to all 
relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss the conduct of 
the stu dy, any findings/relevant issues, and to implement any corrective and/or preventative 
actions to address any findings/issues identified.  
10.5 Compliance with Standards of Medical Research/ Deviations  
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with the applic able ICH E6(R2) guidelines and 
GCP. Any instance of non -compliance with the protocol will result in a documented deviation.  If 
a change is deemed necessary to protect the safety, rights or welfare of a subject, Mycovia 
Pharmaceuticals and IRB/IEC should be  notified as soon as possible and preferably prior to 
introducing the deviation. Major deviations are defined as, but not limited to, the following:  
• Subjects who did not meet entry criteria.  
• Subjects who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but w ere not withdrawn.  
10.6 Data Management  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used to capture study results and data.  The study 
coordinator or other authorized site study personnel will transcribe data from source documents 
into the eCRFs.  The Extensio n eCRFs may be reviewed and source verified by the clinical study 
monitor to ensure data in the eCRF are correct and complete.  The Medical Monitor or clinical 
study monitor may request redacted copies of source documents  for medical review. Once the 
Exten sion Study is  complete, the Investigator must sign and date all required pages, verifying the 
accuracy of all data contained within the eCRF.

151 Training will be provided for the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  All personnel using the 
EDC system must h ave the appropriate education, training, and experience, or any combination 
thereof. The Investigator will be provided with SOPs (contained in the Study  Procedures Manual 
or a vendor -specific SOP) on the use of the EDC system. Documentation for employee ed ucation, 
training, and previous experience that pertains to the EDC system must be present in the 
Investigator files.  
If electronic data systems other than those provided and maintained by Mycovia Pharmaceuticals 
are used for documentation and data capture , the Investigator must ensure that the systems are 
validated and ensure regular data back -up. 
The eCRF will be signed by the Principal Investigator listed on the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) 1572 form.  It is the responsibility of the Principal Inve stigator to ensure the eCRFs are 
completed and submitted to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals (or designee) in an accurate and timely 
manner.  The processing of eCRFs will include an audit trail (to include changes made, reason for 
change, date of change, and person  making change). At the completion of the Extension study, 
eCRFs (including queries and audit trails) will be retained by the Mycovia Pharmaceuticals and 
copies will be sent to the Investigator to maintain as the Investigator copy.  
Management of clinical d ata will be performed in accordance with applicable Mycovia 
Pharmaceuticals standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (e.g., 
removing errors and inconsistencies in the data).  Concomitant medications will be coded using 
WHO -DD.   
10.7 Study and Site Closure  
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study, the representative (or designated 
clinical study monitor) of Mycovia Pharmaceuticals will conduct site closure activities with the 
Investigator or site staff, as appro priate, in accordance with applicable regulations including GCP.  
Mycovia Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to suspend or prematurely discontinue this study at 
any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non -comp liance. 
For multicenter studies, this can occur at 1 or more or at all sites.  If the Sponsor determines such 
action is needed, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals will discuss the reasons for taking such action with the 
Investigator or head of the medical institution  (where applicable).  When  feasible, Mycovia 
Pharmaceuticals will provide advance notification to the Investigator or head of the medical 
institution (where applicable) of the impending action.  If  the study is suspended or prematurely 
discontinued for saf ety reasons, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals will promptly inform all Investigators, 
heads of medical institutions (where applicable), and/or institutions conducting the study.

suspension or premature discontinuation of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If required 
by applicable regulations, the Investigator must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the 
reason(s) for the suspension or premature discontinuatio n. 
Mycovia Pharmaceuticals requires the following data and materials before a study can be 
considered complete or terminated:  
1. Clinical data and all test results from Extension Study Week 48 through Week 96.  
2. Electronic CRFs properly completed by appropriate  study personnel and signed and dated by 
the Investigator.

10.8 Record Retention  
Following closure of the study, the Investigator must maintain all site study records (except for 
those required by local regulations to be maintained elsewhere), in a safe and secure location.  
The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when needed (e.g., for a 
Mycovia Pharmaceuticals audit or regulatory inspection) and must be available for review in 
conjunction with the assessment of the facility, supporting sy stems, and relevant site staff. When 
permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all records can be maintained 
in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to 
be exercised before such action is taken.  The Investigator must ensure that all reproductions are 
legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval 
standards, including regenerating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the Invest igator must 
ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality control 
process exists for making these reproductions.   
Investigators are required to retain essential documents pertaining to the conduct of this stud y for 
at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there 
are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2  years have

disconti nue the study prior to the EOS Week 48 visit. 
For scheduled visits where the investigator’s 
assessment of clinical signs and symptoms or the 
culture result is missing, missing values will be 
imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  For 
subjects wh o discontinue the study early and have 
missing assessments for all visits after 
discontinuation, the missing values for the expected 
scheduled visits will be imputed using the method of 
multiple imputation.  The missing values will be 
imputed using the fol lowing auxiliary information: 
region, treatment, baseline BMI, baseline age, 
ethnicity, and visit.  The procedure PROC MI in SAS 
will be used to generate 10 possible imputed datasets.  
Using these multiple imputation datasets, 
determination of meeting the primary endpoint of a 
culture -verified acute VVC episode during the 
Maintenance Phase will be derived.  Subjects with a 
culture -verified acute VVC episode at any point from 
post randomization through Week 48 (including 
unscheduled visits) will be counted a s having an 
episode when calculating the primary endpoint.  The 
multiple datasets containing the primary endpoint will 
be analyzed using a Chi -square test and the results 
will be combined using PROC MIANALYZE to

Title of Study:  
  
A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Confirmatory Phase 2 Study Assessing 
the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Bryostatin in the Treatment of Moderately Severe to 
Severe Alzheimer’s Disease  Subjects Not Receiving Memantine Treatment  
Study c enter(s):  Approximately 30 sites in United States (US)  
 
Protocol Number:  NTRP -101-203 
 
Study Duration:  Approximately 1 2 months  Study Phase: 2 
 
Objective:   
 
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of bryostatin  1 (hereafter referred to as 
bryostati n) for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  
 
Study Drug :   Bryostatin 1 or matching Placebo  
Route of Administration: Intravenous by continuous infusion over 45±5 minutes  
Number of Subjects : 100 randomized subjects (approximately 145 subjects screened)  
Study Design  
This is a randomized double -blind Placebo -controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin  to 
placebo for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease in subjects not 
receiving memantine treatment. The study is 15 weeks in duration, including a safety and 
efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Subject s will receive 7 doses of 
study drug during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from 
baseline to Week 13 in the Severe Impairment Battery ( SIB) total score .  
 
Randomization and Treatment  
Eligible subjects will be stratified ba sed on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE -2) scores 4 -9 
vs. 10 -15 and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20µg bryostatin or 
placebo for twelve weeks. The first two doses of study drug  will be a loading dose 20% 
higher  (i.e., 24µg ) than the assi gned dose  and will be administered one week apart.

Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20µg  will commence with the third dose and be 
administered every other week.  Drug is administered IV by continuous infusion over 45(±5) 
minutes . Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks.  
 
Evaluation  Methods  
Safety and tolerability will be determined through evaluations of adverse events (AE), 
serious adverse events (SAE), physical examination (PE), vital signs, 12 -lead 
electroc ardiogram (ECG), the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS), and 
clinical laboratory assessments.  
 
Cognitive improvements wil l be evaluated primarily with the Severe Impairment Battery 
(SIB) and secondarily with functional improvements in the Alzh eimer’s Disease Cooperative 
Study – Activities of Daily Living - Severe Impairment Version ( ADCL -ADL -Sev), Clinical 
Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) metrics.  
 
Safety Assessments  
 
• Treatment emergent AEs and SAEs  
• Vital signs, hematology, blood chemistry, physical examination  including body 
weight  
• ECG parameters  
• C-SSRS  
 
Primary Efficacy End point 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from baseline to Week 13 in the SIB 
total score .  
Secondary Efficacy End points   
•  The changes from baseline  at Weeks 5 , 9 and 15  in the SIB total score   
• The changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, 13 and 15 in the SIB total score for subjects 
in the MMSE -2 4-9 stratification group  
• The changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9 , 13 and 15 in the SIB total score for subjects 
in the MMSE -2 10-15 stratification group  
• Individual patient’s s lope over time in SI B total score evaluated  via Week s 0, 5, 9, 
and 13

score  
• Change from baseline i n 10-point Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score  
• Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI -I) score  
 
Statistical Considerations:  
 
The primary objective for efficacy is to evaluate whether bryostatin is better than the control 
with respect to the primary and secondary SIB endpoints.  
 
Efficacy analyses will be conducted for the full analysis set (FAS), consistent with the 
modified inte ntion -to-treat principle, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of randomized study medication and who had at least one post -baseline assessment. 
The completer analysis set (CAS) will be defined as all randomized subjects who co mpleted 
12 weeks of treatment, and who have a week 13 SIB assessment.  
 
Adverse event and other safety data will be analyzed descriptively in all subjects who 
received any dose of study drug (including partial infusions).  These data will be summarized 
by treatment group and by time in study.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 19 of 74 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.0 Alzheimer’s  disease  
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 5.3 million 
people in the United States (US) and 30 million people worldwide.   There is a disproportionate 
representation of women with nearly 2/3 of the affected individuals being female.  Of the 5.3 
million affected Americans , 5.1 million  are older than 65  (Alzheimer’s Association website 
www.alz.org , 2015 ).  Since aging is the single most important risk factor for development of 
dementia and medical advances are prolonging survival , the incidence of AD w ill increase.  The 
US Census Bureau data suggest that the number of individuals living until age 100 between the 
years 2000 and 2020 will increase by more than 200% and the number of individuals living until 
age 90-95 will double .4   By 2050 the number of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease will almost 
triple to a projected 13.8 million.  In 2013, 15.5 million family and friends provided 17.7 billion 
hours of unpaid  care to those with Alzheimer’s and other dementias – care valued at $220.2 billion  
(Alzheim er’s Association website  www.alz.org , 2015 ). 
The currently approved treatments for AD provide modest symptomatic benefit and do not alter 
the disease progression.  These therapies primarily consist of cholinesterase inhibitors [tacrine 
(Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) , and galantamine (galanthamine, Reminyl)] 
and the N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, memantine (Namenda).  The development of a 
medication that produces a signific ant improvement in clinical symptoms and/or slows the 
progression of the disease would be a significant advance in the therapeutics of AD.  
The protein kinase C  (PKC ) signaling pathways have been shown to play an integral role in learning 
and memory. Severa l animal models have demonstrated that PKC is involved in the learning 
process.5, 6  In addition , PKC activity regulates phosphorylation of Tau and cleavage of Aβ 
amyloid through its effects on alpha secretase and GSK3β.13  The single most important risk factor 
for the sporadic form of AD , increased age, has a lso been linked to impaired PKC -mediated α -
secretase activation .7  Aged animal models, fo r example, have shown age -specific changes of PKC 
isozyme distribution in the brain ,8, 9 impaired PKC translocation, reduced levels of the PKC 
anchoring protein, RACK1 ,10 alterations in mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk1/2 ,11 and 
reduced levels of the α -secretase cleaved Amyloid Precursor Protein  (APP), soluble amyloid 
precursor protein alpha (sAPPα), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) .12  Aging of normal human 
fibrob lasts also reduced secretion of sAPPα.   
The demonstration of reduced levels of PKC in the brain of Alzheimer’s subject s suggests a 
potential target to improve cognition i n AD is the activation of PKC which in turn activates a 
series of downstream pathways  that enhance synaptic function and promote synaptogenesis. 
Bryostatin is a potent stimulator of PKCε and is non -tumorigenic. Hongpaisan et.al 13 have 
recently demonstrated the cognitive benefits and the effect on synaptogenesis in two strains of 
transgenic  AD mice.  Their work was recently reproduced by Schrott , et.al.14 Activation of PKCε 
by bryostatin was associated with reduced levels of β amyloid, increased levels  of the Brain 
Derived Neurotropic Factor  (BDNF) , prevention of synapse loss, reduced pla que formation and 
restored memory and learning even in the presence of pla ques.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 20 of 74 1.1 Rationale for the use of bryostatin in the treatment of AD  
The pharmacological basis for the use of bryostatin for the treatment of AD is based on the 
hypothesis that low dose, in termittent administration of bryostatin will activate PKC isozymes α 
and ε. Activation of PKC is associated with:  
• Enhance d associative learning and recent memory via PKC -mediated phosphory lation of 
downstream substrates  
• Increase d synthesis of proteins suc h as MAP kinase Erk1/2, and synaptogenic proteins such 
as BDNF required for long -term memory  
• Activat ion of  α-secretases, thereby increasing non -toxic fragments of the beta -amyloid 
precursor protein (βAPP) and reducing the neurotoxic fragment of βAPP, Aβ 1-42, and t he 
associated neuropathology  
• Activat ion of  Aβ1-42 – degrading  enzymes  
• Phosphorylat ion of  GSK -3 beta, inhibiting production of Tau an d the associated 
neuropathology  
• Improved memory and learning in  3 different strains of transgenic mice with single or 
multiple Alzheimer’s gene mutations even in  the presence of amyloid plaque  14, 13, 15  
 
Thus , activation of PKC can enhance existing synaptic function, reduce the toxic effects of 
amyloid and promo te synaptogenesis , all potential target s to improve cognitive function in AD .  
1.2 Pharmacokinetics , Toxicology and Drug Metabolism in Animals   
Single dose toxicity of bryostatin  has been characterized in four non-GLP studies conducted under 
National Cancer Institute’s (NCI)  IND, including three  IV toxicity studies in mice and one IV 
toxicity study in rats.  Bryostatin was evaluated in a  single  GLP –repeated dose 21 -day IV toxicity 
study in rats.  The  single dose toxicity  studies were conducted using two different dosing 
formu lations: bryostatin in ethanol/saline or bryostatin in polyethylene glycol, ethanol, and Tween 
80 (PET) diluent.  LD 50 range d from a low of 38µg/kg to 75µg/kg.  The 21 -day repeat -dose toxic 
study  performed in rats at doses of 0, 10, 15 and 25µg/m2 with the ethanol/saline formulation  
resulted in  no relevant toxicology findings.  The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and no adverse 
effect level  (NOAEL ) were noted to be 25µg/m2 the highest dose studied.  However , since there 
were no toxicologically relevant findings , the report  suggested that the MTD and NOAEL are 
greater than  25µg/m2. 
Two preliminary dose range finding IV toxicology studies were performed in the rat and dog to 
characterize the toxicity of  bryostatin and to estimate the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) when 
administered by bolus injection and continuous infusion.   In the Sprague -Dawley rat bryostatin 
was tolerated up to 1 0ug/kg (infusion)  and 15ug/kg (bolus)  with no significant differences in 
toxicity noted between the two routes of administration.   In the beagle dog bryostatin was tolerated 
at doses up to 1 5ug/kg (infusion  and bolus).  There were no significant differences in toxicity 
between the two routes of administration.  A more detailed r esults summary can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 21 of 74 Limited pharmacokinetics ( PK) data are available in animals .  The pharmacokinetics of bryostatin  
was analyzed in female CD1/F2 mice by using [C26 -3H]-labeled bryostatin following IV and IP 
administration (Zhang et al 1996).   Following  IV administration of 40µg/kg (120mg/m2), the 
plasma disappearance curve for bryostatin could be described by a 2 -compa rtment model, with a 
distribution t ½ of 1.05hours and an elimination t ½ of 22.96 hours.   In contrast, following IP 
administration, the plasma disappearance curve was better described by a first -order absorption 
one-compartment model, with an absorption t ½ of 0.81hours and an elimination t ½ of 28.76hours.  
Urinary excretion represented the major pathway of elimination in the first 12 hours after IV 
administration, with 23.0 ± 1.9% (mean ± standard deviation) of the administered dose excreted. 
Approximately eq ual amounts of radioactivity (40%) were excreted in feces compared with urine 
within 72 hours after IV administration.   A greater area under the curve, longer mean resident time, 
and lower clearance were observed with IP administration compared with IV adm inistration.   
Bryostatin  was widely distributed to various tissues following both IV and IP administration.  
However, accumulation was observed in the lung, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and fatty tissue.  
1.3 Genotoxicity   
Bryostatin  1 was evaluated usin g the bacterial reverse mutat ion assay (i.e., the Ames test)  with no 
positive responses  observed.  Bryostatin  1 was evaluated as negative (nonclastogenic) in the 
micronucleus assay ; it was also evaluated as negative (non -DNA damaging) in the Comet Assay.  
Overall, based on the results of the Ames test and the combined micronucleus/comet assay, 
bryostatin  1 is not considered to be genotoxic . 
2 CLINICAL TRIAL DATA  
2.0 Oncology Data  
Safety data are available from published clinical studies  of bryostatin for the treatment of cancer.  
Altogether, over 1 400 oncology subject s received bryostatin,  mainly under NCI’s IND # 42,780, 
with exposures to bryostatin in both single and combination agent studies .  About 584  subject s 
received bryostatin as monotherapy, with dose levels ranging from 5 μg/m2 to >1 80μg/m2.  Most 
subject s in both the monotherapy and combination therapy studies received bryostati n at doses 
>25μg/m2, most often as 1-hour infusions administered  at various time intervals from weekly 
infusion to continuous infusions for 72 hours.   Most studies were repeated dose studies w here 
subject s received treatment for several weeks  (See I nvestigators Brochure ).  
Adverse events occurring in the si ngle agent studies  that resulted in discontinuation from the 
studies  were myalgia (28  subject s), acute transient reaction (dyspnea, flushing, hypotension, and 
bradycardia; 4  subject s each), phlebitis (attributed to ethanol in the formulations, 6 subject s), 
fatigue (3  subject s), and 1 subject  each with bacteremia, chest pain, dehydration, dysphagia, 
hematuria, nausea, skin rash, subclavian vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and vomiting.  The 
following AEs were associated with death in the single agent tr ials: cardiac arrest (2), hypotensive 
with evidence of renal and hepatic failure (1), perforated gastric ulcer (1), renal function decline 
with cardiac arrest and perforated gastric ulcer (1; PIs considered not related to bryostatin), and 
sudden death (1; PIs considered likely to be cardiovascular event).  Relatedness to bryostatin 
treatment was not assessed except where noted.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 22 of 74 Other severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs reported in the single agent clinical studies  in cancer 
subject s included: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (elevated; subject  had pre -existing liver metastases), 
allergic reaction, anemia, anorexia, arthralgia, ataxia, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiovascular, 
coagulation, community -acquired pneumonia, congestive heart failure, constipation, dermatitis, 
dermat ologic, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema/weight gain, fever, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, 
granulocytopenia, headache, hepatic, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, 
hyponatremia, infection, leg weakness, lymphedema, lymphocytopenia, myocardial infarc tion, 
neurotoxicity, neutropenia, pain (abdominal, back, eye, site not specified), pulmonary, pulmonary 
embolus from inferior vena cava tumor thrombus, sepsis and pneumonia without neutropenia, 
syncope, and urinary frequency.  
The absence of a Placebo -contr ol group in bryostatin oncology studies  makes it difficult to 
determine the extent to which underlying disease or concomitant medications may have  
contributed to this safety profile.   
2.1 Alzheimer’s  Disease  Data 
2.1.1 Study NTRP101 -202 
NTRP 101 -202 was a  randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, phase 2 trial assessing the 
safety and tolerability (primary objective)  and efficacy (secondary objective) of bryostatin in the 
treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease subjects.  Exploratory objectives 
characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of bryostatin in this subject 
population. Seven doses of study drug were administered by a 45 -minute continuous intravenous 
(IV) infusion over 12 weeks.   
 
2.1.2 Methodology  
Eligible subjects with moderately severe to severe AD were stratified based on Mini Mental State 
Exam (MMSE -2) scores 4 -9 vs. 10 -15 and randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: 20μg, 
40μg, or placebo for twelve weeks. Trial drug was administered IV  by continuous infusion. The  
first two doses (24μg, 48μg) of each of the two active treatment arms were a loading dose, 
20% higher than the assigned dose (20μg, 40μg), and were administered one week apart. 
Thereafter, the assigned dose commenced with the t hird dose and was administer ed every other 
week. Subjects were scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks, with the primary efficacy 
measure being at Week 13, and a follow -up visit scheduled 30 days from the last dose of trial drug 
administration.  
 
2.1.3 Demographics  
A total of 264 subjects were screened in the trial. Of these, 147 subjects were randomized on a 
1:1:1 basis to a treatment group. There were 50 subjects randomized to the placebo treatment 
group, 49 randomized to the 20μg bryostatin treatment gr oup, and 48 randomized to th e 40μg 
bryostatin treatment group. A total of 141 of the randomized subjects were treated with 
investigational product (IP) and were included in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS). A total of 135 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 23 of 74 subjects provided a post -baseline eff icacy assessment and were analyzed as the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS). A total of 113 subjects out of 147 randomized (76.9%) performed a Week 13 evaluation of 
the SIB and were analyzed as the Completer Analysis Set (CAS). A total of 106 subjects in the 
SAS com pleted the trial (75.2%). A total of 35 subjects in the SAS and 29 subjects in the FAS 
withdrew early from the trial. The most common reason for early withdrawal was withdrawal of 
consent (18 subjects), followed by AE (11  subjects).  
 
2.1.4 Safety  
Overall, the 20 μg bryostatin treatment group  showed minimal differences from the placebo 
treatment group in safety assessments. The 40μg bryostatin  treatment group had significantly 
greater AEs than the other treatment groups. There was also no clear difference in Serious Adverse 
events (SAEs) between the 20μg bryostatin group and placebo treatment groups, and again the 
40μg bryostatin treatment grou p had significantly greater SAEs than the other treatment group.  
Similarly, the placebo and 20μg group had similar numbers of TEA Es (28 events vs 30  events, 
respectively). The TEAEs observed more often in the 20μg treatment group vs placebo were 
infusion site reaction (8 events vs 3 events in placebo) and diarrhea (5  events vs 1 event in 
placebo). The 40μg treatment group was associated with more TEAEs than either the 20μg or 
placebo treatment groups across multiple system organ classes (SOC).  
The most co mmon treatment related TEAEs were grouped infusion reactions, diarrhea, headache, 
fatigue, and myalgia. Myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the higher 
dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesi cs. There were 
also more treatment related TEAEs of diarrhea, headache,  and fatigue in the higher dose bryostatin 
group. Both bryostatin treatment groups reported higher rates of infusion site TEAEs, and in 
particular the 40μg bryostatin treatment group re ported 4 events of infusion site cellulitis. 
Although IV infusion -related reactions were also reported more often in the higher dose bryostatin 
group, none were reported following WebEx -based training on IV infusion and universal 
precautions, suggesting th at this AE can be prevented.   The higher dose bryostatin group also 
reported more TEAEs of seizure and fall compared to the lower dose bryostatin and placebo 
groups.  
A total of 97 (68.8%) subjects in all treatment groups reported 287 separate TEAEs. Of th ese, 49 
(34.8%) subjects reported 107 separate treatment -related TEAEs. There were 8 (16.7%) subjects 
with 20 treatment -related TEAEs in the placebo treatment group, 17 (37.0%) subjects with 30 
events in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 24 (51.1%) subjects with 57 events in the 40μg 
bryostatin treatment group. Six  subjects had a TEAE that lead to trial drug discontinuation, 2 in the 
placebo treatment group, 1 in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 3 in the 40μg bryostatin 
treatment group.   Over all, 43 (30.5%) subjects had a TEAE that was mild in intensity, 
46 (32.6%)  subjects had a TEAE that was moderate in intensity, and 8  (5.7%)  subjects had a 
TEAE that was severe in intensity.  
There was 1 death in the trial, a subject in the 40μg bryostatin t reatment group who suffered a 
severe TEAE of worsening of AD that was unrelated to the IP.  
There were 12 (8.5%) subjects who had 14 treatment emergent non -fatal SAEs during the trial; 4 
subjects with 4 events in the placebo treatment group, 2 subjects wit h 2 events in the 20μg 
bryostatin treatment group, and 6 subjects with 8 SAEs in the 40µg bryostatin treatment group. A 
total of 4 subjects in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had 4  events that were judged as possibly 
or probably related to the IP: 3 ev ents of cellulitis, and 1  event of seizure.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 24 of 74 There were no apparent differences between treatment groups in laboratory assessments over time.  
No differences were apparent between treatment groups when examining most vital signs, PEs, 
and ECG. However, ther e was a decline in weight in the bryostatin groups, which was more 
prominent in the higher dose group: 20μg bryostatin treatment group (mean loss of -1.65±2.77kg) 
and the 40μg bryostatin treatment group ( -2.98±2.10kg), while there was a slight weight gain in the 
placebo treatment group (0.442±2.52kg). Further, 5 subjects in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group 
had 5  TEAEs of weight decreased, 3 of which were judged to be related to the IP. No weight 
related TEAEs were observed in the 20μg bryostatin dose gro up.  
There were no differences between treatment groups on the C -SSRS as most subjects did not have 
suicidal thoughts during the trial, and there were no attempts at suicide by any subject during the 
trial. 
 
2.1.5 Efficacy  
Consistent with the initial hypothesis for bryostatin effects on PKC ε and cognition, treatment with 
20μg of bryostatin is effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in a FAS and CAS. The 
overall weight of data shows that subjects treated with 20μg  bryostatin displayed significant 
improvement on the SIB, ADCS -ADL -Sev, and other secondary and exploratory endpoints  (one-
sided at α=0.10) , as outlined below.  
Baseline scores on the SIB for the FAS were similar across all treatment groups. In the FAS, the 
treatment difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group 
was statistically significant only at Week 5 (treatment difference 3.0[0.6, 5.3] 80%CI  P=0.056). There 
were no statistically significant differences between the placebo treatment group and either the 
20μg  bryostatin treatment group or 40μg  bryostatin treatment group at Week 9 or Week 13. 
Combining the bryostatin treatment groups and comparing with the placebo treatment group also 
did not produce a statistically si gnificant difference at any time point.  
For the CAS, pre -specified along with FAS to assess primary and secondary endpoints, mean 
scores on the SIB followed the same pattern seen in the FAS. Baseline scores were similar across 
all treatment groups. There was a statistically significant difference, however, between the placebo 
treatment group and the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.016), and the treatment 
difference at Week 13 was also statistically significant (P=0.070). Further, when both b ryostatin 
treatment groups were pooled, there was a statistically significant difference between the placebo 
treatment group and pooled group at Week 5 (P=0.039) and a statistically significant treatment 
difference at Week 13 (P=0.094). There were no stati stically significant differences between the 
placebo treatment group and the 40μg  bryostatin treatment group at any time point.  
In the CAS there were significant differences in the ADCS -ADL -Sev at Week 13 between the 
placebo treatment group and the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group (P=0.082), and between the 
placebo treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment group (P=0.087). There were no 
statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the ADCS -ADL -Sev, MMSE -2, 
NPI, or CGI -I assays for  any time point in the FAS.  
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for the primary endpoint, there were 
additional significant differences between the placebo treatment group and bryostatin treatment 
groups. In an MMRM analysis of change  from baseline in SIB total score, excluding all subjects 
from sites that recruited 2 or fewer subjects during the trial, there was a significant difference 
between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 
(P=0.068). Th ere was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg

there was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and 20μg bryostatin

treatment groups (P=0.049) at Week 5. In an ANCOVA of change from baseline in SIB total score, 
with use of AChEI or memantine at baseline as an additional covariate, at Week 5 the 20μg 
bryostatin treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment groups had statistically significant 
treatment differences from the placebo treatment group (P=0.024 and P=0.027, respectively).  
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for secondary endpoints, there were 
statistical ly significant differences between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin

treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.041) when performing an ANVOCA of change from b aseline in 
ADCS -ADL -Sev total score for subjects with > median baseline ADCS -ADL -Sev total score. 
There was a statistically significant difference between the placebo and 40μg bryostatin treatment 
groups at Week 5 (P=0.099) in an ANCOVA of change from base line in NPI Total score to assess 
site affects. When performing an ANVOCA of change from baseline in NPI total score for subjects 
with > median baseline NPI total score, there were statistically significant differences between the 
placebo treatment group a nd the 40μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 9 (P=0.054) and Week 
13 (P -0.096).  
No clear differences were apparent between treatment groups for Caregiver distress on the NPI, 
each NPI subscore at baseline, or on the NPI 10 -item score.  
The results for SI B score from the MSSE -2 Stratum 1 analysis show the 20μg  bryostatin treatment 
group had a more positive response than any treatment group at Week 5 and Week 9 and the 
40μg  bryostatin treatment group had a slightly better response at Week 13. Results for SI B score in 
the MSSE -2 Stratum 2 analysis show the positive response varied across time point and treatment 
group. The placebo treatment group showed greater improvement in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score 
at Weeks 5 and 9 than either bryostatin treatment group in Stratum 1 or 2, and also at Week 13 in 
Stratum 2. At Week 13 in Stratum 1, the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group showed the best response 
compared to placebo or the 40μg  bryostatin treatment group.  
There was a significant difference in the FAS between the p lacebo treatment group and the 20μg 
bryostatin treatment group (P=0.031), and between the placebo treatment group and the pooled 
bryostatin treatment group (P=0.041) in an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB total 
score at the 30 -day follow up vis it. 
Additional post -hoc analyses were performed on the TEAE by MMSE -2 baseline strata, SIB by 
BSA -adjusted Dose, ADCS -ADL -Sev by BSA -adjusted Dose, TEAE by BSA -adjusted Dose, SIB 
by memantine use, ADCS -ADL -Sev by memantine use, the NPI 10 -item total score by memantine 
use, and administration site -specific TEAE. The SIB and ADCS -ADL -Sev scores also appeared to 
be affected by BSA -adjusted dose, as the lowest tertile of bryostatin  dose in general had a better 
response to treatment than higher tertiles or placebo (th ese data w ere also not analyzed 
statistically). Subjects treated with bryostatin who did not take memantine at baseline had 
significantly better improvement in SIB score  compared to the placebo group in an MMRM 
analyses of SIB total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin and 20μg 
bryostatin treatment groups had significantly better scores than the placebo treatment group at 
Weeks 5, 13, and at 30 -day Fo llow-up. Similar results (which were not statistically analyzed) were 
seen in the ADCS -ADL -Sev test and in the NPI 10 -item score.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 26 of 74 2.1.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Mean plasma bryostatin concentrations increased approximately proportional to dose for an  
increase in dose b etween 20 μg and 40 μg, infused IV over 45 minutes. The median Tmax 
occurred at the end of the 45 -min infusion.  
Mean Cmax ranged from 0.563 ng/mL to 0.653 ng/mL after 20 μg and from 0.792 ng/mL to  
1.34 ng/mL after 40 μg. Mean T1/2 ranged from 1.33 h to 5.3 7 h.  Mean CL was similar for both 
dose levels and ranged from 24.97 L/h to 28.42 L/h for Weeks 0 and 3. The mean CL on Weeks 7 
and 11 was slightly lower, ranging from 13.38 L/h to 23.91 L/h.  
Within a given dose level, the ranges of values for Cmax, AUClas t, and AUCinf were consistent  
across weeks and there was no indication of systemic accumulation of bryostatin during 
administration of bryostatin once every 2 weeks.  
2.1.7 Summary  
Bryostatin  treatment was in general safe to use and well tolerated.  
The 20μg bryostatin treatment group had similar numbers of TEAEs to the placebo treatment 
group except in injection site reactions and diarrhea. The 40μg treatment group had more TEAEs 
and SAEs tha n the 20μg or placebo treatment groups across many SOCs.  
The 40μg dose of bryostatin was associated with more TEAEs. With a decrease in systemic CL 
especially noted with 40µg bryostatin dosing, the higher drug exposure may further explain the 
increased nu mber of TEAEs. The most common treatment related TEAEs were diarrhea, headache, 
fatigue, and myalgia, and all were reported in greater frequency with the 40μg dose of bryostatin. 
Subjects given the 40μg dose of bryostatin also reported more TEAEs of seizur e and fall.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the SIB and secondary efficacy endpoint for the ADCS -ADL -
Sev was met in the CAS with the 20μg  dose, which was statistically significantly different from 
placebo at Weeks 5 and 13 . The 40μg  dose was not statisti cally significant from the placebo.  
SIB improvement was significant for the Week 5 FAS measurement (p< .056). No other primary 
or secondary endpoints were met in the FAS.  
Multiple exploratory analyses in the FAS for covariates in the primary and secondary  endpoints 
revealed additional significant differences, but these occurred predominantly at the Week 5 time 
point.  
2.2 Study NTRP101 -201  
This was a randomized, double -blind, Placebo -controlled safety study of a single  dose of 
bryostatin in subject s with mild to moderate AD (MMSE: 14 -26).  Subject s were randomized 2:1 
to receive bryostatin 25µg/m2 or Placebo .  The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of bryostatin by the incidence of AEs and SAEs .  Secondary safety endpoints included 
assessment of physical examination, hematology including  complete blood count (CBC) and 
platelet count , coagulation  parameters , serum chemistries , ECG, urinalysis and vital signs.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was a com posite end point of change from baseline in the Hopkins 
Verbal Learning Test -Revised  (HVLT -R) delayed recall and Repeatable Battery of Assessments 
for Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS) figure recall at 48 hours post study drug  infusion.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 27 of 74 The study included single dose PK, and measurement of PKCε in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) as a potential biomarker.  
 
2.2.1 Results  
2.2.1.1  Demographic s 
The study enrolled nine subject s, 4 male and 5 female,  with a mean age of 71.8 ± 7.4 years (range 
62 to 82).  The mean MMSE -2 at baseline was 22.5 for the three p lacebo  subjects (range 19 -24) 
and 22 (range 16 -26) for the six bryostatin treated subject s. 
 
2.2.1.2  Safety  
Bryostatin was well tolerated.  There were no deaths or SAEs  reported .  No subjects had an AE 
leading to withdra wal during the study.  There were five treatment emergent adverse events 
occurring in three  subject s: headache, dizziness, and papular rash.  There were no reported 
episodes of myalgia, a known side effect of bryost atin.  The only adverse event in the bryostatin 
treated group was headache, which was not considered related to study drug .  All adverse events 
were mild and resolved without treatment.  All laboratory assessments, including hematology, 
chemistry, coagulat ion, renal function and liver function as well as cardiac assessments were 
unremarkable after treatment and there was no clinically significant change in any vital signs.  
2.2.1.3  Efficac y  
There was no difference in HVLT -R delayed recall or the RBANS delay ed figure recall at 48 
hours.  Additional time points of assessment for these measures (day 2, day 4 and day 15) did not 
indic ate any difference between groups.  Additional endpoints included the change from baseline 
in Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), and MMSE -2 at various time points.  There was no difference in 
mean values between groups for these endpoints at any time point.  Both the treatment and the 
Placebo  group showed an improvement in the MMSE -2 score most likely due to practice effects 
since the MMSE -2 was administered five times in 2 weeks.  
In summary, there was no clinically significant difference between the mean or mean change from 
baseline between bryostatin and placebo in the HVLT -R or MMSE -2 assessments  or any other 
efficacy assessments to sugges t a treatment effect after  a single dose of 255μg/m2 bryostatin.  
2.2.1.4  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of bryostatin were assessed in 6 subject s following 25 g/m2 bryostatin 
administered as a single 1 -hour IV infusion.  Individual bryostatin plasma conce ntrations were 
observed to increase and approac h stead y-state within the 1 hour infusion periods, and then rapidly 
decrease following the end of the infusion.  The bryostatin maximum plasma concentrations 
occurred at the end of the IV infusions, and had a mean ( ±standard deviation (SD) ) value of 1.09 
±0.25 ng/mL.  A terminal elimination rate could not be calculated for most subject s due to 
sampling  frequency , the rapid drug elimination, and the sensitivity limitations of the assay.  Based 
on the observed individual bryostatin plasma concentration profiles, the elimination t 1/2 associated 
with the observed drug exposure was estimated to be less than 30 minutes .  Total drug CL was

appear to be related to body weight, BSA, or sex.  The bryostatin pharmacokinetic parameters 
were observed to have low to moderate intersu bject variability.  
2.2.1.5  Pharmacodynamics/ PKC ε 
Preliminary assessment of PKCε concentration in PBMCs suggests there is an incre ase in the total 
amount of PKCε (cytosol plus membrane bound  concentration ) following treatment with 
bryostatin.  Additional analysis is underway to further characterize the increase and 
pharmacodynamics.  
2.2.1.6  Conclusions  
This was the first double -blind assessment  of the safety of bryostatin treatment in subjects with 
Alzheimer’s disease.  The study met it primary endpoint of safety and toler ability.  Bryostatin 
appears safe and we ll tolerated in this cohort of subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s 
disease.  No improvement was detected in cognitive function on the efficacy measurements  though 
the study was not powered to detect cognitive benefit.  There was no evidence of an adverse effect 
on cognition following treatment with bryostatin.   
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND HYPOTHESIS  
3.0 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety , tolerability and efficacy of bryostatin for the treatment of moderately severe 
to severe Alzheimer’s disease  in subjects not receiving concurrent memantine treatment . 
3.1 Hypothesis   
Patients treated with bryostatin  will experience a greater improvement in cognitive function as 
measured by the SIB from baseline to the primary efficacy endpoint after 12 weeks of treatment, as 
compared to patients on placebo during the same time period.  The null hypothesis will be rej ected 
at a significance level of a two -sided α = 0.05. The test of the null hypothesis will be a superiority 
test based on the two -sample t -test, and only an improvement in the SIB score from baseline is of 
clinical significance.  
  
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.0 Overview of  Study Design    
This is a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled exploratory study  assessing bryostatin for 
the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease  in subjects not receiving 
memantine treatment .  The study is 15 weeks in duration, including safety and efficacy evaluation 
30 days after the last treatment. Eligible subjects will be stratified based on  MMSE -2 scores 4 -9 
vs. 10 -15 and will be randomized 1:1 to treatmen t with  20µg  bryostatin  or placebo  for 12 weeks  of 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 29 of 74 treatment .  Study drug is administered  IV by continuous infusion . The first two doses of study drug 
will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 24µg)  than the assigned dose and will be administered one 
week apart. Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be 
administered every other week.   Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks.   
Safety and efficac y assessments will be done as indicated on the Schedule of Activities  (Table  1).  
4.1 Dose Rationale  
The primary objective of treatment for cognitive disorders with bryostatin is activation of PKCε, 
not downregulation as was attempted for the oncology indicati ons.  Bryostatin activation of PKCε 
is dose dependent, where lower doses activate PKCε and appear to increase de -novo synthesis of 
the enzyme, while higher doses of bryostatin downregulate PKCε.   
The dosing regimen is based on the recently completed phase  2 study, NTRP101 -202, in which the 
safety and efficacy analyses indicated a clear advantage of the 20µg dose over the 40µg dose .   
The oncology data suggest that the dose -limiting side effect of myalgia is dose dependent and 
cumulative and likely related to the down regulation of PKC ε.  This was not seen in the NTRP101 -
201 study, in which there were no reports of myalgia  after a single 25µg/m2 dose of bryostatin was 
administered , nor in the recently completed NTRP101 -202 study, in which myalgia was 
considered an adverse event of special interest.  In NTRP101 -202, in which subjects received 7 
doses of study drug, myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the h igher 40 
µg dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesics.  
Dosing in this study will begin with two initial loading doses at  one-week intervals that are 20 % 
higher than the maintenance dose to assure enzyme activation. Do sing will then continue every 
other week.  
4.2 Risk/Benefit  
Bryostatin treatment in study NTRP101 -202 was shown to be general ly safe and well tolerated. 
The 20μg bryostatin treatment group had similar numbers of TEAEs to the placebo treatment 
group except in in jection site reactions and diarrhea. Post hoc  analysis in NTRP101 -202 clearly 
showed that bryostati n-treated subjects who did not take memantine at baseline had significantly 
better improvement in SIB score compared to the placebo group in an MMRM  analyses  of SIB 
total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin  (20 μg and 40 μg)  and 20μg 
bryostatin treatment groups had significantly better scores than the placebo treatment group at 
Weeks 5, 13, and at 30 -day Follow -up. There were no statistic al differences in SIB score between 
treatment groups in subjects given memantine at baseline.   NTRP101 -203 w ill prospectively seek 
to replicate these findings and  demonstrate a clear benefit both in terms of safety and efficacy in 
this patient population  when comparing the 20µg bryostatin dose to placebo . 
Therapeutic antibodies targeting β -amyloid have been associated with the occurrence of amyloid 
related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which is similar in appearance to cerebral vasogenic edema 
and microhemo rrhage.  A minority of cases have been associated with symptoms of headache, 
visual disturbance, loss of coordination, or disorientation.  Asymptomatic ARIA was reported in a 
clinical study of the small molecule gamma -secretase inhibitor BMS -708163.  Bryos tatin has a 
different mechanism of action than antibodies directed at amyloid, but in the transgenic mouse

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 30 of 74 model of AD treated with bryostatin a decrease of Aβ deposition was observed.  Given the limited 
bryostatin experience in AD, the potential for ARIA and associated clinical events cannot be 
excluded.   In NTRP101 -202, however, there was no clinical evidence suggestive of vasogenic 
edema or microhemorrha ge that require d an MRI scan.  
Subjects in this study, with moderately severe to severe dementia, are those who have had a 
progressive dementia to the degree that their activities of daily living and their ability to care for 
themselves may be compromised.  Subjects with MMSE -2 scores o f 15 or less display significant 
cognitive impairments that are disabling.  Most if not all of these subjects will have progressed 
despite treatment and have no alternative treatments available.  Based on the available nonclinical 
and clinical data, and th e low risk of ARIA, the potential benefits of treatment with bryostatin at 
the proposed dose in this protocol outweigh the risks.

5.3 Storage  and Preparation of Study Drug  
The study drug  kits will be stored under refrigeration  conditions  (2-8°C) in a refrigerator, 
refrigerated cabinet or other refrigerated enclosure, which is securely locked  and temperature 
continuously monitored .  Access to th e stored study drug kits  will be restricted to the 
investigational site pharmacy or designated staff  member .   
Study drug will be prepared and dispensed for administration by a qualified member of the study 
staff ( e.g., pharmacist, pharmacist -designee, nurse or physician trained in aseptic handling 
techniques).  This individual will be responsible for reconstitution, dilution and preparation of 
study drug (active and placebo ) according to the randomization assignment for each subject .  The 
investigational drug is to be administered only according to the conditions of this protocol.   
Study drug will be administered by the study PI or his/her designees.  Study drug should be allowed 
to come to room temperature prior to administration.  The study drug contains no antibacterial 
preservatives and must be used within eight hours of reconstitution. Study drug should be 
reconstituted with 1 mL of PET diluent. After swirling the 10 mL vial to completely dissolve the 
contents, the resulting solut ion mus t be diluted immediately with 9 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride 
(NS) injection,  USP.  The necessary volume of this solution to achieve the assigned dose  (a 4.8 mL 
loading  dose for the first two doses  and a 4.0 mL maintenance  dose for the remaining 5 doses ) 
should then be added to a n IV infusion bag containing 50 mL of normal saline.  Once the infusion

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 36 of 74 bag is filled  with the assigned dose , the 45 ±5 minute continuous infusion must be completed 
within 3 hours  of the IV infusion bag f ill. 
The infusion system ( IV infusion bag and tubing) should be made of a polyolefin plastic, such as 
polypropylene or poly ethylene, or a combination of both . The use of polyvinylchloride (PVC) 
plastic bags and tubing  is NOT to be used  as plasticizer  from the PVC  is leached and there is 
absorption  of bryostatin to PVC plastics .   
The prepared infusion bag  containing  study drug  should be labeled with the following information:  
Protocol number  
Kit/Subject  number  
Date and time prepared  
Instructions for dosing ( e.g., entire contents of IV infusion bag infused within 45 ±5 
minutes 
 
5.4 Study Drug Accountability and Disposal  
Neither the Investigational Pharmacy , designated drug preparer , the PI nor any of his/her designees 
may provide drug to any person not enr olled in this study.  Adequate records of study drug  receipt 
and use must be maintained in order to comply with governmental regulations and with the 
protocol in addition to preventing unauthorized distribution . 
Study drug orders, records of receipts, disp ensing records, and inventory forms will be examined 
and reconciled throughout the study.  All study drug that is used during the course of the study 
must be accounted for on a drug accountability form.  
Unless otherwise directed, at the end of the study al l unused study medication must be destroyed 
onsite following the site’s specific SOPs after drug accountabi lity has been verified by the mo nitor.   
If destruction on site is not possible, study medication should be retained and returned to Singota  
Solutions at the end of the study. A copy of all completed drug accountability forms will be 
collected by the monitor or appropriate designee u pon completion of the study .  
Note : The medications should not be disposed of prior to monitoring  and approval . 
5.5 Randomization  
Once all eligibility criteria for the study have been met,  and the site has received approval by the 
Medical Monitor (MM) and Clinical Assessment Technologies (CAT) group, via the EDC system,  
the subject  can be randomize d via Interactive Resp onse Technology ( IRT) system . A 
randomization number will be assigned , and drug for that randomization number will be shipped to 
the site  for twelve weeks of treatment.  Randomization and scheduling of the first study drug 
infusion should be timed to allow  for receipt of study drug prior to the scheduled study treatment.  
The drug kit s will be shipped to the individual who will be responsible for kit storage and drug 
preparation and may not be handled by any other study staff member.  The study drug kit will not 
identify the vial containing study drug as either placebo or bryostatin .

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 37 of 74 5.6 Blinding  
All subjects, PIs, and investigational clinical site personnel will be blinded to dose assignment.   
Since there is no known antidote to bryostatin, t he blind should  only be broken in exceptional 
circumstances  and is at the discretion of the PI.  The Medical Monitor should be contacted as soon 
as possible to discuss the situation , but this should not delay any treatment.  
In a non -emergency situation, when u nblinding is requeste d, the site  should discuss the clinical  
circumstances with the Medical Monitor  to determine if breaking the blind will alter the subject’s  
treatment .  The decision to break the blind is ultimately the decision of the PI.   If the blind is 
broken for a subject, the PI will record the date and reason for breaking the blind in the  electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ) and study drug  treatment will be discontinued .  However, the subject will 
continue to be monitored per protocol fo r safety and efficacy.  
5.7 Study Drug Administration  
Study drug is scheduled to be administered by  continuous  intravenous infusion only, via a pump, at 
the same rate over  45 minutes  (±5 min)  once a week for 2 weeks and then every 14 days ±2 days  
thereafter .  The entire volume of study drug in the infusion bag  is to be administer ed. Infusion 
times should not be extended or shortened.  If a subject misses a dose, the dose should be 
administered as soon as possible.  The subject should then continue on the original dosing 
schedule.   Provided all efficacy assessments have been completed, if deemed necessary by the PI, 
a short acting sedative may be administered to reduce a subject’s anxiety or agitation during the 
infusion. All medication is t o be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF.  
 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES AND  ASSESSMENTS   
Subjects will be randomized to study drug , either bryostatin  or placebo  treatment .  A follow -up 
visit will take place 30 days after the last dose of study drug  for all subject s, including subject s that 
have discontinued treatment before completion of the study . Assessments will be performed 
according to the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1).

6.1 Assessments  
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are completed 
as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstanc es 
outside the control of the PI that may ma ke it unfeasible to perform a test.  In these cases, the PI 
must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject.  When a protocol 
required test cannot be performed, the PI will document the reason for the missed test and any 
corrective and prev entative actions which were taken to ensur e that the required processes are 
adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely 
manner.  
6.1.1 Safety  
Overall safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence of treatment emergent AEs and 
SAEs and  by eva luations of change from baseline in physical examination, vital signs, 12 -lead 
ECG , the C-SSRS , clinical chemistry, hematology , and coagulation lab tests .  
6.1.1.1  Laboratory  
Blood samples will be obtained for routine laboratory tests, including hematology, chemistry,  
coagulation  and βhCG if indicated as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2 ).   
Hematology tests will include CBC with differential , platelet  count  and coa gulation 
(prothrombin time  (PT) and partial prothrombin Time  (PTT)) studies.  
 
Clinical chemistry tests will include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, estimated creatinine CL, glucose, calcium, CO2, total protein,  
albumin, ALP, ALT, AST,  gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
uric acid and bilirubin.   A serum creatine phosphokinase  (CPK ) will be done at screening and in 
the event of myalgia.  A TSH will be done at screening, and B12, T-3 and T -4 will be done if 
TSH r esult is abnormal.  
 
Samples will be sent to a central lab for testing .  Refer to the Laboratory Manual  for detailed 
instructions . 
6.1.1.2  Physical Examination  
All physical examinations must be performed by the PI or qualified designee (physician, 
physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner).  The complete physical examination conducted 
during the screening period and at designated subsequent time points should  include, but is not 
limited to the following:   
• General appearance  
• Weight  
• Height (screening only)  
• Ears  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 40 of 74 • Eyes  
• Nose  
• Throat  
• Neck  
• Respiratory system  
• Cardiovascular system  
• Abdomen  
• Musculoskeletal /Neurologic  
• Extremities  
• Skin  
• Lymph nodes  
An abbreviated PE will include  but is not limited to the following:  
• General appearance  
• Weight  
• Respiratory system  
• Cardiovascular system  
• Abdomen  
Examination of other systems as needed to explore reports of AEs should be conducted as 
needed by the PI.  Any cli nically significant  physical findings that were not present on the  initial 
physical examination will be considered AEs and documented on the AE eCRF as well as in the 
subject’s source documentation and on the physical examination eCRFs.   
6.1.1.3  Vital Sign  Measur ements  
Single supine  blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at Screening and at oth er visits as 
specified in the Schedule of Activities .  
6.1.1.4  Electrocardiogram  
An average of triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be collected at screening.  The triplicate ECG 
measurements sho uld be obtained approximately 2 -4 minutes apart.  Single 12 -lead ECGs will be 
collected at time points  specified in the Schedule of Activities.  
6.1.1.5  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS is an interview -based rating s cale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behavior.  The scale should be administered by an individual with appropriate clinical 
training, who has also taken the specific rater training for the scale, which will be provided by an 
agent o f the Sponsor prior to the study start.  If at any visit from baseline on, there are “YES” 
answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C -SSRS, a risk assessment should be 
done by a qualified clinician to determine whether it is safe for the subject to continue to 
participate in the study .  A suicidality narrative should be constructed for subjects who have 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 41 of 74 undergone any post -baseline risk assessment, using information from the C -SSRS, an d available 
information from t he NPI, prior screening an d baseline information, the clinician assessment and 
the narrative guide.   Subjects who answer “YES” on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of 
the C -SSRS on more than one occasion during a study  should be discontinued from the study .  
Suicidality AEs or other clinical observations may, based on the judgment of the PI, also trigger 
a risk assessment and a narrative.  When there is a positive response to any question on the C -
SSRS, the PI should de termine whether an AE has occurred.  
6.1.2 Efficacy  / Psychometric Assessments  
All raters for the efficacy assessments need to be trained and qualified on the administration of 
the scales.  A qualified  rater is required for the administration of  the SIB, NPI and MMSE -2.  
The same qualified rater should perform a given Efficacy/Psychometric Assessment at 
approximately the same time of day for a given subject throughout the study.  All changes in 
raters for a given assessments must be noted in the subject’s source d ocuments.   The caregiver 
designated to provide assessments ( ADCS -ADL -Sev and NPI) at the start of the study should be  
the same individual throughout the study.  Should a change be necessary during the course of the 
study, the reason for the change and the first corresponding visit must be noted in the subject’s 
source document.  
All psychometric tests performed on study s ubjects on the same day should be administered in 
the following order: SIB followed by MMSE -2, except at the screening visit  as described in 
Section 6.2.1 . If the MMSE -2 score obtained at screening does not fall within the 4 -15 range for 
inclusion, no furt her screening tests should be performed.  Efficacy  tests at subsequent visits 
should be administered prior to dosing . 
6.1.2.1  Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale  
The Rosen -Modified Hachinski  Scale will be evaluated at screening to differentiate Alzheimer’s 
type dementia from multi -infarct dementia.  The 8 -item scale results in a score of 0 -12; and a 
score of 5 or above is exclusionary for the  study . 
6.1.2.2  Severe Impairment Battery  
The SIB is used to assess cognition in subject s with moderate and severe AD.   It is divided into 
nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, 
construction, social ski lls, orienting head to name.  Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus 
decreasing the need for language output.  Forty  questions are included with a point score range 
of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.   
6.1.2.3  Mini Mental State Examination, 2nd Edition  
The Standard version of the MMSE -2, with two alternate forms,  will be used.  This version has 
the structure and scoring of the original 30 -item MMSE -2 and scores are comparable.  The 
MMSE -2 is a brief, widely used test for assessing overall cognitive state.  The MMSE -2 
measures selected aspects of cognition such as memory, orientation, attention, language, and 
praxis on a scale of 0 -30.  Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 42 of 74 6.1.2.4  Alzheimer’s Disease  Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory – 
Seve re Impairment Version  
The ADCS -ADL -Sev is a 19 -item functional assessment of the performance of activities of daily 
living for subject s with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease.  Informants are queried via a 
structured int erview format as to whether su bjects attempted each item in the inventory during 
the previous 4 weeks, as well as their level of performance.  Each item is rated from the highest 
level of independent performance to complete loss.  Total score range s from 0 -54 with lower 
scores indicating greater functional impairment.   The ADCS -ADL -Sev may be administered via 
telephone at the discretion of the PI, within the allowed time window for the scheduled visit.  
6.1.2.5  Neuropsychiatric Inventory  
The NPI is a caregiv er interview -based rating scale assessing 10 behavioral disturbances 
occurring in dementia subject s.  The NPI may be administered via telephone at the discretion of 
the investigator, within the allowed time window for the scheduled visit.  Items are scored  for 
both frequency and severity.   Total scores range from 0 -120 with higher scores indicating greater 
behavioral disturbances.  For each item, the associated caregiver distress is also assessed.  
6.1.2.6  Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale  
The CGI -I is used to assess global change in the subject’s condition compared to baseline before 
treatment.  The same Clinician must complete the CGI -I scale at each scheduled visit. This is a 
seven -point scale ranging from (1) very much improved to (7) very much wo rse. 
6.2 Visit Procedures  
6.2.1 Screening and Randomization (Days -28 to -2) 
In order to avoid unnecessary screen failures, a prescreening telephone call to rule out clearly 
exclusionary conditions is advised prior to scheduling a screening visit.  Informed Consent must 
be obtained before any study related procedures are performed. Screening procedures and 
randomization will take place within a n approximate  4-week period prior to first dose 
administration (Days -28 to -2).   
Subjects who are screen -failed (e.g. due to clinically significant laboratory abnormality or an 
active medical condition) may be re -screened if their medical condition stabilizes or improves as 
assessed by the PI.  Subject who are screen -failed due to MMSE score may be rescreened in 3 
months.  
The Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to re -screening.  Subjects who are Screen Failures  
may be rescreened only once.  
 
The following procedures should be performed first t o avoid unnecessary procedures for 
ineligible subject s:  
• Collect ion of  subject demographic data  
• Review of concomitant medications   
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 43 of 74 • Review of m edical history   
• Assessment of neuroimaging  (CT or MRI  performed within 2 years of screening ) 
• Evaluate Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale  
• Evaluate MMSE -2  
After confirming that these parameters satisfy eligibility criteria, the remaining 
screening procedures should be performed;  
• SIB. The SIB should be done within 3 weeks before the first study drug dose. If 
the screening period exceeds 3 weeks, the SIB should be r epeated on the day of 
the first dose, prior to dosing. The repeat SIB score obtained closest to the day of 
dosing should be recorded in the eCRF as an unscheduled visit.  
• NPI 
• ADSC -ADL -SIV 
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• Blood samples for routine safety including hematology, PT, PTT, INR and 
serum -chemistry, CPK, TSH  (B12, T-3 and T -4 if indicated),  and β -hCG, if 
indicated  
• 12-lead ECG (x3)  
• Complete physical examination  
• Vital signs  
• AEs and concomitant medications  
If changes in the subject’s health or mental status occur during the screening and 
randomization period, including changes in medication affecting the mental status, the 
Medical Monitor should be notified. The Medical Monitor will advise the PI  regarding 
any assessments that should be repeated to ensure eligibility requirements are met.  
Sites will not be able to randomize subjects before confirmation that eligibility criteria 
have been m et per the review of the Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale, MM SE-2, 
CSSRS , and other eligibility criteria by the Worldwide Clinical Trials’ Clinical 
Assessment Technologies (CAT)  group  and Medical Monitor (MM) . 
 
6.2.2 Week 0 ( Day 0 Dose  1) 
If the subject has had no intervening medical issues or changes in medi cations between 
the date of randomization  and Week  0, dosing may proceed as scheduled.   
A final a ssessment of the inclusion/exclusion criteria , including any changes in medications or 
health status will be done before dosing to confirm the  subject ’s eligibility .   
 The following procedures  will be done on Day 0:

During the screening visit, the Caregiver will provide a history of prior medication use during the 
past 6 months and provide a list of currently used medications .  All concomitant medications 
used should be recorded on the eCRF  and in the source documents using the generic na me for 
the drug.  Assessment of concomitant medications will take place at each study visit.  Any 
changes to chronic medications should be noted as well as new and discontinued medications.   
Subject s taking allowed antidepressant medications may be enrolled in the study  (see Appendix 
1).  The dose and dose regimen for these medications should be stabilized for at least 30 days 
prior to enrollment in the study.  Every effort should be made to keep the dose and dose regimen 
of antidepressant medication s stable throughout the study.  
6.3.1 Medications for AD  
Subject s taking FDA approved  medications for the treatment of AD , with the exception of 
memantine or any drug containing memantine , may be enrolled in the study.  The subject  
must be on a stable dose of per mitted medications for at least 3 months prior to entry into the 
study and dose must not change during the study.  Subject s may not initiate additional drugs for 
treatment of AD during the study other than the study drug .  
6.3.2 Concomitant Medications for Manag ement of Myalgia  
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium are permitted .  
Use of acetaminophen  as an analgesic is contraindicated as it has the ability to inhibit PKC 
activation.  
6.3.3 Prohibited  Medications   
Memantine is prohibited.  Subjects previously treated with memantine must stop treatment at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study drug treatment.  Treatment with other NMDA receptor 
antagonists such as but not  limited to dextromethorphan (a cough supp ressant), ketamine, 
phencyclidine (PCP), methoxetamine (MXE), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and the following synthetic 
opiods: penthidine, levorphanol, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, tramadol, and ketobemidone 
is prohibited  and a 30 -day washout period is required p rior to initiation of study drug treatment.    
High dose Vitamin E (> 400 IU / day) , Valproic Acid and divalproex sodium are prohibited.  
If the PI determines that initiation of any of the  prohibited medications  is required to ensure the

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 48 of 74 7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER SAF ETY EVALUATIONS  
7.0 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e .g., clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality.   
The PI is responsible for obtaining information about all med ical emergencies during the clinical 
study. The PI’s contact information will be located in the body of the  informed consent form 
(ICF) and subjects/caregivers will be encouraged to contact the PI or clinical site personnel 
during any clinical study -relate d emergency.  
All adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or caregiver in response to an open 
question or revealed by observation will be recorded durin g the study regardless of relationship 
to the study drug .  All AEs will be monitored and  recorded for the progress of the event until it 
resolves or reaches a clinically stable outcome .  Adverse events that are not resolved at the time 
of database lock will be recorded as ongoing.  
The AE and SAE reporting period starts from the time of conse nt to the last study visit.   
7.1 Adverse Event of Special Interest - Myalgia  
Myalgia has been reported as the dose limiting toxicity across the oncology studies.  The 
incidence of myalgia appears to be dose dependent and cumulative.   However , it has been 
reported in subject s receiving doses as low as 5μg/m2.  The myalgia has been investigated in 
some studies but not all.   No increase in muscle enzymes were found in the cases investigated.  
EMG was abnormal in one subject who received 65µg/m2 and suggested a patchy myositis . An 
MRI done in another subject was normal.  
For all cases of myalgia despite the severity , a narrative will be created documenting onset, 
severity, treatment and outcome.  Muscle enzymes , CPK, will be collected for all cases  and 
compared to baseline values.  Additional investigations are at the discretion of the investigator.  
7.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that fulfills any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death (fatal)  
• Is life threatening (an event is con sidered “life threatening” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence placed the subject  at immediate risk of 
death.   It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death).  
• Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 49 of 74 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
or 
• Is an important medical event (events that may not resu lt in death, be immediately life 
threatening or require hospitalization; may be considered serious when based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes lis ted above.  Examples include; 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.    
The following situations may not, by themselves, constitute sufficient grounds to be considered 
as an SAE:   
• Hospitalization solely for a diagnostic purpose, even if related to an AE,  
• Elective hospitalization for an intervention planned before the subject enrollment in 
the study  
• Admission to a day care facility or sleeping laboratory  
7.3 Assessment of Intensity  
Severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE and will be dete rmined by the PI 
based on the following classification criteria for all AEs occurring during the clinical study:  
Mild - Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated, may require additional therapy  
Moderate  - Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity and to require 
intervention or additional therapies  
Severe  - Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity  
Note : It should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious in nature and that an SAE is not, by 
definition, severe.  Regardless of intensity, all SAEs and significant events must be reported.  
7.4 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causal relationship between the investigational drug and each AE will be determined by the 
PI based on his/her medical judgment in considerat ion of all relevant factors, including pattern of 
reaction, temporal relationship, positive, concomitant medication, co -existing diseases, and 
relevant medical history.   The PI will classify every AE according to its relationship to study 
drug or trial -related procedures.  The categories according to World Health Organization 
guidelines are listed in the following Table  
 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 50 of 74 7.5 Table 2 Relationship of AE to Study Drug or Trial -Related Procedures  
Rating  Classification  Definition  
1 Probable  An AE that:  
• Occurs at a reasonable time interval after administration 
of the study drug ;  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug  
and; 
• Cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state or by other 
therapies.  
2 Possible  An AE that:  
• Occurs at a reasonable time interval after administration 
of the study drug ;  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug , 
but; 
• Could have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state 
or by other therapies.  
•  
3 Unlikely*  • An AE for which sufficient information exists to 
indicate that the etiology is unrelated to the study drug;  
• Another etiology is specified.  
*If the AE is classified as unlikely, the PI should provide a likely cause, other illness, 
concomitant medication, or o ther.  
7.5.1 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the  Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or se verity that has been observed.  Unexpected refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurr ing with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug 
under investigation.  However, an event that is more specific or more severe than describe d in 
the IB will be considered unexpected.  
7.6 Reporting Adverse Events  
The PI should instruct all subject s/caregivers on the procedure for reporting AEs/ SAEs to the 
approp riate clinical site personnel.  For each AE reported by parents/guardians, clinical site 
personnel should obtain all required information to complete the eCRF.  
The PI or designee should  document all AEs/ SAEs in subject s’ source documentation and on the 
AE eCRF.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 51 of 74 In addition to standardi zed reporting procedures, worsening or exacerbation of concurrent 
conditions in subject s will also be reported as AEs, and will follow the designated reporting 
format.  
The following should be recorded with each SAE/AE:  
• The nature of the AE, with a diagnosis wherever possible  
• Date of event  
• Assessment of intensity  
• Is this an SAE ? 
• Relationship to study drug  or trial -related procedures  
• Action taken regarding study drug treatment  
• Outcome  
If the intensity of an already reported AE increases, then a new AE  eCRF must be completed for 
that AE. The date of change would be included as the end date for the originally reported AE, 
and the start date for the new AE of greater intensity.  
The clinical research associate is responsible for source document verificati on of all safety 
events.  
If the clinical site becomes aware of an SAE, regardless of causality, within 30 days following 
the last administration of investigational product, the SAE should be recorded and reported 
immediately to the Sponsor.  An SAE that oc curs more than 30 days after the last dose will NOT 
be collected unless the PI considers that the event is related to the investigational product.  
The sponsor should be informed if the PI becomes aware of any unusual safety information or 
any potential dru g-related safety information, even after a subject completes the study  
7.6.1 SAE reports  
All SAEs, whether or not considered associated  with study treatment or study -related procedures, 
must be reported on the eCRF immediately and no later than 24  hours after the site becomes 
aware of the  event .  Follow -up information must be provided promptly as requested.    
The PI is obligated to provide as much information about the event as possible on the eCRF 
provided and as requested by the Sponsor or Medical Monit or.  
In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete 
medical assessment of the case.   The pharmacovigilance physician or  designee will review the 
SAE including the SAE  criteria, the relationship to study medication, the expected or unexpected 
assessment, and inform the Sponsor by phone and e -mail immediately.  
The following AEs should also be reported to the Sponsor’s designat ed Medical Monitor 
immediately:   
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 52 of 74 • severe injection/infusion site reactions (ulcerat ion or necrosis that is severe; operative 
intervention indicated)  
• systemic hypersensitivity reactions  
• myalgia  
All additional follow -up evaluations must be reported by the site to the medical monitor, or 
designee, immediately after notification of the addi tional information.   
An SAE will be followed until it resolves or reaches a clinically stable outcome.  AEs/SAEs that 
have not resolved by study closure will be considered ongoing.  
An SAE that occurs after the 30-day safety visit  will NOT be collected  unless the PI  determines 
that the event is related to the investigational drug product.  
7.6.2 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The PI, or designee, is responsible for informing the  Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of any 
unexpected SAEs, as well as any additional SAEs according to the IRB’s policy . 
Any SAE that is serious , suspected to be related to investigational study drug  and unexpected  
(SUSAR) , will  be promptly reported to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor  according to 
expedited reporting requirements.  Subsequent relevant information after the initial submission 
of the (IND) Safety Report to the regulatory authorities will be submitted  in a follow -up IND 
Safety Report  to the regulatory authorities in the e xpedited period  by the Sponsor.  
7.7 Criteria for Withdrawal of Subject s 
Subject s may be w ithdrawn from the clinical study  for the following reasons:  
• The PI believes withdrawal to be medically necessary or in the best interest of the 
subject  
• Noncompliance with the protocol as judged by the PI (requires discussion with the 
Sponsor)   
• Subjects who are enrolled in violation of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria   
• An AE that presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject  as judged by 
the PI, Sponsor or the Medical Monitor  
• Lost to follow up  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Subject is unblinded  
 
Subjects may voluntarily discontinue their participation in the study a t any time without 
prejudice to further treatment.  
7.8 Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study d rug treatment may be discontinued for the following reasons:  
• if sponsor or regulatory authorities discontinue study  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 53 of 74 • if the PI believes that disco ntinuing treatment is in the best interest of the subject  
7.9 Study Discontinuation  
Neurotrope  has the right to discontinue this clinical study at any time. The  PI has the right to 
discontinue participation in this clinical study  at any time for any reason .  Clinical study  site 
discontinuation should only occur after mutual consultation between the PI and Neurotrope . 
Should the clinical study  be discontinued prematurely, all subject s should be brought in for early 
termination procedures as outlined for the 30-day Follow -up visit.   All clinical study  materials 
should be returned to Neurotrope  or designee.  
  
8 SAFETY MONITORING  
An Independent Safety Monitor will provide consultation to Neurotrope  to assess the 
implementation and progress of study  NTRP101 -203 and will review accumulating trial data to 
monitor the safety of bryostatin administered to patients with AD.  Safety data will be reviewed 
when 30 subjects have received four doses of study drug, followed by additional safety analyses 
when 60 s ubjects have received a similar number of doses.  Medical decisions relevant to this 
study will be made by the Sponsor in consultation with the Primary Investigator , Medical 
Monitor  and S tatistician . 
Prior to each safety review, a cut -off date for the data to be provided will be established by the 
Sponsor in consultation with the WCT Supporting Biostatistician.  The format and content of 
data listings will be approved by the Supporting Biostatistician.  Data reports will be provided as 
partially blinded disp lays (e.g., data is grouped by unblinded treatment using "Group A, B” to 
indicate treatment).  The identity of each group will be available to the safety reviewer via the 
Supporting Statistician.  
Data review documents, safety data  tables and listings, will  be provided to the Independent 
Safety Monito r at least 7 business days prior to scheduled reviews. Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) reported during the 7 days before the scheduled review and therefore not included in the 
provided documentation will be provid ed by the WCT  Drug Safety Manager  as soon as possible 
before the review date . The reviews of the safety data will be summarized for the overall subject 
group only and will not be separated by treatment groups.   
9 DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  This separate document will be finalized 
prior to study unblinding and conduct of any statistical analys es.  The SAP may modify and will 
take precedence over the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications or 
modification of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 54 of 74 Descriptive su mmaries of safety and efficacy data including number of evaluable subjects, mean, 
median, SD, maximum and minimum for continuous variables will be provided by treatment 
group and scheduled visit.   Categorical variables will be presented showing number eval uable, 
frequencies and percentages.  In addition, the same descriptive statistics will be provided for 
changes from baseline at each post -baseline visit.  
The primary efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint will be  conducted on data collected 
through Week 13.  
9.0 Sample Size Determination   
Based on post hoc analyses of the NTRP 101 -202 study for patients not treated with memantine, 
the SIB for the 20ug bryostatin group demonstrated a mean (SD) increase  of 4.5 (6.8) points 
from baseline by Week 13. In contrast , patients not treated with memantine in the placebo arm 
showed a decrease  in SIB scores at the 13 -week time -point from baseline, giving a mean (SD) 
SIB change of -0.9 (6.7) points. This resulted in group difference in means of  the 13 -week SIB 
measure from  baseline SIB changes of  5.4 poi nts.  
Guided by these post hoc results, power analyses were performed based on 50 patients per 
treatment arm, and assuming  differences  of between 4.0 to 5.5 points in the treatment arm -
specific means of the primary outcome  (e.g. the treatment effect). Table 2 below gives the 
estimated power to detect various treatment effects, assuming a two -sided alpha of 0.05. Based 
on these analyses, 50 patients per group will give an approximate 83% power to detect a  
treatment effect  of 4.0 points, and an estimated power o f 98% to see a treatment effect  of 5.5 
points. Power calculation was based the two -sample t -test of the group difference in the mean 
13-week SIB changes from baseline  SIB.

Power analyses were also preformed to determine detectable effect sizes that assume an 
estimated dropout rate of 25% (e.g. 50 patients per group at a baseline, dropping to 37 patients 
per group by Week 13). Table 3 gives the estimated powers for treatment effects  of between 4.5 
and 5.5 points, assuming a 25% dropout rate. Note that a minimum treatment effect  of 4.5 points 
can be statistically detected with at least 80% power, given 37 patients per group  with a primary 
efficacy endpoint .

9.1 Statistical Methods  
The Safety Analysis Set (SA S) is defined as all randomized subjects who received any study 
medication (either partial or completed infusions of bryostatin or placebo ).  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) used for efficacy analyses, consistent with the  modified  intention -
to-treat ( mITT) principles, is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose 
of study medication and who have at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment.  
 
The completer analysis set (CAS) will be defined as all randomized subjects who completed 12 
weeks of treatment, and who have a week 13  SIB assessment.  
Demographics will include age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, and body weight and will be 
summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics for both the SA S and FAS 
populations.  
Medical history, neuroimaging, prior and concomitant medications, exis ting disease, years since 
AD onset and diagnosis, baseline medical conditions, and baseline safety and 
neuropsychological assessments will be summarized descriptively by  treatment group for both 
the SA S and FAS populations . 
Subject disposition will be summ arized by treatment group and will include numbers screened, 
randomized, dosed and withdrawn with reason for withdrawal.  
9.2 Exploratory Analysis  
Descriptive statistics by visit and randomized treatment group will be provided for all efficacy 
data. These descr iptive statistics will include the mean, median, SD, maximum and minimum for 
continuous variables, and frequencies, percentage, and tabulations for categorical variables. 
Summary statistics will also be performed on both the patient demographics and patien t clinical 
characteristics. Exploratory plots of the data  will also be created, including box plots and 
histograms, in order to determine the distribution of these data as well as to identify any unusual 
or outlying observations.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 56 of 74 9.3 Safety Analysis  
The SAS  population will be used for all safety analyses with treatment group determined by the 
treatment actually received. The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) is defined as all randomized subjects 
who received any study medication (either partial or completed infusion s of bryostatin or 
placebo). AEs, safety laboratory, ECGs, physical exam and vital signs data will be presented in 
tabular format and summarized descriptively by treatment group.  No formal hypothesis testing 
will be carried out on these safety assessments .  Incidence and severity of AEs will be 
summarized by treatment dose using System Organ Class (SOC).  AEs will be coded according 
to standard MedDRA terms.  
C-SSRS responses will be mapped onto the Columbia -Classification Algorithm of Suicide 
Assessment ( C-CASA) scale, and the frequency distribution of the C -CASA scores will be 
tabulated by treatment group and study visit.  No hypotheses associated with the C -SSRS or C -
CASA scales will be tested.  
Subject disposition will be summarized by treatment group an d will include numbers screened, 
randomized, dosed and withdrawn with reason for withdrawal.  
9.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the change  from baseline to Week 13 in the SIB total 
score.  The primary analysis will be conducted on FAS population . The CAS population will be 
used as a supportive analysis.   All statistical tests for efficacy will be two -sided tests, with 
α=0.05.  
   
Based on the review of patients not treated with memantine in t he NTRP 101 -202 clinical trial, 
the expected number of  patients who will drop out of the study prematurely will not be 
significant.  For efficacy evaluations, multiple imputation methods will be used to handle missing 
data. This imputation method is a robus t method to impute missing measurements. The 
imputation will be carried out in SAS version 9.4 or later using PROC MI. Each imputation 
model will include the stratification factor (i.e., MMSE -2 score (4 -9 vs. 10 -15)) as a covariate in 
the model. .

9.5.4 Individual patient’s slope over time in SIB total score evaluated via Weeks 0, 5, 9  
and 13  
 
Individual -specific SIB slopes will be estimated for all patients over each person’s available SIB  
outcome measures. An indicator will be assigned to each patient depending on the sign of the 
SIB slope β (i.e. I= -1 if β <0; 1 if β >0; no value otherwise). T he proportions of patients with I=1 
and, respectively, -1 will be compare d using logistic regression to assess the overa ll trend 
between treatments . In addition, an overall population averaged slope will be estimated for each 
treatment arm, and two -sample t -test will be used to assess the difference between treatments.  
   
9.6 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
The following exploratory endpoints will be analyzed:  
Change from baseline in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score  
Change from baseline  in MMSE -2 total score

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 61 of 74 designees,  must review and approve the data before database lock, or before any scheduled 
interim analyses, as required by the sponsor.  
The medical records (source documents) upon which the eCRFs are based must be kept at th e 
clinical site for at least a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved 
for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed 
or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is 
discontinued and the FDA is notified.  Neurotrope  must be informed if the records are passed on 
to any other person or institution during this period.  Records related to the study will be 
maintained by Neurotrope  or its designee for a minimum of 5  years per 21  Code of Federal 
Regulations  (CFR ) 58.195 (b) 2.

the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the PI(s) 
• Confirm that facilities r emain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that investigational product accountability checks 
are being performed  
• Perform source data verification.  This inc ludes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject ( e.g. 
clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Neurotrope   
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been reported and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to 
the EC/IRB/  Independe nt Ethics Committee  (IEC).

12 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
12.0  Data Co llection  and Management  
For all written documentation such as source documents, the data collected during the study must 
be legibly printed using a permanent ink pen.  A single line should be drawn through any 
incorrect information.  Opaque correction flui ds or tapes are not permitted.  All corrections or 
deletions to any of the source documents must be dated and initialed.  All corrections or 
deletions to the eCRF will be documented via an electronic audit trail.  The PI or designee will 
electronically sig n each subject ’s final eCRF to signify that all of the information is correct and 
complete.  
12.1  Data Quality Control  
Periodic on -site review of communications between the PI and investigational site study 
monitors, and review of eCRF data and source documents  are the responsibility of the Sponsor, 
or designee.  The eCRF data for each subject will be reviewed against source documents at the 
study sites by the investigational site study monitor.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 64 of 74 The PI and investigational site will allow study  related quality control monitoring and audits, 
EC/IRB/IEC review, and/or regulatory inspection and will cooperate in providing direct access 
to source data and documentation.  
12.2  Data Management and Data Storage  
Study procedures will be documented on source documents that will be retained at the site(s).  
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will produce eCRFs that will be used to collect 
assessment data for this study.  All study data entered into the eCRF will be  compliant with 
regulatory requirements and 21CFR part 11.  The system will allow differing levels of access and 
will accommodate roles for the PI, Medical Monitor, CRO, and Sponsor.  All data changes made 
within the system will be subjected to an audit tr ail.  In compliance with GCP, source 
documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study 
and should clearly document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and subject status.  
The eCRFs will identify st udy subjects with unique identifiers.  Data are recorded from the 
source documents, directly onto the eCRF at the site.   
Electronic CRF data items will undergo quality control standards of operation.  Unresolved 
errors, omissions, or requests for clarific ation will trigger a query to the Investigational Site for 
resolution via electronic queries.  The database will be corrected for completeness and accuracy.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be entered into the eCRF and coded using the World 
Health O rganization  Drug Reference List  (WHO -DRL).  Medical history, concurrent medical 
conditions, and AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  
A quality assurance audit will be conducted to verify the accuracy and completeness of the 
database and will be done prior to de claring database lock.  The database will not be altered after 
lock, unless joint  written agreement is obtained between the CRO and the Sponsor.  
12.3  Inspection of Records  
Neurotrope , Inc. , will  be allowed to condu ct site visits to the investigation facilities for the 
purpose of moni toring any aspect of the study.  The PI agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the 
drug storage area, study drug  stock, drug accountability records, subject charts and study source 
documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
12.4  Retention of Records  
A searchable offline version of the eCRF will be forwarded to the Sponsor for storage.  A copy 
of each comple ted eCRF will remain in the PI’s study file on a compact disk.  All source 
documentation, eCRFs and administrative records will be retained by the PI for a minimum of 
2 years following agency approval of the medication for the indication under study or fol lowing 
notification that the investigational application is closed for this indication.  However, this may 
be adjusted based on the applicable local requirements.  After this time, the documentation will 
either be destroyed or transferred to  Neurotrope  or designee.  No study documentation should be 
destroyed or moved to a new location  without prior written approval by Neurotrope .

research teams must not disclose such information without prior written approval from 
Neurotrope or its representatives.  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained.  A Protected Health Information 
statement w ill be provided to each subject either as a part of the Informed Consent document or 
as a separate form.  Subjects will be identified on eCRFs and other documents by their initials, 
birth date, and subject number.  Documents that identify the subject by na me (eg, the signed 
Informed Consent Form) must be maintained in strict confidence by the PIs. 
12.6  Protocol Amendments  
Minimally, any change that significantly affects the safety of subjects , the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific quality of the stu dy will be effected by means of a protocol 
amendment approved by the Sponsor.  Any changes that affect subject safety or welfare must be 
submitted to the relevant IRB and approved before implementation.  
The PI will provide written agreement of the protoco l amendment via the approval signature 
page.  The PI will notify the IRB of the amendment and obtain approval prior to implementation.

immediately, prior to IRB notification.  
12.7  Protocol Deviations  
Should a deviation from the protocol be deemed crucial for the safety and well -being of a 
particular subject, such a deviation will be instituted for that subject only.  The PI or other 
attending physician should contact the Medical Monitor as soon as poss ible.  In addition, the PI 
or designee should document in the source document the reasons for the protocol deviation and 
the ensuing events. No protocol deviations for any Inclusion or Exclusion criterion will be 
permitted in this study.  
12.8  Data Corrections

16 APPENDIX 3  SUMMARY OF CHANGE S 
16.1 Version 2.0 , 21 Aug 2018  
Global changes:  
• Neurotrope change of address and logo have been updated.  
• Spelling correction: ADCS -ADL -Sev replaces ADCS -ADL -Siv in the list of 
abbreviations and wherever it occurs in the document  
• IRT (Interactive Response Technology) replaces IwRS (Interactive Web Response 
System) in the lis t of abbreviations and wherever it occurs in the document.  
Inclusion criterion #4 clarification: MMSE -2 inclusion range of 4 -15 applies to screening 
criterion only and may deviate from this range during study participation.  
Inclusion criterion #5: The uppe r limit SIB score for inclusion has been changed from 97 to 93 to 
optimize measurement of improvement.  
Exclusion Criterion #4: Text has been added to describe parameters for eligibility with medical 
history of cancer: If there is a h istory of cancer the su bject should be clear of cancer for at least 2 
years prior to screening . More recent history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma and 
melanoma in situ (Stage 0) may be acceptable after review by the Medical Monitor.  
Section 5.3: Since all site personne l are blinded, there is no need to exclude individuals preparing 
study drug from participation in safety or efficacy assessments. The sentence “The individual 
designated to prepare the study drug may not participate in any study subject  safety or efficacy 
evaluations.” has been removed.  
Section 5.5: Text has been added to describe randomization procedure details. The text now 
reads: “ Once all eligibility criteria for the study have been met,  and the site has received 
approval by the Medical Monitor (MM) and Clinical Assessment Technologies (CAT) group, via 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-203

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 74 of 74  
the EDC system,  the subject can be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
system.”   
Section 6.0, Table 1 Schedule of Activi ties: A footnote has been added to clarify time window 
for the screening window. The visit window of ±2 Days for scheduled study visits does not 
apply to the screening and randomization period which is a maximum of 28 days.  
Section 6.1.2: Text has been cla rified to be consistent with Section 6.2.1. The MMSE -2 should 
be administered and assessed before administering the SIB at screening. For all study visits after 
randomization, the SIB should be administered first.  
Section 6.2.1 Text has been added to descr ibe subject re -screening: Subjects who are screen -
failed (e.g. due to clinically significant laboratory abnormality or an active medical condition) 
may be re -screened if their medical condition stabilizes or improves as assessed by the PI.  
Subjects who ar e screen -failed due to MMSE score may be rescreened in 3 months. The Medical 
Monitor should be consulted prior to re -screening. Subjects who are Screen Failures may be 
rescreened only once.   
Section 14, Appendix 1 Restricted Concomitant Medications:  Memant ine has been removed 
from the list of allowed AD medications.  
 
16.2 Version 3.0, 18 April 2019  
No changes have been made to study procedures.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was described in previous versions as the  change in the Severe 
Impairment Battery (SIB) scale score after 12 weeks of treatment from baseline (taking the 
change in the average of SIB measures observed during the Week 13 to Week 15 time window 
from SIB at baseline).    
The revised text is: The primary efficacy endpoint is  defined as the change from baseline to 
Week 13 in the SIB total score .  This change was made to assure consistency with the primary 
analysis endpoint as analyzed in study NTRP101 -202, for which NTRP101 -203 is considered a 
confirmatory study.  
Secondary endpoints were added to an alyze the changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, 13 and 15 
in the SIB total score for subjects enrolled in the MMSE -2 4-9 stratification group and the 
MMSE -2 10-15 stratification group. Similar analysis methods as the primary endpoint will be 
used for analys is of these endpoints.

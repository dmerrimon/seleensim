IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  02/29/2016   Object ive: To determine if delayed cord clamping above the peri neum has an ef fect on neonatal 
hematocrit when compared to delayed cord clamping below the perineum in Pre-term spontaneous 
vaginal deliveries

BACKGROU ND: 
 
Delayed cord clamping has been noted to reduce the need for neonatal transfusion, especia lly in pre- 
term infants. In a ddition, the higher hemoglobin levels in newborns serve as a source of new born iron 
stores to assist during the first 6  months of life (1). Infants born with lower iron stores may be at risk for 
iron defic iency  during the time of exclusive breastfeeding. Delaying cord clamping has been s hown to 
improve fetal hemoglobin levels around the time of birth ( 6,7). These  studies h ave typically been 
performed with the infant kept either at or below the level of the placenta.  Potential a dverse effects 
related  to delayed cord clamping include: increased post-partum hemorrhage (this eff ect has not been 
supported by  evidence) and increased ri sk of therapy for newborn jaundice (which has been noted in 
some studies looking at delay) (8). 
 
Skin to skin contact at the time of birth, however also has purported benefits  relating to maternal – 
infant attac hment. Additionally, this allows for a family centered experience  with the infant placed 
immediately on the maternal abdomen and  allows the father  or other  family member to partic ipate in 
the cord cutting. The positioning for this with the  infant on the maternal abdom en, th eoretically  places 
the inf ant at a higher level than the placenta.  
 
The mecha nism of transfusion to infant from the placental is i ncompletely understood. It is  believed to 
be related to pulsatility from the cord, but the importance of gravity in this process is unexplored. It is 
there fore unclear if positioning the infant above the placenta  on the maternal abdomen would have any 
influence  on the effectiveness  of the transfer of blood. 
 
Study Design: 
 
This stu dy will compare the difference  in neonatal h ematocrit with delayed cord clampi ng above vs. 
below the perineum, in infants who are born via term spontaneous vaginal deliveries.  Delayed cord 
clamping below the peri neum is an accepted clinical practice  in obstetrics and  gynecology; however, 
delayed cord clamping above the peri neum has not yet been studied. Delayed cord clampi ng above the 
perineum  will provide the benefit  of immediate skin-to-skin contact between the  mother  and her 
newborn. We believe that there will be no clinically significant differen ce in neonatal h ematocrit at 24 
hours of life. 
 
We anticipate that we will need thirty two patients  in each g roup for a total of sixty four study 
partici pants. Maternal Hgb/Hct prior to delivery will be documented. In addition, maternal 
demographics (such  as age,  race, socioeconomic status) and prenatal care  information (such as IRB

weight change in pregnancy and use of prenatal  vitamins and/or other supplementation) will be 
recorded. Inclusion criteria will include females with pregnancies with 32 0/7-36 6/7 gestation., with 
single intra uterine pregnancies.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  02/29/2016   Exclusion criteria  will include patients  whose infants required i mmediate resusci tation. Patien ts will be 
consented either in cli nic or when they present to the labor and  delivery ward and the decision has been 
made to proceed with s pontane ous vaginal delivery. Patien ts will then be  randomized into one of two 
groups: Delayed cord clamping above the perineum  (Group A) vs Delayed cord clampi ng below the 
perineum  (Group B). Due to the nature of the study, blinding of the patients  and medical staff present at 
the time delivery will not be possible, however the delivering physician  will not be the same one to 
collect the blood sample, and maternal kn owled ge of study group will not change the hematocrit value. 
In those patients  randomized to G roup A, af ter delivery, the infant will be placed on the mother’s 
abdomen and  the cord will be clamped 30-45 seconds after  delivery of the infant. In those randomized 
to the B  group, the infant will be held below the perineum, and the cord clamped and  cut 60-75 seconds 
after  delivery of the infant. To ensure accu rate timing of cord-clamping, a designated time-keeper will 
be designated whose sole responsibility will be to document time of del ivery and cord clamping. This  
time-keeper will  announce when 15 seconds are  left to cord-clamping and will also begin a count-down 
at 5 seconds. 
 
Neonatal b lood will be  obtained at  the time of routine newborn screening, approximately 24-hours af ter 
delivery, to check  the hematocrit. This should not pose any significant risk to the infant, as the blood 
collection will not require any additional sticks and  the additional volume required to check  the 
hematocrit is 250 microliters. 
 
The difference in hematocrit of the two groups will be  compared. If there  is no significant differen ce in 
the n eonatal h ematocrit, this study can be extended to those infants born via pret erm spontaneous 
vaginal delivery to encourage skin-to-skin contact between mom and baby while waiting to clamp the 
cord. This  contact could be beneficial to both mom and baby, as premature i nfants are often h anded off 
to the awaiting  NICU team for resusc itation or other  necessary assessments and/or interventions; and 
the opportunity for that initial c ontact is missed.

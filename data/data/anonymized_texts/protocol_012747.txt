 2. BACKGROUND  
 2.1   Study Disease  
 
Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome  
MF is a mature T cell lymphoma that arise s primarily from the skin. It is the major subtype of cutaneous T 
cell lymphoma (CTCL). Patients usually present initially with patch, plaque, tumor or erythrodermic 
involvement of their skin. MF has a long natural history (2). Many patients have non- specif ic skin 
manifestation s for several years before a diagnosis is made. Although the initial lesions are usually limited 
skin patches or plaque, generalized plaques involving large body surface area and tumor lesions are common by the time patients seek medical attention. Extra- cutaneous dissemination may occur to lymph 
nodes, liver, spleen, lungs and blood (Sezary cells). SS is a leukemic form of MF in which patients have 
significant blood involvement with Sezary cells and diffuse erythroderma (3).  
 After the  diagnosis is established, appropriate staging is important. Initial staging should include 
comprehensive skin examination, peripheral blood evaluation for Sezary cells, and appropriate imaging 
such as CT scan. The International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the Cutaneous 
Lymphoma Task Force of the EORTC has recently published a revised TNM staging for MF/SS (4). 
Several large studies have shown that overall clinical stage determines long- term outcome. Patients with 
limited stage IA disease have a very favorable outcome with life expectancy comparable to matched 
control population. Patients with IB/IIA disease have a median survival of 11- 12 years after diagnosis , 
with fewer than 20% experiencing progression to higher stage. However, stage IIB/III disease carried a worse outcome with median survival of 4-5 years and higher chance to have large cell transformation. Patients with stage IV disease have the worst, <2 year median survival (Figure 1) (2).

Therapy for Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome  

Page 9 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 Choosing appropriate treatment for individual patients is not easy. The most important consideration is 
the T (tumor) classification and overall clinical stage, with specific concerns for large cell transformation, 
acuity or severity of associated symptoms, and potential treatment related toxicities (5). In general, step-wise approach with first skin- directed therapy,  then mild biological systemic therapy, and then systemic 
chemotherapy is the current strategy. Skin- directed therapies should be the first step to control skin 
lesions, which include topical steroids, topical nitrogen mustard, topical retinoids and photot herapy. 
Narrow -band UVB and Psoralen plus UVA are highly effective for thicker plaques. Total skin electron 
beam therapy, considered the most intensive skin- directed therapy, is reserved for patients with extensive 
generalized disease and severe skin symptoms (6). While clinical response is greater with more intensive skin-directed therapies, no improved progression free or overall survival has been shown.  
 For patients with refractory disease to skin- directed therapies or with advanced stage of MF (IIB -IV) and 
Sezary syndrome, systemic treatments should be included in the primary therapy strategy, with or without  
skin-directed treatments. The first category of systemic therapy is mild immunomodulating agents 
(biologics), such as systemic retinoids (bexarotene) (7), interferons (8,9), low dose methotrexate and 
newer reagents, histone deacetylase inhibitors (10), and denileukin diftitox (11). While these treatments 
have a slow time to response and generally provide partial response rates no greater than 50%, t heir lack 
of cumulative toxicity allows them to be used as maintenance treatment for long periods. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been used as monotherapy or in combination with other systemic therapy and 
has been shown to be a very effective treatment, especially for disease control of SS (12). The next category of systemic therapy is more traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common reagents are 
liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, chlorambucil and high dose methotrexate. Pegylated liposomal  
doxorubicin is effective as a single agent. In a prospective study, every 4 week infusions gave an overall 
response rate of 84% with 42% of the patients achieving complete response (13). However, these responses are usually short -lived and patients move from one agent to another agent, then proceed to 
combination chemotherapies, and eventually progress after multiple therapies.  
 Treatment with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
Emerging data on allogeneic HSCT, particularly using non- myeloablative conditioning, suggest the 
existence of a graft -versus -T cell lymphoma effect. Allogeneic transplant should be considered in patients 
with advanced disease who fail to respond to all primary therapies or do not have durable response with 
salvage treatments.  
 Recently, we have performed a meta- analysis of studies treating MF/SS patients with HSCT in an attempt 
to understand its utility. In this analysis, 15 published reports with a total of 38 cases and 5 unpublished 
cases were included (14 -28). Twenty three cases had high dose therapy followed by autologous HSCT 
and twenty cases had allogeneic transplant. The median age was relatively young of 42 years with an 
equal male/female distribution. All but one case had advanced stage ( >IIB) disease at time of transplant. 
The median follow -up was 21 and 29 months for autologous and allogeneic transplant group, 
respectively. For autologous group, 12 cases received total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy and 11 cases had only high dose chemotherapy. For allogeneic group, half of them received myeloablative 
preparative regimen with TBI plus chemotherapy; and the other half had non- myeloablative preparative 
regimen. As a whole group, the allogeneic transplant had a significantly longer e vent-free survival (EFS) 
than the autologous HSCT (Figure 2). In the autologous transplant group, 19 of 23 cases progressed/relapsed after transplant with median time to progression of 3 months. In contrast, only 5 of 
20 cases progressed/relapsed with median time to progression not reached in allogeneic group.  
 
The overall survival (OS) was also longer in allogeneic group than in autologous group (Figure 3). The 
estimated OS was 85% vs 65% at 1 year, 79% vs 56% at 2 year and 79% vs 36% at 5 year for the two groups. One hundred day post transplant mortality was 5% and 13% in allogeneic and autologous groups 
respectively. One year mortality was 15% and 35% for the two groups. While progressive disease caused 11 deaths in autologous group, none of the death in allogeneic cases was due to disease progression. 
The most  interesting finding was that there was no difference in clinical outcome between the cases 
receiving myeloablative regimen and the cases having non- myeloablative approach in the allogeneic 
group.

(p = 0.028).  
 
Although this is a very small sample size with many limitations, this meta- analysis suggests several 
important points related to the use of HSCT to manage MF/SS: 
1) High dose therapy with either TBI or chemotherapy has not provided significant clinical benefit given the extremely short time to progression (3 months) in autologous transplant experience.  

Page 11 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 2) A significant fraction of cases remained in progression free status after allogeneic transplant, 
suggesting a n effective graft -versus -MF/SS effect.  
3) Non-myeloablative approach for allogeneic transplant is a reasonable option, especially  given 
that the median age at diagnosi s is 55 -60 years and compromised skin is frequently present in 
these patients, which increases the risk of infection. Therefore, we propose a clinical study with 
allogeneic HSCT using a unique non -myeloablative preparative regimen, TLI/ATG, to treat 
advanced MF/SS.  
 2.2  Investigational Agent/Device/Procedure 
 Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)/antithymocyte globulin (ATG) preparative regimen  
One of the concerns using allogeneic HSCT is the toxicity related to transplantation process. While graft -
versus -lymphoma is highly desired for a long-term disease control, the mortality and morbidity from 
preparativ e regimen, infections and graft versus host disease (GVHD) makes allogeneic transplant 
difficult to apply to patients with indolent lymphoma. To overcome this, preparative regimens of non-myeloablative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both to decrease early toxicity have been used (29- 32). 
However, acute GVHD remains a major problem after non-myeloablative transplantation and is 
responsible for approximately 50 percent of the deaths that are not due to a relapse of the neoplasm (31 -
33). 
 A new approach to the prevention of acute GVHD takes advantage of the immune system's regulatory T 
cells. Two types of regulatory T (Treg) cell s in mice, natural killer T cells and CD4+CD25+ T cells, can 
prevent acute GVHD (34 -37). These Treg cells inhibit the proliferation of and cytokine secretion by CD4+ 
and CD8+ donor T cells that injure the intestines, liver, and skin in acute GVHD (34,37). Nevertheless, the 
direct tumor -killing activity mediated by donor CD8+ T cells remains unaffected (35). Thus, Treg cells can 
separate GVHD from the antitumor activity of the graft. Regulatory natural killer T cells of either donor o r 
host origin have the unique capacity to prevent acute GVHD by secreting interleukin- 4 (36 -38). In a mice 
model s, after repeated treatment with low -dose irradiation targeted to the spleen, thymus, and lymph 
nodes (total lymphoid irradiation, TLI),  the proportion of these cells progressively increases until ultimately 
they constitute the majority of T cells in the spleen and bone marrow (37,  38). In preclinical studies, 
murine recipients of allogeneic bone marrow that underwent conditioning with anti –T-cell antibodies and 
TLI were fully protected from GVHD, whereas mice that underwent conditioning with anti –T-cell 
antibodies and a single dose of total -body irradiation were not protected (37,  38). Studies of the pattern of 
cytokine secretion by donor T cells in protected hosts showed a polarization toward a pattern of type 2 
helper T (Th2) cells, with increased secretion of interleukin-4 (38). The Th2 cells assist B cells to produce 
antibodies and reduce the inflammation promoted by type 1 helper T cells.  
 
To apply this novel non -myeloablative regimen of TLI and ATG for allogeneic HSCT, a clinical trial has 
been conducted in patients with hematological malignancies other than myelodysplasia or 
myeloproliferative disorders since December 2001. Analysis of the first 37 patients (last patient enrolled in 
2004), 19 of whom had NHL, appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine (39). The regimen 
consisted of 800 cGy in 10 fractions over 11 days with ATG administered at 1.5 mg/kg/d from day -11 to -
7. The median age was 56 (28 -65) years and 35% had failed prior autologous HSCT. Multi -lineage 
chimerism was achieved within 56 days and sustained in 31 of 37 patients. Of the 6 who lost their grafts, 
4 were in the setting of progressive disease. Minimal neutropenia was observed and more than half of patients did not require hospitalization. Remarkably and in agreement with the preclinical studies, 35 of 
37 patients developed no acute GVHD. Among the 18 patients in partial remission at transplant, 10 
achieved complete remission, strongly suggestive of retained graft versus tumor effect. Among the 17 patients in complete remission at transplant, 11 continued to be disease -free at 1.5 years. Transplant -
related mortality in this study was just 5% at 180 days. To date, 4 deaths due to disease progression and 4 deaths related to the procedure have been recorded. Overall, these results indicate that preparation 
with TLI/ATG and allogeneic HSCT is well tolerated, associated with prompt multi -lineage engraftment 
and a markedly low incidence of acute GVHD, with a strong suggestion of retained graft versus tumor 
effect. 
 
Update on experience in B cell lymphoma patients 
Since the initial report, we continue to accumulate the experience using this novel non- myeloablative 
preparative regimen. To date, we have performed allogeneic HSCT using TLI/ATG preparative regimen in 111 patients. Sixty four of the patients had malignant lymphoma. The m ajority  of the patients  (83%) 
achieved full donor chimerism (> 95% donor cells) and the transplant was  well tolerated.  
 
Page 12 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 The one -year non- relapse mortality was 2% for patients receiving HLA -matched sibling donor graft and 
8% for patients having HLA -matched unrelated donor graft. Acute GVHD only occurred in 4% of the 
patients, while the incidence of chronic GVHD is estimated to be around 35 -45% at 2 year s. For patients 
with lymphoma, the disease control was significantly better in patients who responded to salvage 
chemotherapy prior to transplantation than those who had refractory disease (Figure 4). One possibility is 
that graft -versus -lymphoma effect is a slow process after non- myeloablative allogeneic transplant and is 
unable to control high tumor burden or fast growing tumor in time. Therefore, we propose in this project to use non-myeloablative al logeneic HSCT in MF/SS patients after they achieve some degree of disease 
control with salvage therapy. One important observation was that patients who failed to achieve full donor 
chimerism had significant chance to relapse after transplant.

disease status at transplant (N=64).  
 
 2.3  Rationale  
 
Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and its leukemic variant, Sezary Syndrome (SS) is the most common type of cutan eous non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in North America. Though most of the patients have an 
indolent course with median survival of 12- 15 years, those with advanced diseases have a survival of 1-3 
years after diagnosis, and there is no curative therapy (1). While localized skin treatment, novel biological therapies such as histone deacetylase inhibitor s, or systemic chemotherapy can temperately control the 
diseases, none of these provide a long -term remission. Graft -versus -lymphoma effects after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been demonstrated to provide a long- term disease 
control in B cell lymphoma, including low -grade B cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We 
propose a clinical trial using non- myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat patients with advanced stage 
MF/SS. The rationale is that graft -versus -lymphoma provided by this non- myeloablative approach will 
result in a clinical response and a prolonged progression free survival in these patients. The patient populati on enrolled in this clinical trial will be those with MF/SS who still have persistent or progressive 
disease after being treated with multiple lines of local and systemic therapies. When MF/SS reached this stage of their disease, the conventional chemotherapies will no longer provide any clinical benefit. 
Therefore, we proposed using this low toxicity allogeneic HSCT protocol to these patients.  
 
2.4  Correlative Studies Background  
 
2.4.1  Donor Cell Chimerism: The standard definition for full engraftment is that the percentage of 
donor cells in CD3 population rises above 95%. While most of our patients (83%) having undergone 
TLI/ATG preparative regimen reached full donor chimerism, the timing to achieving full chimerism varied 
significantly. It is of great interest to determine whether the full donor chimerism correlate s to clinical 
response. In addition, donor chimerism of different cell populations may also have a significant impact on 

Page 13 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 clinical outcome. We will attempt to correlate the kinetics of donor chimerism of different cell populations 
to tumor response, disease progression, and GVHD. One prediction is that rising donor CD3/CD4/CD8 
cells correlate to tumor response.  
 
2.4.2 Profile of  Grafting Immune Cells: To assess the T cells immune profile, intracellular cytokines 
with monoclonal antibodies against IL- 2, IFN -g (Th1 pattern), IL -4 and IL- 10 (Th2 pattern) will be 
assayed. In mouse model s, TLI/ATG polarized T cells to a Th2 pattern, which has been thought to be 
critical for graft- versus -tumor effect. Therefore, it is of great interest to see whether this Th2 polarization 
can be recapitulated in humans and whether Th2 polarization may affect tumor response. In the case of MF/SS, it is m ore complicated as most of the tumor T cells express Th2 phenotype (44). Whether this 
will facilitate or hamper the graft -versus -tumor effect by the donor T cells is unknown.  
 
 
2.4.3 Donor T Cell Trafficking: Engrafted donor T cells have to be in close contact with the tumor cells 
to help antigen- presenting cells (APC) to cross -prime cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Recently, chemokine 
receptors, CCR4, CCR10 and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) have been shown to play a critical role in mediating CD4 T cell trafficking to skin in both mice and humans (45 -49). We will first test whether 
the peripheral blood T cells express these skin homing receptors by using multi -color flow cytometry. In 
addition, CCR7 has been shown to mediate the homing of T or B lymphocytes to lymph nodes (50), which is an essential step after T cells being primed in the tumor sites. In addition, examining the skin 
tumor site after transplant will be extremely informative to determine whether donor T cells reach the 
tumor sites.  
 
2.4.4 Regulatory  T cell (Treg): Treg cells have been implicated in many important aspects of 
allogeneic transplant, such as modulating graft -versus -tumor effect and damping GVHD. Recent studies 
have also pointed a role for Treg in the progression of MF/SS and in immunomodulation in the skin 
(52,53). Therefore, monitoring the number and function of Treg will be performed. We will monitor the 
number of Treg in blood and their function using a mixed -lymphocyte -reaction (MLR) inhibition assay 
(39). 
 We will s pecifically monito r the number and function of Treg cells in patients who undergo ECP or 
TSEBT. The status of Treg cells in these patients becomes even more interesting because these 
treatments have been proposed to mediate their therapeutic effects via modulating Treg (54) .

BMT 206  January 7, 2019 the patient will be obtained using a form approved by the Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in 
Medical Research of the Stanford Universit y Medical Center.  
 
 
3.7       Randomization Procedures  
 
No randomization process will be performed in this study.  
 
  4. TREATMENT PLAN  
 4.1  Investigational Agent or Device Administration  
 
4.1.1  Pre-transplant Evaluation 
 
a) Prior to initiating therapy, patients will have a complete history and physical examination performed.  In addition, a bone marrow specimen and bone marrow aspirate will be obtained for the evaluation.  
b) Patients will have the following laboratory tests performed: CBC with differential,  HLA typing, 
comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, hepatitis panel, HIV antibody, HIV p24 antigen, herpes simplex titer, herpes zoster titer, and CMV titer.  Additional evaluation will include a chest radiograph, 
EKG and pulmonary function testing with spirometry and diffusing capacity.  Other testing may be 
needed and will be determined based on the patients history and physical examination.  
c) HLA typing of the donor will be confirmed at Stanford before beginning treatment.  
 
4.1.2  Allogeneic Transplant: Prepa rative Regimen  
 
d) Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI) Administration: TLI is administered ten times in 80c- 120c Gy 
fractions on day –11 through day –7 and day –4 through day –1 according to the above delineated 
schedule. TLI is administered from a 6 MeV linear  accelerator (photon beam). The radiation field (four 
fields —two anterior and two posterior) will include all major lymphoid organs including the thymus, 
spleen and lymph nodes. A radiation oncologist will evaluate patients prior to conditioning to determi ne blocks and radiation ports. TLI will generally be administered between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
Since TLI can cause nausea, premedication with antiemetic therapy is needed. TLI schedule may be 
adjusted based on schedule of radiation therapy department.  
e) Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG) Administration: ATG will be administered five times intravenously at 
1.5 mg/kg/day from day –11 through day –7 for a total dose of 7.5 mg/kg. ATG doses will be based 
on the adjusted ideal body weight. Premedication for ATG will include benadryl 25- 50 mg, Tylenol 
650 mg and solumedrol 1.0 mg/kg.  
f) Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) Administration: TSEBT will be given to patients who have 
extensive skin involvement such as wide spread plaques, tumors, or erythroderma with si gnificant 
tumor infiltration, as part of cytoreduction prior to transplant. The length of therapy and dose of 
TSEBT will be determined by the radiation oncologist and individualized based on the patient’s 
presentation and treatment history.  In patients receiving TSEBT, TLI will begin during the last two 
week of TSEBT.  
g) Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP ) Administration:   Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a 
leukapheresis -based immunomodulatory therapy that has been approved by the US Food and Drug 
Adminis tration f or the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) since 1988. ECP will be 
performed using the UVAR XTS Photopheresis System developed by Therakos, Inc (Exton, Pa). Blood (225 mL) will be passed through 3 cycles of leukapheresis, or 125 mL of blood will be passed 
through 6 cycles, depending on the patient's hematocrit value and body size. At the end of each leukapheresis cycle, the red blood cells and plasma are returned to the patient. The collected WBCs 
will be mixed with heparin, saline, and 8- methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP), which intercalates into the DNA 
of the lymphocytes upon exposure to UVA light and makes them more susceptible to apoptosis when 
exposed to UVA radiation. The treated WBC mixture is returned to the patient.  
 
4.1.3  Donor PBPC  
 
h) Donors will receive G -CSF injections daily from day -5 to day 0.  G -CSF will be administered 
Page 16 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 subcutaneously at a dose of 16 µg/kg/day.  Collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC’s) 
will be performed by apheresis.  Collections generally  occur on day –1 and day 0  if needed. CD34+ 
proportion will be evaluated by flow cytometry. Patients will receive all cells collect ed.  The ideal cell 
doses (based on recipient body weight) for MRD and MUD transplants are > 5x106 CD34+ cells/kg. 
Cells collected on days –1 and 0 will be processed for infusion on day 0. Fresh cells (not frozen) are 
to be infused whenever possible. Patients will receive premedication approximately 1 hour prior to 
infusion using current standard of care or as recommended: 
i) Acetami nophen:  650 mg p.o., Diphenhydramine:  50 mg i.v. , Hydrocortisone:  100 mg i.v. ,1 hour 
prior to infusion.  
j) For MRD transplants, if the target cell dose is not achieved then a third apheresis procedure may be performed on day  +1 and the cells infused on the same day. If after a third apheresis procedure the 
CD34 dose is <3x10
6/kg and the total CD3 cell dose does not exceed 5x108/CD3+ cells per kg , then a 
fourth apheresis procedure may be performed on day +2 and the cells infused on the same day. Total 
CD3+ cell dose should not exceed 7x108 CD3+ cells/kg. Grafts that contain >7x108 CD3+ cells/kg must 
first be evaluated by the Principal Investigator before infusion.   Administration and premedication prior 
to cell infusion will be identical to those specified for day 0.  
k) Collection of cells for the MUD transplants will be coordinated through the National Marrow Donor Program and subject to the rules of that Program, thus MUD collections will be limited to days –1 and 
0 only. If mobilized PBPC is not available through certain NMDP collection centers then bone marrow will be considered.  
l) ABO incompatibility : ABO incompatibility between donor and host will require red cell depletion only if 
bone marrow is used as the hematopoietic source. Red cell depletion is performed by Hetastarch 
sedimentation according to standard procedure.  
m) Post-Transplant Growth Factors: Patients should not receive post -transplant growth factors while 
receiving MMF , particularly during the first month off MMF taper. Growth factors should not be given 
unless severe neutropenia develops or persists past day 27 post -transplant (ANC < 100/ml for > five 
days).  
 
4.1.4  Immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis  
 
n) Immunosuppression will include tacrolimus (Prograf ) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) ) .  Tacrolimus  
will be administered orally at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day bid from day -3 through day +56.  MMF will 
begin at 15 mg/kg p.o. bid for MRD and Q 8 hours for MUD from the evening of day 0 to day  +27 for 
MRD or day + 40 with a taper for MUD.  Prograf dose adjustments will be made as clinically indicated.  
Trough levels will be monitored to keep the Tacrolimus  level in the range of 8-10 ng/ml.  MMF dose 
adjustments will be made if there is evidence of MMF -related GI toxicity or myelosuppression.  
o) Tacrolimus (Prograf): Tacrolimus is given at 0.03 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d (9 am and 9 pm) from day –3 until 
after the day +56 chimerism studies have been obtained. Doses should be adjusted to maintain a high therape utic Tacrolimus  level to between 8-10 ng/ml ng/ml, unless there is renal insufficiency 
(creatinine >2.0) or hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin >2.0) in which case the Tacrolimus  should be 
reduced to normalize these parameters. If there is nausea and vomiting at any time during FK506 
treatment, Tacrolimus  should be administered intravenously by continuous infusion at 3 mg/kg over 
20 hours, and adjusted for the Tacrolimus  blood level. Tacrolimus  will be tapered per standard 
guideline of Stanford BMT program after the day +56 chimerism studies are obtained. If patient does 
not tolerate Tacrolimus , tacrolimus may be used and administered per standard guideline of Stanford 
BMT program.  
p) Mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) : Administration of MMF will begin at 15 mg/kg po on day 0, at 5- 10 
hours after mobilized PBPC infusion is complete. Thereafter, beginning on day +1 MMF is taken at 15 mg/kg po b.i.d. (30 mg/kg/day) if transplantation was using a matched related donor , and 15 mg/kg po 
Q8 hours if from a matched unrelated donor or a one antigen mismatched donor.  Doses will be 
rounded up to the nearest 250 mg (capsules are 250 mg). MMF will be stopped on day +28 for 
matched related donors and for one antigen mismatched or unrelated donors beginning day +40. MMF will be tapered by 10% weekly till off, typically by day +96.  If there is nausea and vomiting at 
any time preventing the oral administration of MMF, MMF should be administered intravenously.  
q) Guidelines for MMF dose adjustment: If in the clinical judgment of the investigator, there is 
documented toxicity related to MMF administration, a dose adjustment will occur.  Based on previous solid organ transplantation studies, dose adjustments are likely to occur because of hematopoietic or 
gastrointestinal adverse effects.  Dose adjustments will not be made for hematopoietic toxicities 
unless severe neutropenia develops or persists until day +21 post -transplantation (ANC <100/ml for 
>5 days).  In the event of gastrointestinal toxicity that requires medical intervention including 
Page 17 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 medication for control of persistent vomiting or diarrhea that is considered to be due to MMF, a 20% 
dose reduction or the drug will be given i.v.  For severe gastrointestinal toxicity related to MMF 
(severe refractory diarrhea or overt gastrointestinal bleeding), MMF may be temporarily stopped.  
 
4.1.5  Infection Prophylaxis  
 
r) It is expected that patients on this protocol will be susceptible to opportunistic infections in the post -
transplant period for at least 6 months.  These expectations are based upon prior experiences with patients that have undergone treatment with TLI and/or ATG, as well as other non- myeloablative 
allogeneic transplantation procedures.  Infectious disease prophylaxis will be according to the current standards of care of Stanford BMT program.  
 
4.1.6  Engraftment and Disease Status Monitoring  
 
s) Patients will be followed in the ITA for signs of infection or GVHD.  Monitoring for engraftment and infection will be according to current standard of care of Stanford BMT program . 
t) Chimerism:  Microsatellite ana lysis (VNTR) of CD3, CD19, CD15, and CD56 peripheral blood cell 
subsets will be performed on days +28 (+ 5 days) , +56  (+ 5 days) , +90 ( + 14 days), +180 (+ 14 days) , 
+270  (+ 14 days) , and yearly  (+ 4 weeks)  to evaluate the degree of donor hematopoietic cell 
engraftment (donor chimerism), and on bone marrow on day +90 (+ 14 days) , and yearly  per 
physician’s discretion.  
u) Clinical response will be determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months or until relapse or progression after 
transplant. The disease status and clinical response will be scored on a rigorous and multifactorial approach described before (41, appendix). This approach takes tumor burden in skin, lymph nodes 
and blood into consideration. To achieve this, patients will be evaluated at Cutaneous Lymphoma 
Clinic before transplant and at specified time points after transplant.  
 
4.1.7  Therapeutic Interventions for Disease Progression  
 
v) Early discontinuation of immunosupression (< day +120) should be considered the first therapeutic 
maneuver. However, neither MMF nor Tacrolimus  should be stopped prior to reviewing chimerism 
results. If the donor T cell chimerism in blood is > 50% and there is < grade II GVHD, MMF is to be 
stopped if still being taken, and Tacrolimus  tapered over two weeks. Bone marrow aspirate and blood 
chimeris m studies will be performed two weeks after discontinuation of immunosuppression.  
w) For Sezary Syndrome patients, lymphoma cells in the blood (Sezary cells) will be monitored by flow cytometry on days +28, and then 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months after transplant  as described for clinical 
response determination. Patients with persistent Sezary cells on day +28 will have the option to start extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) on day +30 + 5. The recommendation is to administrate four 
weekly treatments  at the discret ion of the investigator, followed by additional four monthly treatments, 
and to be re -evaulated.  
 
4.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
4.2.1  Supportive care measures will be consistent with standard practice of the Stanford BMT Program.  Standard care measures are included by not limited to measures for skin care, mucositis, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, pain control, infection prevention and patient and family education.  
4.2.2  Transfusion support for red blood cells and platelets will be consistent with standard practice of the Stanford BMT Program.

 5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION  
 5.1  Investigational Agent/Device/Procedure    
5.1.1 Non- myeloablative allogeneic transplant using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and anti -
thymocyte globulin (ATG):  
 As discussed earlier, using a non- myeloablative preparation regimen for allogeneic transplant preserves 
the benefit of graft versus tumor effect but decreases the toxicity. However, one major complication found in our previous approach using TBI/fludarabine regimen is GVHD. Recently, Lowsky et al. (32) have extended the preclinical model of Strober and colleagues to the clinic using a novel conditioning strategy 
of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) prior to allogeneic HCT. In this recent 
report, the incidence of acute GVHD was just 5%, prompt multi -lineage engraftment was demonstrated, 
and promising efficacy was reported in hematologic malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma and DLBCL (32).  Since this report, we have performed allogeneic transplant with both related and unrelated 
donors using TLI/ATG in over 150 patients who have a variety of hematological malignancies including 
mantle cell lymphoma, transformed lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute 
myelobalstic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and myelofibrosis. The overall experience has re-
demonstrated the low incidence of acute GVHD and preserved graft versus tumor effect.  
 
5.2 Availability

6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
No dose modifications will be made.  
 7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
 
Tacrolimus  
 
• Human Toxicology: Nephrotoxicity is the most frequent side effect of tacrolimus .  Other frequently 
observed side effects include hypertension, hirsutism, tremors, paresthesias, hepatotoxicity, 
hypomagnesemia, and hyperkalemia.  Transient gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred, to include anorexia, nausea and ileus.  The drug has demonstrated a relative lack of myelotoxicity.  
 
• Pharmaceutical Data Formulation: Tacrolimus is available for oral and intravenous administration.  
The intravenous solution is available as 1 ml ampules containing 5 mg/ml.  Tacrolimus should be 
administered intravenously over 2 -6 hours. Longer infusion times are acceptable and sometimes 
better tolerated.  The contents of the ampules should be diluted 0.9% NaCl injection or 5% dextrose injection  
 
• Supplier:  This drug is commercially available.  
 
Mycophenolate Mofetil  
 
• Human Toxicology: The principal side effects include diarrhea, leukopenia, vomiting and infection.  
The drug is also associated with abdominal pain, nausea, hypertension and anemia.  
 
• Pharmaceutical Data: Mycophenolate Mofetil is available in 250 mg capsules and 500 mg tablets.  Mycopenolate Mofetil should be taken on an empty stomach.  
 
• Supplier:  Mycophenolate Mofetil is commercially available.  
 Granulocyte- Colony Stimulating Factor  
 
• Human Toxicology: The primary side effect of G -CSF is bone pain and is more common with higher 
doses of G -CSF.  
 
• Pharmaceutical Data: G -CSF is available in vials containing 300µg or 480µg at a concentration of 
300µg/ml.  G -CSF should be refrigerated.  G -CSF is given as a daily subcutaneous injection. 
 
• Supplier:  G -CSF is commercially available.  
 
Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG)  
 
• Thymoglobulin is a rabbit -thymocyte globulin. It is the purified, sterile, IgG fraction of immune serum 
of rabbits immunized with human thymus lymphocytes. ATG is a lymphocyte -selective 
immunosuppressant. It is believed to act by modifying the number and function of lymphocytes.  
 
• Administration: Thymoglobulin is diluted in 0.9% NaCl. Thymoglobulin is given intravenously as a 4 -
Page 20 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 6 hour infusion into a central vein.  
 
• Potential Toxicities: Thymoglobulin may cause:  
Cytopenia of any cell line  
Pyrogenic action (ATG causes chills and fever in a high proportion of patients treated)  
Fluid retention 
Allergic reactions (rash, pruritus, urticaria, wheal and flare reactions are reported, as well as 
bronchospasm and anaphylactic shock)  
A serum sickness -like syndrome may develop.  This is best prevented by steroid co- administration.  
EBV lymphoproliferative disorders have been associated with administration of anti -thymocyte 
globulin in highly immunosuppressed patients.  
 
• Because of the potential for anaphylaxis, resuscitation equipment should be available during administration.  After an anaphylactic reaction, infusion should not be resumed. A central line should 
be established and oxygen, as well as resuscitation equipment should be available.  
 
Total Lymphoid Irraditaion (TLI)  
 
• TLI may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, temporary hair loss and painful swelling of the salivary 
glands for a few days. The TLI in this protocol is approximately on e-fifth of that used in standard NHL 
treatments. Therefore, these side effects most likely will be milder and severe acute side effects are not expected. The risk of secondary malignancies after the low dose TLI is yet to be determined.  
 
Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSEBT)  
 Acute side effects can include a skin burn that is much like a moderate to severe sun burn (worse in patients who burn but do not tan when exposed to sun), deep tanning (in those who tan after sun 
exposure), itching and fatigue. Although these acute side effects are occasionally severe, they are self -
limited if appropriate supportive therapy is administered in a timely fashion.  
 Long -term side effects can include generalized dry skin and permanently decreased secretion of sweat 
and oil on much but not all of the skin, scattered dilated blood vessels (telangectasias), pigmentation 
changes, and partial or complete scalp hair loss which is more severe in males with signs of thinning hair 
than in females . 
 
Extra corporeal photopheresis (ECP)  
 ECP is a very well -tolerated procedure. Transient hypotension may occur in some patients during the 
collection phase of the treatment, but this is asymptomatic. Some patients may experience low -grade 
fevers a few hours after ECP.  
 
Some patients with CTCL may experience an increase in pruritus or redness during the course of ECP.  
 
In all of the various patient groups treated, no immunosuppression, opportunistic infections, or neoplasia 
has been associated with ECP. The risk of secondary malignancies after the low dose TLI is yet to be 
determined.  
 
Finally, although patients with hypertriglyceridemia do not experience further adverse events during ECP, 
they may have a less efficacious treatment because of the inability of the UVAR machine to separate the WBCs from the lipid -rich blood. Because of this, patients should have triglyceride levels of less than 300 
mg/dL and should eat a very low fat or non- fat diet starting the evening before the procedure.

BMT 206  January 7, 2019 10.  MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
The measurement of effect is determined by clinical response to non-myeloablative allogeneic 
HSCT. The clinical response will be assessed by a rigorous and multifactorial approach described 
before (41, appendix). This approach takes tumor burden in skin, lymph nodes and blood into consideration. To achieve this, patients will be evaluated at Cutaneous Lymphoma Clinic before 
transplant and at specified time points after transplant.  
 
10.1 Anti -tumor Effect  
 
10.1.1 Definitions  
Disease status will be evaluated right before non -myeloablative allogeneic transplants and  
at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months after allogeneic transplant or up to 1st recurrence or 
progression.  
 
10.1.2 Disease Parameters  
Measurable diseases include skin, lymph node, viscera and blood Sezary cells.  
 
10.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
Please refer to Appendix C . 
 
10.1.4 Response Criteria  
 10.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Please refer to appendix.  
 
10.1.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
N/A 
 10.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
Clinical response will be determined at different time points after allogeneic transplant.  
 10.1.5 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response is time measurement between first compete response and the first recurrent documentation.  
 10.1.6 Progression -Free Survival (or other parameters)  
Event -free survival (EFS) is the time measurement between the day of allogeneic 
transplant and the first documented recurrence or death from any cause.  Overall survival (OS) is the time measurement between the day of allogeneic transplant and death from any 
cause . 
 10.1.7 Response Review  
No external review of clinical response is planned.  
 10.2 Other Response Parameters  
N/A 
 11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 11.1 Monitoring plan 
Research  team will meet monthly to review the adverse events. Any severe adverse events will 
be reported to principal investigator immediately. The stopping rule is described below.  
 
Page 25 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 11.2 Stopping rules for the individual patie nt and for the study as a whole  
Individual patient:   
Patients who develop severe adverse reaction to the ATG infusion, such as serum sickness that 
result end -organ damage, will be removed from study . 
 
For the study as a whole: There is no interim analysis for efficacy (PFS), but the study may stop 
early for safety . The safety monitoring is by means of two rules, one for Grade II -IV acute GVHD 
and the other for 100 day mortality. The rules call for assessing observed counts after  every 5 
patients and stopping as follows:  
 For 100 day mortality  
 
after.pt            5    10    15    20    25    30    35    40 
stop.if.reach    2     3      3      4      5      5      6      7 
 
For Grade II -IV acute GVHD  
 
after.pt            5    10    15    20    25    30    35    40 
stop.if.reach    2     3      4      5      6      7      8      9 
 For example, if there are 3 deaths in the first 15 patients, the study will stop at 15 patients or earlier, or if there are 3 Grade II -IV acute GVHD cases in the first 10 patients, the study will stop 
at 10 or earlier, and so on. The usual 'look ahead' principle will apply: as soon as it is known that a stopping boundary will surely be reached (such as 3 deaths in the first 9 patients) the study will stop. These rules guarantee stopping if the lower 80% one- sided confidence limit for the true rate 
exceeds 10% for 100 day mortality or 15% for Grade II -IV acute GVHD.  
 
11.3 Data management  
All the clinical data from this study will be maintained by BMT data management team.  
 
11.4 Confidentiality  
 
All patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation at Stanford are assigned a SPN (Stanford 
Patient Number) and data is entered into a secure database.  Access to the database is limited to study 
personnel and password protected.  Research records are maintained in a secure office of the data 
management staff.    
 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The primary goal of this study is to provide proof -of-concept evidence for the safety and efficacy of non-
myeloablative allogeneic transplant with TLI/ATG conditioning for patients with MF/SS as described 
above. Safety will be measured at the end of study by rates of GVHD, other measures of side effects, and overall survival (see above  for safety monitoring methods). The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS at 180 
days. The historical control for safety is the acute GHVD and mortality rates of myeloablative allogeneic treatment. The rationale for this study is based on the expectation that the new non-myeloablative 
allogeneic  transplant will achieve response rates (and subsequent disease control) that is comparable to 
myeloablative allogeneic transplant, but with a great reduction in GVHD and TRM.  
 
12.1 Endpoints  
 
12.1.1  Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS at 180 days (defined above).  The safety endpoints 
include GVHD and other treatment related events, including mortality.  
 
12.1.2  Secondary endpoints  
We will report OS, EFS, cumulative incidence of cancer and treatment -related m ortality.  
Page 26 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019  
12.2 Analysis Populations  
We will report outcomes on all patients who begin the preparative protocol (corresponding to 
the intent -to-treat principle) as the primary analysis, and also on those who actually receive 
transplant and those who successfully engraft (subset analyses).  
 
12.3 Plan of Analysis  
 
12.3.1  Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Tabulate summary statistics with measures of variation.  
 
12.3.2  Evaluation of Efficacy  
Efficacy will be evaluated by calculating the Kaplan -Meier estimates of progression- free survival 
(PFS, i.e., probability of remaining alive and free of progression). We will also calculate the 
cumulative incidence estimate of the progression rate, using non- relapse mortality as a 
competing risk.  
 
12.3.3  Methods for handling missing data and non- adherence to protocol  
We do not expect to have missing data on key outcome variables, and non -adherence to 
protocol presumably is limited to failure to complete the entire process of preparation and 
transplant; this will be handled by subgroup analyses as described. 
 
12.3.4  Evaluation of Conduct of trial (including accrual rates, data quality)  
Accrual and progress of patients through the regimen will be monitored by the PI, and data 
quality will be monitored by the BMT data coordinators.  
 
12.3.5  Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics  
N/A 
 
12.3.6  Methods for Correlative Studies  
Analyses of the correlation of response and other outcomes with measures of chimerism and 
other markers will be done with standard methods, including fixed and time- varying Proportional  
Hazards models and graphical methods. Given the small sample size, we do not expect to have 
power to do more than explore such correlations.  
 
12.4 Sample Size  
 
12.4.1  Accrual estimates  
12-15 patients per year over 3 years for a maximum of 40 patients, subject to stopping rules 
above. 
 
12.4.2  Sample size justification  
The study sample size is based on expected accrual of 12-15 patients per year, up to a 
maximum of 40 patients over 3 years, with at least 1 year of follow- up in all patients. With 180 
day PFS measure and assuming a target rate of 75%, the 95% confidence interval half -width 
(the precision estimate) will be 15% (e.g., from 58% to 88% if we observe 27/36 PFS). If the 
PFS is substantially closer to 50%, the results will not be considered encouraging, while if the PFS is even better than 75% the half -width is never greater than 17%.  
 
12.4.3  
Criteria for future studies  
See above.  
12.5 Interim analyses  
The trial may also stop early for safety at any time, based on unexpected high rates of acute 
GVH D or mortali ty. Specifically, the stopping rule (every 5 patients) will  guarantee stopping if 
Page 27 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 the low er one-sided confidence limit for the rate exceeds 10% for 100 day mortality or 15% for 
acute GVHD.

AE and SAE Reporting Guidelines 
 
ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING AND REPORTING  
 
Definitions:  
 Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), a symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or 
procedure whether or not considered related to medicinal product or treatment. 
 Life Threatening Adverse Event 
Any adverse event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.   
 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (Investigator’s Brochure, product insert).  For studies that do not involve investigational products or devices, an unexpected adverse event is an adverse event that is not described in the transplant medical literature or consent form. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life threatening adverse event, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly, requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  Unless the Principal 
Investigator is using an investigational agent, s/he is not bound by the definition in Title 22 CFR 
312.32.  The PI is bound by Title 45 CFR 46, Subpart A which is the “Common Rule” for the Protection of Human Subjects, therefore, the Stanford IRB definition applies (report “unanticipated problems” involving risks to study participants or others).  
 Distinction between Serious and Severe 
The term severe is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, for example mild, moderate or severe.  The event itself however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, for example a severe headache.  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the patient/event outcome and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to the patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
obligations.  
 
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an aggressive therapy for the treatment of a number 
of life threatening malignant and non-malignant disorders.  Individuals presenting for HCT generally have exhausted other avenues of therapy that will result in any lasting benefit.  The treatment related mortality (TRM) of autologous transplantation is approximately 5%.  The TRM 
of a sibling myeloablative allogeneic transplant is approximately 20% and the TRM for an unrelated myeloablative allogeneic transplant ranges from 20-50%.  In the setting of a non-myeloabative allogeneic transplant from a sibling donor the TRM is approximately 10% and ranges from 20-50% for unrelated donors.   
 
As an aggressive therapy HCT is associated with a large number of AEs and SAEs.  The toxicities associated with HCT are related to the following: 1) the underlying disease, 2) therapy 
antecedent to HCT, 3) the health status of the transplant recipient including co-exiting 
Page 35 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019 conditions, 4) the high dose preparative regimen employed in preparation for transplant, 5) 
therapies directed at reducing transplant related complications (e.g. immunosuppressants for 
the prevention of GVHD), and 6) the treatment of complications of HCT.  
 The use of toxicity grading scales such as the NCI CTC is a standard in the medical com munity 
for the reporting of AEs and SAEs in the investigation of new drugs or devices.  The use of this type of scale is less helpful in the evaluation of AEs and SAEs associated with a treatment, such as HCT.  In an effort to report to regulatory agencies  the toxicities that are relevant and 
meaningful for the evaluation of risks and benefits to potential HCT recipients the following guidelines will serve to determine what is reported as AEs and SAEs. 
  
The following SAEs require reporting to the CCTO.  If the event is unexpected, it will also 
require reporting to the IRB:  
 1) Deaths  All deaths  
• while the patient is receiving treatment on a protocol  
• up to 60 days (autologous) or 90 days (allogeneic) after last dose of protocol treatment 
• or any death that occurs more than 60 days (autologous) or 90 days (allogeneic) after protocol treatment has ended that is felt to be treatment related. 
 This includes deaths from the common and expected grade 4 toxicities noted below.  Deaths that occur outside of Stanford will be reported whenever possible.  It must be noted that 
obtaining detailed information on the cause and circumstances of a death occurring at another institution can be difficult.  This excludes deaths related to relapse of underlying disease, which will be reported at the time of protocol renewal.   
 2) All serious and unexpected toxicities.   
Defined as those toxicities not identified in the transplant literature, product inserts or in the 
consent form.  
 
The following will generally not be reported as AEs or SAEs:  
 1) Hospitalizations   
Approximately 70% of autologous transplants are readmitted to the hospital for management of HCT related events.  The most common indication for readmission of an autologous transplant recipient is neutropenic fever. Approximately 50% of allogeneic transplant recipients will be readmitted to the hospital.  The most common indications for readmission of an allogeneic HCT recipient are fever, failure to maintain nutritional status and graft versus host disease.  
 2) Relapse of disease  
Relapse unfortunately remains a significant problem following both autologous and allogeneic transplantation.  The risk of relapse is influenced by both patient and disease variables.  In general, the risk of relapse following autologous transplant is approximately 50%.  The risk of relapse following allogeneic transplant is extremely dependent on the disease being treated but 
ranges from 10% (for patients with severe aplastic anemia) to 80% (for patients with refractory 
acute leukemia).  3) Common and expected grade 4 toxicities of HCT that are well described in the transplant literature, the product inserts or stated in the consent form and do not result in death.   
This includes but is not limited to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, thrombotic 
microangiopathy, bleeding requiring transfusions, edema, hypertension, hypotension, gastritis, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, central venous catheter infections, febrile 
Page 36 of 42

tremor, pain, hypoxia, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, incontinence, infertility, laboratory 
abnormalities, veno-occlusive disease, graft failure, cardiac arrhythmias and graft versus host 
disease.  
 4) Secondary Mal igancies. 
The occurrence of secondary malignancies and associated mortality is a known risk of cancer therapies.  The occurrence of secondary malignancies will be reported at the time of the 
protocol annual review.

Response criteria for Mycosis fungoides and Sezary S yndrome 
 
Clinical Endpoints and Response Criteria in Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Syndrome:  a Joint Consensus Statement of the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL), the United States Consortium for Cutaneous Lymphomas (USCCL) and the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)  
 
The global response criteria uses scoring  system for the following four organ involvement systems: skin, 
lymph node, blood and viscera.  Based on the response score of individual systems, a global response 
score will be given for individual patient. The skin disease burden will be measured using the modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT); the skin responses are recorded and assessed as changes of the mSWAT score.   
 
Response in Skin*  
Complete response (CR)  100% clearance of skin lesions#   
Partial response (PR)  50-99% clearance of skin disease from baseline without new tumors (T 3) in 
patients with T 1, T2 or T 4 only skin disease  
Stable disease (SD)  <25% increase to <50% clearance in skin disease from baseline without new 
tumors (T 3) in patients with T 1, T2 or T 4 only sk in disease  
Progressive disease (PD)♦ (1) >25% increase in skin disease from baseline or 
(2) New tumors (T 3) in patients with T 1, T2 or T 4 only skin disease or  
(3) Loss of response: in those with CR or PR, increase of skin score of greater than the sum of nadir plus 50% baseline score  
Relapse  Any disease recurrence in those with CR  
*Based on mSWAT score.  
# A biopsy of normal appearing skin is unnecessary to assign a CR.  However, a skin biopsy should be 
performed of a representative area of the skin if there is any question of residual disease where otherwise a CR would exist.  If histologic features are suspicious or suggestive of MF/SS (see histologic criteria for early MF
7), the response should be considered a PR only.  
♦ Whichever criterion occurs first.  
 
Response in Lymph Nodes*  
CR All lymph nodes are now <1.5 cm in greatest transverse (long axis) diameter by method used to assess 
lymph nodes at baseline or biopsy negative for lymphoma.  In addition, lymph nodes that were N 3 
classification and <1.5 cm in long axis diameter at baseline, must now be < 1 cm in diameter of the 
short axis or biopsy negati ve for lymphoma .  
PR (1) Cumulative reduction >50% of the SPD sum of the maximum linear dimension (major axis) x 
longest perpendicular dimension (minor axis) of each abnormal lymph node at baseline and no new lymph node > 1.5 cm or >1.0 cm in the short axis if long axis 1-1.5cm diameter.  
SD Fails to attain the crite ria for CR, PR and PD  
PD ♦ (1) >50% increase in SPD from baseline of lymph nodes or 
(2) Any new node > 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter or >1 cm in short axis diameter if 1 -1.5 cm 
in long axis that is proven to be N 3 histologically or  
(3) Loss of response:  in those with PR or CR, >50% increase from nadir in SPD of lymph nodes  
Relapse  Any new lymph node >1.5cm in long axis diameter in those with CR  
* Peripheral and central lymph nodes.  
♦Whichever criterion occurs first.  
 
Page 38 of 42  
BMT 206  January 7, 2019       Response in Blood* 
CR**  B0 
PR# >50% decrease in quantitative measurements of blood tumor burden from baseline in those 
with high tumor burden at baseline (B 2) 
SD Fails to attain criteria for CR, PR or PD  
PD♦ (1) B 0 to B 2 or  
(2) >50% increase from baseline and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL42 or 
(3) Loss of response:  
1. in those with CR who were B 1 or B 2 at baseline, increase in neoplastic 
>1000 neoplastic cells/ μL or  
2. in those with PR who were originally B 2 at baseline, >50% increase from 
nadir and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL  
Relapse  Increase of neoplastic blood lymphocytes to > B1 in those with CR  
 
* As determined by absolute numbers of neoplastic cells/uL.  
** If a bone marrow biopsy was performed at baseline and determined to unequivocally be indicative of lymphomatous involvement, then to confirm a global CR where blood assessment now meets criteria for B
0, a repeat bone marrow biopsy must show no residual disease or the response should be 
considered a PR only.  
# There is no PR in those with B 1 disease at baseline as the difference within the range of neoplastic 
cells that define B 1 is not considered significant and should not affect determination of global 
objective response.  
♦ Whichever occurs first.  
 
Response in Viscera  
CR Liver or spleen or any organ considered involved at baseline should not be enlarged on physical 
exam and should be considered normal by imaging. No nodules should be present on imaging of liver or spleen. Any post treatment mass must be deter mined to be biopsy to be negative for 
lymphoma . 
PR >50% regression in any splenic or liver nodules, or in measureable  disease (SPD) in any organs 
abnormal at baseline.  No increase in size of liver or spleen and no new sites of involvement.   
SD Fails to attain the criteria for CR, PR or PD  
PD♦ (1) >50% increase in size (SPD) of any organs involved at baseline or 
(2) New organ involvement or  
(3) Loss of response:  in those with PR or CR, >50% increase from nadir in the size (SPD) of any 
previous organ involvement  
Relapse  New organ involvement i n those with CR  
 
*Use of FDG -PET scan in this instance is compatible with other NHLs but there is a paucity of data 
in clinical trials of MF/SS to document its utility.  
♦Whichever criterion occurs first.

Introduction 
 
Before agreeing to participate in this research study, it is important that you read and understand 
the following explanation of the proposed procedures. This document describes the purpose, 
procedures, benefits, and risks of the study.  
 
The study is being conducted for and funded by Abbott Laboratories. Up to 23,000 – 90,000  
individuals from several blood collection centers across the United States may be participating in 
the study associated with this follow-up blood draw . 
 
Why is this research being done? 
 
The purpose of this part of the study is to obtain an additional blood sample that may help 
interpret and better understand the investigational (research) test results of your previous 
specimen.  The sample is to be used by Abbott to evaluate new investigational products (Alinity s 
blood screening assays) that detect Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV and HTLV viruses and Chagas 
disease in donor blood. An investigational product is one that is not approved by the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

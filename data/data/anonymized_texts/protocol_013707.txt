Aspergillosis (IA) or Invasive Mucormycosis (IM) in Pediatric Subj ects
Planned Study Period:
From 1 Q2019 to 1Q2021
Study Objective(s):
Safety Objective
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of isavuconazonium sulfate in pediatric subjects
Efficacy Objective
To assess the efficacy of isavuconazonium sulfate for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) or 
invasive mucormycosis (IM) in pediatric subjects
Pharmacokinetic Objective
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole by monitoring the plasma concentrations in 
pediatric subjects during treatment with isavuconazonium sulfate
Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):
Approximately 30 investiga tive centers in the US and in Europe
Study Population:
Male and female subjects (1 to < 18 years of age) who have been diagnosed with proven, probable or 
possible IA or IM
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled/Randomized:
Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled. 
Every effort will be made to achieve at least 5 evaluable subjectsper age cohort: 1 to < 12 years of 
age and 12 to < 18 years of age. The sponsor reserves the right to stop enrollment if the cohort

Study Design Overview:
This is a phase 2, open- label, non- comparative, multicenter study to assess the safety and tolerability, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics of isavuconazonium sulfate in pediatric subjects for the treatment of 
IA or IM.
An approved informed consent form must be obtained from the subject’s parent or legal guardian, 
and, if required, pediatric assent prior to any study -related procedures being performed.
The subjects will enter into screening anytime between days -5 to day 1 (predose). All subjects will be 
assigned to open -label treatment via intravenous or oral treatment at the discretion of the investigator . 
The oral formulation can only be give n to subjects 6 years to < 18 years of age andwith a body 
weight of at least 12 kg . The route of administration may be changed per the investigator’s discretion 
as needed for treatment purposes asthe resulting exposure from the 2 routes of administration is 
considered equivalent on a mg:mg basis.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3Treatment will begin on day 1 , and then su bjects will be followed for 60 days post -last dose for 
safety.
Treatment will be administered until the subject has a successful outcome as judged by the 
investigator or for a maximum duration of 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM), whichever occurs first. 
Investigator guidance of a successful outcome is provided in Table 4. 
Intravenous and Oral Dosing: Subjects will receive a loading regimen of isavuconazonium sulfate (via 
intravenous or oral administration at the investigator’s discretion), which consists of a 10mg/kg dose 
every 8 hours (± 2 hours) on days 1 and 2 (for a total of 6 doses), followed by once daily maintenance 
10 mg/kg dosing for up to 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM) of dosing. The first maintenance dose 
should start 12 to 24 hours after the administration of the last loading dose. Subsequent maintenance 
doses will be administered once daily (24 hours ± 2 hours from the previous maintenance dose). 
Subjects who are discharged from the hospital with oral capsules for at -home administration must 
return weekly for study drug accountability and to receive new oral dosing supplies. Subjects who 
begin oral administration are to complete the oral dosing acceptability assessment after ingesting their 
first oral dose. Isavuconazonium sulfate oral capsules can be administered with or without food.
Due to the similarity in exposure (AUC) between intravenous and oral in pediatric subjects, the 
investigator may change dosing between the 2 routes (intravenous oral) throughout the treatment as 
needed for treatment purposes. If the route of administration is changed after the 2 -day loading 
regimen is completed, there is no need to repeat the loading dose for the new route of administration. 
The total doses for the loading period should not exceed 6 study drug adminis trations over the 2- day 
loading period, even if the route of administration is changed during the 2 -day loading period .
Blood sampling for the analysis of isavuconazole trough levels will be obtained from all subjects. 
The samples should ideally be drawn immediately prior to the next dose of study drug, but must be 
taken no earlier than 1 hour prior to the next dose on days 7, 14, 21, 42 and 84 or end of treatment 
(EOT). 
In addition to the above, 24 -hour pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained on any oneday between 
day 14 and day 42, while the subject is still receiving study drug, for subjects who consent to 
participation in the 24 -hour pharmacokinetic assessment.
Subjects receiving intravenous administration:
The 24- hour pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained for intravenous dosing as follows:
1. within 1 hour prior to the start of the intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate infusion (this sample 
will be the same as the trough sample prior to dose, if it coincides with scheduled days 14, 21 or 
42);
2. immediately after the completion of the intravenous infusion (no more than 5 minutes after);
3. within 4 to 10 hours after the start of the intra venous infusion; and 
4. within 16 to 24 hours after the start of the intravenous infusion (must be obtained before the start 
of the next infusion).
Subjects receiving oral administration:
The 24- hour pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained for oral dosing as follows: 
1. within 1 hour of next oral dose (this sample will be the same as the trough sample prior to dose, 
if it coincides with scheduled days 14, 21 or 42);
2. 1 hour post dose (± 10 minutes);
3. 3 hours post dose (± 10 minutes);
4. 4 hours post dose (± 10 minutes);
5. within 6 to 8 hours (± 30 minutes) ofstudy drug administration; and
6. 24 hours post dose (within 1 hour before next study drug administration) after study drug 
administration.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 31 INTRODUCTION
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a new azole antifungal agent that was approved for use in adults for 
the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mucorm ycosis (IM) in the US and in 
Europe for treatment of IA ; and for the treatment of IM in subjects for whom amphotericin B 
is inappropriate. These same invasive fungal pathogens are also important hospital- acquired
pathogens in criticall y-ill pediatric subject s, especia lly those with underly ingconditions 
compromising the immune system and there are currentl y ver y limited approved treatment 
options for pediatric subjects.
Therefore, establishing anefficacious andsafedosage regimen forisavuconazole forusein
pediatric subject s will provide important information for phy sicians treating these subjects.
1.1 Back ground
As in adults, fungal infections remain an important cause of morbidit y and mortality in 
pediatric subject s. In immunocompromised pediatric subject s, invasive mo uld infections 
(IMIs) are a leading cause of mortality  [Georgiadou et al, 2012; Al -Rezqi et al, 2009; Burgos 
et al, 2008; Walsh et al, 2008; Sung & Johnston, 2007; Zaoutis et al, 2006]. I n a large 
prospective multinational study  to evaluate the epidemiology  and spectrum of IMIs in 
children, which enrolled 131 pediatric subject s with proven or probable IMIs, the most 
common diagnosis was IA (75%), fol lowed by  other IMIs (17%) and IM (13%) [Wattier et 
al, 2015]. A large proportion of these subject s had some underl ying immunosuppression. 
Overall mortalit y was 30% at 12 weeks [Wattier et al, 2015]. Another study identified 
48pediatric subject s with prove n or probable IMIs from a retrospective single- center in the 
US [Georgiadou et al, 2012] and found similar trends with Aspergillus species being the most 
common organism and the majority  of subject s being immunocompromised with hematologic 
malignancy  and/or neutropenia. Overall mortality in this study  was 31% at 12 weeks; in all 
subject s, death was attributed to both I MI and the underly ing disease.
Invasive Aspergillosis: Risk factors and underly ing disease characteristics for IA are 
comparable between adul ts and children with the most common being malignancy , such as 
acute m yeloid leukemia (AML) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
Chronic granulomatous disease, which is t ypicall y diagnosed in children, is also a risk factor 
[Dornbusch et al, 2009]. The Infectious Diseases Society  of America guidelines for the 
treatment of IA do not distinguish between the disease characteristics in adults and children 
[Walsh et al, 2008]. Therefore, aside from s ystemic dosing differences, the treatment 
guidelines for these 2 populations do not differ.
Invasive Mucormycosis: IM is extremely  rare and can occur not only in subject s with a 
severel y compromised immune sy stem, but also occasionall y in subject s with traumatic 
injuries or in subject s with uncont rolled diabetes mellitus. I M is one of the most life -
threatening mo uld infections in subject s with hematologic malignancies and in HSCT 
recipients [Skiada et al, 2011; Chamilos et al, 2008; Roden et al, 2005]. I n a 10 -year (1997 to 
2006) retrospective stud y in France, the incidence of IM annuall y increased with age, from
0.3 per million in children less than 9 y ears to 3.9 per million subject s > 89 years; overall the

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3annual incidence was 0.9 per million subject s [Bitar et al, 2009]. The incidence is reporte dly 
1/10 of the incidence of IA on average [Abidi et al, 2014].
Presentation and pathogenesis of the disease aresimilar between children and adults. 
Therefore, diagnosis and treatment recommendations are the same in both populations at risk.
Given the sim ilarity  of the pathogenesis and features of invasive fungal infection (IFI) 
betw een adults and pediatric subjects for both IA and IM, this IA and IM treatment study  in 
children is designed to assess the safety of the proposed clinical dosage regimen. The 
proposed clinical dosage regimen is supported b y a prior clinical pharmacokinetic and safety  
study  in children. The dosage regimen generates exposures in the pediatric population that 
are consistent with the exposures achieved in adults receiving the recomm ended clinical dose 
for adults. The current pediatric study  is intended to evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of 
isavuconazonium sulfate in the pediatric population from 1 to < 18 years of age .
1.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Data
An overview of the nonclinical and adult clinical data of isavuconazole can be found in the 
latest version of the investigator’s brochure (IB).
Isavuconazole has been investigated in a phase 1 pharmacokinetic, safet y and tolerability  
study  in pediatric subject s following intravenous administration. In this study , a total of 
27pediatric subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug (Protocol 9766- CL-0046). Nine 
subjects were between 1 and < 6 years of age, 8 subjects were between 6 and < 12 y ears of 
age and 10 subjects were between 12 and < 18 years of age. A majority  of subjects were 
white and male. Most subjects had an underl ying malignancy . Subjects weighing ≤ 40 kg 
received 10 mg/kg of isavuconazonium sulfate, and subjects > 40 kg received 372 of 
isavuconazonium sulfate intravenously  daily , after a loading regimen. 
The vast majority  of subjects experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE), and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were experienced b y about half of all subjects, which is expected given the 
medical history  of the subjects enrolled. About a third of subjects experienced drug -related 
AEs. I mportant drug -related events included gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and infusion -
related reactions. Two subjects were withdrawn from the study  due to an AE. The events 
leading to withdrawal were increased liver enzy mes and QT prolongation, and both events 
were considered related to study  drug . No differences were observed in the AE experience 
between the 3 age cohorts.
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
In the isavuconazole juvenile toxicity  study , the no -observed -adverse- effect -level in rats was
determined to be 10 mg/kg per day . In this study , no toxicities were observed in pediatric 
sensitive organs. A summary  of the juvenile toxicity  study , as well as an overview of the key  
isavuconazole safet y data collected in adult subjects during the clinical development program 
can be found in the latest version of the IB.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3In addition, isavuconazonium sulfate has been investigated in one pediatric clinical study 
[Study 9766 -CL-0046]. In this small study , important adverse reactions were GI disorders, 
rash, increased liver enzymes and infusion -related reactions.
1.4 Risk  Benefit Assessment
The safet y of isavuconazonium sulfate in pediatric subjects has been investigated in a stud y 
with a total of 27 subjects. I n this small study , isavuconazonium sulfate appeared to be 
generall y well -tolerated with a safet y profile similar to that observed in adults. The efficacy 
of isavuconazonium sulfate in pediatric subject s has not yetbeen studi ed. It is expected that 
the dosage regimen used in the study  will result in efficacious exposures in pediatric subjects 
and therefore subjects will likely  benefit from participating in this study .
Subjects enrolled in this study  may  experience AEs , including previousl y unknown AEs
related to study drug or may experience procedural complications (e.g., bruising from blood 
draws and slight skin irritation from the adhesive on the electrocardiogram [ECG] electrodes). 
While the proposed dosage regimen was established to minimize the number of subjects 
reaching exposures associated with increased toxicity  in adults, some pediatric subjects could 
reach exposures that resulted in central nervous system and GI- type adverse effects in adults. 
Subjects with f amilial short QT sy ndrome are excluded from participation in this study . 
Pediatric subjects enrolled in this study  will be closely monitored for AEs, especially  for liver 
toxicity . Overall, based on the target population selected for this study , the exclusion criteria 
and the proposed dosage regimen, which matches adult efficacious exposures, the benefit and
risk assessment associated with the participation of pediatric subjects in this clinical study is 
favorable.

2.2.1 Study Design
This is a phase 2, open- label, non -comparative, multicenter study  to assess the safet y and 
tolerability , efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of isavuconazonium sulfate in pediatric subjects 
for the treatment of IA or I M.
An approved informed consent form (ICF) must be obtained from the s ubject’s parent or legal 
guardian, and, if required, pediatric assent prior to any  study -related procedures being performed.
Approximately  30 centers in the US and EU are planned to enroll approximately  30 subjects 
1 to < 18 y ears of age with at least 25 s ubjects evaluable. Every  effort will be made to 
achieve at least 5 evaluable subjects per age cohort below:
●Cohort 1: 1 to < 12 y ears of age
●Cohort 2: 12 to < 18 y ears of age
The sponsor reserves the right to stop enrollment if the cohort requirements are not achieved.
The subjects will enter into screening an ytime between day s -5 to day  1 (predose). All 
subjects will be assigned to open -label treatment via intravenous or oral treatment at the 
discretion of the investigator. The oral formulation can onl y be given to subjects 6 years to 
<18 years of age and with a body  weight of at least 12 kg . The route of administration may  
be changed per the investigator’s discretion as needed for treatment purposes as theresulting 
exposure from the 2 routes of administration is considered equivalent on a mg:mg basis . 
Treatment will begin on day 1, and then subjects will be followed for 60 day s post -last dose 
for safety . Treatment will be administered until the subject has a successful outcome as 
judged b y the investigator or for a maximum duration of 84 day s (IA) or 180 day s (IM), 
whichever occurs first. Investigator guidance of a successful outcome is provided in Table 4. 
Intravenous and Oral Dosing: S ubjects will receive a loading regimen of isavuconazonium 
sulfate (via intravenous or oral administration at the investigator’s discretion), which consists 
of a 10 mg/kg dose every 8 hours (± 2 hours) on day s 1 and 2 (for a total of 6 doses), 
followed b y once daily maintenance 10 mg/kg dose for up to 84 day s (IA) or 180 day s(IM) 
of dosing. The first maintenance dose should start 12 to 24 hours after the administration of 
the last loading dose. Subsequent maintenance doses will be administered once dail y (24 
hours ± 2 hours from the previous maintenance dose). Subjects who are discharged from the 
hospital with oral capsules for at -home administration must return weekl y for st udy drug 
accountability  and to receive new oral dosing supplies. Return visits should coincide with
days when study -related assessments are required. Subjects who begin oral administration are 
to complete the oral dosing acceptability  assessment after ingesting their first oral dose.
Due to th e similarity  in exposure (AUC) between intravenous and oral in pediatric subjects, 
the investigator may  change dosing between the 2 routes (intravenous oral) throughout the 
treatment as needed for treatment purpo ses. Ifthe route of administration is chang ed after the 
2-day loading regimen is completed, there is no need to repeat the loading dose for the new 
route of administration. The total doses for the loading period should not exceed 6 study  drug

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3administrati ons over the 2- day loading period , even if the route of administration is changed 
during the 2 -day loading period. 
Blood sampling for the analy sis of isavuconazole trough levels will be obtained from all 
subjects. The samples should ideally  be drawn immed iately  prior to the next dose of study  
drug, but must be taken no earlier than 1 hour prior to the next dose on day s 7, 14, 21, 42 and 
84 or end of treatment (EOT).
In addition to the above, 24 -hour pharmacokinet ic samples will be obtained on anyone day 
between day  14 and day  42, while the subje ct is still receiving stud y drug, for subjects who
consent to participation in the 24 -hour pharmacokinetic assessment .
Subject s receiving intravenous administration:
The 24-hour pharmacokinetic samples will be obt ained for intravenous dosing as follows: 
1. within 1 hour prior to the start of the intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate infusion (this 
sample will be the same as the trough sample prior to dose, if it coincides with scheduled 
days 14, 21 or 42);
2.immediately  after the completion of the intravenous infusion (no more than 5 minutes 
after) ;
3.within 4 to 10 hours after the start of the intravenous infusion ; and
4.within 16 to 24 hours after the start of the intravenous infusion (must be obtained before 
the start of t he next infusion).
Subject s receiving oral administration:
The 24- hour pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained for oral dosing as follows:
1. within 1 hour of next oral dose (this sample will be the same as the trough sample prior 
to dose, if it coincides wi th scheduled day s 14, 21 or 42) ;
2. 1 hour post dose (± 10 minutes);
3. 3 hours post dose (± 10 minutes);
4. 4 hours post dose (± 10 minutes);
5.within 6 to 8 hours (± 30 minutes) ofstudy  drug administration ; and
6.24 hours post dose (within 1 hourbefore next study  drug administration) after study  drug 
administration.
No additional samples will be taken from IM subjects after day  84.
Throughout the stud y,safety  and tolerability  will be assessed b y the recording of AEs, vital 
signs, ECGs and safet ylaboratory  evaluations. This includes assessments at 14 day s, 28 day s 
and 56 day s. All subjects will complete 2 follow -up visits. At the discretion of the 
investigator, follow -up visits may  be conducted via telephone with the subject, the subject’s 
parent or the subject’s legal guardian, 30 and 60 day s after the subject’s day  84 (IA)/day  180 
(IM) or EOT visit.
If subject discontinues study  drug prior to day  84 or day  180, all EOT procedures must be 
completed. If subject continues to allow consent, end of s tudy (EOS) information will be 
collected 30 and 60 day s after EOT.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 32.2.2 Dose Rationale
The safet y and efficacy  of isavuconazonium sulfate in adults has been demonstrated for the 
treatment of IA and IM. The clinical dosage regimen used to establish the safet y and efficacy  
was 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) every  8 hours for 
the first 2 day s followed by  372 mg once dail y thereafter. While dosing is reflected as 
milligrams of the administered prodrug (isavuconazonium sulfate), e xposure is represented as 
milligrams of the active moiety (isavuconazole), which is immediately  present in the 
systemic circulation.
An exposure -response analy sis was conducted using data from adult subjects receiving 
isavuconazonium sulfate for the treatm ent of IA in the phase 3 SECURE clinical study  [Study  
9766 -CL-0104] and the population pharmacokinetic model [Company  Report 9766 -PK-0005; 
Desai et al, 2017]. The objective was to determine ifthere was a threshold of exposure or 
plasma concentration that was optimal for successful outcome in the adult subjects receiving 
isavuconazonium sulfate for the treatment of IA. For this analy sis, plasma concentrations at 
day 7 (C 7), day  14(C14) and at stead y-state (C ss) and steady -state area under the concentration -
time curve at 24 hours (AUC 24)estimates simulated from thepopulation pharmacokinetic
model inadults were used. No specific exposure parameter or threshold of exposure or 
concentration showed a significant relationship with any  measure of response (i.e., all -cause 
mortality  through day 42, all -cause mortality  through day  84, overall response at end of therapy  
andoverall response at day  42) observed in subjects from [Study 9766 -CL-0104].
These results suggested that the exposures achieved by  the cli nical dosage regimen were 
adequate totreat theinfecting organisms insubjects treated inthestudy .
In addition, the probability of target attainment analy sis, which assessed the ability  of the 
clinical dosage regimen to achieve the pharmacodynamic targe t defined by  theexperimental 
IA model, suggested that the clinical dosage regimen was adequate to cover the wild -type 
population of Aspergillus species according to the defined epidemiological cutoff values for 
isavuconazole [Espinel- Ingroff et al, 2013].
The efficacy  described for IM was established based on exposure to the same clinical dosing 
regimen in adults; therefore, the expectation would be that the exposure required (median
AUC ss of 89.6 mg·h/L) for this disease in children would be similar.
In order to establish the upper exposure target for the proposed pediatric dosing regimen for 
the proposed pediatric study , the safet y information from 2 clinical studies in which doses 
higher than the clinical adult dose of isavuconazonium sulfate were admin istered were 
reviewed:
●[Study  9766 -CL-0102]: dose -ranging stud y in adult subjects with AML  receiving doses 
upto744 mg isavuconazonium sulfate and
●[Study  9766 -CL-0017]: thorough QT study  with healthy  adult subjects receiving doses up 
to 1116 mg isavuconazonium sulfate.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3The mean AUC 24for subjects in the 1116 mg isavuconazonium sulfate group was 353mg*h/L , 
and the minimum AUC 24 in this dose group was 233 mg*h/L [Study  9766 -CL-0017].
Population Pharmacokinetic M odel for Pediatric Data
Apediatric population pharmacokinetic model was developed utilizing plasma concentration 
data from 27 subjects administered intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate from Part 1 of Study  
9766 -CL-0046 ,10 subjects administered oral dose from Part 2 of Study  9766 -CL-0046 (12 to 
< 18 y ears of age ) and24 subjects from the 9766- CL-0018 study , an intravenous study  in 
which subjects were administered single dose of 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate. The 
model was updated to include plasma concentration data from an additional 9subjects from 
Part 2 of Study  9766 -CL-0046 (6 to < 12years of age ), who were administered oral 
isavuconazonium sulfate.
Data was modeled using a nonlinear relationship with the following equation:
where Pistheparameter ofinterest (clearance [CL] orvolume ofdistribution
[Vd]),
WT is the weight in kg for the individual subject and x for the relevant 
allometric component, which was fixed to 0.75 for CL  related parameters and 
one for V drelated parameters
A 3-compartment model with combined zero order absorption, first order absorption and 
linear elimination described the data adequatel y. Inter -individual variability  was observed on 
clearance, volume of distribution of central and peripheral compartment and 
inter-compartmental clearance.
Monte Carlo simulations were performed for 1000 randomly  chosen subjects for each age 
group in pediatrics and 1000 to 5000 randomly  chosen subjects for adult data. Area under the 
isavuconazole concentration- time curve at stead y-state (AUC ss) was calculated for each 
simulated subject. The dosing schedule for the simulation was similar to that for subjects in 
Study  9766- CL-0046, with subjects weighing ≤ 37 kg administered 10 mg/kg dose and 
subjects > 37 kg receiving the adult dose of 372 mg.

Based on modeling and simulation results, the proposed daily  dose administered either as 
intravenous (across all age groups) or oral ( 6 years to < 18 y ears of age and with a body  
weight of at least 12 kg ) for the clinical stud y in pediatric subjects is:
●10 mg/kg isavuconazonium sulfate for subjects weighing ≤ 37 kg (the maximum loading
and daily  maintenance doses to be a dministered to any  subject are 372 mg)
OR
●372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate for subjects weighing > 37 kg.
NOTE: The oral administration is only  available for pediatric subjects 6 years and older due 
to the difficulty  in swallowing the oral capsule.
Due to si milarity  in exposures between intraveno us and oral in pediatric subject s, the route of 
administration can be switched from intravenous to oral and oral to intravenous, as needed. 
Currently ,interchangeability  of administration is permitted in adults in approved product 
labeling (US Package Insert) .Isavuconazonium sulfate oral capsules can be administered 
with or without food.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3documentation . If the subject should vomit any  of the medication, this is to be recorded as 
well. The dose is NOT to be repeated. Compliance of the study drug will be monitored by  
review of the oral dosing log and the accounting of unused medication returned by  the subject 
at each scheduled visit after day  7 and/or at the EOT visit.
When study  drug is administered at the research fa cility , it will be administered under the 
supervision of study  personnel. A subject dail y dosing log will be collected to record 
date/time and completeness of dosing for each day.
Study  subjects and their parents/legal guardians should be counseled on the need to meet 
100% compliance with study  drug dosing. The investigator or designee should ensure that 
study  subjects adhere to this goal throughout the study .
If compliance is less than 80%, the investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and 
ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. 
5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
Demographic characteristics will be recorded at the screening visit. This will include age, 
sex, race, ethnicit y (if known), height and bod y weight. Height and w eight are to be measured 
while the subject is clothed, but not wearing shoes.
5.2.2 Medical History
The medical history  of diseases other than the underly ing diseases or conditions or infectious 
diseases will be identified at screening, b y means of diagnosis and duration of the disease.
The medical history  will include information related to the duration (i.e., the number of 
months or y ears). Subject’s relevant medical and surgical history must be documented.
5.2.2.1 Underlying Diseases or Conditions
At screening, all underl ying diseases or other conditions that predispose the subject to IFIs 
will be recorded.
5.2.2.2 Infectious Disease History

fungal disease at the infected bod y site). These data will be recorded in the eCRF .
During treatment with study  drug, record an y tests performed to demonstrate changes from 
baseline or evaluate the st atus of the fungal infection, such as mycological evidence of fungal 
culture or histology results (positive and negative) from the relevant site of infection or any  
new site, new fungal infection, changes in clinical signs and s ymptoms, including 
radiologi cal findings relevant to the baseline fungal infection under treatment, and any  
serological markers performed (serum GM) and any surgical procedures. Record an y 
procedures conducted to further assess or treat the fungal infection such as surgical 
debrideme nt, amputation, etc. and the results of such procedures. Negative results of tests 
demonstrating resolution of infection should also be documented and recorded in the eCRF. 
Mortality  status will be assessed per [ Table 1and Table 2Schedule of Assessments]. 
Every  effort should be made to speciate and characterize any  fungal organisms grown in 
cultures. Results of susceptibility  testing done locally  will be collected. F ungal isolates from 
all positive fungal cultures should be stored and a reference laboratory  will be made available 
by the sponsor. The reference laboratory  will provide confirmation of the fungal genus and 
species, as well as in vitro susceptibility  to isavuconazole, as well as relevant mould -active 
antifungal drugs. The reference laboratory  results will not be available until after the end of 
the study .
5.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessment
Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic anal ysis of isavuconazol e as depicted in 
[Table 1andTable 2 Schedule of Assessments ]. Blood sample collection, handling and 
storage will be described in the laboratory  manual.
Blood sampling for the analy sis of trough levels will be obtained from all subjects. The 
samples should ideally  be drawn immediatel y prior to the dose of stud y drug, but must be 
taken no earlier than 1 hour prior to the dose on days 7, 14, 21, 42 and 84 or EOT. 
In addition to the above, 24 -hour pharmacokinetic samples for intravenous or oral dosing will 
be obtained on an yoneday between day  14 and day  42, while the subject is still receiving 
study  drug , for subjects who consent to participation in the 24 -hour pharmacokinetic
assessment. The goal is to achieve approximately  6 subjects in each age cohort by  the time 
enrollment is completed for the stud y.
The 24-hour intravenous pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained as follows:
1. w ithin 1 hour prior to the start of the intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate infusion (this 
sample will be the same as the trough sample prior to dose if it coincides with scheduled 
days 14, 21 or 42);
2. immediately  after the completion of the intravenous infusion (no more than 5 minutes 
after) ;
3. w ithin 4 to 10 hours after the start of the intravenous infusion ; and
4. w ithin 16 to 24 hours after the start of t he intravenous infusion (must be obtained before 
the start of the next infusion).

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3The 24- hour oralpharmacokinetic samples will be obtained as follows:
1. w ithin 1 hour of next oral dose (this sample will be the same as the trough sample prior 
to dose, if it coincides with scheduled day s 14, 21 or 42);
2. 1 hour post dose (± 10 minutes);
3. 3 hours post does (± 10 minutes);
4. 4 hours post dose ( ± 10 minutes);
5. w ithin 6 to8 hours ( ± 30 minutes) of study  drug administration ; and
6. 24 hours (within 1 h ourbefore next study  drug administration) after study  drug 
administration.
5.3.3 Oral Dosing Acceptability Assessment
This assessment will be conducted to assess the acceptability  of the new oral formulation in 
this subject population. Subjects who begin oral administration of the study  drug will 
complete an assessment shortly  after taking their first oral dose. A 5 -point hedonic scale 
rating the oral dosing is included on the assess ment. There are 5 faces with descriptions from
really bad to reall y good that rank the resp onse to the following questions :
●How was the TASTE of the medication?
●How was it to SWALLOW the medication?
●How would y ou FEEL if y ou took this medication again?
Refer to [Appendix 12.7 Oral Dosing Acceptability Assessment].
5.4 Safety Assessment
5.4.1 Vital Signs
Vital signs (temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure) are to be measured within 1 hour 
before the start and approximately  1 hour after the end of each infusion on dosing day s. No 
additional vital signs are needed on dosing day s for oral administration. Temperature to be 
taken as per institution’s policy  based on age of subject. Vital signs will be collected as 
shown in the schedule of assessments [ Table 1andTable 2]. When vital signs are scheduled 
for the same time as a blood sample, the vital signs will be taken before the blood sample.
5.4.2 Laboratory Assessments
Below is a table of the laboratory  tests that will be performed during the conduct of the study  
and assessed b y the local laboratory . In the event the protocol -specified clinical laboratory has 
alread y been collected and results available, these data are sufficient for mon itoring safety as 
per the protocol and must be recorded in the eCRF. In order to minimize blood draws, it is not 
necessary  to draw an additional sample for the sole purposes of the clinical trial.
Clinical laboratory  samples should be collected at the same time as other blood samples such 
as pharmacokinetic whenever possible to minimize the need for unnecessary blood sampling 
forthe subject. See [ Table 1andTable 2Schedule of Assessment] for study visit day s and 
allowed windows for lab sample collectio n.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3Any abnormal f inding(s) at screening must not be exclusionary  per the eligibility  criteria if a 
subject is to be enrolled in the study . Post initial study  drug dosing, new abnormal findings or 
a worsening of an ongoing abnormal condition must be recorded as an AE.
5.4.4 Electrocardiogram 
Standard 12-lead ECG recordings willbeused forthepurposes of safety assessment bythe
investigator.
A 12 -lead, resting ECG is to be recorded, as indicated in [ Table 1andTable 2Schedule of 
Assessments]. Subjects should remain supine for at least 5 minutes prior to all ECGs being 
performed. Dates and times m aybe generated by  the machine’s internal clock and are 
considered source data. The results are to be interpreted b y qualified personnel in real time. 
The principal investigator/ designee will initial and date and provide his/her clinical 
interpretation on each report. The results (normal, abnormal notclinically significant,
abnormal clinicall ysignificant) aretoberecorded.
The ECG recorded during screening will be used to determine eligibility  forstudy  
participation. Subjects who have familial short Q T syndrome, or a clinically significant 
abnormal ECG, will not be eligible for the stud y. The interpretation of the ECG from 
screening will be the baseline to which post study drug dosing ECGs will be compared.
ECGs will be performed at screening and prior to study  drug administration on each 
scheduled day  as indicated in [ Table 1andTable 2Schedule of Assessments].
Unscheduled ECGs will be performed if clinicall yindicated.
The original printout and an electronic cop y of all scheduled and unscheduled ECG tracings 
should be maintained on site as source data.
5.4.5 Order of Assessments 
The following sequence order wi ll be in effect when more than one assessment is required at
a time point with blood sampling forpharmacokinetics being collected nearest tothe
scheduled time point:
1. Vital signs
2. ECG
3. Laboratory  assessments (hematology , chem istry and hepatic panel ) blood draw
4. Pharmacokinetic blood draw
5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug, and which 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory  finding), 
symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

05 Sep 2019 Astellas Page 50of 110
Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received study  drug treatment. AE collection begins after the signing of the I CF and will be 
collected until 60 days after the last dose of stud y drug or the subject is dete rmined to be a 
screen failure.
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
5.5.1.1 Abnormal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g. , hematology , clinical chemistry ,hepatic panel or 
INR) or other safet y assessment (e.g., ECGs, vital signs measurements, ph ysical 
examination), including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to 
underly ing d isease, is to be reported as an SAE or AE ((S) AE).
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment 
which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety assessment, in the absence of any  of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE. Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an 
error does not require reporting as an AE.
5.5.1.2 Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions 
on drug induced liver injury . Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent or with 
abnorm al elevations in TBL that meet the criteria outlined in [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safet y 
Monitoring and Assessment], in the absence of other causes of liver injury , are considered 
potential cases of drug -induced liver injury  (including potential Hy’s Law cases) and a re 
alway s to be considered important medical events and reported per [ Section 5.5.5 R eporting 
of Serious Adverse Events].
5.5.1.3 Disease Progression and Study Endpoints
Under this protocol, the following event(s) will not be considered as an (S)AE:
●Pre-planned and elective hospitalizations or procedures for diagnostic, therapeutic or 
surgical procedures for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the course of 
the clinical trial. These procedures are collected per the eCRFs Completion Guidelines.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 35.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outc omes:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a mo re severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
●Results in congenital anomaly  or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospitalization ( except for planned procedures as allowed per study) 
or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned 
hospitalization is not caused by  an AE). Hospitalization for 
treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be consider ed as serious.
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization , but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
usually  are considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency  ordrug abuse.
5.5.2.1 Always Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events. I f an AE is 
reported that is considered by the sponsor to be an SAE per this classification as “alway s 
serious”, additional informati on on the event (e.g. ,investigator confirmation of seriousness,
causality ) will be requested.
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to Study Drug
A medicall y qualified investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the stud y 
drug and each occurrence of each (S)AE. This medically  qualified investigator will use 
medical judgment, as well as the Re ference Safet y Information (refer to the IB) to determine 
the relationship. The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporting requirements.
The medicall y qualified investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality 
assessment for each (S)AE and must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the (S)AE and has provided an assessmen t of causality .
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 9766 -CL-0107
-CONFIDENTIAL -
05 Sep 2019 Astellas Page 52of 110
Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the study  drug and 
each (S)AE will be assessed by  answering ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “ Do you consider 
that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may ha ve been caused by the study 
drug ”.
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ 
that an (S)AE may  have been caused by  the stud y drug (rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out) or if there is evidence to reasonabl y deny a causal relationship:
●Plausible temporal relationship between exposure to the study drug and (S)AE onset 
and/or resolution. Has the subject actually  received the study  drug? Did the (S)AE occur 
in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study  drug? 
●Plausibility ; i.e., could the event been caused by  the study  drug? Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half- life, lit erature evidence, drug class, preclinical 
and clinical study  data, etc.
●Laboratory  or other test results; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y drug (e.g., based on values pre -, during 
and post-treatment)
●Available alternative explanations independent of study  drug exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc. and st rength of the alternative 
explanation
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the medically  qualified investigator alway s make an assessment of causality  for every  event 
before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insufficient 
information about the event to make an informed medical judgment and in absence of an y 
indication or eviden ce to establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to 
be considered. In such instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information 
regarding the event as soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality  upon receipt of 
additional information. The medicall y qualified investigator may  revise his/her assessment of 
causality  in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -up 
report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated causality  assessment.
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to ra te the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 35.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
The collection of AEs and the expedited reporting of SAEs will start following receipt of the 
ICFand will continue until 60days after last administration of study  drug or the subject is 
determined to be a screen failure.
In the case of a SAE, the investigator must contact the sponsor by fax or email immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The investigator must complete and submit an SAE worksheet containing all information that 
is required b y local and/or regional regulations to the sponsor b y email or fax immediately 
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The SAE worksheet must be signed b y a medically  qualified investigator (as identified on 
Delegation of Authorit y Log). Signatur e confirms accuracy  and completeness of the SAE 
data,as well as the investigator causalit y assessment including the explanation for the 
causality  assessment.

5.5.8.1 P regnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 30 days from 
the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator is to report the information to the sponsor 
according to the timelines in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Seri ous Adverse Events] using the 
Pregnancy  Reporting Form and i n the eCRF.
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  female partner of a 
male subject who becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 30 day s from 
the discontinuation of dosing and report the information to the sponsor according to the 
timelines in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Event s] usin g the Pregnancy  
Reporting Form. 
The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
study  subject as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse

reported via the Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  when also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below:
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
● Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the study  drug.
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as " possible "by 
the investigator.
●Congenital anomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus)
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by  visual examination. (S)AEs 
experienced b y the newborn/infant should be reported via the Pregnancy  Reporting Form. 
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks followi ng the estimated delivery  
date.
5.5.8.2 Medic ation Error, Overdose and “Off -label Use”
If a m edicat ion error, overdose or “off- label u se” (i.e., use out side of what is stated in the 
protocol) is suspected, refer to [Section 8.3Major Protocol Deviations]. Any associated (S)AEs 
are to be reported in the eCRF. If the AE meets the definition of a SAE, the SAE is also to be 
reported as described in [Section 5.5.5 R eporting of Serious Adverse Events] together with the 
details of the medi cation error, overdose and/or “off- label u se”.
In the event of suspected isavuconazonium sulfate overd ose, the subject should receive 
supportive care and monitoring. At supratherapeutic doses ( equivalent to isavuconazole 
600mg/day  maintenance d ose) evaluated in a thorough QT stud y in adults, there were 
proportionally  more treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) than in the therapeutic dose 
group (equivalent to isavuconazole 200 mg/day  maintenance dose) for the following: headache, 
dizziness, paraesthesia, somnolence, disturbance in attention, dy sgeusia, dry  mouth, diarrhoea, 
oral hy poesthesia, vomiting, hot flush, anxiety , restlessness, palpitations, tachy cardia, 
photophobia and arthr algia. Isavuconazole is not removed b y hemodial ysis.
There is no speci fic antidote for isavuconazole.
The medical monitor should be contacted as applicable.
5.5.8.3 Misuse/Abuse
If misuse or abuse of the study  drug(s) is suspected, theinvestigator must forward the special 
situation worksheet to the sponsor b y fax or email immediately  (within 24 hours of 
awareness). An y associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF. If theAE meets the 
definition of a SAE, the SAE is also to be reported as described in [Section 5.5.5 R eporting 
of Serious Adverse Events ]together with details of the misuse or abuse of the study drug(s).

preparing it for administration to the subject ) to the study  drug occurs, the investigator must 
forward the Special Situation worksheet to the sponsor by fax or email immediatel y (within 
24 hours of awareness). Any  associated (S)A Es occurring to the individual associated with or 
resulting from the Special Situation are to be reported on the Special Situations worksheet.
5.5.9 Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study
When new information becomes available necessary  forconducting the clinical study  
properl y, the sponsor will inform all investigators involved in the clinical study ,as well as 
the regulatory  authorities. I nvestigators should inform the I RB/IEC of such information when 
needed. 
The investigator will also inform the subjects, who will be required to sign a n updated ICF in 
order to continue in the clinical study .
5.5.10 Urgent Safety Measures
An urgent safet y measure (USM) i s an intervention, which is not defined by  the protocol and 
can be put in place with immediat e effect without needing to gain prior approval by the 
sponsor , relevant CA , IRB/IEC, where applicable, in order to protect study  participants from 
any immediate hazard to their health and/or safet y. Either the investigator or the sponsor can 
initiate an U SM. The cause of an USM can be safety , product or procedure related. 
5.5.11 Reporting Urgent Safety Measures
In the event of a potential USM, the investigator must conta ct the Astellas study  physician
(within 24 hours of awareness). Full details of the potential USM are to be recorded in the 
subject’s medical records. The sponsor may  request additional information related to the 
event to support their evaluation.
If the event is confirmed to be an USM the sponsor will take appropriate action to ensure the 
safet y and welfare of the subject s.These actions may  include ,but are not limited to ,a change 
in study  procedures or study  treatment, halting further enrollment in the trial, or stopping the 
study  in its entirety . The sponsor or sponsor's designee will notify  CA and cEC within the 
timelines required per current local regulations, and will inform the investigators as required. 
When required, investigators must notify  their IRB/IEC within timelines set by  regional 
regulations.
5.6 Test Drug Concentration
Plasma concentrations of isavuconazo le will be analy zed to monitor the levels of isavuconazole 
in the subject population during treatment. For the purpose of this study , serial blood samples 
(approximately  1 mL) will be collected in 1 -mL potassium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid.
Vacutainer tubes for each scheduled nominal time point on days 7, 14, 21, 42 and day  84 or 
EOT. The samples should ideally  be drawn immediately  prior to the dose of study  drug, must 
be taken no earlier than 1 hour prior.

consent to participation in the 24 -hour pharmacokinetic assessment. The goal is to achieve 
approximately  6 subjects in each age cohort b y the time enrollment is completed for the stud y.
The intravenous pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained as follows:
1. within 1 hour prior to the start of the intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate infusion (this 
sample will be the same as the trough sample prior to dose if it coincides with scheduled 
days14, 21 or 42);
2. immediately  after the completion of the intravenous infusion (no more than 5 minutes after) ;
3. w ithin 4 to 10 hours after the start of the intravenou s infusion; and
4. within 16 to 24 hours after the start of the intravenous infusion (must be obtained before 
the start of the next infusion).
The oralpharmacokinetic samples will be obtained as follows:
1. w ithin 1 hour prior to the next oral dose (this sample will be the same as the trough 
sample prior to dose if it coincides with scheduled days 14, 21 or 42);
2.1 hour post dose (± 10 minutes);
3.3 hours post dose (± 10 minutes);
4.4 hours post dose (± 10 minutes); 
5.within 6 to 8 hours (± 30 minutes) of s tudy drug administration; and
6.24 hours (within 1 hour before next study  drug administration) after study  drug 
administration.
No additional pharmacokinetic samples will be taken from IM subjects during days 85 to 180.
Immediately  after each sample collection, gentl y invert the blood sample 8 to 10 times and 
place in an ice water bath. Within 1 hour of sample collection, centrifuge the blood sample(s) 
at 1200 gfor 10 minutes at approximately  4°C in order to obtain plasma.
Plasma willbeharvested and divided equally into2(primary andback -up) appropriatel y

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 36 DISCONTINUATION
6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s) From Study Treatment 
A discontinuation from treatment is a subject who enrolled in the study  and for whom study  
treatment is permanently  discontinued for any  reason. The reason for d iscontinuation from 
study  treatment must be documented in the subject’s medical records.
A subject must discontinue study  treatment for any  of the following reasons:
●Subject requests to stop treatment. 
●Any clinical AE, laboratory  abnormalit y or intercurre nt illness, in the opinion of the 
investigator, indicates continued treatment is not in the best interest of the subject.
● Parent(s) or legal guardian withdraws consent.
●Subject experiences asystemic infusion- related reaction (IRR) such ashypotension,
dyspnea, chills, dizziness, paresthesia and hy poesthesia attributable to study  drug during 
or shortly  after theintravenous administration ; however, i n case of an infusion- related 
reaction, the infusion must be stopped immediately  and the subject must be d iscontinued 
from treatment.
Note : If the IRR signs and sy mptoms are mild and self- limiting, the subject may
continue in the study  at the discretion of the investigator .
●Serious hy persensitivity  orsevere skin reactions, such as anaph ylaxis or Stevens Johnson 
syndrome, have been reported during treatment with other azoles. If subject develops a 
severe h ypersensitivity  adverse reaction without alternative etiology , the subject must be 
discontinued fr om treatment .
●Investigator’s decision that further treatment is not in the best interest of the subject.
●Female subject becomes pregnant.
●Subject is lost to follow -up despite diligent efforts to contact.
Discontinuation of the subject from treatment should be considered if a subject experiences 
an increase in liver enz ymes . For specific liver abnormalities, refer to [ Appendix 12.5].
All subjects who discontinue stud y treatment will remain in the study and should continue to 
be follow ed for protocol specific follow- up procedures as outlined in [Table 1Schedule of 
Assessments]. T he only  exception to this is when the subject specificall y withdraws consent 
for an y further contact , with him/her or persons previously  authorized by  the participant to 
provide this information.
6.1.1 Lost to Follow -up
Every  reasonable effort is to be made to c ontact any  subject lost to follow -up during the 
course of the stud y to complete study- related assessments and record outstanding data.
6.2 Discontinuation ofthe Site
If an investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study , the investigator must
immediately  inform the sponsor.

8.2 Screen Failure s
For screen failures , the demographic data, reas on for failing, ICF , inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and AE s will be collected in the eCRF.
8.3 Major Protocol Deviations
A major protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as a s ystematic change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study  is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safety and welfare of subjects. The investigator should 
not implement any  deviation from, or chang es of, the protocol, unless it is necessary  to 
eliminate an immed iate hazard to study  subjects.
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictly  prohibited.
The major protocol deviation criteria are as follows:
PD1 - Entered into the study  even though they  did not sa tisfy entry  criteria,
PD2 - Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and was not withdrawn,
PD3 - Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose,
PD4 - Received excluded concomitant treatment.
When a major deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the 
investigator or designee must ensure the sponsor is notified. The sponsor will follow- up with 
the investigator, as ap plicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y 
and/or efficacy  OR pharmacokinetic parameters of the subject to determine subject 
continuation in the study . 
If a major deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the investigator mus t contact the sponsor 
immediately .

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 312.5 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN or bilirubin > 2 × ULN should undergo detailed 
testing for liver enzy mes (i ncluding at least ALT, AST, a lkaline phosphatase [ALP]and 
TBL). Testing should be repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. For 
studies for which a central laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated b y the central 
laboratory  regarding moderate and severe liver ab normality  to inform the investigator and 
study  team. Subjects should be asked if they  have any  symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  
dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where UL N:
ALT or AST TBL
Moderate > 3 × ULN or > 2 × ULN
Severe > 3 × ULN and > 2 × ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN.
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks.
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and International Normalized Ratio (I NR) > 1.5 (If INR testing 
is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detail ed pertinent history , 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site staff is to complete the liver abnorma lity 
case report form (LA -CRF). Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)
should be followed as described below.
Confirmed mo deratel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  drug has been discontinued an d the subject is 
asymptomatic.
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absen ce of another 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a SAE. The 
sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver 
function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are obs erved.

Version 4.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 3To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Sy mptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF . Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may  lead 
to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipopro teinemic and/or diabetic subject s, and may  be a ssociated with 
fluctuating AT levels. The investigator should ensure that the medical history  form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function.
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including n onprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets. Medications, is to be entered in the eCRF . Information on alcohol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA- CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
● B ased on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
○Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents), 
○Ultrasound or other imag ing to assess biliary  tract disease,
○Other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin.
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Treatment Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from study treatment. The investigator may  determine that it is not in the 
subject’s best interest to continue study  treatment. Discontinuation of study treatment should 
be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN.
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks.
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fe ver, rash and/or eosinophilia ( > 5%). 
In addition, if close monitorin g for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, study  treatment should be discontinued.

treated and untreated subjects to be discriminating ). 
2.Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) w ith concurrent transaminase elevations at 
least 3 × ULN and no evidence of intra- or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated 
ALP) or Gilbert’s s yndrome [Temple, 2006].

or placebo.
2.Among trial subjects showing such AT elevations, often with ATs much greater than 
3 xULN, one or more also show elevation of serum TBL to > 2× ULN, without initial 
findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP).
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TB L, such 
as viral hepatitis A, B or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of 
causing the observed injury . [Guidance for Industry titled “Drug -Induced Liver Injury :

study  in which subjects were administered single dose of 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate. 
The initial model was updated with 10 subjects from Part 2 of Study  9766 -CL-0046, who 
were administered oral isavuconazonium sulfate.
A 3-compartment model with combined zero order absorption, first order absorption and 
linear elimination described the data adequatel y.
Monte Carlo simulations were performed for 1000 to 5000 randomly chosen subje cts for each 
age group in pediatrics and adult data. Area under the isavuconazole concentration -time 
curve at stead y-state (AUCss) was calculated for each simulated subject. The dosing schedule 
for the simulation was similar to that for subjects in Study  9766-CL- 0046, with subjects 
weighing < 40 mg administered 10 mg/kg dose and subjects > 40 kg getting adult dose of 
372mg.
The figure shown below compares pediatric exposures ag ainst exposures from Study  
9766 -CL-0104 (SECURE), a successful phase 3 study  in adults with IA, in which subjects 
received isavuconazonium sulfate via both intravenous and oral routes of administration and 
against data from Stud y 9766 -CL-0103 (VITAL), a successful phase 3 adult study in subjects 
with I M and other rare invasive fungal infections, in which subjects received 
isavuconazonium sulfate via oral route of administration. The dosage regimen in both adult 
studies was similar.
Red dots are the means. Dashed orange line is the lowest targeted value (25thpercentile, with 
AUC ssof 60 mg*hr/L) based on exposures from SECURE study .
From the figure, it can be seen that exposure predicted for pediatric subjects across all ranges 
for intravenous and for 12 to < 18 y ears of age for oral route of administration are within the 
efficacio us range that was observed in adult studies.
Anisavuconazonium sulfate dose of 10 mg/kg forallagegroups weighing > 37 kgandthe
adult dose for pediatric subjects weighing > 40 kg provide mean exposures that were similar 
to and/or above the 372 mg adult dose and significantly  below the 1116 mg dose group,

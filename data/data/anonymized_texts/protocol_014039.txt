PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  2b 
INDICATION   Post-menopausal vasomotor symptoms 
STUDY DESIGN This is a multi-centre, multi-country, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study. The study will have a single-blind placebo run-in period and will be adaptive with respect to the number of subjects recruited into each dose group.  
Four doses of NT-814 (40 mg once a day, 80 mg once a 
day, 120 mg once a day and 160 mg once a day) will be 
investigated and compared to placebo, in five parallel 
groups. All subjects will receive placebo for the last 2 weeks of the screening/baseline period , after which 
subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomised into the study.  Subjects will initially be randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to each of the treatment groups, with the randomisation ratio subject to change in response to emerging efficacy and safety data. Regardless of any changes to the randomisation ratio,  subjects will continue to receive the dose regimen they were randomised to for the full 12-week treatment period.

 approximately 19 weeks, comprising a screening & 
baseline period (3 weeks), 12 weeks of double-blind treatment and then a final follow up visit, 4 weeks after the end of the treatment peri od. There will be a total of 
8 visits whilst participating in the study.  
Subjects who provide informed consent will be 
screened for participation in the study. After giving informed consent, but before Screening Visit 2 (i.e. before starting the placebo run-in period), subjects will be withdrawn from prohibited concomitant medications. 
At the first visit (Screening Visit 1), they will be 
provided with a paper diary, which they will be asked to complete once daily (prior to retiring to bed) for 7 days, recording their recall of the total number of hot flushes (also known as hot flashes) over the previous 24 hours, and the severity of each of those hot flushes. At the second visit (Screening Visit 2), the investigator or designee will review the paper diary to determine if the subject can continue in the st udy. To continue, subjects 
must have completed the paper diary for at least 6 days and recorded an average of at least 8 moderate or severe hot flushes per day over the last 5 days that the paper diary was completed. 
Subjects who continue to satisfy all the initial selection 
criteria at Screening Visit 2 will commence placebo 
treatment on a single-blind (s ubject only) basis and be 
provided with an electronic diary (eDiary) which they will be asked to complete twice a day for 14 (+2) days 
during the remaining screening/baseline period. The eDiary will record the subject’s recall of the number of hot flushes during the day (recorded just prior to retiring to bed) and overnight (recorded on wakening). The severity of each hot flush will also be recorded. To proceed to randomisation, th e subject will be required 
to have completed the eDiary for at least 9 days and to have recorded an average of at least 7 moderate or severe hot flushes per day ove r the last 7 days that the 
eDiary was completed. 
At the baseline visit (Day 1), subjects who comply with 
all selection criteria will be enrolled into the 12-week double-blind portion of the study and be randomised to one of the NT-814 doses or placebo. Subjects who do not meet the eDiary criteria will not continue into the study (they will be screen failures).

 Randomised subjects will undergo further clinic visits 
at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 (end of treatment visit) and Week 16 (end of study) with regular assessments of complian ce with study medication, 
compliance with the eDiary completion as well as assessments of concomitant medications, mental well-being, quality of life (QoL), sleep, and safety.  
A treatment kit will be dispensed at Screening Visit 2 
(for the placebo run-in), the Baseline Visit, Week 4 and Week 8. A final follow-up safety assessment will be performed at Week 16, 4-weeks after stopping study medication. 
Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis for all subjects at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION  Oral 
DURATION/FREQUENCY OF TREATMENT  Once daily dosing in the evening for 12 weeks.  All subjects will also receive placebo capsules for the last 2 weeks of the screening/baseline period.  
PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE For the efficacy objectives of the study, assuming a 
common standard deviati on (SD) of 4.4, N=27 per 
treatment group has ~95% pow er (alpha=0.05 2-sided) 
via trend test across all doses including placebo if the true underlying dose response is non-decreasing from a reduction of 4 hot flushes on placebo up to 8 on the highest dose of NT-814.   N=33 per treatment group is required for 95% power for pairwise comparison of the highest dose to placebo under these same assumptions. Hence, a total of 150 comple ted subjects (30 x 5) was 
used for the simulations of adaptive design.  The actual sample size will be determined by the adaptive dose-finding design algorithm outcomes. In addition, the initial actual sample size is increased by 10% to allow for subjects who withdraw prematurely and so the initial sample size will be 165 subjects. 
 The sample size allows for 95% power since each of the four co-primary endpoints are required to demonstrate statistical significance to yield a firm conclusion of beneficial treatment effect on hot flushes.  Conservatively, assuming independence among the four endpoints, this would yield approximately 81% power overall for achieving statistical significance for each of

 the four endpoints.  Thus, ove rall power for the trial is 
estimated to be at least 81%; the actual power depends 
on the unknown magnitudes of correlations among the co-primary endpoints.   
STATISTICAL METHODS The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who 
receive at least one dose of double-blind study drug irrespective of treatment received. Subjects will be analysed according to treatment received. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug, irrespective of treatment received, and have a at least 7 days’ worth of post-treatment assessments (i.e. requirement for the primary efficacy endpoint). Subjects will be analysed according to randomised treatment. This is the primary efficacy analysis set for the study. The Per Protocol analysis set consists of all subjects in the FAS excluding those identified as having relevant protocol deviat ions. The Exposure-Response 
Set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug and for whom the PK data are considered sufficient.  All statistical hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be two sided, using a type I error rate of 0.05. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be used for this Phase 2 study.   The co-primary endpoints are the change from baseline in the mean daily frequencie s of moderate and severe 
hot flushes in the 7 days before the Week 4 and Week 12 visits, and the mean severi ty of moderate and severe 
hot flushes in the 7 days before the Week 4 and Week 12 visits. The baseline assessment will be the last 7 days of the baseline eDiary completion period. Absolute and changes from baseline in the mean daily frequencies and average hot flush severity will be summarised by treatment group. The change from baseline endpoint will be analysed by mixed model repeated measures.  Pairwise statistical comparisons are planned for each NT-814 dose group (40 mg, 80 mg, 
120 mg and 160 mg) versus placebo, presenting the 
adjusted mean treatment difference with its corresponding 95% confidence interval. Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analysed in a similar fashion, except that the proportion of responders, defined as a reduction of >=50% points and >=80% points on the weekly average frequency of hot flushes will be analysed by logistic regression.

The safety analysis set will be used for all presentations of safety endpoints. No statis tical testing will be used to 
compare treatment groups for different safety endpoints. Safety data will be summarised descriptively 
for each treatment group.   All adverse events will be  coded using the current 
version of the Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be presented within summary presentations, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC), preferred term and treatment group.   Blood samples for assay of NT-814 plasma concentrations are collected periodically. The plasma NT-814 concentrations will be  listed by visit. Further 
details of the analysis of PK data will be described in an Exposure-Response Data Analysis Plan and exposure-response data will be report ed in a separate report.

 5. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
5.1 NT-814 
Prior to its acquisition, initially by NeRRe Therap eutics Ltd (NeRRe), and then subsequently by 
KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd (KaNDy), NT-814’ s laboratory code name was GSK1144814. The 
GSK laboratory code may be used in this and ot her trial related document when referring to the 
studies conducted by GSK, but NT-814 is used  for all development activities conducted by 
NeRRe as Sponsor. NT-814 is be ing developed in a number of i ndications in women’s health, 
including the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms. 
KaNDy has delegated all regulatory and quality Sponsor res ponsibilities to NeRRe.  
5.1.1 Pharmacology 
In vitro  binding and functional studies have demonstr ated that NT-814 is a potent and selective 
antagonist of both human neurokinin-1 (NK 1) and NK 3 tachykinin receptors.  NT-814 was active 
in pharmacodynamic models for the NK 1 receptor (the gerbil foot tapping test) and NK 3 receptor 
(wet dog shaking behaviour in guinea pigs); bo th in a dose dependent manner.  NT-814 also 
shows non-sedating anxiolytic-like properties in the human threat test in the marmoset.   
The brain penetrant proper ties of NT-814 were conf irmed in the gerbil and guinea pig in which 
receptor occupancy (RO) in the brain was demonstrated at both the NK 1 and NK 3 receptors in a 
dose- and concentration-dependent manner; the RO at both re ceptors was sustained for extended 
periods post-dose. In a positron emission tomogr aphy (PET) study in baboons, NT-814 achieved 
high NK 1 RO at modest plasma concentrations. Thes e studies demonstrated that NT-814 is an 
orally active antagonist of brain NK 1 and NK 3 receptors in vivo .  
NT-814 was shown to be >100-fold selective for the human NK 3 receptor and >300-fold for the 
human NK 1 receptor, in comparison to 53 other non-tachykinin receptors, ion channels, enzymes 
and transporters. There were no clinically relevant findings in respiratory or neurobehavioral safety pharmacology 
studies at doses up to 100 mg/kg or in a cardiova scular study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up 
to 60 mg/kg. NT-814 did not inhibit the human ether-a-go-go (hERG) tail current. 
5.1.2 Pre-clinical Safety 
A full package of pre-clinical safety studies ap propriate to the stage of development has been 
completed with NT-814.  This includes single dose studies in marmoset and monkey (up to 
1000 mg/kg) and repeat dose studies of up to 13-weeks in rat (up to 100 mg/kg/day) and cynomolgus monkey (up to 40 mg/kg/day). The safety profile was acc eptable and supported 
clinical evaluation with appropriate monitoring.  
Genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies  have also been undertaken. NT-814 was not 
genotoxic and there was no evidence of embryo fetal toxicity in the rat at doses up to

 100 mg/kg/day or in the rabbit at doses up to 140 mg/kg/day. A signal with respect to potential 
phototoxicity warrants monitoring of subj ects for skin reactions to sunlight.  
5.1.3 Clinical Experience 
To date, five clinical studies in healthy volunteers have been completed with single total daily doses up to 250 mg and repeat doses up to 200 mg total daily dose for 28 days. These studies comprise a single dose escalation pharmacokinetic  (PK) and safety study incorporating an 
assessment of NK
1 RO using PET imaging (Study MNK111321), a repeat-dose PK and safety 
study with a drug interaction assessment and NK 1 RO evaluation (MNK111587), a single-dose 
study assessing the PK and effect of food on a tablet formulation (MNK112891), a single dose 
study assessing whether the psychomotor and cognitive effects of alcohol are exacerbated by NT-
814 (MNK113476) and a relative bi oavailability and food effe ct study (814-1-01).  
Thirty-seven female and 89 male healthy volunt eers received NT-814 in these studies. NT-814 
was found to have a good pharmac okinetic profile after both single  and repeat doses. The PK was 
characterized by rapid absorption, modest accumu lation ratios and approxima tely linear increases 
in exposure with increasing dose. The terminal elimination half-life was estimated to be in the 
range ~15-20 hours and steady state was achieved  within 7 days. NT-814 was well tolerated 
throughout the dose range. The only potential safety  signal identified was a possible effect on 
cardiac rhythm, although review of  the individual arrhythmias reported suggested that they were 
likely to be coincidental. Non-serious AEs consid ered possibly related to treatment with NT-814 
are headache, diarrhoea and somnolence. 
Seventy-six post-menopausa l female subjects experiencing tr oublesome hot flushes participated 
in a 14 day repeat dose study which assessed the safety, efficacy and PK of NT-814 in this 
indication (Study RELENT-1). Eighteen subject s received placebo and 56 received NT-814 at 
doses ranging from 50 mg to 300 mg once daily.  All doses were well to lerated, and no safety 
concerns were identified. Extensive Holter monitoring did not identify any treatment effect on 
cardiac rhythm. There was clear evidence of a beneficial effect on post-menopausal symptoms, 
with clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements on both daytime hot flush 
frequency and severity and night-time awakening at the higher doses (150 and 300 mg) compared 
to placebo.  
The PK profile in post-menopausal  females was very similar to th at observed in younger male 
volunteers. However, the hard gel capsule formulati on used in the study resulted a high degree of 
within and between subject variability in exposure. The variability was generally greater at the 
higher doses, with the coefficients of variation (CV%) approaching 150% for some parameters.  In addition to the high variability, the mean ex posures observed at doses up to 150 mg were not 
as great as those expected based on previous studies.  Consequently, a new formulation was 
developed in which NT-814 was dissolved in a liqui d lipid vehicle and encapsulated in a soft gel 
capsule. The kinetics of this soft gel formulation were evaluated in a relative bioavailability study and it was found to have acceptable vari ability (CV% <45%) and good exposures.  
Administration of the soft-gel capsule with f ood was found in this study to reduce the maximum

Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page 22 of 100 
21 May 2019 plasma concentration (C max) of NT-814 quite significantly (by around 70%) but with only a 
modest reduction (~9%) on overall ex posure. This blunting of the C max dose not result in lower 
concentrations at later time points and the overall exposure is anticipated to be sufficient for 
efficacy in both the fed and fasted states. 
This soft gel formulation is the current devel opment form of NT-814 and will be used in this 
study.  
Further information on the pre-clinical and clin ical studies undertaken with NT-814 can be found 
in the current version of the Investigators Brochure (IB). 
5.2 Hot flushes in post-menopausal women and rationale for this study 
Over the coming decades, it is estimated that more than 1 billion women worldwide will be older 
than 50 years. Up to 75% of these women will experience adverse symptoms related to 
menopausal transition, particularly  hot flushes (also called flashe s) vasomotor symptoms, sleep 
disturbances and adverse mood effects that have such a negative impact upon patient daily 
activities and quality of life1,2,3. Hot flushes are transient but recurrent episodes of flushing, 
perspiration and intense heat sensation that  are one of the most common, bothersome and 
distressing symptoms felt by women during th e transition to menopause (peri-menopause) and 
post-menopause periods4. They are the leading cause for seeking medical attention during this 
particular phase of a woman’s life, particularly amongst those experiencing the severest 
symptoms5,6.  The hot flushes may also be associated with difficulty in sleeping7, 8 worsen 
depressive symptoms and signal the onset or relapse of a major depressive episode9,10. When hot 
flushes occur at night they are known as night sweats and can caus e insomnia and fatigue11,12. 
Hot flushes can vary in frequency, with some women experiencing episodes many times a day, 
and can last up to 10 years after the last menses13,14. Current treatment options are limited and 
include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which is effective in many women but associated 
with an increased risk of hormone-dependent can cers, thrombotic risk and cardiovascular adverse 
effects15. HRT can also take several months to im prove hot flush symptoms, especially when 
used at lower doses, and has limited effects on sleep disturbance16,17. These and other limitations 
preclude its use in many women. A low dose of the anti-depressant paroxetine is licensed for use in some countries but has limited efficacy and a ra nge of safety and tole rability concerns that 
prevent its widespread usage especially  in the breast cancer survivor population. 
Emerging data show that hot flushes may be trea ted by targeting the neur oendocrine factors that 
trigger the symptoms
18. The menopause is characterized by de creased oestradiol levels due to 
ovarian failure, and a resultant increase in go nadotropin releasing horm one (GnRH) secretion 
from the hypothalamus leading to high gonadotropin (luteinising hormone [LH] and follicle stimulating hormone) concentrations.  A link between initiation of the LH pulse and hot flushes 
has been reported
19. However, a number of studies invol ving oestrogen administration and 
withdrawal in patients who do not have elevated LH have shown they still experience hot 
flushes20,21,22, as do patients with Kallman’s syndrome who lack hypothalamic GnRH neurons, 
and in whom oestrogen withdrawal will trigger hot flush es23. These findings show that hot

Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page 23 of 100 
21 May 2019 flushes can occur even in the absence of pulsatile GnRH or LH release, implicating the 
involvement of upstream processes res ponsible for GnRH synthesis. The h ypothalamic 
infundibular (arcuate) nucleus is a group of sex steroid-res ponsive neurons that co-express 
kisspeptin, dynorphin as well as NKB; the so-called ‘KNDy’ neuron s24. Morphologic studies 
have shown that KNDy neurons from postmenopausal women are hypertrophied25 and this 
hypertrophy is accompanied by elevated NKB, kisspeptin and Substance P gene expression; but 
not dynorphi n25-27.  These expression changes are a conseque nce of oestrogen withdrawal as they 
can be induced by oophorectomy and reversed  by estrogen replacement in cynomolgus 
monkeys28-30.    
KNDy neurons, expressing NK 3 receptors, branch extensively within the arcuate nucleus and are 
also linked to the medial preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus which has been identified as the 
control center for thermoregulation and which is  responsive to both oestrogen and ambient 
temperatur e31. Support for the hypothesis that KNDy neurons have a thermoregulatory role and 
are involved in hot flush generation has been described in animal studies32.  
It is hypothesised that in the menopausal state th e KNDy neurons are in a st ate of hyperactivation 
(consistent with the observed hypertrophy) which could disrupt baseline thermoregulation and trigger hot flushe s
31. Therefore, modulation of the KNDy ne urons could be a viable therapeutic 
approach to controlling hot flushes. Clinical  evidence supporting the hypothesis comes from a 
study in healthy women in which it was shown th at intravenous infusion of NKB (endogenous 
ligand that binds the NK 3 receptor) acutely induces hot  flushes in healthy wome n33. Furthermore, 
two recently completed proof of concept studies with NK 3 receptor antagonists have provided 
direct evidence that NK 3 receptor blockade can reduce the number and severity of hot flushe s34,35. 
In a 12-week study in post-menopausal women, twice daily dosing with the NK 3 antagonist 
fezolinetant resulted in a sustained reduction in the frequency (-93% vs -54% for placebo) and severity (-70% vs -23%) of hot flushes (HF). The maximum improvements were apparent within 
2 weeks of the start of treatment. In a 4-week study with the NK
3 antagonist MLE4901, the 
reduction in HF frequency was 78.4% compar ed to a reduction of 45.6% with placebo.  
A role for SP and NK 1 receptors in the control of post-me nopausal and other reproductive system 
disorders is supported by a body of evid ence that indicates that the SP/NK 1 receptor system 
modulates KNDy neurons in unison with the NKB/NK 3 system. In adult male and/or 
ovariectomised female rodents, central infusion of specific NK 1 receptor agonists induces 
gonadotropin releas e36,37. In the mouse this response can be shown to be modulated by kisspeptin 
as knockout mice (Kiss1r-/-) fail to respond to the NK 1 agonis t36. Expression of the gene 
encoding for SP (Tacr1) can be inhibited by circulating estradiol in mice and ~50% of 
Kiss1 positive neurons also expressed the Tacr1 gene. In goats, however, although data suggests 
that SP (along with NKA and NKB) has a s timulatory effect on the GnRH pulse-generator 
and LH release, it only does so at high doses i ndicating that NKB in this species is the pivotal 
effector molecul e38. Although there is evidence suggesting that SP does not play a key role in 
the non-human primate GnRH pulse generato r39, SP immunoreactivity frequently co-localises 
with kisspeptin and NKB in the human infundibular regio n40. Further, hypertrophy and 
increased gene expression of neurons containing SP messenge r ribonucleic acid and SP+ immunoreactive nerves has been

21 May 2019 demonstrated in humans in the hypothalami of postmenopausal women, with significantly more 
SP+ immunoreactive neurons than in age-matched men41.  
In addition to a central role in flushing, NK 1 receptors have been shown to be located in nerves 
associated with blood vessels in human skin and infusion of SP resu lts in vasodilatation42 and the 
same remote flushing of the face and neck  characteristic of post-menopausal hot flushes 42,43. 
As well as a role in improving vasomotor symptoms, NK 1 receptor antagonists have proven to be 
effective in Phase 2 studies in mood and primary insomnia44,45,46,47 it is possible that the mood 
and sleep comorbidities associated with menopausal  hot flushes could also be addressed with a 
molecule that has NK 1 receptor antagonist properties. 
Taken together this evidence supports the hypothesis that the dual NK 1,3 receptor antagonism that 
NT-814 offers could be an effective treatment fo r vasomotor symptoms in the menopausal patient 
population as well as addressing important comorbidities. 
5.3 Rationale for endpoints 
There is no uniform clinical profile of hot fl ushes and variations are observed in terms of 
frequency, severity, duration, and course. Patients’ perception of a hot flush and their impact on 
quality of life (QoL), sleep and psychosomatic reactions differ, and each is vulnerable to 
confounders, such as current mood, environmental fact ors or stress. It is, th erefore, important to 
use a variety of assessment tools in clinical studies of hot flushes.  
The primary efficacy assessment in this study will be based on subject reported assessments of 
hot flush frequency and severity. These will be recorded daily in an electronic diary (eDiary) throughout the study. Hot flush is a subjective experience for the subject and so its occurrence 
and intensity can only be assessed by the subject.  The assessment will be based on the subject’s 
recollection of the number and severity of hot flushes experienced twice daily; once in the 
evening on retiring to bed and once in the morning on waking. The morning assessment also enables the number of times the subject awoke at night to be recorded. These assessments are routinely employed in clinical studies in hot flush and their use is supported by recommendations 
from experts in the field
48 and regulatory authoritie s49.  
The impact on sleep will be measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index which is a validated questionnaire that evaluate s a number of dimensions of sleep
50. Insomnia, a common 
symptom of the menopause, will be assessed using the specific Insomnia Severity Index assessment. The broader impact of menopausal sy mptoms on subjects’ hea lth and well-being will 
be evaluated using the Menopause Specific Quality of Life Scale (MenQOL) which is a quality of 
life instrument designed speci fically for use in the menopaus e and is used frequently in 
menopause clinical research
51. In addition, the Hot Flash Re lated Daily Interference Scale 
(HFRDIS) will be used to evaluate interference with daily functioning. This is a validated 
instrument that has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of pharmacological interventions on 
menopause symptoms52,53.The effect of NT-814 on symptoms of depression will be assessed

 using version II of the Beck Depression Inventor y. This is a widely used and validated self-
reported tool for assessing both the psycholog ical and physical symptoms of depression54. 
The PK exposure-response relationship will be established through the correlation of plasma NT-
814 concentrations derived from sparse sampling, w ith appropriate clinical  efficacy endpoints. 
Sparse sampling is a well-estab lished method of collecting PK da ta that avoids the need for 
multiple blood draws and ex tended clinic visits.  
The safety of NT-814 will be assessed using standard  measures of safety appropriate for the stage 
of development (adverse events, routine safety la boratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram 
(ECG)). Although the effect is expected to  be modest in the post-menopausal population, NK 3 
receptor blockade may result in a reduction in circ ulating oestrogen concentrations and so safety 
assessments will, additiona lly, include an assessment of bone  turnover. No adverse effects are 
anticipated but because NT-814 acts centrally in the nervous system its safety  related to suicidal 
ideation will, in accordance with regulatory expectations, be assessed using the electronic version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Score.   
The assessment of safety for hor monal menopause therapies typica lly includes evaluation of the 
endometrium by trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVU) a nd, if indicated, endometrial biopsy. Since NK 
receptor blockade will, if anything, reduce horm onal drive to the endometrium these invasive 
evaluations are not warranted routinely for all subjects. However, any subject experiencing 
uterine bleeding (including spotting) during th e study will undergo TVU and biopsy if indicated.

 The Investigator may withdraw subjects from the study or may discontinue study treatment at any 
time. 
Early withdrawal or early discontinuation from th e IMP of any subject who has given informed 
consent to participate will be recorded including the reason for withdrawal. The primary reason 
will be selected from the following standard categories of early discontinuations or withdrawals: 
x Failed to meet randomisation criteria  
x Adverse Event (AE) : Clinical events occurred, or laboratory results are reported, that in 
the medical judgment of the investigator are grounds for discontinuation from 
participation in the best interests of the subject 
x Withdrawal of Consent : The subject desired to withdraw from further participation in the 
study. The subject is not obliged to provide any reason for withdrawal of consent, but 
where a reason is given this will be recorded on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) 
x Protocol Violation : The subject failed to adhere to the protocol requirements, and, in the 
opinion of the investigator, this failure to comply increased the risk to the subject to an unacceptable level 
x Lost to Follow-Up : The subject stopped coming for visits and study personnel were 
unable to contact the subject. 
x Pregnancy : Any subject becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from 
dosing.  
x Other:  The subject was terminated for a reason other than those listed above 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from pa rticipation in the study should attend an Early 
Termination visit at which the procedures scheduled for the final Follow Up visit will be undertaken. If the subject withdraws due to an AE, the event should be followed until resolution 
or care is transferred to the subject’s usual physician. 
Subjects who are withdrawn after ra ndomisation will not be replaced.  
In some circumstances, the Investigator may discontinue study treatment without the need to 
withdraw the subject from participation in th e study. When subjects permanently discontinue 
IMP, effort should be made to continue followi ng the subject through to the end of scheduled 
visits for safety and to obtain efficacy assessments that can be assigned to the originally 
randomised treatment. 
7.5 Criteria for Stopping the Study 
The Sponsor may terminate the study for safe ty or administrative reasons at any time.

 8.6 Study design 
This is a multi-centre, multi-country, double-b lind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase 2b 
study. The study will have a single-blind (subjects only) placebo run-in period and will be 
adaptive with respect to the number of subjects recruited into each dose group. 
Subjects will be provided the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and Informed Consent Form 
(ICF) for their prior review. Informed consent to participation in the study will be obtained for all 
subjects before any study rela ted procedures are performed.

once per day NT-814, 120 mg once per day NT-814, 160 mg once per day NT-814 and placebo 
once per day. See Figure 1 for study design schematic. After 30 subjects have been randomised 
and completed all assessments through the Week 4 visit the emerging efficacy and safety data 
will be reviewed by the DRC and the first determ ination made as to whether randomization to all 
dose groups should be continued. Further inter im reviews may be conducted after 60, 90, 120 and 
150 subjects have completed the Week-4 assessmen ts. Once a subject has been allocated to a 
dose/treatment group they will continue to receive the same dose/treatment throughout the study. 
Subjects will continue to be allocated to placebo treatment throughout the study. Further details of the DRC reviews are provided in Section 11.2 and in the DRC Charter.

 8.6.1 Justification for Study Design 
The study is a dose-range finding study, with assessment of dose-response based on both efficacy 
and safety. A four-fold range of doses will be evaluated which broadly encompasses the 
equivalent exposures to those evaluated in th e RELENT-1 study that were associated with 
efficacy (See Section  5.1.3) .  
The study will have an adaptive design component in which the number of subjects randomised to each treatment group is modified on the basis of emerging safety and efficacy data. This design 
enables a broad range of doses to be evaluated in the first instance, but with the ability to reduce the number of doses of NT-814 being evaluated if  this emerging data shows that there is no 
advantage in continuing to evaluate them. The interim reviews also enable the sample size (per treatment group) to be assessed on an ongoing basis and to be increased if the estimates of treatment effect and variability used to derive the sample size originally prove to be incorrect. These adaptive features ensure that the study has the greatest probability of success while making efficient use of the trial population.  
The study will be placebo controlled to minimise  assessment bias. Placebo is considered an 
acceptable reference group for studies in PM VMS as the disorder, whilst uncomfortable and 
disruptive to the affected individual, is not life- threatening or limiting, and studies are typically of 
limited duration. Experience from multiple studies in  women with VMS has shown that a placebo 
response of up to 60% can be expected
48 and so even subjects allocat ed to placebo should expect 
to receive some benefit from study participation. The use of placebo is also recommended by 
both the United States FDA and EU CHMP disease-specific guidelines49,55.   
Although the interim analyses used to make  the adaptive randomisation decisions will be 
reviewed by an unblinded Data Review Committee (DRC), the Sponsor and CRO study 
operational team will remain fully blinded throughout the study. The subjects and investigative site staff will also be blinded throughout the rando mised phase of the trial and thus the study will 
be triple blind to reduce assessment bias. All subjects will receive  placebo on a single blind basis 
during the last 2-weeks of the baseline period to enable baseline assessments to be recorded under similar conditions to those used during the randomis ed phase of the study. This run-in period, 
which has been used in similar trials previously
56, also allows participants to familiarise 
themselves with the requirements and systems used in the study before the start of the randomised treatment phase. 
The study will comprise a 2-week baseline peri od followed by a 12-week treatment period. The 
2-week baseline period allows subjects one week to become familiar with eDiary completion 
before the baseline efficacy assessments are made during the second week. Studies with other NK antagonists have demonstrated that maximum efficacy is achieved within a matter of weeks
34,35, 
and, in the case of fezolinetant, is sustained for at least 12-weeks. The disease-specific guidelines 
from both the FDA and CHMP recommend studies of 12-weeks duration to demonstrate 
maintenance of effec t49,55.  
8.6.2 Duration of Subject Participation 
Subjects will participate in the study for a total of approximately 19 weeks, comprising a formal 
screening and baseline period (3 weeks), 12 week s of double-blind treatme nt and then a final

 follow-up visit 4 weeks after the end of the trea tment period. There will be  a total of 8 visits 
whilst participating in the study. 
8.6.3 Screening Visit 1 
Informed consent will be obtained prior to any screening procedures being performed. Consent 
can be obtained prior to Screening Visit 1 or at the actual visit.  
The visit will include the following assessments to determine the subject’s initial eligibility for 
inclusion into the study: 
x Recording of the subject’s medical history, and prior and concomitant medication use, in 
particular, hormonal therapie s and drugs used to manage menopausal symptoms  
Subjects will be provided with, and trained on the use of, a paper diary to be completed once a 
day for 7 days. Each evening (before retiring to bed), subjects will record in the diary their recall 
of the total number of hot flushes of each se verity experienced over the previous 24 hours.  
The minimum time between Screening Visits 1 and 2 is 6 days, to enable at least 6 days of paper diary data to be completed. If necessary, the time  period between Screening Visits 1 and 2 can be 
extended to enable prohibited concomitant medications to be washed-out. 
8.6.4 Screening Visit 2 
Subjects will return to the clinic for Screening Visit 2, during which the investigator or designee 
will review the paper diary to determine if the subject can continue in the study. To continue, subjects must have completed the paper diary for at  least 6 days and have recorded an average of 
at least 8 moderate or severe hot flushes per day over the last 5 days that the paper diary was 
completed.  
Subjects who do not  record an average of at least 8 m oderate or severe hot flushes per day 
(including night-time) over the last 5 days that the paper diary was completed, or who are not 
compliant with diary completion will be Screen Failures and will not be able to continue into the 
study. Limited data will be collected for subjects who withdraw from the study after providing informed consent but prior to randomis ation onto the study (Screen Failures). 
If the diary compliance and hot flush criteria are satisfied, the following assessments will be 
performed to further determine the subject’s eligibility for inclusion into the study: 
x Review of other inclus ion/exclusion criteria 
x Full physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs 
x Blood sampling for haematology and clinical ch emistry, and urine sample collection for 
urinalysis and urine pregnancy test  
x Review for adverse events and ch anges in concomitant medications

 Subjects who continue to satisfy selection criteria will be provided with, and trained on the use 
of, an eDiary to be completed twice a day, starting the evening of Screening Visit 2 and 
continuing until they return to the site for the Ba seline visit. Each evening, subjects will record in 
the diary the total number of hot flushes of each severity experienced that day since waking. Each 
morning upon waking, subjects will record the number  of times they woke up in the night and the 
total number of hot flushes of each se verity experienced during the night. 
At Screening Visit 2, subjects will commence placebo treatment. Their first dose of placebo will be taken in the clinic and all subsequent doses at home once a day in the evening (starting the following day) up until the day before the Baseline visit. Subjects will be provided with a medication kit containing sufficient placebo capsules for a 2-week period (plus 2 days overage).  
This placebo-run in period will be single-blind in de sign, in that whilst the investigator and clinic 
staff will know that placebo is being provided, subjects must remain blinded, and should be 
merely be informed that they are being given study medication. 
8.6.5 Baseline (Day 1) 
Subjects will return to the clinic for the Baseline visit at which compliance with eDiary 
completion and hot flush data will be reviewed. Subjects who comply with all other selection criteria, who have completed the diary for at least 9 days, and who have recorded an average of at 
least 7 moderate or severe hot flushes per day (including night-time) over the last 7 days that the 
eDiary was completed may enter the 12-week  double-blind portion of the study and be 
randomised to one of 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg or 1 60 mg NT-814 or placebo treatments. The mean 
number of hot flushes will be cal culated programmatically by th e eDiary vendor and the outcome 
made available to the site.  
Subjects who do not  record an average of at least 7 m oderate or severe hot flushes per day 
(including night-time) over the last 7 days that the eDiary was completed, or who are not 
compliant with eDiary completion will be deemed Screen Failures and will not be able to continue into the study. Limited data will be collected for subjects who withdraw from the study after providing informed consent but prior to randomisation onto the study (Screen Failures). 
The Baseline visit will be Day 1. Prior to dosing on Day 1, the following assessments will be completed:  
x Review of inclusion/exclusion cr iteria, including eDiary data 
x Symptom directed physical examination 
x Vital signs ( after resting for ≥ 5 mins , see Section  10.3.8)  
x 12-lead ECG  
x Blood samples for clinical chemistry, haem atology and plasma bone turnover markers 
x Urine sample for urinalysis

 x Subjects will be asked to complete the MenQoL-I, HFRDIS, Pittsburg Sleep Quality 
Index, Insomnia Severity Index, electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory II. 
x Review for adverse events and ch anges in concomitant medications 
Eligible subjects will be randomised on Day 1 to NT-814 or placebo. Randomisation will be 
performed centrally via an interactive web response system (IWRS). 
Subjects will be given their first dose of IMP in the clinic and take all subsequent doses at home 
once a day in the evening (starting the following day) for a total of 12 weeks. At the baseline 
visit, subjects will be provided with IMP sufficient for the next 4 weeks. 
Subjects will continue to comple te the eDiary twice a day throughout the study until the Final 
Follow-up visit at Week 16. 8.6.6 Interim visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) 
During the double-blind treatment phase, subjects will return to the clinic for interim assessments 
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Weeks 2 and 4 should be sche duled within ±3 days of the target visit day 
and Weeks 8 and 12 within ±4 days of the target visit day. The visit at Week 12 should be 
conducted at a similar time of day to  the baseline visit to reduce di urnal variation in the plasma 
bone turnover markers. 
At the start of each visit a blood sample will be taken for determination of  plasma levels of NT-
814. At the same time, if required per the Study Schedule, blood samples for safety laboratory 
assessments and plasma bone tur nover markers will be taken. Subj ects will be asked to provide 
the time they took their dose of study medication on the previous day and this will be recorded on 
the eCRF.  
Study medication compliance will be  reviewed at all visits and a new supply of study medication 
(sufficient for the next 4 weeks) will be provided at Weeks 4 and 8. Diary completion compliance 
will also be reviewed, and training/re-training provided as necessary.  
At each visit the following assessments will be completed: 
x Vital signs (after resting for ≥ 5 mins, see  Section  10.3.8)  
x 12-lead ECG  
x Blood samples for hematology (Weeks 2, 4 and 12 ), clinical chemistry (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 
12), pharmacokinetic analysis (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12) and plasma bone turnover markers 
(Week 12 only) 
x Urine samples for urinalysis (weeks 2, 4 and 12)

x Review for adverse events and ch anges in concomitant medications 
At Week 12, subjects may be re-started on any prohibited medications th at are permitted after 
the end of treatment (see Appendix A). 
8.6.7 Final Follow-up / Early Termination visit 
Subjects will return to the clinic for the final study visit 4-weeks (+5 days) after the end of 
treatment. The visit should be c onducted at a similar time of day to  the baseline visit to reduce 
diurnal variation in the pl asma bone turnover markers. 
The same procedures will also be undertaken if  a subject withdraws from the study early.  
The eDiary will be collected and the following assessments completed:  
x Symptom directed physical examination 
x Vital signs (after resting for ≥ 5 mins per Section  10.3.8)

medications at this time. 
9. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT AND ADMINISTRATION 
9.1 Selection of doses in the study 
Subjects will initially be randomised to one of  four NT-814 dose regimens and placebo. The use 
of four active doses and placebo will enable an adequate range of doses and exposures and 
several dose-response scenar ios to be evaluated. 
Product:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 An adaptive design will be used to maximise the efficiency of the study through discontinuation 
or reduction in the number of subjects randomis ed to doses that are found, on the basis of 
emerging data, to be either insufficiently effective or no more effective than an adjacent lower dose. Doses may also be discontinued for safe ty reasons and the randomisation ratio may be 
adjusted in favour of one or more doses w ithout necessarily discon tinuing other doses.  
Two reference points have been used to set the dose s in the current study. The first is the efficacy 
findings in the RELENT-1 proof of concept study. Ideally, the pattern of response with respect to 
dose will be replicated in the current study but  the treatment groups in RELENT-1 were small 
and interpretation of the findings was complicated by the variable pharmacokinetics of the hard 
gel capsule formulation used in that study. A 150 mg dose of NT-814 was found to be maximally 
effective with no greater efficacy observed at the higher dose of 300 mg. A dose of 100 mg was effective in some endpoints but was clearly sub-optimal in comparison to the 150 mg dose. A dose of 50 mg was ineffective. The RELENT-1 study sets the target exposures for future studies.

300 mg 25,874 14,822 No additional benefit over 150 mg 
AUC 0-last,ss  = Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to last measurable time-point at steady state 
Since the hard gel capsule formulation used in RELENT-1 had unacceptable variability in 
kinetics, an optimised soft-gel capsule formulation has been developed for use in this and future studies. A relative bioavailability (RBA) stud y has been conducted which confirmed an 
acceptable level of variability and showed that, compared to the exposures seen in RELENT-1 
with the hard gel capsule formulation, the soft-gel  results in approximately twice the exposure on 
a “per mg” basis (Table 9-2) . These data are the second reference point for setting the doses in 
the current study.

A 40 mg soft-gel capsule has been developed and so all doses in the current study will be a 
multiple of 40 mg. The exposure after a single 150 mg dose in RELENT-1 is approximately 3-
fold higher than the exposure after a single 25 mg dose of the soft gel capsule. Thus, an 
equivalent dose in the soft gel capsule is ~80 mg. In all previous clinical evaluations the kinetics of NT-814 have been found to be either linear or very close to linear with respect to dose and so

 linearity is also assumed when setting the doses for the current study. Assuming a ‘pivot’ dose of 
80 mg, dose-linearity across the dose range and an  accumulation ratio of 1.7 (to convert single 
dose data to steady state conditions), the estimated median AUCs at steady state at the four doses planned will be as shown in  Table 9-3.  
Table 9-3 Estimated NT-814 exposures at steady state

40 mg 2,390 2,740 3,150 
80 mg 4,780 5,500 6,310 
120 mg 6,760 8,240 9,460 
160 mg 9,580 10,990 13,350 
AUC 0-24 = Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours, CI = confidence interval  
These four doses enable a range of exposures to  be evaluated that encompass the full range of 
effectiveness responses observed in RELENT-1. Th e mean values at the mid doses (80 and 120 
mg) are around the point that exposure-response modelling predicts max imum efficacy and the 
low and high doses are, respectively, expected to enable the rising and plateau parts of the dose-response curve to be demonstrated.   
The upper bound of the confidence interval for pred icted exposure at the high dose is below the 
mean exposure for the high dose in the RELENT-1 study (~15,000 ng*hr/ml) and is substantially 
below the individual highest exposures (up to ~8 0,000 ng*hr/ml) that were we ll tolerated in that 
study. It is also below the mean (~14,000 ng*hr/ml) and maximum (~42,000 ng*h/mL) values 
observed in healthy males after repeat dosing for 4 weeks that were also well tolerated with no safety concerns.  
Thus, the administration of these four dose levels together with sparse PK sampling in this study 
will allow a robust evaluation of both the dose- response and PK exposure-response, from which 
it will be possible to select an appropriate dose to progress into the pivotal Phase 3 registration 
studies. 
9.2 Investigational medicinal product 
The IMP will consist of NT-814 40 mg capsules or matching placebo. The capsules are oblong, 
soft-gelatin capsules and each subject will take 4 capsules orally once-daily. The number of 
active and placebo capsules that each subject will take will be dependen t on the dose to which 
they have randomized: 
Dose             IMP Supply 
Placebo   4 x placebo capsules  
40 mg NT-814       1 x NT-814 capsule, 3 x placebo capsules 
80 mg NT-814            2 x NT-814 capsules, 2 x placebo capsules 120 mg NT-814          3 x NT-814 capsules, 1 x placebo capsule 160 mg NT-814          4 x NT-814 capsules

 Inactive ingredients in both the NT-814 capsules and the placebo capsules are Capmul MCM EP, 
Labrasol ALF, Tween 80, Peceol and Vitamin E.  The physical, chemical, pharmaceutical formulation properties and characteristics of the IMP are 
described in the IB.  
All capsules will be blistered and packaged into weekly cards, with each weekly card containing 
capsules for a 7-day week plus an additional day for overage. These weekly cards will be further 
packaged into cardboard cartons: 
- For the single-blind placebo run-in period, a ca rton will be dispensed containing 2 weekly 
placebo cards thereby providing sufficient capsules for the 2-week period between 
Screening Visit 2 and the Baseline visit (plus 2 days overage to allow for delays in clinic visit scheduling). 
- For the post-randomisation double-blind trea tment phase, each carton will contain 4 
weekly cards thereby providing sufficient ca psules for a 4-week dosing period (plus 4 
days overage to allow for delays in clinic visit scheduling). 
The IMP cards and cartons will be labelled in accordance all applicable local regulatory requirements. Multi-language labels may be applied to the IMP. 
All IMP must be stored in a secure area with access limited to the Investigator and authorized site 
staff. The IMP is to be shipped and stored at controlled room temperatur e and be protected from 
light. 
Only authorized investigational site study staff members are to dispense the IMP. 
9.3 Allocation to Treatment 
The 2-week placebo-run in period will be conducted  in a single-blind manner, with the subjects 
blinded to the treatment allocated. 
The post-randomisation 12-week trea tment phase of the study will be conducted in a double-blind 
manner, with the subjects, Investigators and Sponsor all blinded to the treatment allocated. Both 
NT-814 and placebo will be presented as soft-g el capsules, identical in size and shape. 
On successful completion of screening and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will initially be 
randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either NT-814 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, 120 mg/day, 160 mg/day or placebo. Randomisation w ill be stratified by region (Nor th America or Europe). After 
completion of the first interim review the ra ndomisation may be changed (see Section 11.2). 
Regardless of any changes to the randomisation ratio, subjects will continue to receive the dose regimen they were randomised to for the full 12-week treatment period. 
The IMP each subject will receive will be allocated by an IWRS tool provided by Pharm Olam on 
behalf of the Sponsor.

 9.4 Study Treatment and Administration 
IMP will be taken once daily both during the 2-week placebo run-in phase and the 12-week 
double-blind treatment phase.  
For the placebo run-in, the first dose will be taken in the clinic at Screening Visit 2 and the last 
dose will be taken the evening before the Baseline visit.  
For the double-blind treatment phase, the first dose w ill be taken in the clinic  at the Baseline visit 
(Day 1) and the last dose will be taken the evening before the Week 12 visit. IMP doses are fixed 
and will not be adjusted for individual subjects during the study. 
Subjects will be required to take 4 capsules of IMP once-daily in the evening before bedtime. At Screening Visit 2, Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 subjects will be dispensed sufficient IMP for 
daily dosing at home until the next visit, with  overage included to allow for visit windows.  
At Screening Visit 2, subjects will be dispense d sufficient supply to cover the period to the 
Baseline visit. 
At the Baseline visit subjects will be dispensed su fficient supply to cover the period to Week 4. 
An interim check of compliance will be made at the Week 2 visit (subjects will be instructed to 
bring their IMP carton with them to this visit). 
At the Week 4 visit subjects will be dispensed sufficient supply of IMP to cover the period from 
Week 4 to Week 8. 
At the Week 8 subjects will be dispensed sufficient supply of IMP to cover the period from Week 
8 to Week 12. 
On the days of clinic visits (Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) subjects will be asked to provide the 
time that they took their dose the previous even ing and this will be doc umented in the eCRF. 
All doses are to be taken at approximately the same time each evening. If a subject forgets to take a dose in the evening then the dose can be taken at any time up until 9 a.m. the following day. After this time, the dose should not be taken and will be considered a missed dose.   
Subjects will return any unused medication at each clinic visit.  
9.4.1 Dose Interruption 
In the event that a subject experiences an AE which the investigator believes is treatment related 
and which the subject finds intolerable, a break in dosing of up to one week is permitted. If, on reintroduction of the study medication, the adverse event recurs and remains intolerable the study 
drug will be withdrawn altogether. A break in dosing will not result in extension of the overall 
dosing period.

 9.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance Checks 
In accordance with regulatory requirements, th e Investigator or designated site staff must 
document the amount of IMP dispensed and/or administered to study subjects, the amount 
returned by study subjects, and the amount rece ived from and returned to the Sponsor (or 
representative) when applicable. IMP accountabi lity records must be maintained throughout the 
course of the study. The accountability unit for this  study is a capsule. Discrepancies are to be 
reconciled or resolved. Procedures for final disposition of unused IMP will be provided in the 
appropriate Study Manual. 
The Investigator has overall responsibility in ensu ring that the study treatment is received and 
managed at the study site in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Limited responsibility may be dele gated to a nominated study s ite representative and this 
delegation must be documented. St udy treatment will be dispensed by a nominated person at each 
study site. 
The Sponsor will be permitted upon re quest to audit supplies, storage and dispensing records and 
procedures.  
Every effort should be made to encourage subject  compliance with the dosage regimen as per the 
protocol. All subjects will be instructed to return their medication carton with any unused 
capsules at each visit. A record of the capsules dispensed, taken, and returned will be recorded at 
each visit and compliance calculated.   
9.6 Treatment Blinding Code 
Study investigators will be given access to th e IWRS system for the purposes of emergency 
unblinding. Investigators are per mitted to unblind treatment for a subject if it is deemed that 
knowledge of the subject’s treatme nt will impact subject’s future medical care. If possible, the 
CRO medical monitor or Sponsor medical expert should be consulted prior to the blind being 
broken. If this is not possible, the CRO medica l monitor or Sponsor medical expert must be 
notified as soon as possible afte r a code break was performed.  
If a suspected unexpected serious adverse reac tion (SUSAR) occurs th at requires expedited 
reporting to the relevant regulatory agency/Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC), then the blind will be broken for the relevant subject by Emas safety group, in 
order to provide the Regulators the knowledge of the event and the causal agent. A blinded copy of the report will be provided to the investigators and the relevant IRB/IEC. 
If unblinding occurs accidentally this will be considered a protocol deviation which must be 
documented in the subject’s medical  notes and in the trial master file (TMF), and the Sponsor 
must be informed.

21 May 2019 9.7 Permitted Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medi cations taken during the study will be r ecorded in the eCRF with indication, 
dose information, and dates of administration. 
Any medication that is not speci fically prohibited is allowed.  
9.8 Prohibited Concomitant Medication 
A list of prohibited medications is provided in Appendix A.  
The use of hormonal therapies is prohibited prior to Screening Visit 2 for the periods stated in 
exclusion criterion 1, and throughout out the study.  The use of non-hormonal prescription (eg paroxetine, other anti-depressants, alpha agonists [eg 
clonidine], methyldopa, gabapentin, pregabalin, medicinal cannabis) or over the counter/herbal 
treatments for treatment of  menopausal symptoms is not allowed throughout the study. Subjects 
must have discontinued these drug s at least 28 days prior to Screening Visit 2. Subjects may, 
however, be permitted to continue to use these drugs if the dose has been stable for at least 4 weeks and they have been prescribed solely for the management of another disorder (e.g. 
neuropathic pain, depression). 
The following medications are also excluded from Screening Visit 2 until the last dose of IMP 
(unless stated otherwise).  
xKnown CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range
xStrong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4
xStrong or moderate inducers of CYP3A4 (until Week 12 only)

10.2.1 Hot Flush Electronic Diary 
Subjects will be provided with an eDiary to document the number of hot flushes experienced, the 
severity of each hot flush using a scale of 1 to  3 (mild, moderate or severe) and the number of 
night-time awakenings (Appendix C). Subjects will complete the eDiary twice a day, starting the evening of Screening Visit 2 and continuing th roughout the study until the final Follow up visit. 
Each evening, subjects will record the total number of hot flushes of each severity experienced that day since waking. Each morning upon waking, subjects will record the number of times they 
woke up in the night and the total number of hot flushes of each severity experienced during the 
night. The severity of each hot flush will be graded by the subject as follows: 
Mild:  Sensation of heat without sweating Moderate:  Sensation of h eat with sweating, but able  to continue activity.  
Severe:  Sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation (stopping) of activity A hot flush at night which awakens the subject should be classed as severe. Once awake, subjects 
should record any further hot flush episodes according to their severity. 
10.2.2 MenQoL-I (1 month recall version) 
The MenQoL-I (Menopause-specific Quality- of-Life Questionnaire Intervention Version, 
Appendix C) is a validated questionnaire used to  measure condition-specif ic quality of life in 
menopausal women. It is composed of 32 it ems across 4 domains (physical, vasomotor, 
psychosocial and sexual). For each item, subjec ts record whether they have experienced the 
problem in the past month, and if so, they rate how bothered they were by the problem on a scale 
of 0 (not at all bothered) to 6 (extremely bothered). The item respons es can then be converted into 
analysis scores and an overall questionnaire score.

 Subjects will complete the MenQoL-I questionnaire at each clinic visit except the two Screening 
visits and Week 2. 
10.2.3 Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) 
The HFRDIS (Appendix C) is a 10-item, self-re port questionnaire assess ing the impact of hot 
flushes on a woman’s life during th e past week. For each of the 10 items, subjects rate how much 
hot flushes have interfered with that aspect of th eir life on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (very 
much so). Subjects will complete the HFRDIS at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits. 10.2.4 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, Ap pendix C) is a self-ra ted questionnaire which 
assesses sleep quality and disturba nces over a 1-month time interv al. Nineteen individual items 
generate seven "component" scor es: subjective sleep quality, sl eep latency, sleep duration, 
habitual sleep efficiency, sl eep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime 
dysfunction. The sum of scores for these se ven components yields one global score. 
Subjects will complete the PSQI at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits and Week 2. 10.2.5 Insomnia Severity Index 
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI, Appendix C) is  a brief self-report questionnaire assessing the 
nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The ISI comprises 7 items assessing the perceived 
severity of difficulties initiating sleep, staying asleep, and early morning awakenings, satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem. 
Subjects rate each item on a scale of 0 to 4, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. 
Subjects will complete the ISI at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits and Week 2.  
10.2.6 Beck Depression  Inventory II 
The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II, Appe ndix C) is a 21-item que stionnaire assessing the 
intensity of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. It is composed of items relating to 
symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cogniti ons such as guilt or feelings 
of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such  as fatigue, weight loss, and lack of interest 
in sex. Subjects rate each item on a scale of 0 to 3, with the total score ranging from 0 to 63, with 
a higher score suggesting more severe depressive symptoms. 
Subjects will complete the BDI-II at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits.

 10.3 Safety Assessments 
10.3.1 Medical history and concomitant diseases 
A review of medical and medication history will be performed at the Screening visits to confirm 
subject eligibility. This must be confirmed by medically qualified investigator or sub-
investigator. All medically and clinical relevant information must be recorded, regardless of the 
time since the date of diagnosis. 
History should include (but is not limited to): 
x All current and past medications  taken during the six months before the Screening Visit  
x Relevant history of menopausal, respiratory,  cardiovascular, renal,  gastro-intestinal, 
hepatic, endocrine, hematolo gical, neurological, psychiat ric and any other diseases 
The menopausal symptom history does not need to  be recorded on the general medical history 
page of the eCRF. However, surgeries rela ted to menopause (e.g. bilateral oophorectomy, 
hysterectomy) do need to be reco rded on the medical history page. 
10.3.2 Physical examinations 
A full physical examination will be conducted at Screening Visit 2 and a symptom directed 
physical examination at the Baseline and Week 16 visits. This will be completed by a physician 
or an appropriatel y qualified delegate. 
A full physical examination includes a review of the following body systems: 
x General appearance 
x Skin 
x Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat 
x Respiratory 
x Cardiovascular 
x Abdomen (including liver and kidneys) 
x Musculoskeletal 
x Neurological 
Any abnormalities that are identified at Screening Visit 2 will be documented on the medical history eCRF page. Any change (including new a nd worsening findings) between Screening Visit 
2 and the final study visit should be recorded as an AE on the AE eCRF page and in the subject’s 
medical record.

21 May 2019  
  
 If an improvement/resolution of a physical ex amination finding documented in the subject’s 
medical history occurs during the study, it should be  recorded in the source document. If there is 
resolution of a physical examination finding previously noted as an AE, then the event resolution 
and stop date should be recorded on the AE eCRF  page and documented in the subject’s notes. 
10.3.3 12-Lead ECGs 
Resting 12-lead ECG data will be captured at all study visits except Screening Visit 1. 
All ECGs will be performed after the patient has rested for five minutes in a semi-recumbent 
position. The same model of ECG recorder should  be used throughout the study for any given 
subject wherever possible. 
All ECG reports must be reviewed, signed and date d by the Investigator or  delegated physician. 
Reports will then be filed with the subject’s medical record. The Investigator will comment on all 
abnormal findings and determine whether they are c linically significant. These assessments will 
be recorded in the eCRF and clinically significant findings must also be reported as AEs in the 
eCRF. 
10.3.4 Electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, or C-SSRS (Appendix C), is a rating scale created 
to evaluate suicidality in adults  and children over the age of 12. It rates an individual's degree of 
suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent." The ve rsion used will be the electr onic C-SSRS (eC-SSRS), which is a 
subject-reported version of the scale. The C-SSRS has been found to be reliable and valid in the 
identification of suicide risk in several research studies and is a standard tool used in clinical 
development studies with centrally acting inve stigational drugs, re gardless of indication. 
Subjects will complete the eC-SSRS at Baseline, Weeks 4, 12, and 16. 
10.3.5 Clinical chemistry 
Blood for clinical chemistry assessments will be collected as indicated in the Study Schedule 
(Table 10-1)  and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  The following clinical chemistry 
parameters will be assessed: sodium, potassium, glucose, ur ea (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, 
creatine kinase, albumin, calcium, phosphate, bilir ubin (total), alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (A LT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), 
bicarbonate, magnesium, chloride, total protein and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Subjects do not 
need to fast before clinical chemistry samples are taken. 
All clinical chemistry test reports must be revi ewed, signed and dated by the Investigator or 
delegated physician. Reports will then be filed with the subject’s medical record. The Investigator 
will comment on all abnorma l results and determine whether th ey are clinically significant. 
Clinically significant findings must also be reported as AEs in the eCRF.

 10.3.6 Haematology 
Blood for haematology assessments will be collected as indicated in in the Study Schedule (Table 
10-1)  and sent to the central laboratory for analysis. The following haematology parameters will 
be assessed: red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, haematocrit, 
haemoglobin, MCV, platelet count and WBC differentials. 
All haematology test reports must be reviewed, si gned and dated by the In vestigator or delegated 
physician. Reports will then be filed with the subject’s medical record. The Investigator will 
comment on all abnormal resu lts and determine whether they are c linically significant. Clinically 
significant findings must also be reported as AEs in the eCRF. 
10.3.7 Urinalysis 
Urine for urinalysis assessments will be collected as indicated in the Study Schedule in (Table 
10-1)  and sent to the central laboratory for analysis. Urinalysis will include glucose, bilirubin, 
ketones, specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrites, leucocyte esterase, 
sedimentation.  
All urinalysis test reports must  be reviewed, signed and dated by  the Investigator or delegated 
physician. Reports will then be filed with the subject’s medical record. The Investigator will 
comment on all abnormal resu lts and determine whether they are c linically significant. Clinically 
significant findings must also be reported as AEs in the eCRF.  
10.3.8 Vital signs 
Vital signs will be measured at all visits except Screening Visit 1: 
x Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature and weight will be recorded 
at all visits except Screening Visit 1 
x Waist circumference will be recorded at all visits except Screening Visits 1 and 2 
x Height will be measured at Screening Visit 2 only. 
At Screening Visit 2 only, blood pressure measur ements may be repeated a maximum of twice 
(three measurements in total) if the first values are high and suggestive of uncontrolled hypertension. The repeat m easurements should be taken after at least 5 minutes of rest in a quiet 
environment.  
All measurements are to be recorded on the Vital Signs eCRF. All vital signs must be reviewed by the Investigator or delegated physician. The Investigator will 
comment on all abnormal results a nd determine whether they are clinically significant. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF and clinically significant findings must also be reported as AEs in the eCRF.

 10.3.9 Bone Turnover Markers 
Blood for assessment of bone turnove r markers will be collected at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 
16 and sent to the central laboratory for analys is. The serum concentration of the following 
markers will be assessed: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and procollagen type 1 N-
terminal pro-peptide (P1NP). 
 Baseline and Week 12 and 16 visits should be c onducted at similar times of day to reduce diurnal 
variation in these markers.  
10.3.10 Pregnancy Testing, Contraception and Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Testing 
A dipstick urine pregnancy test will be performed for all subjects at Screening Visit 2 and must 
be negative for the subject to remain eligible.  
Contraception 
There are no contraception requirements given that all subjects will be post-menopausal.  
Pregnancy 
Not applicable for this study.  10.4 Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples for analysis of plasma NT-814 con centrations will be collected at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
and 12. The actual date and time of each blood samp le collection will be recorded, together with 
the date and time of the most recent dose of IMP.  Approximately 6 mL of blood will be collected at each time point. Details  of PK blood sample 
collection (including volume to be collected), processing, storage and shipping procedures will be 
provided in the Study Manual. 
10.5 Adverse events 
10.5.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical trial subject administered an IMP and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationshi p with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not considered 
related to the IMP.

Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page 52 of 100 
21 May 2019  
  
 As the full medical history and physical evaluation does not take place until Screening Visit 2, 
the adverse event reporting period starts after this visit is complete.  
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
All AEs considered to be untoward and uninte nded responses to an IMP related to any dose 
should be considered ADRs. The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what 
is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse an d abuse of the product. The phrase “responses to 
an IMP” means that a causal relationship betwee n an IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse event that: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) 
x Requires in-patient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see 
explanation below) 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is considered to be an important medical event 
Based upon medical and scientific judgment, important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening, or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject 
and/or
11 may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above may be considered a SAE. 
Hospitalizations are defined as initial or prolonged admissions that include an overnight stay. 
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for t echnical, practical or social reasons, in the 
absence of an adverse event is not an SAE and neither is attendance at an Emergency Room / 
Accident and Emergency Department that takes place in the evening or night and does not result 
in formal admission to the hospital. 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with applicable product 
reference safety information (Section 6.5 of the Investigator Brochure). 
                                                 
11 The definition varies between regulatory jurisdictions

Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page 53 of 100 
21 May 2019  
  
 Reports which add significant information on the sp ecificity, increase of occurrence, or severity 
of a known, already documented serious adve rse reaction constitute unexpected events. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) 
A serious adverse event that is suspected to be  related to the administe red medicinal product and 
the nature or severity of which is not consistent with th e reference safety information. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
NT-814 is a non-hormonal therapy and so is not expected to have any adverse effect on the 
endometrium. However, post-menopausal bleeding will be monitored as an AE of special interest 
and investigators should report any such events to the Sponsor in an expedited manner. This 
should be done by completing an AE of Special Inte rest form within 5 working days of awareness 
of the event and submitting the form to the medical monitor by email. Note, the AESI form 
should NOT be sent to Emas. 
Additionally, any subjects experiencing post- menopausal bleeding af ter randomisation should 
undergo a transvaginal ultrasound with subseque nt investigation and management (including 
endometrial biopsy, if i ndicated) according to the investigat or’s clinical judgement and usual 
practice (unexplained post-menopausal bleeding prior to randomisation will exclude the subject 
from the study). 
10.5.2 Assessment of Severity 
The severity (intensity) of each adverse event will be classified as: 
x Mild   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated 
x Moderate Sign or symptom causes discomfort, but does not interfere with normal  
  activities 
x Severe  Sign or symptom of sufficient intensity to interfere with normal activities 
10.5.3 Assessment of Causality 
A determination will be made of the relationship (if any) between an AE and the study drug. A 
causal relationship is present if a determination is made that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the drug or stud y procedure. AEs will be classified as either 
related or unrelated.  
10.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or discovered as a result of 
general, non-leading questioning. As the full me dical history and physical evaluation does not 
take place until Screening Visit 2, the adverse event reporting period starts after this visit is

 complete. Adverse events occurring from the time of Screening Visit 2 up to the final study visit 
will be recorded. All AEs should be recorded in the eCRF and in the subjects’ source notes. 
Any SAE occurring from Screening Visit 2 until 28 days after the last dose of IMP must be 
reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investig ator becoming aware of it) and recorded on 
the SAE Form. Detailed instructions for the repor ting of SAEs can be found in the Study Manual. 
All subjects with a SAE must be followed up and the outcomes reported. The investigator must 
supply the Sponsor and the relevant agency/IRB/I EC with any additional requested information 
(e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports). Any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE will also be reporte d within 24 hours of awareness. 
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/ she will not wait to receive additional information be fore reporting the event and co mpleting the appropriate data 
collection form. The Investigator should always provide a preliminary assessment of causality at 
the time of the initial report as described in Section  10.5.3. 
The primary mechanism for reporting SAEs will be a paper collection form. 
Scan & email of the SAE form is the preferred me thod to transmit this information to the project 
contact for SAE receipt although fax transmission is also acceptable. In rare circumstances and in 
the absence of email facilities or  fax equipment, notification by  telephone is acceptable, with a 
copy of the SAE data collection form sent by overnight mail. Initial notif ication via the telephone 
does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE data collection form 
within the designated reporting periods. 
If required according to local regulatory authorities and IRB/IEC policy, each Investigator must 
then notify his or her relevant agency/IRB/IEC of the SAE. 
NeRRe is required to expedite to worldwide re gulatory authorities reports of SUSARs in line 
with the relevant legislation. Fatal or life-threatening SUSARs must be reported within 7 calendar 
days and other SUSARs within 15 calendar days. 
In accordance with the European Commissi on Directive 2001/20/EC, NeRRe will notify the 
relevant Ethics Committees in concerned Member states of applicable SUSARs as individual 
notifications or through a periodic line listing. SUSARs will be reported to IRB/EC in non-EU 
countries according to local regulations and IRB/EC policy. 
All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant SUSAR reports. 
NeRRe (or their designee) will submit to the regulatory authorities all safety updates and periodic 
reports, as required by applicab le regulatory requirements.

 11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Estimated Sample Size 
11.1.1 Efficacy 
The total sample size for the trial yields high power for the expected large difference from 
placebo in hot flush reduction from baseline and adequate power for moderate difference.   
Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of  4.4, N=27 per treatment group has ~95% power 
(alpha=0.05 2-sided) via trend test across all doses including  placebo if the true underlying dose 
response is non-decreasing from a reduction of 4 hot flushes on placebo up to 8 on the highest 
dose of NT-814.   N=33 per treatment group is re quired for 95% power for pairwise comparison 
of the highest dose to placebo under these same assumptions. Hence, a total of 150 completed 
subjects (30 x 5) was used for the simulations of adaptive design.  [Note, the actual performance / power for the adaptive designs may be higher than the values cited in this report since additional 
subjects will be added to selected dose groups to better inform on safety.]  The actual sample size 
will be determined by the adaptive dose-finding design algorithm (See Appendix B). In addition, 
the actual sample size is increased by 10% to allow for subjects who withdraw prematurely and so the initial sample size will be 165 subjects. 
The sample size allows for 95% power since each of the four co-primary endpoints are required 
to demonstrate statistical significance in order to yield a firm conclusion of beneficial treatment effect on hot flushes.  Conservatively, assuming independence among the four endpoints, this would yield approximately 81% power overall for achieving statistical significance for each of 
the four endpoints.  Thus, overall power for the tr ial is estimated to be at least 81%; the actual 
power depends on the unknown magnitudes of correlations among the co-primary endpoints.   
11.1.2 Safety 
In addition to assessing efficacy, the study objectiv es also include further evaluation of the safety 
of a range of doses of NT-814 in women with  menopausal symptoms. Regarding estimation of 
differences in AE rates from placebo for a gi ven dose group, Table 11-1 (computed via normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution) shows th e half-width of 95% confidence intervals for 
difference between a pair of tr eatment groups.  This indicates the precision for such estimation 
for several example cases.  The DRC will use these confidence intervals to assist in their 
consideration of increasing the sample size of those doses which achieve target levels of HF 
frequency and severity reduction in order to better assess safety.  Criteria for such considerations 
will be described more fully in the DRC Charter.

11.2 Interim Reviews 
A number of interim analyses (IA) are planned to enable the following two questions to be 
addressed as the trial progresses:  
1) Do the emerging efficacy and safety data  support the continued evaluation of all four
NT-814 doses?
2) Do the assumptions used in the original sample size estimate remain valid?
The first IA will be conducted after efficacy data for the frequency and severity of hot flushes is 
collected through Week 4 from 30 patients randomiz ed in equal proportions to the four NT-814 
doses and placebo. The DRC will review the HF fre quency and severity results, together with all 
available safety data, and will determine the randomisation ratios for subjects subsequent enrolled 
into the study. The ratio may be changed to optimise the adaptive design to estimate doses with 
target levels of weekly average daily HF reduction from baseline of between 6 and 8.  The adaptive design algorithm will be based on Bayesian Emax dose-response modeling
57 and / or T-
statistic adaptive dose-finding design58.  The DRC will have dose assignment recommendations 
by each of those adaptive dose-finding algorithms  and assign the randomiz ation ratio that best 
integrates the safety and efficacy objectives of the trial and the adaptive design results.  Additional details regarding the adaptive algorithms and their performance characteristics are in the adaptive dose-finding design simulation report (Appendix B).  Subsequent IA's will be 
conducted similarly, after Week 4 data from each  cohort of ~30 additional subjects become 
available.  The DRC will evaluate stopping criteria according to the IA algorithms as described in 
Appendix B and decide on stopping assignment of s ubjects to specific doses or stopping the trial 
for an efficacy or safety conclusion, and dose choice for subsequent study or futility. 
The DRC will be unblinded to tr eatment allocation. Subjects will continue to be recruited and 
randomised while the interim analyses are being undertaken.

 11.3 Analysis Sets 
The following data sets will be used for the statistical analysis. 
1. Safety Analysis Set : All subjects who receive at least one dose of double-blind study drug 
irrespective of treatment received. Subjects will be  analyzed according to treatment received 
2. Full Analysis Set (FAS):  All randomised subjects who r eceived at least one dose of double-
blind study drug, irrespective of treatment rece ived, and have hot flush data for at least 7 
days’ worth of post-treatment assessments (i .e. requirement for the primary efficacy 
endpoint). Subjects will be analyzed according to randomised treatment. This is the primary 
efficacy analysis set for the study. 
3. Per Protocol (PP) Set: All subjects in the FAS excluding those identified as having relevant 
protocol deviations. 
4. Exposure-Response (ER) Set: all subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind 
study drug and for whom the PK data are considered sufficient. 
Analysis Sets will be identified prior to the unblinding of the study data.  
11.4 Data Analysis 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalised prior to database lock and treatment unblinding. The SAP will give a more detailed description of the summaries and analyses that will be performed, expanding on the protocol specified analysis. Any deviation 
from the protocol specified analysis will be documented within a protocol amendment or in the 
SAP, as appropriate, and de scribed within the CSR.  
Data will be analysed using SAS
® version 9.4 or a later version. 
Continuous variables will be summarised usi ng number of non-missing observations, mean, 
standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, minimum a nd maximum values. Categorical 
variables will be summari sed using counts and percentages. A ll statistical hypot hesis tests and 
confidence intervals will be tw o sided, using a type I error rate of 0.05. No adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will be used for this Phase 2 study. For the analysis of each efficacy 
endpoint pairwise statistical co mparisons are planned for each NT-814 dose group (40mg, 80mg, 
120 mg and 160 mg) versus placebo, with the understa nding that this increases the overall type I 
error rate of the study. All collected subject data will be listed. 
No subgroup analyses are planned to be performed. 11.5 Interim Analysis 
The first interim analysis (IA) will be conducted after efficacy data from frequency and severity 
of hot flushes (HF) is collected through Week 4 from 30 patients randomiz ed in equal proportions 
to the 4 doses and placebo.  Based on DRC review of the IA results, randomization ratios for

 subsequent enrolled patients may be changed to optimize the adaptive design to estimate doses 
with target levels of weekly average daily HF reduction from baseline 6 and 8.  Adaptive design algorithm will be based on Bayesian Emax dose-response modeling
57  and / or T-statistic adaptive 
dose-finding design58.  The DRC will have dose assignment  recommendations by each of those 
adaptive dose-finding algorithms and assign the randomization ratio that best integrates the objectives of the trial and the adaptive design results.  Additional details regarding the adaptive algorithms and their performance characteristics are in the adaptive dose-finding design simulation report (Appendix B).  Subsequent IA's will be conducted similarl y, after Week 4 data 
from each cohort of ~30 additional patients beco me available.  The DRC will evaluate stopping 
criteria per the IA algorithms as described in Ap pendix B, and decide on stopping assignment of 
subjects to specific doses or stopping the tr ial for an efficacy conclusion and dose choice for 
subsequent study or futility.  
11.6 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be listed by subject a nd treatment group. Relevant  protocol deviations 
will be identified from review of the subject data, prior to database lock, at a blinded data review 
meeting (BDRM). Subjects with any relevant deviations that are judged to impact on the statistical analysis will be excluded from the PP analysis set. 
11.7 Subject Disposition 
The number of subjects enrolled, randomised and within each subject analysis set will be 
summarised by treatment group and overall. Any screen failure subjects will be separately 
described in the CSR. In addition, the number of  subjects completing / not completing the study 
will be summarised along with the primary reason for withdrawal from the study. 
11.8 Demographics and Base line Characteristics 
Relevant Screening and Baseline data (i.e. data collected prior to the study treatment 
administration initiation) and demographic characteristics will be summarised descriptively for 
each treatment group. The FAS will be used in su mmaries of demographic and baseline data. No 
statistical testing will be used to compare treatment groups for different baseline characteristics. 
11.9 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Parameters 
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS analysis sets which is the primary analysis set for all statistical comparisons of efficacy en dpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint will, 
additionally, be analysed in the PP set.  
11.9.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The co-primary endpoints are the change from baselin e in the mean daily frequencies of moderate 
and severe hot flushes in the 7 days before the week 4 and Week 12 visits, and the mean severity 
of moderate and severe hot flus hes in the 7 days before the week 4 and Week 12 visits. The 
baseline assessment will be the la st 7 days of the baseline diar y completion period. Absolute and

 changes from baseline in the mean daily frequencies and average hot flush severity will be 
summarised by treatment group. The change from  baseline endpoint will be analysed using a 
mixed model repeated measures analysis. Pairwise statistical comparisons are planned for each NT-814 dose group (40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg) versus placebo, presenting the adjusted 
mean treatment difference with its corresponding 95% confidence interval.  In addition, treatment 
mean comparisons to placebo may be made via estimated means from a 4-parameter Emax model 
fit and trend test for increasing response with increasing dose based on isotonic regression modelling [details will be in the Statistical Analysis Plan]. 
The primary objective will be assessed by testing the following hypotheses for each NT-814 
group versus placebo separately: 
Null hypothesis (H
0): There is no difference in the mean  change from baseline in hot flush 
frequency [or severity] at Week 12 [or Week 4] compared to Baseline for the NT-814 treatment 
group compared to placebo. 
H0: μ (active) = μ (placebo) 
Alternative hypothesis (H 1): There is a difference in the mean change from baseline in hot flush 
frequency [or severity] at Week 12 [or Week 4] compared to Baseline for the NT-814 treatment 
group compared to placebo. 
H1: μ (active) ≠ μ (placebo) 
Absolute and changes from baseline in the in the mean frequency and severity will be 
summarised by treatment group.  
11.9.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
11.9.2.1 Other hot flush frequency and severity secondary endpoints 
Each of the hot flush frequency and severity secondary endpoints, including night time 
awakening (Section 8.2), will be summarised by treatme nt group and scheduled visit (as 
applicable) and will be analysed, following th e same approach as for the primary endpoint. 
The proportion of responders, defined as a redu ction of >=50% points and >=80% points on the 
weekly average frequency of hot flushes will be summarised at each scheduled visit. The Week 4 and Week 12 response will be analysed by logis tic regression, including the same terms in the 
model as for the primary efficacy endpoint analys is. Pairwise statistical comparisons are planned 
for each NT-814 dose group versus placebo, presen ting the adjusted odds ratio for the treatment 
difference with its corresponding 95% Wald confidence interval.

 11.9.2.2 Other Secondary endpoints  
The analyses of the following endpoints will use the same approach as for the primary endpoint: 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Insomnia Severity Index Scores, Beck Depression 
Inventory Scores, MenQoL and HFRDIS (total sc ore and domain/sub-scores , as applicable).  
For each of these secondary endpoints the appropri ate analysis method to be used to assess the 
observed data will be reviewed, and any changes documented in the SAP. Only the Week 4 and Week 12 time points will be analysed, other visits summarised only, by treatment group. 
11.10 Statistical Methods for Safety Parameters 
The safety analysis set will be used for all presentations of safety endpoints.  No statistical testing 
will be used to compare treatment groups for di fferent safety endpoints.  Safety data will be 
summarised descriptively for each treatment group.  
11.10.1 Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be presented 
within summary presentations, by MedDRA syst em organ class (SOC), preferred term and 
treatment group.  
An adverse event will be defined as treatment emergent if the onset date is on or after the date of 
first dosing with study treatment. Any adverse event with an onset date earlier than the first 
dosing with study treatment will be considered as a pre-treatment adverse event. If a subject experiences more than one AE with the same pref erred term, that preferred term will be counted 
only once within summaries. It will be assigned the highest observed severity and the strongest 
relationship to study treatment among those events for the tables in which those characteristics are summarised. Pre-treatment AEs will be identified in a subject listing.  
Summaries presentations for the number and percen tage of subjects reporting TEAEs, severity of 
TEAEs, TEAEs by relationship to study treatment, and treatment emergent serious adverse events 
(SAE) will be presented by treatment group and overall. In addition, SAEs and adverse events 
directly resulting in withdrawal from study will be listed. 11.10.2 Laboratory Parameters 
Laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistr y, bone turnover marker s and urinalysis) will 
be summarised over the scheduled  visits by treatment group. Absolute values and changes from 
baseline will be summarised for the haematology, biochemistry and bone turn -over parameters. In 
addition, for haematology and biochemistry paramete rs, shift tables will be presented for changes 
in category (below, within or above normal ra nge) from baseline to the subjects’ worst post-
baseline value (‘worst’ separately identified as either lowest or highest value observed on a 
subject for specific parameter being presented). Laboratory values outside the reference range 
will be identified in the subject listings.

 A summary of abnormal clinically significant laboratory values will also be produced. 
11.10.3 Vital Signs 
Vital sign parameters (heart rate , systolic and diastolic blood pres sure, temperature, weight, BMI, 
waist circumference) will be summarised (absolute values and changes from baseline) by 
treatment group and schedul ed protocol visit.  
11.10.4 ECG 
ECGs will be assessed by the Investigator for abnormal findings. These will be categorised and 
summarised as normal, abnor mal-not clinically significant or abnormal-clinically significant. A 
summary of abnormal clinically signif icant ECG findings will be produced.  
ECG intervals will be recorded and summarised as absolute values and changes from baseline. Other ECG findings will be listed. 
11.10.5 C-SSRS 
Absolute values and changes from baseline will be summarised by treatment group and scheduled 
protocol visit. 
11.10.6 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant therapies will be coded to their generic name and Drug Class using the current 
version of the WHO Drugs Dictionary. Medications will be assigned as being prior to study 
treatment or concomitant with study treatment, ba sed on the start and stop dates of the medication 
and the study treatment. If the medication stop date  is before the study treatment start date, the 
medication will be assigned as being prior to study treatment. In all other situations, the 
medication will be assigned as being concomitant with study treatment. Concomitant medications 
will be summarised by WHO Drug Class, generic name  and treatment group.  
11.11 Pharmacokinetics Analysis 
Blood samples for assay of NT-814 plasma concentrations are coll ected at each of Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
and 12. The plasma NT-814 concentrations will be lis ted by scheduled visit. Further details of the 
analysis of PK data will be described in an Exposure-Response Data Analysis Plan and exposure-
response data will be reported in a separate report.  
11.12 Missing Data 
Summary statistics and statistical analysis will be based primarily on non-missing values. 
Sensitivity analyses may be conducted to check the robustness of the analysis results under 
alternative assumptions with regards to missing data. Further details on the handling of missing 
values, including rules applied to incomplete que stionnaires and any planned sensitivity analyses 
will be defined in the SAP.

 14. STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT 
14.1 Monitoring 
In accordance with applicable regulations, incl uding GCP, and NeRRe or delegated CRO’s 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), clinical re search monitors will, prior to the start of the 
study, review with the site staff the protocol , study requirements, and the sites’s responsibilities 
to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and NeRRe requirements. This review will also include a review of 
source documentation. A list of what is to be  classed as ‘source documentation’ will be 
documented in the Study Monitoring Manual. 
During the study the clinical monitor will periodically visit the site to verify: 
x Data are authentic, accurate and complete 
x Safety and right of the subjects are being protected 
x IMP accountability 
x AE and SAE reporting 
x Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other 
study agreements, GCP and all app licable regulatory requirements 
14.2 Quality Assurance 
To ensure compliance with GCP and all a pplicable regulatory requirements, the 
investigator[s]/institution[s] will permit study-related audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection[s], providing direct ac cess to source data/documents. 
14.3 Data Recording 
An eCRF will be used to capture subject data into a secure, validated database. Access to enter data in the eCRF will be limited to delegated and trained investigator site staff only.  
Primary efficacy endpoint data and some secondary efficacy e ndpoint data will be recorded 
directly by subjects into the eDiary. In additi on, eC-SSRS data will be recorded directly by 
subjects into an interactive voice response (IVR) system . Subject-entered diary and IVR data will 
not be subjected to source data verification. 14.3.1 Data to be Considered as Source Data 
Source data may be defined as information from an original record or certified copy of the 
original record containing patient information for use in the trial.  The information may include, but is not limited, to clinical findings, observations, or other activities necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents

 (original records or certified copies) (ICH E2A Guideline). Examples of source data include 
subject identification and ra ndomisation identification.  
14.4 Confidentiality 
The Investigator must assure that the subjects’ anonymity is maintained. On all study 
documentation, with the exception of the consent fo rm and subject ID logs, subjects will only be 
identified by their unique identification code and will not be referred to by name. 
Study data will be handled with utmost discretion within the context of physician’s 
confidentiality. Names of participating subjects and data generated as a result of this study will not be passed on to unauthorized persons. If orig inal documents are to be sent outside of the 
research site they must be redacted to remove information which might potentially identify the subject.  
NeRRe may transfer some data collected during the study to a different company or regulatory 
authority outside of the US or EU for the purpose  of processing, review, analysis or storage. 
Whenever the subject’s personal data is transferred, it will be kept confidential and secure, and will used only for the purpose for which it was collected. 
Safety analysis samples collected during the study will be analysed at a central laboratory. 
Samples will be identified by the subjects’ unique identification code only. All safety samples 
will be destroyed after the assays have been completed. 
Blood samples for analysis of NT-814 concentrations will be shipped to Aptuit Srl, Italy for 
analysis. Samples will be identified by the subjects’ unique identification code only. Following completion of the analysis, all samples will be destroyed. 
14.5 Retention of Study Data 
Following closure of the study, the Investigator must maintain all site study records, except for 
those required by local regulations to be maintained by someone else, in a safe and secure location. The records must be maintained to allo w easy and timely retrieval, when needed (e.g., 
audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to  allow any subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by local laws/ regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche,  scanned, electronic). The Investigator must, 
however, ensure that all reproductions are legi ble and are a true and accurate copy of the 
originals, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re-generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the Investigator must ensure there is an acceptable back-up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality  control process exists for making these 
reproductions. 
NeRRe will inform the Investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply with 
all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time will be either 15 years or, if

 a longer period if required by local institutional re quirements or local laws or regulations, then 
the minimum will become that longer period.  
The Investigator must notify NeRRe of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but 
not limited to, archival at an off-site facility or transfer of ownership of the records in the event 
the Investigator leaves the site. The Investigator  must not dispose of any records without prior 
approval from NeRRe. 
14.6 Communication and Publication of Results 
Where required by applicable regulatory requirements, an Investigator signatory will be identified 
for the approval of the CSR. The Investigator will be provided appropriate access to statistical 
tables, figures, and relevant re ports and will have the opportunity to review the complete study 
results at NeRRe or another mutually agreeable location. 
The original eCRFs and all data  generated during the study under this protocol will become the 
property of the Sponsor. 
Upon completion of the CSR, NeRRe will ensure public  disclosure of the c linical trial research 
results according to the NeRRe’s SOP and provide each Investigator with the full summary of the 
study results. The Investigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as appropriate.  
It is the intent of all parties that the results of the study be published in a timely manner consistent 
with academic standards and with due consideration given to the protection of intellectual property rights. The Principal Investigator and NeRRe will be responsible for writing the proposed publication; this must happen with  due diligence and w ith minimal delay.  
Any proposed publication or presentation (including  a manuscript, abstract or poster) originated 
by an Investigator for submission to a journal or scientific meeting should be sent to the Sponsor 
for review at least sixty days prior to s ubmission. The Sponsor's comments on the proposed 
publication shall be considered in good faith by the authors. Sponsor may delay such submission 
by a maximum of six months if it reasonably believes that publication of results may compromise its intellectual property rights or else insist that such information or data is removed from the proposed publication. Publication of the results w ill not include confidentia l information without 
the permission of the Sponsor. 
14.7 Indemnification 
In the event of study-related damage or injuri es, the clinical trial insurance of the Sponsor 
provides compensation for claims that arise in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the 
countries involved, except for cl aims that arise from willful misconduct or gross negligence. A 
copy of the country-specific insurance certificates will be held in the TMF and in the Investigator 
Site File.

APPENDIX B:  PHASE 2B ADAPTIVE DOSE-FINDING DESIGN FOR NT-814 
EFFECT ON REDUCTION OF HOT FLUSHES  
  J.Bolognese
 
18 July 2018  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE 
 A Phase 2b dose-finding placebo-controlled trial of NT-814 treatment with four different doses for 12 weeks aimed at reduction of hot flushes is  being planned.  Adaptive design options are 
being considered to modify randomization ra tios to the NT-814 doses based on accumulating 
data.  This report summarizes several example adaptive design options along with their performance characteristics for an initial assume d example set of potential TRUE underlying 
dose-response curves.  The primary endpoints for the trial are hot flush frequency and severity; however, the adaptive design simulation software cannot handle multiple endpoints.  Hence, the scenarios evaluated focus on re duction of hot flush frequency. 
 METHODS 
 First, in order to arrive at so me example TRUE underlying dose-response scenarios, prior data on 
hot flush reduction was examined.  NT-814 has shown efficacy in reduction of hot flushes over a 
2-week period in a Phase 1/2a trial.  Mean re ductions in hot flush frequency of up to 9 per day 
from a baseline frequency ~10-12 were observed (w ith an observed SD of change from baseline 
ranged between ~3.4 to ~4.9; SD back-calculated from SE's from the analysis model yielded SD's 
of change ~3.7).  In order to obtain longer term prior data to inform on expected variability, the Duavee label was also examined.  It yielded SD 's of change ~4.4 after 4 weeks' treatment and 
~3.6 after 12 weeks' treatment.  Based on these pr ior data, an SD=4.4 a nd somewhat conservative 
magnitudes of treatment effect were used to simulate adaptive design outcomes and performance characteristics.  The following TRUE under lying dose-response curves were examined:

 The total sample size for the trial yields high power for the expected large difference from placebo in hot flush reduction from baseline and adequate power for moderate difference.   
 Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of  4.4, N=27 per treatment group has ~95% power 
(alpha=0.05 2-sided) via tr end test across all doses including placebo if the true underlying dose 
response is non-decreasing from a reduction of 4 hot flushes on placebo up to 8 on the highest 
dose of NT-814.   N=33 per treatment group is re quired for 95% power for pairwise comparison 
of the highest dose to placebo under these same assumptions. Hence, a total of 150 completed 
subjects (30 x 5) was used for the simulations of adaptive design.  [Note, the actual performance / 
power for the adaptive designs may be higher than the values cited in this report since additional subjects will be added to selected dose groups to better inform on safety.]  The actual sample size will be determined by the adaptive dose-finding design algorithm.  The sample size allows for 95% power since each  of the four co-primary endpoints are required 
to demonstrate statistical significance in order to yield a firm conclusion of beneficial treatment effect on hot flushes.  Conservatively, assuming independence among the four endpoints, this would yield approximately 81% power overall for achieving statistical significance for each of the four endpoints.  Thus, overall power for the tr ial is estimated to be at least 81%; the actual 
power depends on the unknown magnitudes of corr elations among the co-primary endpoints. 
 Adaptive dose-finding design algorithms use results from interim analysis (IA) of accumulating data from the trial to modify dose-choices and / or randomization ratios fo r subsequent subjects 
entering the trial.  Three numbers of IA and two adaptive dose-finding algorithms were evaluated for each of the four potential TRUE underlying dose-response curves (total 24 scenarios = 4 DR 
curves X 3 cohort sizes X 2 design algorithms).  Th e three IA sizes evaluated are (i) no IA's (i.e., 
N=15 per dose group to compare to a non-adaptive design ), (ii) two IAs, and (iii) five IAs.  Both 
the 2-IA and 5-IA designs randomize the initial 25 patients 1:1:1:1:1 to the 5 dose groups (note, 
placebo is the zero dose group) to obtain a r easonable amount of seeding data upon which to 
begin the adaptation.  Note, the actual planned si ze of the first cohort is N=30, which would yield 
results between those of the two sample size scen arios simulated for the adaptive designs.  Hence, 
the actual performance characteristics of the trial fall between the those two sample size scenarios.   Since the timing of the actual IA's may vary due to logistical / enrolment constraints, these two scenarios are representative of the those expected during the trial. Then the 2-IA design carries out a second IA after N=50 total patients are obs erved, and then the final analysis is

 carried out after the 75 patients are completed.  After the initial IA at N=25, the 5-IA design 
carries out an IA after results of each 10 patients are added to the accumulating data. 
 The two adaptive algorithms are (i) a Bayesian  adaptive Emax (S-shape d) dose-response model 
fit at each IA (COMPASS User Manual), and (ii) a model based on classical T-statistics at each IA (Ivanova, 2008).  The Emax design uses a "vag ue" Bayesian prior distribution on each of the 
four parameters of the S-shaped Emax model in combination with the observed data to estimate the posterior distribution of the Emax model pa rameters from which es timates of mean response 
at each dose are obtained, along with their SE's.  Then randomization ratios are chosen for the next cohort to minimize the variances of the resu lting Emax model estimates at two target levels 
of response, namely hot flush reductions of 6 per day and of 8 per day.  The Emax algorithm was 
set up to recommend stopping randomization to a given dose if (a) the probability is > 90% that the mean hot flush reduction at least 8 at that dose, or (b) the probability is <20% that the mean hot flush reduction is at least 5 (i.e., >80% probability that the mean hot flush reduction is <5).  The T-statistic design relies on isotonic regression (i.e., best-fit non-decreasing dose-response curve) derived estimated means for each dose and then computes the resultant T-statistic for estimated mean difference from each target level of  response (hot flush reduction of 6 and of 8) 
for each dose.  Then the subjects in the next cohort are split among the two doses with T-statistics pointing closest to each target level of response and placebo.  The sample sizes of each cohort are 
always 10 on placebo for the 2 IA design, and always 5 on placebo for the 5 IA design, to yield N=30 on placebo for the final analysis.  For the simulations, the subjects assigned to the active doses are randomized according to the randomiza tion ratio indicated by the adaptive design 
algorithm for each cohort after the first.  The only stopping criteria recommendation available for 
the T-statistic in the simulation software (Cytel 's COMPASS V1.1) is futility stopping; hence, if 
probability of a significant difference from placebo is <5% for a given dose based on the IA results, then the algorithm recommends that dose is dropped from any further randomization to it.  The 24 scenarios (4 DR curves X 3 cohort sizes X 2 design algorithms) were each simulated 500 
times, and the following performance characteristics, averaged across the 500 simulations, were summarized in Tables 1a and 1b

 In order to account for recruitme nt rate and lag of data collection and analysis as patients 
continually enter the trial, the simulations were run assuming a 6-week lag for each patient 
entering and their 4 week hot flash frequency data entering the interim analysis.  An average recruitment rate of 5 patients per week was assumed, since the software cannot accommodate 
varying recruitment.  It should be noted that the analysis models fo r the actual trial data w ill be longitudinal mixed 
effects models to model the correlation structure of  all hot flash frequency data at each week from 
baseline to week 12.  Due to software limitations, the simulations only assume available data of 
Week 4, so the performance characteristics in this report are likely conservative.  SIMULATION RESULTS 
 For dose-response curve 1 (DRCID_1), power is approximately 90% for both the adaptive and the non-adaptive designs - highest for the (Emax 90 & 93%; Tstat 85 & 89%; non-adaptive design (88 & 89%).  The adaptive designs achieve this power with slightly smaller overall sample 
sizes (~148 for Emax, ~145 for Tstat), since they have potential for early stopping for futility.  Note that all of the adaptive designs, except th e Emax 3-cohort design, assign fewer subjects to 
the lower 2 doses that have TRUE underlying mean  hot flash values less than the lower target 
value 6, and assign the majority of subjects to doses 3 and 4, the former having TRUE response 
equal to the lower target value 6.  The Emax 3-cohort design assigns more subjects to Dose1 
(which has TRUE underlying response 4) than to doses 2 and 3 in order to best fit the lower 
portion of the Emax model.  All of the adaptive designs assign most subjects to Dose 4.  The 
subtle distinction between the Emax and Tstat ad aptive designs (more spread of subjects across 
the dose range via Emax design than via Tstat design) arises since the Emax design estimates target doses via optimally fitting the Emax model, whereas the Tstat design seeks to assign most subjects to the two doses closest to the target le vels of response.  The average estimated target 
doses for both designs are very close to the TR UE target values (>4 for the upper target and 
approximately dos e3 for the lower target.  Howe ver, only approximately 2/3 of the simulations 
actually estimate the target dose exactly at Dose3 for the lower target, but nearly all simulations estimate the lower target dose at Dose3, or Dose4 (i.e., at or adjacent to the correct / TRUE target dose).  For dose response curves 2,3 and 4 (DRCID_2, DRCI D_3, DRCID_4) power is at least 94% for 
the adaptive designs, and generally similar to  that for the non-adaptive 1-cohort designs.  The 
Emax design achieves this power with somewhat  smaller average sample sizes (N=133-146) than 
the Tstat and non-adaptive designs. The Tstat design sample sizes are N=146-149 because in a 
small portion of trials the design incorrectly stops early for futility - note the software does not permit inclusion of early stopping for an efficacy conclusion [NOTE: in the actual trial, the same 
early stopping criteria can be employed with the Tstat design as with the Emax design; it is just that the simulation software does not have that feature for the Tstat design].  Note also that the Emax design assigns more subjects to dose 4 (t he highest dose) in order to fit the plateau 
response level, whereas the Tstat design focuse s the dose assignments more at the doses with 
TRUE target levels of response 6 and 8.  The Ts tat design seems slightly better than the Emax 
model in estimating the target doses on average; Tstat design average estimated target doses are generally closer to TRUE target doses or mid-point of TRUE target doses when multiple doses have same TRUE target level of response.  Th e percentage of correct target dose estimates are 
generally higher for the Tstat design than for the Emax design, except for the DRCID_2 lower target dose, for which they are generally similar, but the percentages are generally similar for the Emax adaptive designs compared to the non-adaptive designs, but higher for the Tstat design than

 for the Emax and non-adaptive designs.  For the Emax  design, this is could be at least partially 
due to the early stoppages of the Emax design indicated by lower average sample sizes. 
 Type 1 error (false positive, i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis of flat dose-response curve when 
the TRUE underlying dose-response curve is fl at) was estimated via simulation in the same 
manner as performance characteristics were s imulated and summarized for the above four non-
flat dose-response curves (perfo rmance characteristics are summarized in Table 2). Type 1 error 
is estimated to be approximate ly 5% for both adaptive designs and the non-adaptive designs 
analyzed by the same methods as the adaptive de signs.  Hence, the adaptive designs adequately 
preserve type 1 error.  Note the much lower av erage sample sizes associated with the adaptive 
designs; they result from the high proportion of  adaptive designs that stop early for a futility 
conclusion (66-78%).  Finally, note the adaptive de signs assign the largest number of subjects to 
dose 4, and minimize assignment to the lower doses.   RECOMMENDATIONS for consideration 
 Simulation software limitations to  a single endpoint at a single  time point make the performance 
characteristics summarized conservative.  The actual analysis model can incorporate all time points of observation and multiple endpoints (freque ncy and severity); hence, actual statistical 
precision and performance characteristics will likely improve during the actual study beyond those levels reported in this simulation report.  An adaptive dose-finding design is preferable to the fixed randomization design since it will allocate more subjects to doses with target levels of response and/or minimize randomization to doses be low or above those with target levels of 
response.  In addition, both the Emax and Tsta t algorithms can be run at each IA and the 
suggested dose-assignments can be compared by the Data Review Committee (DRC), which can recommend the best dose ratio assignments in the context of the overall accumulated data 
available at the IA.  Alternatively, depending on the performance characteristic(s) of most interest, the better performing adaptive design on that(those) performance characteristic(s) can be chosen.   REFERENCES

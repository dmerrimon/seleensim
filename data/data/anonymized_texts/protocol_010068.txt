Pharmacokinetic 
Measures Viltolarsen levels in plasma wi ll be assessed at time points for 
each patient in which anti-vi ltolarsen antibody is detected.  
Statistical Methods Sample Size:  
The target sample size is 20 patients.  A minimum of 8 ambulant 
patients will be enrolled. 
Assuming a sample size of 20, at  least 1 adverse drug reaction 
with an incidence of 15% may be  detected at a probability of 
95% for the safety profile, which is the primary outcome.  Based 
on this, it was decided that 20 patients should be enrolled to 
confirm safety.  
Analysis Populations:  
The Safety Population will consist of all patients who received at 
least 1 dose of IP.  This will be  the primary analysis population 
for the evaluation of safety.  The modified Intent-to-Treat 
Population will consist of all pati ents who received at least 1 dose 
of IP and have a baseline assessme nt and at least 1 post-baseline 
efficacy assessment.  This will be the analysis population for the 
evaluation of efficacy. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

All measurements will be analyzed based upon the type of 
distribution, and descriptive statis tics will be presented by time 
point, as appropriate. 
Primary Safety Evaluation:  
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population.  
TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred 
term (using the Medical Dictiona ry for Regulatory Activities), by 
relationship to IP, and by intensity (Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events grade). 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation: 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses will be presented in a 
separate report. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL         Page 14 of 117 g. For each visit that includes an IP administration, vital signs w ill be performed at predose, as well as 1 hour (up to 20 minute s following completion of the 
infusion) and 2 hours ( 20 minutes) after initiation of infusion.  If a clinically signif icant change from predose is observed at 2 hours after initiat ion of 
infusion, the parameter will be measured again at 6 hours ( 20 minutes) after initiation of infusion.  Vital signs will be measured prior to any blood 
collection scheduled at the same time point and will include syst olic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rat e, and temperature (modality for 
determining temperature should be consistent for each pati ent at all assessment time po ints throughout the study).  
h. Physical and neurological examinations will include an assessmen t of the following: general appearance, HEENT, skin, lymph node s, heart, including 
rhythm, heart sounds and presence of cardiac abnormalities, lung s, abdomen, extremities/joints, nervous system, and any additio nal assessments necessary to 
establish baseline status or evaluate symptoms or adverse experiences as detailed in Section 9.10 . 
i. ECGs will be performed with the patient having rested for at leas t 5 minutes, and the patient should remain in the supine or se mi-recumbent position.  
A consistent position should be maintained for each individual patient.   
j. Renal ultrasound will include imaging of the ki dneys, ureters, and bladder.  Beginning with the Week 25 Visit, renal ultrasound  can occur up to 2 weeks 
prior to or after the scheduled week, as needed for scheduling purposes. 
k. Beginning with the Week 25 Visit, echocardiogram can occur up to 2 weeks prior to or af ter the scheduled week, as needed for sc heduling purposes. 
l. Any blood sampling that occurs during the IP infusion should be collected from the opp osite arm.  Post-infusion PK blood sample s should not be drawn 
from the cannula that was used for the infusion.  These samples can be drawn from the arm opposite the infusion or can be from a separate access point in 
the same arm as the infusion. 
m. Refer to Table 3 for additional details on the clinical laboratory tests, includin g the laboratory analytes that will be measured for hematology , serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis.   
n. Patients will collect a first morning void urine sample on the da te of the specified visit and bring it to the site.  Analysis of the sample will include urine 
dipstick protein to be performed at the site.  An aliquot will also be sent to the central laboratory for urinalysis.  Refer to  Section 11.12.1  for details on 
monitoring of renal function and urine analyses. 
o. To be performed on a predose urine sample collected on-site. 
p. To be performed on a urine sample collected within 5 hours after completion of infusion. 
q. To be collected predose and will be performed on serum blood samples.  
r. PK blood samples will be collected predose (within  60 minutes prior to infusion) and 2 hours ( 20 minutes) after initiation of infusion at Weeks 25, 37, and 
48; and 6 hours (  20 minutes) after initiation of infusion at Week 48. 
s. Function and strength tests will include the following: Brooke and Vignos scales, PUL, N SAA, and hand-held dynamometer. 
t. TSQM , PODCI, and PARS III Questionnaire.  No te: TSQM will b e administered only at Week  25 and Week 48.  PODCI and PARS III Ques tionnaire will 
not be administered at Week 48.  
u. ActiGraph GT9x will be provided at Screening; 10 h our daytime + full nighttime wear for full study period.  
v. IP infusion will be administered every week within a 3-day window.  A minimum of 3 days (72 hours) should elapse between infusions.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 117 2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Rationale for Study Design, Cont rol Group, and Dose Selection 
2.1.1 Rationale for Dose Selection 
The dose (80 mg/kg/week for 48 weeks) for this study was based on the successful treatment of 
patients at 80 mg/kg/week in  Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 for up to a total of 24 weeks of 
treatment, as well as in th e Phase 1/2 Study NS-065/NCPN-0 1-P1/2 conducted in Japan 
(Japan P1/2).  Results are detailed below.   
Viltolarsen dystrophin levels and exon ski pping ratio were assessed in Japan P1/2 
(Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) and Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201.  The results are summarized 
below: 
1. Highest dystrophin production measured by Wes tern Blot at 20 to 24 weeks in both 
Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2 [n = 4]) and Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 (n = 8) 
was observed at 80 mg/kg. 
2. Average dystrophin production by group measur ed by Western Blot at 24 weeks in 
Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) was higher at 80 mg/kg (n = 4). 
3. Average dystrophin production by group excluding exon 45-52 mutati on measured by 
Western Blot at 20 to 24 weeks in both Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) and

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 25 of 117 Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 and Study NS- 065/NCNP-01-202 (extension study for 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201) have en rolled a total of 16 patient s.  As of 28 February 2018, 
there have been no apparent drug-related serious  adverse events (SAEs)  reported, and no adverse 
events (AEs) led to study drug di scontinuation.  One SAE (left tibi a/fibula fracture that required 
hospitalization for surgery, not-related to drug) was reported in June 2018.   
In summary, the dose of 80 mg/kg/week fo r 48 weeks is supported based on dystrophin 
production at 80 mg/kg/week and safety profile (w ell-tolerated for 168 week s) in the 2 studies 
(Japan P1/2 [NS065/NCNP01-P1/2] and St udy NS-065/NCNP-01-201) conducted to date. 
2.1.2 Rationale for the Primary Endpoint and Age Range 
The primary endpoint for this study is safety and tolerability.  The rationale for using incidence 
of AEs as the primary endpoint is that AEs seriously affect patient  safety and quality of life in 
daily life. 
There is an unmet need for sa fe and efficacious treatments fo r Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
(DMD); to date there is 1 marketed e xon 53 skipping agent (Vyondys 53 [Golodirsen], 
SRP-4053, Sarepta Therapeutics).  The ongoing gl obal Phase 3 study (Clinical Study Protocol: 
NS-065/NCNP-01-301) has an age range  of 4 to <8 years.  Therefor e, this study will investigate 
safety and tolerability of viltolars en for patients with DMD who are 8 years of age.  
2.1.3 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
For the comparator to assess th e secondary endpoint,  the natural history group is referred.  
Although the sponsor understands the complexity in interpreti ng an open-label study with a 
natural history, external compar ator control group due to the heterogeneity of the disease 
progression in DMD, an open-label historic al control study was designed to account for 
beneficence, ethics, and the inhe rent difficulty to enroll a placebo-controlled study after an 
accelerated approval is granted in the United States (US). 
2.1.4 Rationale for Study Duration of 56 Weeks 
Individual patient study duration is approximately 56 weeks, whic h takes into consideration the 
feasibility of patient enrollment and retention. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

2.2.1 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy – Epidem iology and Genetic/Biochemical Basis 
DMD is a disorder of progressive weakness leadi ng to severe disability and ultimately death 
caused by a deficiency of the dystrophin protein.  The reported prevalence of DMD is 15.9 cases 
per 100,000 live male births in the US and 19.5 cas es per 100,000 live male births in the United 
Kingdom ( Ryder et al, 2017 ; Mendell et al , 2012 ; Moat et al, 2013 ).  The symptoms of DMD are 
often first noted at about 3 to 5 years of age, although clinical manifesta tions may be present as 
early as the first year of life.  Proximal leg weak ness impairs mobility and precludes the ability to 
run or to rise from a squatting position.  Comple te loss of ambulation follows, with a progressive 
decline of upper extremity strength and function.  Declines in respirat ory and cardiac function 
contribute to morbidity later in the disease,  ultimately culminating in early lethality 
(Birnkrant et al, [Part 1], 2018 ; Birnkrant et al, [Part 2], 2018 ).  The impact of this debilitating 
condition on those affected by it and their families is significant.  
The biochemical basis of DMD is the absence of  a functional dystrophin protein in striated 
muscle tissue that is essential for healthy muscle  function and muscle fibe r integrity.  In normal 
striated muscle the cytoplasmic dystrophin protein links intracellular actin w ith the extracellular 
matrix to provide structural stab ility of the muscle cell membrane.  In the majority of patients 
with DMD, dystrophin protein is not produced becau se of out-of-frame mutations characterized 
by a deletion of one or more e xons from the dystrophin gene, whic h is located on the short arm 
of the X chromosome.  Dystrophin mutations in  which some dystrophin pr otein function remains 
are associated with a similar but often milder phenotype, classified as Becker muscular 
dystrophy (BMD).  DMD and BMD exhibi t X-linked recessive inheritance. 
2.2.2 Current Natural History, Disease Manage ment, and Treatment Recommendations 
The Cooperative International Neuromuscular Re search Group (CINRG) conducted the largest 
prospective multicenter natural history study to date in DMD, the CINRG DMD Natural History 
Study (DNHS) ( McDonald et al, 2013 ; Henricson et al, 2013 ; McDonald et al, 2018 ).  The study 
included >400 boys and men with DMD, with va riable amounts of l ongitudinal follow-up over 
the course of a decade (2006 to 2016).  The study had annual follow-up visits that included timed 
function tests, muscle strength, functional assess ment questionnaires, pulm onary function tests, 
and quality of life assessments.   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Clinical Study Protocol: NS-065/NCNP-01-211 v2.0 21Mar2022
NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 117 Since there is currently no cure for DMD, the goal of care is to provide th e best quality of life 
through all stages of the disease.   To date, treatments focus on  optimizing strength and function 
through the use of pharmacologica l interventions, physical ther apy, and assistive and adaptive 
devices. 
2.2.3 Glucocorticoid Treatment 
At present, treatment with glucocorticoid  (GC) medication is the only pharmacological 
intervention that has been shown to slow the decl ine of strength and function in DMD patients.  
The two main GCs used in DMD are prednisone  and deflazacort (EMF LAZA™).  Daily oral 
administration of prednisone or deflazacort stabi lizes or improves muscle strength and prolongs 
ambulation ( Drachman et al, 1974 ; Brooke et al, 1987 ; Griggs et al, 1993 ; Mendell et al, 1989 ; 
Griggs et al, 1991 ; Fenichel et al, 1991 ).  The mechanism by whic h GCs are beneficial in 
dystrophin deficiency is likely multifactoria l, including anti-inflammatory actions.  The 
immunosuppressive effects of GC s may not be beneficial, and other immunosuppressants have 
not shown benefit (Griggs et al, 1993 ).  On 09 February 2017, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved EMFLAZA™ for th e treatment of patients 5 years of age and 
older with DMD.   
In 2005, the American Academy of Neurology issued a practi ce parameter regarding GC 
treatment in DMD and recommended that GC should be offered as treatment, despite known side 
effects ( Moxley et al, 2005 ).  The significant side effects of  GCs include Cushingoid features, 
adverse behavioral changes, wei ght gain, growth retardation, in creased risk for bone fractures, 
gastritis, cataracts, hypertension, susceptibility to infe ction, and masking of response to stress 
(Matthews et al, 2016 ). 
2.2.4 Dystrophin Restoring Interventions 
New therapies based on specific genotypes are in development.  Small molecules that can read 
through nonsense mutations could potentially trea t approximately 13% of DMD patients 
(Bushby et al, 2014 ).  On 31 July 2014, ataluren wa s granted conditional approval by the 
European Medicines Agency.  Exon skipping, which uses antisense oligonuc leotides to alter the 
splicing pattern of the genes, is designed to  bring out-of-frame dele tions into frame.  The 
technology of exon skipping utilizes  antisense oligonucleotides that  bind to a specific sequence 
in the messenger ribonucleic acid (m RNA) to alter splicing of exons.  By this means, specific [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28 of 117 exons can be excluded from the final transcript  that is exported to the cytoplasm from the 
nucleus; hence the term “exon skip ping.”  By the design of the o ligonucleotide, th e out-of-frame 
deletion can be enlarged to include the adjacent exon such that the resul ting deletion is in-frame 
(Kole et al, 2015 ).  
This new type of treatment could potentially treat 80% of DMD patients who have large-scale 
deletion or duplication mutati ons in the dystrophin gene ( Aartsma-Rus et al, 2009 ).  The full 
characterization of DMD patient mutations and further development of the technology will be 
crucial to fully realize these novel therapies as they are developed. 
Three oligonucleotides , Eteplirsen (Exondys 51®), Golodirsen (VYONDYS 53®), and 
Viltolarsen (VILTEPSO™), received accelerated approval fro m the US FDA based on increased 
dystrophin expression in treated pa tients.  Viltolarsen also rece ived accelerated approval from 
the Pharmaceutical and Medica l Devices Agency in Japan.  They are phosphorodiamidate 
morpholino oligomers (PMOs) ( Mendell et al, 2013 ; Clemens et al, 2020 ; Frank et al, 2020 ).  
Eteplirsen (Exondys 51®), approved by FDA on 19 Septem ber 2016, targets exon 51 skipping, 
with dystrophin increase of ~0.4% after 48 week s of treatment and ~ 0.9% after 188 weeks of 
treatment ( Charleston et al, 2018 ).  Golodirsen (VYONDYS 53®), approved by FDA on 
12 December 2019, targets exon 53 skipping, with dystr ophin increase of 0.9% after 48 weeks of 
treatment.  Viltolarsen (VILTEPSO™), approved by FDA on 12 August 2020, also targets 
exon 53 skipping, with dystrophin increase of 5.3% after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment.  These 
drugs now need to provide supporting data that they slow disease progression as measured by 
functional outcome measures.   
Casimersen (a PMO under development) target s exon 45 skipping, with dystrophin increase of 
0.8% after 48 weeks of treatment.  A placebo-cont rolled global Phase 3 study of golodirsen and 
casimersen is currently ongoing.  
A dose-finding safety clinical  study is being conducted with  SRP-5051, a peptide conjugate 
PMO targeting exon 51.  Although SRP-5051 improves tissue uptake, it is known to be toxic. 
2.3 Background on Viltolarsen 
Viltolarsen is a novel antisense oligonucleotid e for the treatment of DMD, which has been 
discovered jointly by National Center of Neurolo gy and Psychiatry (NCNP), which is a National [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 117 Research and Development Agency in Japan, and Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd.  Details of data 
summarized in the following sections can be found in the Investig ator’s Brochure (IB). 
2.3.1 Mechanism of Action 
Viltolarsen is designed to interact with the dys trophin gene ribonucleic acid (RNA) and alter the 
exon/intron splicing patterns.  The mechanism of action is for viltolarsen to bind to a specific 
sequence in or near exon 53 of  the dystrophin pre-RNA transc ript and block the exon/intron 
splicing of exon 53, leading to mature mRNA tran scripts that lack exon 53.  Viltolarsen is 
thought to be effective on DMD patients with exon deletions amenable to skipping of exon 53 
such as 43-52, 45-52, 47-52, 48-52, 49-52, 50-52, or 52.  The loss of exon 53 restores the mRNA 
reading frame, thus converti ng a DMD (out-of-frame) deletion mutation to a Becker-like 
(in-frame) deletion mutation.  In -frame deletion mutations are typically compatible with 
production of a shortened dystrophin protein, although the resulting Becker-like dystrophin 
protein will be smaller in mo lecular weight compared to the normal dystrophin protein, and 
likely lower in abundance (quant ity) compared to normal muscle, and thus may have lower 
function than normal amounts of  wild-type dystrophin protein. 
2.3.2 Summary of Nonclinical Findings 
2.3.2.1  Pharmacology 
Viltolarsen (0 to 10 μmol/L) demonstrated sustained e xon 53 skipping and dystrophin protein 
expression for at least 2 weeks in  cells from a DMD patient with deletion of exons 45-52 and in 
cells from a DMD patient with deletion of e xons 48-52.  In cynomolgus  monkeys, a dose of 
60 mg/kg viltolarsen resulted in  exon 53 skipping in the right gastrocnemius muscles and the 
cardiac muscle in a 12-w eek intermittent intravenous (IV) toxicity study. 
The potential off-target effect of viltolarsen and its n 1 mers among all human mRNA sequences 
was assessed by in silico  and in vitro  approaches.  Taken together, while CX3CL1 , APCDD1 , 
FUT1 , CNTNAP2,  and MYT1  showed some predicted and st atistically significant changes on 
mRNA expression, the clinical rele vance for these moderate diffe rences in terms of protein 
expression or predicte d effects on physiology in vivo  is questionable. 
Viltolarsen did not display any adverse effects in in vitro  and in vivo  cardiovascular, in vivo 
central nervous system, or in vivo  respiratory safety pharmacology studies.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 30 of 117 2.3.2.2  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic analyses revealed no apparent species differences for 
viltolarsen.  None of the in vitro  or in vivo  metabolism studies showed any distinct evidence of 
metabolism of viltolarsen.  After IV administration, time of maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) occurred at the first sampling time after the in jection or at the end of  the infusion for mice, 
rats, and monkeys.  C max and area under the curve (AUC) increased with dose, and most 
increases were approximately pr oportional to dose, with some in creases being greater than dose 
proportional.  For rats, the mean values for the terminal elim ination half-life (t 1/2) were 1.19, 
1.19, and 10.5 hours for 6, 20, and 60 mg/kg, respectivel y.  For monkeys, the mean values for t 1/2 
ranged from 1.7 to 3.5 hours.  For mice and monk eys, exposure did not change with 12 or 
13 weeks of repeat dosing. 
The fraction of viltolarsen bound to rat, m onkey, and human serum proteins was low, 40%, for 
all species and was independent of  concentration.  The distributi on of viltolarsen into red blood 
cells was 2.5%, 6.7%, and 3.5% for rat, monkey, and huma n, respectively, indicating low 
distribution of viltolar sen to red blood cells.  Quantitativ e whole-body autoradiography studies 
showed wide tissue distribution of [14C] viltolarsen in both mice a nd monkeys, with the highest 
concentrations observed in the kidney, and general distribution to muscle tissues.  For both rats 
and monkeys, renal excretion was the major route of eliminat ion, with less than 10% in the feces.  
No radioactivity was in the expi red air from the rats.  Most of  the radioactivity was excreted 
within the first 24 hours.  Howeve r, small measurable amounts continued to be excreted in the 
urine and feces throughout th e 7-day collection periods.  
Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to cyto chrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (inhibition constant [K i] 
value: 1.44 mmol/L), while no inhibitory eff ects were observed to other CYPs (CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 ).  Viltolarsen did not induce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.  Viltolarsen s howed weak inhibition to UGT1A1 (K i value: 
0.642 mmol/L), while no inhibitory effects were  observed to UGT2B7.  Viltolarsen was not a 
substrate of transporters  (P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K).  
Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, and BCRP (respective 
half-maximal inhibito ry concentration value: 0.4 85, 0.448, 0.176, and 1.97 mmol/L), while no [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

2.3.2.3  Toxicology 
Histopathological evaluations foll owing a single IV dose of 600 mg/kg in monkeys resulted in 
vacuolation of the epithelium of the proximal renal tubules.  No other renal changes were noted.  
Repeated administration of viltol arsen via the clinically relevant  route of administration (weekly 
IV injections) in mice, rats, and monkeys resu lted in decreases in red blood cell parameters, 
increased values for cytokines, and histopathologi cal effects in the kidney and urinary bladder.  
The kidney is the primary target organ in mice, rats, and monkeys, as shown by increased values 
in clinical chemistry parameters  indicative of renal effects (1 000 mg/kg in 4-, 13-, and 26-week 
mouse studies; 500 mg/kg in 4- and 13-week rat studi es; and 600 mg/kg in a 12-week monkey 
study) and by histopathological findings  of effects in renal tubules ( 240 mg/kg in 4-, 13-, and 
26-week mouse studies; 250 mg/kg in 4- and 13 -week rat studies; and 200 mg/kg in 12- and 
39-week monkey studies) accompanied by increased kidney weight at necropsy.  An additional 
histopathological finding in a 26-week mouse study was the presence of cytoplasmic 
eosinophilic material in the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder at 60 mg/kg.  An 
increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was observed in all toxicity studies with all species, 
mainly at the higher doses.  Th e main causes of an increase in BUN are high protein diet, 
decrease in glomerular filtra tion rate (GFR) (suggestive of re nal failure) and in blood volume 
(hypovolemia), congestive heart fa ilure, gastrointestinal hemorr hage, fever, and increased 
catabolism.  In the toxicity studies with vilto larsen, BUN increases were considered to be 
attributable to a decrease in GFR.  Based on th ese data, the no observed adverse effect levels 
(NOAELs) were concluded to be 60 and 15 mg/kg in 13- and 26-week mouse studies, 
respectively, and 60 mg/kg in 12-  and 39-week monkey studies.  
Results from in vitro  and in vivo  genotoxicity studies were ne gative, and studi es showed no 
evidence of chromosomal aberrations. 
In a study of the effects of viltolarsen on fertility and early em bryonic development to 
implantation by intermittent IV administration, no  toxicologically signifi cant changes were noted 
in copulation rate, copulatory interval, fertility rate, necr opsy, organ weights (testes or [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

implantation rate, preimplantati on loss rate, number of live embryos, embryonic viability rate, 
number of postimplantation losses, or postimpla ntation loss rate.  The NOAELs of viltolarsen 
were 240 mg/kg for general toxicity (based  on increases in BUN) and 1000 mg/kg for 
reproductive function and early embryonic development (no cha nges observed at the highest 
tested dose). 
Viltolarsen administered to juvenile male mice ( from PND7) (subcutaneous [SC] or IV) at doses 
up to 2000 mg/kg once-weekly (up to 4 weeks) or up to 1200 mg/kg once-weekly (up to 
10 weeks) suggested tolerability up to 240 mg/kg,  after which evidence of toxic effects to the 
kidney were observed (tubular degeneration, basoph ilia, and vacuolation and chronic progressive 
nephropathy in the kidneys at 240 mg/kg).  The NOAEL for general toxicity of viltolarsen is 
60 mg/kg, and for bone growth/geometry and ju venile neurotoxicity of viltolarsen is 
1200 mg/kg.  No toxicity specific to juvenile animals was noted. 
IV injections of 200 mg/kg showed acceptable local tolerances in cynomolgus monkeys, but 
600 mg/kg IV injections induced si gns of inflammation at the injection site into SC tissue.  
Similarly, intramuscular injec tions of 100 mg/kg were not su itable for administration of 
viltolarsen, showing inflammation of the injection site. 
No anti-viltolarsen antibodies were  detected in the 4-, 13-, or 26-week mouse studies, or in a 
39-week monkey study.  Anti-viltolars en antibodies were detected in 1 male at 200 mg/kg in a
12-week monkey study and 1 male at 500 mg/kg in a 13-week rat study.  However, antibody
detection was not considered to affect the toxicological evalua tion in this study, since skipping
efficiency was confirmed in the muscle of this monkey at the e nd of the treatment period and no
remarkable alteration in exposure to viltola rsen was observed after repeated dosing.
No toxicological differences were noted between lots of viltolarsen produced from an initial 
solid phase and the new liquid phas e (LP2, LP2) synthetic process. 
Viltolarsen was administered once weekly for 26 weeks at a dose level of 0 (vehicle: 
physiological saline), 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg (51 mice per group) to male 
CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic mice via IV route with a bolus injection.  After the terminal necropsy,

subsequent histopathological examinations on these 3 mice, transitional cell carcinoma was 
noted.  Histopathological examination of the ureters for the other mice was conducted and no 
further tumorigenic changes were identified.  Additionally, no treatment-related tumors were 
noted in any other organs.  The blood concen tration of viltolarsen in mice who received 
50 mg/kg/week was lower than the blood concentrati on of viltolarsen expect ed in human patients 
who will receive 80 mg/kg/week. 
2.3.3 Summary of Clinical Findings 
A Phase 1 investigator-initiat ed study (Study NCNP/DMT01) ( ClinicalTrials.gov: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) of viltolarsen injection was conducted in  DMD patients (aged 5 to 18 years) to 
investigate the overall usefulness of viltolarsen injection in the treatment of DMD, based on 
evaluations of safety, ex ploration of predictive markers of tr eatment response, and assessment of 
PK.  A total of 10 DMD patients were enrolled  and randomized.  IV infusion of viltolarsen 
injection in doses of 1.25, 5, and 20 mg/kg to DMD patients once weekly for 12 weeks was well 
tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxi city was observed, although all patients had at least one AE.  
Moreover, neither SAEs nor incidences of Common Terminology Crite ria for AEs (CTCAE) 
version 4.0-JCOG (Japanese translation, publishe d by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group) Grade 
3 (severe) or worse were reported.  
Among the mild and moderate AEs, an increase in  beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (Grade 1) 
was found in all patients in both Cohorts 1 and 2 (Cohort 1 [n = 3], Cohort 2 [n = 3]) and in all 
but 1 patient in Cohort 3 (Cohort 3 [n = 4]).  
Initially, testing appeared to reve al proteinuria in 8 of 10 patients.   However, it was subsequently 
determined that there was a cross reaction between viltolarsen and the pyrogallol red dye-binding 
method, which was used for urinary protein measur ement, resulting in a fa lse positive result for 
protein in the 24-hour pooled urine samples.  To evaluate the 24-hour pooled urine samples for 
protein, the Coomassie brilliant bl ue method was used to remeasur e urinary protein in the frozen 
urine samples.  None of the retested samples sh owed urinary protein leve ls exceeding the normal 
range of the institution (i.e., 31.2 to 120 mg/day ).  Current studies ut ilize a urine protein 
benzethonium chloride method, using reagents that do not cross react with viltolarsen.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 117 Viltolarsen exhibited no cro ss reactivity with the benzet honium chloride method up to 
500 mg/dL.  
The 24-hour pooled urine samples di d not show increased levels of albumin.  Spot measurements 
of urinary albumin were positive in 7 patients (Grade 1).  
Interleukin (IL) levels were increased (Grade 1)  in the serum in 6 out of 10 patients (high IL-6 
level in 4 subjects, high IL-1 β level in 1 subject, and high IL-2 level in 1 subject), and some level 
of anemia (Grade 1) was observe d in 7 out of 10 patients.  
Increased levels of brain natriure tic peptide (Grade 1) in serum were present in 4 patients.  White 
blood cell count (WBC) was increased in 3 patients  (Grade 1).  All other mild and moderate AEs 
occurred in 2 or fewer patients. 
The C max and AUC values increased in a dose-dependent manner, and the t 1/2 value was between 
1.52 and 1.84 hours. 
Distinct exon 53 skipping efficiency  by RT-PCR, positive dystrophin fibers by 
immunofluorescent staining, and dys trophin protein expression by Weste rn blot were detected in 
1 patient in Cohort 3, who was the largest patien t enrolled in the cohort and hence received the 
largest absolute dose of viltolarsen inj ection that was administered in the study.

Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2 and Study NS-065/NCNP- 01-201 of viltolarsen were completed; 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-202 remain s ongoing.  Results for all st udies are detailed below. 
Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2 
Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2 was a Phase 1/2 study of viltolarsen injection conducted in Japan.  
This was a multicenter, parallel -group, open-label, 24-week study.  Patients received weekly IV 
administration of viltolarsen in jection 250 mg (40 and 80 mg/kg) over 24 weeks.  The primary 
efficacy endpoint of this study was dystrophin pr otein expression as measured by Western blot, 
immunofluorescence stai ning, and RT-PCR.  Sixteen DMD patients amenable to exon 53 
skipping, aged 5 to <18 years were enrolled.   
Viltolarsen injection was well tolerated in up to  the highest administered dose of 80 mg/kg; no 
SAEs were observed, 1 SAE (upper respiratory tract infection, Gr ade 2, not-related to drug) was [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 117 reported, and no patients discontinued study drug administration as a result of an AE.  AEs 
included 84 Grade 1 AEs in 10 patients, 11 Grade 2 AEs in 5 patients, and no Grade 3 AEs.  The 
Grade 2 AEs included nasopharyngitis and eczema , each in 2 patients, and miliaria (a common 
disorder of eccrine sweat gla nds), pharyngitis, ejecti on fraction decreased, ligament sprain, and 
urine protein present, each in 1 patient.  No evidence for immunogenicity was found in any 
Phase 1/2 study patient, as no anti-viltolarsen or  anti-dystrophin antibodi es were detected in 
DMD patients receiving 40 or 80 mg /kg viltolarsen injection in th is study.  Under the conditions 
of this clinical study, viltolarsen  injection was safe and well tole rated up to 80 mg/kg, the highest 
dose in this study. 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 was a Phase 2 stud y conducted in the US and Canada.   
This was a multicenter, 24-week dose finding study to assess th e safety, tolerability, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics of viltolarsen  in boys with DMD.  Patients received weekly IV 
administration of viltolarsen inje ction 250 mg (40 and 80 mg/kg) or  placebo for the first 4 weeks, 
followed by weekly IV administra tion of viltolarsen injection 250 mg (40  and 80 mg/kg) over 
the remaining 20 weeks.  The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was dystrophin protein 
expression as measured by Western  blot.  Sixteen DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping, 
aged 4 to <10 years were enrolled.  There were  no apparent drug-related SAEs reported, and no 
AEs led to study drug discontinuation.  There we re 59 treatment-emergen t AEs (TEAEs) with 
23 TEAEs from patients in the low-dose cohor t and 36 TEAEs from patients in the high-dose 
cohort.  Fifty-four of the 59 TEAEs were reporte d as mild in severity, with 5 from the high-dose 
cohort reported as moderate in se verity.  There were 55 AEs deem ed unrelated to study drug and 
7 as unlikely related. 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-202 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-202 is the extension study for Study NS-064/NCPN-01-201 and is 
being conducted in the US and Canada.  There are currently 16 DMD patie nts enrolled.  Thus 
far, there have been no apparent drug-rela ted SAEs reported, no AEs led to study drug 
discontinuation, and 1 SAE (lef t tibia/fibula fracture require d hospitalization for surgery, 
not-related to drug) was reported in June 2018.   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

2.4.1 Viltolarsen 
There were no important identifie d risks of viltolarsen in the current clinical development 
program.  Identified important potential risks from nonclinical studies were renal disorder, 
hepatic dysfunction, anemia, drug allergy, and immune activation.  No serious adverse reactions 
were recognized in the reporting period of th e current Drug Safety Update Report (14 May 2019 
to 13 May 2020), and there were no actions taken for safety reasons, or any significant changes 
in the IB. 
At present, none of the safety ri sks identified during the current reporting period were considered 
to be important risks.  Further, nonclinical a dverse effects previously identified as important 
potential risks have not been  observed in any of the human  studies conducted to date. 
2.4.2 Procedures 
Risks due to study-related procedures are detailed below. 
Blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, a nd PK is associated with the usual risks of 
a blood draw which include pain, bruising at th e point where the blood is taken, redness and 
swelling of the vein, infection, a nd a rare risk of fainting.  In order to decrease any of these 
possible risks the sites will employ pediatric tr ained staff and will use a numbing cream, if 
desired by the patient, to reduce the risk of pain. 
Function and strength tests will be performed during this study.  These include the Brooke and 
Vignos scales, Performance of Upper Limb (PUL ), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), 
and hand-held dynamometer.  All te sts are associated with muscle  soreness, fatigue, and falls. 
Quantitative muscle strength by hand-held dynamome ter may cause fatigue and muscle soreness. 
While wearing the ActiGraph GT9x on the wrist, there is a small risk for discomfort or redness at 
the wear site.  Padding will be provided and patien ts will be instructed to remove the ActiGraph 
if they experience any discomfort (i.e., redness,  irritation, pressure points) and contact the 
investigator immediately.

Viltolarsen administered at 80 mg/kg/week is safe and well tolerated and ameliorates the clinical 
course of ambulant and non-am bulant boys with DMD as a ssessed by a muscle functional 
measure.  The improvement in function is due to an increas e in muscle tissue dystrophin 
expression. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 2, open-label study with DMD boys  receiving 80 mg/kg v iltolarsen administered 
IV at weekly doses in ambulant and non-ambulant boys 8 years of age with DMD over a 
48-week Treatment Period.  See Section 1.1  for study schema. 
5.1.1 Number of Centers 
The study will be conducted at approximately 10  study sites in approximately 6 countries, 
including China, Italy, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and the US. 
5.2 Design Implementation 
5.2.1 Randomization 
Not applicable. 
5.2.2 Investigational Product Dosing 
The dose per patient (in milligra ms) will be calculated based on body weight in kilograms, 
collected per the protocol.  Details of dose prep aration can be found in the study Investigational 
Product Information Manual (IPIM).  Doses will be  administered by an IV infusion over a 1-hour 
period.  All missed or incomplete doses will be  documented.  The dispensed investigational 
product (IP) vials will be stored at the research  site until drug accountability is verified by the 
pharmacy monitor.   
In the event it becomes necessary, or at the discretion of the pare nt/guardian, in consultation with 
the investigator and consulti ng surgeon and following adequa tely informed and voluntary 
patient/guardian consent and child assent, a to tally implantable central venous access device 
(TICVAD) may be used, continge nt upon approval by local and/or  country-specific regulatory 
body(ies).  Implantable central venous access (CVA)  ports will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for patients who experience difficulty with peripheral venous access.  Discussions 
regarding implantable ports  for patients will include  the study site investig ator, medical monitor, 
and sponsor.  Before final decision, NS Phar ma, Inc. will obtain documentation from the 
investigator that the consulting surgeon who w ill place the port holds hospital privileges as a 
board eligible/board certified  surgeon.  Implantation shoul d not proceed without sponsor [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 40 of 117 approval.  Care of the TICVAD (including as eptic access and flushing) and patient monitoring 
must be performed by qualified personnel according to the site’s standard operating procedure.   
An alternative method of CVA may only be considered in the case of a documented 
contraindication to the placement of a TICVAD. 
5.2.3 Potential Design Modifications Due to Toxicities 
Dose reductions may be necessary for individual patients.  The dose level will be determined 
jointly by the investigator, study chair, and medi cal monitor in consultation with the sponsor. 
5.2.4 Dose Interruptions 
Infusion interruptions may be necessary for individual patients.  Infusion interruptions should be 
handled in accordance with standard proce dures should an acute re action occur during an 
infusion.  Sites should notify the me dical monitor in the event of an infusion interruption due to 
an acute reaction. 
5.3 Study Duration and Dates 
The expected study duration for each patient is approximately 56 weeks.  The Pretreatment 
Phase will last approximately 28 days (inclusive of  Screening Visit and Pretreatment Visit).  The 
Treatment Phase will last approximately 48 weeks.  The follow-up phase is 30 days. 
5.3.1 End of Study Definition 
Primary Completion: The primary completion date is  the same as the end of  study date and is the 
date when the last patient has completed the study (i.e., last pa tient last visit). 
If the study concludes prior to th e primary completion date origin ally planned in the protocol 
(i.e., early termination of the study ), then the primary completion da te will be the date when the 
last patient is assessed or receiv es an intervention for evaluation in  the study (i.e., last patient last 
visit). 
End of Study: The end of study date is defined as the date when th e last patient at the site is 
assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation  in the study (i.e., last patient last visit). 
5.3.2 End of Treatment 
End of treatment is defined as the last assessment for the protoc ol-specified Treatment Phase of 
the study for an individual patient. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

9.1 Time and Events Schedule 
The Schedules of Study Asse ssments are described in  Table 1  and Table 2 ; however, a patient 
can be seen at any time for reas ons of safety.  Study events are divided into the following phases: 
 Pretreatment Phase:  
o From execution of informed consent/HI PAA authorization/assent until Day -1 
 Treatment Phase:  
o From Day 1 (first infusion) until Week 48 (last infusion) 
 End-of-Treatment Phase:  
o The 30-day interval (including Week 49) be ginning after completion of the 48-week 
Treatment Phase and ending af ter a final phone call for colle ction of any information 
about AEs, concomitant medications , and actigraphy for all patients   
9.1.1 Home Infusion Option 
Home infusion is not required fo r participation in this study.  The option of home infusion should 
be considered if the investigator believes that it will help the patient to derive safety, benefit, and 
convenience from participation in the study.  The option of home infusi on would alleviate the 
need for the patient to visit th e primary study site fo r study treatment.  The routine study visits 
that are eligible to be conduc ted in the home are limited to t hose whose study procedures do not 
extend beyond the following list: IP  administration; vital signs collection; review of medical, 
surgical, concomitant medication, and treatment history; laborato ry procedures; actigraphy; and 
AE review.  If necessary, an unscheduled visit may also be conducted by  home-health.  See the 
Schedules of Study Assessments (Table 1  and Table 2 ) for additional details.  
Participation in optional home infusion requi res written approval fro m the study sponsor, 
medical monitor, and investigator.  The investigat or will submit the request for approval of home 
infusion to the medical monitor and sponsor, both of whom must provide approval for the home 
infusion. 
As advised by the medical mon itor and investigator, infusion s taking place outside of the 
primary study site (e.g., home infu sion) would only be considered  starting at the Week 6 study 
visit or after, and only if the patient had not experienced any si gnificant AEs related to infusion [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

services (such as 911) to be eligible to partic ipate in home infusions.  The safety monitoring by 
the investigator, sponsor, and medical monitor wi ll continue throughout the Treatment Phase for 
all study visits, regardless of whether the infusion occurs at the st udy site or the home.  
Furthermore, the investigator will be responsible  for immediate contact wi th the medical monitor 
for any safety concern, regardless of whether the infusion occurs at  the study site or the home. 
Home infusions will only be considered starting at  the Week 6 study visit or after.  Visits with 
additional assessments (Weeks 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 37, 48, and 49 [or early ter mination]) should be 
conducted at the prima ry study site.   
9.2 Informed Consent 
Each patient and/or patient’s pare nt or legal guardian will receive an explanation of the nature 
and purposes of the study from the investigator or  designee.  The investigator or designee will 
ensure the study is appropriate for the patient.  Consent must be obtained in accordance with the 
principles outlined in the current version of the D eclaration of Helsinki.  The patient or patient’s 
parent or guardian (if patient is  a minor) will confirm that s/he understands that the study is for 
research purposes only and that it may not provide any therapeutic  benefit to the individual.  
Each patient and patient’s parent or guardian (if patient is a minor) will confirm that s/he 
understands that the patient is fre e to withdraw from the study at  any time without prejudice.  
The investigator or designee will review the elements of the HIPAA and Protected Health 
Information (PHI) with each pati ent and/or patient’s parent or guardian and each patient and/or 
patient’s parent or guardian will confirm that s/he understands HIPAA authorization and PHI.  
The investigator (or designated staff) will obt ain the written informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization on the approved in formed consent form (ICF) by the appropriate Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Commi ttee (IEC) at each site, from the patient or 
patient’s parent or guardian (i f the patient is a minor) prior to any study-related procedures, 
including agreement for discontinuation of any prohibited medi cations, prior to the start of the 
study.  The written assent of mi nor patients will be obt ained per individual site guidelines.  
The ICF must be dated and signed by the investigator or designee and the patient or the patient’s 
legal representative (if the patient is a minor) a nd the original signed cons ent form must be kept [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

judicial or other body authorized under applicab le law to consent on behalf of a prospective 
study patient to the patient’s part icipation in the procedure(s) i nvolved in the research.  The study 
patient’s legal representative will rece ive a copy of the signed consent form. 
If the ICF is amended during the study, the investigator must follow all applicable regulatory 
requirements pertaining to all ne w patients and repeat the consen t process with the amended ICF 
for any ongoing patients. 
9.3 Assignment of Patient Identification Number 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-211 participation begins once written informed consent/assent is 
obtained from the patient or the parent/legal guardian for a patient (if the patient is a minor) 
before any study-specific pr ocedures are performed.  
Following the signing of the written ICF/Assent  Form, patients will be assigned a unique, 
site-specific, 6-digit patient identification number in sequentia l order of scre ening into the 
study.  The patient identification nu mber will be assigned by the site  at the time of submission of 
the de-identified genetic test report to the central  genetic counselor to confirm that the patient 
meets the genetic diagnostic eligibility criteria .  If the de-identified genetic test report is 
submitted to the central genetic counselor prior to  signing of the ICF (only if acceptable per local 
IRB/IEC), then the report will have personal health informati on removed prior to sending for 
review.  
All data will be identified using the unique pa tient identification number.   The assigned patient 
identification number will be re tained through enrollment and throughout participation in the 
study.  Patient identification numbe rs assigned to patients who fail  screening may not be used 
again.   
Each investigator will keep a Pati ent Identification log relating th e names of the patients to their 
patient identification numbers to permit efficient ve rification of patient files, when required.   
9.3.1 Screen Failures 
Patients who fail to meet inclus ion criteria are considered to be screen failures and are not 
required to return for additional visits (although a patient can be seen by the investigator at any 
time for safety reasons).  Patie nts who have failed screening ma y be retested up to 2 times [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

repeat all Screening procedures.  This full resc reening may be performed  up to 2 times, after 
which the patient is no longer eligible for the study. 
If rescreening is more than 90 da ys since a current ICF/Assent Fo rm has been signed and/or the 
consent form has been modified fr om their original consent, patie nts should be reconsented prior 
to rescreening procedures. 
9.4 Genetic Confirmation of Diagnosis 
As part of the Screening assess ments, the central gene tic counselor will revi ew the de-identified 
genetic report to confirm the pa tient’s DMD diagnosis and presence of a mutation that  is eligible 
for skipping of exon 53.  The date  of diagnosis, method of diagnosis, and diagnosis results will 
be documented in source documents a nd captured in the relevant eCRF.   
A DMD genetic test at Screeni ng will be conducted in order to obtain uniform DMD mutation 
information for the exact intronic boundaries and will be analyzed by a central laboratory. 
9.5 Demographics 
The following information will be collected and documented in source documents and captured 
in the relevant eCRF: date of birth (if allowed by local regulat ions), race, ethnicity, and hand 
dominance.  If local regulations do not allow collec tion of full date of birth, then year of birth 
should be collected.  
9.6 Medical History 
The investigator or designee will obtain detail ed information regarding all past medical and 
surgical events.  The dates and descriptions of past events will be documented in source 
documents and captured in the relevant eCRF. 
9.7 Prior and Concomitant Treatment 
The investigator or designee will review prior and concomitant treatment as indicated in the 
Schedules of Study Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).  See Section 8  for additional details. 
9.8 Weight and Height 
Ulna length will be measured in all patients at the visits specified in the Schedules of Study 
Assessme nts (Table 1  and Table 2 ).  If the patient is able to sta nd, standing height will also be 
collected with the patient barefoot  (without shoes).  The patient’s le gs should be kept as close as [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

will be collected with the patient barefoot (wit hout shoes) and wearing light-weight clothes.  
These measurements are routinely performed during standard clinical exa minations of patients 
with DMD.  Weight in kilogr ams and height in centimeter s will be documented in source 
documents and captured in the relevant eCRF.   
9.9 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be performed at the visits sp ecified in the Schedules of Study Assessments 
(Table 1  and Table 2 ).   
Vital signs can be measured in the supine, semi -recumbent, or sitting position.  A consistent 
position should be maintained for each individual patient.  When ever vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, 
and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the a ssessments should occur in the 
following order: 12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood draws, with vital si gns obtained without 
repositioning.  If the patient changes position during or after the ECG assessment, then a 
5-minute rest would need to occur in the new pos ition prior to measuring v ital signs.  Otherwise, 
vital signs can be measured i mmediately after the ECG is completed, and blood draws can occur 
immediately after vital signs.  At time points af ter infusion when vital signs are measured but 
ECGs are not performed, patients should maintain the position in which they were infused.  At 
all other times when vital signs are measured but ECGs are not performed, vital signs will be 
measured after a 5-minute rest.   
For each visit that includes IP administration, vita l signs will be performed at predose, as well as 
1 hour (up to 20 minutes following comple tion of the infusion) and 2 hours ( 20 minutes) after 
initiation of infusion.  If a clinic ally significant (CS) change fro m predose is observed at 2 hours 
after initiation of infusion, the paramete r will be measured again at 6 hours ( 20 minutes) after 
initiation of infusion.   
Vital signs will be measured prior to any blood collection scheduled at the same time point and 
will include the following: 
 Systolic blood pressure 
 Diastolic blood pressure 
 Heart rate  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

 Temperature (modality for determin ing temperature should be consistent for each patient at 
all assessment time poi nts throughout the study)  
Vital signs will be documented in source documents and captured in the relevant eCRF.  Any CS 
changes noted by the investigator should be reported as an AE. 
For each patient who is eligible and has elected to receive home infusions, the investigator and 
home infusion nurse will discuss vital sign guide lines for home infusion for each patient.  The 
investigator will take into consideration the range of clinically safe vital signs that have been 
observed for the patient during pa st study site infusions.  The hom e infusion nurse will consult 
with the investigator for any confirmed vital signs outside of these guidelin es (low or high).  See 
Section 9.1.1  for additional detail s on home infusion. 
9.10 Physical and Neurological Examination 
The physical and neurological exam inations will be performed at the visits specified in the 
Schedules of Study Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ) to assess any changes in physical 
presentation and symptoms. 
Physical and neurological examinations w ill include an assessment of the following: 
 General appearance 
 Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat 
 Skin 
 Lymph nodes 
 Heart, including rhythm, heart sounds, and presence of cardiac abnormalities

9.11 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs a nd SAEs at each study visit, or patient contact 
during the study.  AEs and SAEs may be repor ted by the patient/parent, discovered upon 
questioning, or detected during ex aminations or review of test and laboratory results.  AEs and 
SAEs should be documented in the source docum ents and the relevant eCRF with a full 
description including the nature , date and time of onset a nd resolution, determination of 
seriousness, severity, causality, correc tive treatment, and outcome.  Refer to  Section 11  for safety 
procedures and reporting. 
9.12 12-Lead Electrocardiograms 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed at th e visits specified in the Schedules of Study 
Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).   
ECGs will be performed with the patient having rested for at least 5 minutes, and the patient 
should remain in the supine or semi-recumbent position.  A consistent position should be 
maintained for each individual pa tient.  Skin preparation should be thorough and electrodes 
should be placed according to standard 12-lead EC G placement.  Digital ECGs will be submitted 
to the ECG core laboratory, which will perform th e digital ECG analysis and interpretation in 
this study. 
9.13 Echocardiogram 
An echocardiogram will be performed at the vi sits specified in the Schedules of Study 
Assessmen ts (Table 1  and Table 2 ) according to the instruct ions provided in the imaging 
acquisition manual.  Beginning with the Week 25 Vi sit, echocardiogram can occur up to 2 weeks 
prior to or after the scheduled wee k, as needed for scheduling purposes. 
Each echocardiogram will be record ed and reviewed locally by the cl inical site, and the clinical 
significance of the echocardiogram  findings will be assessed by the investigator.  Each 
echocardiogram will also be sent to an inde pendent central laboratory repository that will 
conduct a separate centralized review.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

9.16.1  Function and Strength 
All function and streng th testing will be performed by a traine d site clinical evaluator (CE).  The 
same CE should perform testing on the same patient throughout  the study when possible.  
Instructions and further deta ils on these tests can be found within the CE Manual.   
The function and strength measures will be vide otaped to ensure that they are being conducted 
properly and consistently by the CE, where possi ble and upon consent.  The videotaping will 
only be used to standardize the assessment in the tests.  The videos will be reviewed centrally by 
an experienced physiotherapist and will be compil ed and stored confidentially in the video 
review portal in compliance with all International Organization for Standardization requirements 
and in compliance with data pr otection requirements.  The vide o review does not affect the 
assessment results and adoption of the test data.  The patient will be allowed to participate in the 
study if they meet all other criteri a even if they do not  agree to the recording or recording is not 
permitted at the site.

The Brooke scale for upper limb has grades rangi ng from 1 to 6.  Grade 1 is given to the patient 
who can keep both his arms by his sides in the st arting position and is then able to abduct the 
arms fully so that both the arms  are touching over the head.  Grad e 6 is given when the patient is 
unable to raise his hands to his mouth, a nd the hands show no functional usefulness.  
9.16.1.3  Vignos Scale 
The Vignos scale for lower limb ha s grades ranging from 1 to 10; 1 means that the patient is able 
to walk and climb stairs wit hout assistance, while 10 means th at the patient is bed-bound.  
Ambulant patients score 1 to 6 and non-ambulant  patients score 7 to 10 on the Vignos scale. 
9.16.1.4  Performance of Upper Limb  
The PUL 2.0 was specifically deve loped for the assessment of uppe r limb function in DMD.  The 
PUL 2.0 provides both a total scor e and sub-scores for the 3 do mains (shoulder, middle, and 
distal) that in DMD are progressively involved with a proximal  to distal gradient.  The PUL 2.0 
includes 22 items with an entry item to define the starting func tional level.  The 22 items are 
subdivided into the high level shoulder dimens ion (6 items), middle level elbow dimension 
(9 items), and distal wrist and hand dimension (7 items).   For weaker patients, a low score on the 
entry item (0-2) means high level items do not need to be performed.  Scoring options vary 
across the scale between 0-1 and 0-2 according to performance.  Each dimension can be scored 
separately with a maximum score of 12 for the high level shoulder dimension, 17 for the middle 
level elbow dimension, and 13 for the distal wrist and hand dime nsion.  A total score can be 
achieved by adding the 3 level scores  (for maximum total score of 42). 
9.16.1.5  North Star Ambulatory Assessment  
NSAA will be performed by a CE at visits sp ecified in the Schedules of Study Assessments

to perform test, and 0 = unable to perform the test.  Thus, total score can range from 
0 (completely non-ambulant) to 34 (no impairm ent) on these assessments.  The NSAA will 
include an assessment of both grad e and time for the Time to R un/Walk 10 Meters Test and the 
Time to Stand Test.  Individual test item scores and total score will be recorded in source 
documents and in the relevant eCRF.  This test should take appr oximately 20 minutes.  
9.16.1.6  Loss of Ambulation 
Time to run/walk 10 meters will be assessed as part of the NSAA for patients performing the 
NSAA.  Loss of ambulation will be defined as th e inability to perform the Time to Run/Walk 
10 Meters Test in 30 seconds at any post-baseline visit and for all remaining assessments. 
9.17 Pharmacokinetic Assessments

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 62 of 117 9.18.3  Personal Adjustment and Role Skills Scale, 3rd Edition Questionnaire 
PARS III is a questionnaire designed for DMD young men that asks parents/guardians about 
their child’s well-being and psychosocial adjustment ( Hendriksen et al, 2009 ).  Please refer to the 
SRM for further details on how to ad minister the PARS III Questionnaire.  
9.18.4  Other Assessments 
9.18.4.1  Actigraphy (ActiGraph GT9x) 
During the Screening process and prior to baseline assessments, patients will be provided with an 
ActiGraph GT9x, specific information regarding the de vice, and the wear prot ocol.  Patients will 
wear the ActiGraph on their non-dominant  wrist throughout the study period (10 hour 
daytime + full nighttime wear).  Daily bouts of activity (energy expenditure) and percent sleep 
efficiency, nighttime awakenings, and duration of nighttime awakenings will be explored 
through the ActiLife data analyses software plat form.  Sleep-wake activity analyses will be 
performed using R*Studio and nparACT software to compute several non- parametric measures 
from raw actigraphy data.  Specificall y, the interdaily stability, intradaily variabil ity, and relative 
amplitude of activity will be computed to explore sleep-wake activity  rhythms (circadian 
rhythmicity) in study patients.  
9.18.5  Respiratory Assessments 
9.18.5.1  Peak Expiratory Flow  
PEF is a measure of the maximal flow rate th at can be achieved during forceful expiration 
following full inspiration. 
PEF rate will be calculated based on the patient’s age, height, and race/ethnicity. 
9.18.5.2  Forced Vital Capacity  
FVC is the maximum amount of air exhaled by a patient after a maximal inhalation.  
9.18.5.3  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second  
FEV1 is the amount of air forcefully exhaled by the patient in the fi rst second after full 
inspiration. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63 of 117 9.18.5.4  Peak Cough Flow  
PCF will be measured using a peak flow meter.  The test will be performed by asking the patient 
to inspire completely until total lung cap acity and subsequently cough forcefully.  During the 
test, patients breathe through a mouthpiece while wearing noseclips or a f ace mask linked to a 
peak flow meter or to a pneumotachograph.   
9.18.6  Chest X-ray 
The chest X-ray will include images of the hear t, lungs, airways, blood vessels, and the bones of 
the spine and chest. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

treatment review.  Any AE(s) that is unresolved will be followed up by the site (investigator or 
designee) for as long as medically  indicated.  The clinical res earch organization (CRO) retains 
the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AEs at the end of the 
study, if judged necessary. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

If a patient returns to the clinic for a visit outsid e of the protocol evalua tion time points, the visit 
and any assessments and/or tests performed will be recorded in the source documents and the 
eCRF as an Unscheduled Visit.   
10.3.4  Early Termination or Wit hdrawal from the Study 
A patient (or the legal guardian acting on behalf of the patient) is  free to withdraw consent and 
discontinue participation in the study at a ny time, without prejudice to further treatment, 
according to standard clinical practice.  Study pa rticipation may be discontinued at any time at 
the discretion of the investigat or or sponsor.  The following ma y be justifiable reasons for 
removing a patient:  
 Withdrawal of consent by the patient/legal guardian 
 Failure to comply with the protocol 
 Lost-to-follow-up 
 Illness, condition, or procedural  complication (including AEs) af fecting the patient’s ability 
to participate or requir ing prohibited medication 
 In the investigator’s judgment, it is deemed in the best interest of the patient to discontinue 
his/her participation in the study 
 The investigator, sponsor, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and/or regulatory 
authority terminates the study 
 Any other reason 
A Patient Completion/Discontinuation eCRF, desc ribing the reason for discontinuation, must be 
completed for any discontinued or withdrawn patien t regardless of reason.  If a pa tient withdraws 
from the study or if the study is prematurely terminated, the inves tigator or designee will contact 
the patient or the patient’s legal guardian within 30  days after withdrawal  or termination to 
assess any AEs.  The investigator will be asked to follow all SAEs until the event returns to 
baseline or until the investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary. 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study may not re-enter.  
The following assessments should be performed  at the time of early termination: 
 Medical history (any updat es will be recorded)  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

If a patient withdraws or is removed from th e study for any reason, all early termination 
procedures should be completed per the Schedules of Study Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).  
Reason for withdrawal, date of th e discontinuation, and date of th e last dose of IP should be 
recorded in source documents and in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  IP assigned to the 
withdrawn patient may not be as signed to another patient. 
The medical monitor and study chair should be co nsulted prior to the withdrawal of the study 
patient, except in the case of a medical emergenc y.  Written notice (regardless of cause) is to be 
provided to the medical monitor within 48 hour s of the withdrawal.  At the time of 
discontinuation, every effort should  be made to ensure all releva nt procedures and evaluations 
scheduled for the final study visit are performed.  At the time of  discontinuation, a self-addressed 
stamped shipper will be sent to the patient for returning of the ActiGraph GT9x and all 
accessories. 
10.4 Patient Replacement 
Patients will not be replaced. 
10.5 Suspension or Termination of Study 
If, in the opinion of the study chai r and the medical mon itor, clinical  observations in the study 
suggest that it may be unwise to continue, th e study may be suspended.  The study chair will 
request a DSMB meeting and cons ult with the sponsor.  If the study chair, medical monitor, 
DSMB, and sponsor agree that sa fety concerns warrant termina tion of the study, the sponsor will 
terminate the study.  A written statement fully do cumenting the reasons fo r such a termination 
will be provided to investigators, IRBs/IECs,  and regulatory authorities, if required.  
NS Pharma, Inc. has the right to terminate an investigat or’s participation in the study and remove 
all study materials from a clinical site.  A written statement will be provided to the investigator, 
the IRB/IEC, and regulatory au thorities, if required.   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

11.1 Definition of Adverse Events and Adverse Drug Reactions 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical prod uct, including control, and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with treatment.  This include s any untoward signs or symptoms experienced 
by the patient from the time of cons ent until completion of the study. 
AEs may include, but are not limited to: 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (includi ng an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal pr oduct, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product 
 Any new disease or exacerba tion of an existing disease 
 Any deterioration in non-protoc ol-required measurements of  laboratory value or other 
clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation 
from IP 
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities  already existing prio r to the use of the 
product are not considered AEs after treatment, unless they re occur after the patient has 
recovered from the preexisting c ondition or in the opinion of the investigator, they represent a 
CS exacerbation in intensity or frequency.  If CS  worsening from baseline is noted, the changes 
will be documented in the AE source document and the eCRF.   
TEAEs are defined as any AE or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of the IP and 
through 30 days after completi on of study participation. 
A suspected adverse reaction is  any noxious and unintended re sponse for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New 
Drug safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is ev idence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE.  A susp ected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than adverse r eaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
An AE and/or a suspected adverse reaction is consid ered “unexpected” if it is  not listed in the IB 
or is not listed at the specificit y or severity that has been previ ously observed.  As viltolarsen is 
approved in the US, the US package insert will be referenced for the purposes of expedited [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 of 117 reporting to the FDA and US sites.  During the c ourse of the study, the IB will be updated on an 
ongoing basis with new importa nt safety information.  
11.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An AE is serious when the patient outcome is: 
Death
Life-threatening (see below for expanded definition)
Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)
Disability or permanent damage (s ee below for expanded definition)
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed
above
Life-threatening experience: Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the site investigator, 
at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occu rred, i.e., does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death. 
Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization.  However, emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital 
should be evaluated for one of the other seri ous outcomes (e.g., life- threatening; required 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically important 
event). 
Hospitalization for an elective or outpatient procedur e will not be considered an SAE.  However, 
unexpected complications and/or  prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective or 
outpatient surgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the 
hospital for social or situati onal reasons (e.g., no place to stay, live too far away to come for 
hospital visits) will not be consid ered inpatient hospitalizations.  
Disability or permanent damage: Any AE that results in a substa ntial disruption of a patient’s 
ability to conduct nor mal life functions, i.e., the AE resulted in a sign ificant, persistent or 
permanent change, impairment, damage, or disrup tion in the patient's bod y function/structure, 
physical activities, and/ or quality of life. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
NS-065/NCNP-01 NS Pharma, Inc.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 85 of 117 Important medical events that may jeopardize the patient and ma y require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of th e outcomes listed above: an AE th at may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hos pitalization may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize th e patient and may requir e medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above. 
11.3 Severity 
It is the investigator’s res ponsibility to assess the intens ity (severity) of an AE.   
The severity of the AE will be characterized and recorded as “mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threatening, or death” according to the following definitions: The CTCAE version 4.03 
guidelines for severity assessments will be used  to grade AEs for this study (available at 
evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ).  The CTCA E version 4.03 listed guidelines for 
severity assessment are:  
 Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clin ical or diagnostic observations only or 
intervention not indicated 
 Moderate: Minimal, local, or non invasive intervention indicate d or limited age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
 Severe: Severe or medically  significant but not immedi ately life-threatening; or 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; or disabling; or limiting self-care 
ADL  
 Life-threatening: Life-threat ening consequences or urge nt intervention indicated 
 Death: Death related to AE 
Note: A severe AE need not be seriou s, and an SAE need not be severe. 
11.4 Relationship 
It is the investigator’s responsib ility to assess the re lationship between the IP and the AE.  The 
degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IP  may be described usi ng the following scale: 
 Not Related 
o Not Related:  No temporal association and othe r etiologies are likely the cause.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
NS-065/NCNP-01 NS Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: NS-065/NCNP-01-211 v2.0 21Mar2022 
   
 
NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 86 of 117 o Unlikely:  Event or laboratory test abnormalit y, with a time to drug that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossibl e).  Diseases or other drugs provide 
plausible explanations. 
 Related 
o Possible: Temporal association, but other etiologies are like ly the cause.  However, 
involvement of the IP cannot be excluded. 
o Probable:  Temporal association, other etiologi es are possible but unlikely.  The 
event may respond if the IP is discontinued. 
o Definite:  Established temporal asso ciation with administration of the IP with no other 
more probable cause.  The event should reso lve when the IP is discontinued and recur 
on re-challenge. 
11.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The following events are considered AEs of specia l interest based on the route of administration 
and toxicology profil e for viltolarsen: 
 Access device complication (for patient s with indwelling access devices) 
 Urinary protein excretion 300 mg/day based on a 24- hour urine collection 
 Serum cystatin C 1.5 × baseline, or serum creatinine 2 × baseline and 0.3 mg/dL, 
confirmed with a repeat test with in 1 week of the original results  (i.e., meets the cystatin C or 
creatinine criteria for referral to a nephrologist described in Section 11.12.1 ) 
 Any confirmed instances of hematuria or othe r potentially CS abnorma lities on urinalysis  
11.6 Disease-Related Signs and Symptoms 
Reporting of disease-related or DMD-related signs and symptoms as AEs is based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  However, pr ogression of symptoms and signs associated with 
DMD that is inconsistent with the usual course of  the disease should be reported as an AE in the 
eCRF and source documentation. 
11.7 Reporting 
11.7.1  Adverse Event Reporting 
All AEs occurring during the course of the st udy (starting from signing informed consent to 
study completion) will be collected on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 87 of 117 severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the IP.  For each AE, the following information 
will be recorded: 
 Description of the event (e.g., headache) 
 Date of onset 
 Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing) 
 Action taken as a result of the event 
 Seriousness of the event 
 Severity of the event 
 Outcome of the event 
 Investigator’s assessment of relationship to IP 
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause  should be reported as a single 
AE (e.g., fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest X-ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”). 
The investigator will carefully evaluate the co mments of the patient and the response to 
treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AE to IP administration should be determin ed by the investigator or study 
physician after thorough consideration of all facts that  are available. 
CS changes from time of ICF will be documente d as AEs on the AE eCRF.  CS changes are 
physical findings that have medi cal relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care. 
11.7.2  Adverse Events of Special Interest Reporting 
AEs of special interest should be  promptly recorded in the eCRF  so that the DSMB and medical 
monitor are notified.  Such events will be review ed by the DSMB and medical monitor to enable 
consideration of implicati ons for other patients. 
11.7.3  Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed  consent until the foll ow-up telephone call, 
30 days following the last administ ration of IP, must be reported  to the designated CRO within 
24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence.  This  includes death due to any cause and whether 
or not the SAE is deemed drug-related or expe cted.  After the 30-day reporting window, any 
SAE that the investigator considers re lated to IP must also be reported.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 88 of 117 To report the SAE, the investigator is to comple te the SAE form electroni cally in the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system for th e study.  If the event me ets serious criteria and it is not possible 
to access the EDC system, the investigator is to  send an email, phone, or  fax the event to the 
designated CRO within 24 hours of awareness.  When the EDC system becomes available, the 
SAE information must then be entered within  24 hours of the system becoming available. 
The investigator is requ ired to submit SAE reports to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local 
requirements.   
11.8 Serious Adverse Event Follow-up 
SAEs will be followed by the site investigator un til resolution or until the investigator determines 
that follow-up is no longer medically necessary. 
Follow-up information, or new information rega rding an ongoing SAE, must be provided 
promptly to the CRO within 24 hours of knowledg e of the new or follow-up information.  The 
CRO will forward the inform ation to the sponsor and the medical monitor. 
11.9 Expedited Reporting 
The sponsor must report any suspected adverse re action to the IP, that is both serious and 
unexpected, to the US FDA, 21 Code of Federa l Regulations 312.32(c)(1)( i), and other national 
and local health authorities. 
The NS Pharma, Inc.-designated CRO is responsible  for reporting all rele vant information about 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S USARs) that are fatal or life-threatening as 
soon as possible to the applicable regulatory aut horities in all the Member States concerned, and 
to the Central Ethics Committee, and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the 
CRO of such a case.  All other SUSARs will be reported to the applicable regulatory authorities 
concerned and to the Central Ethics Committee concerned as soon as possible but within a 
maximum of 15 days of first know ledge by the sponsor/designee. 
The NS Pharma, Inc.-designated CRO will also report any additional expedited safety reports 
required in accordance with the timelines outlined in c ountry-specific legislation. 
The NS Pharma, Inc.-designated CRO will also in form all investigators as required per local 
regulation.  Reports of all appli cable SUSARs must be communica ted as soon as possible to the [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 89 of 117 appropriate IRB/IEC and/or reported in acco rdance with local laws and regulations.  
Investigators should file written  documentation of IRB/IEC notific ation for each report to the 
designated CRO as applicable. 
11.10  Monitoring and Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Patients who experience AEs will be monitored with  relevant clinical assessments and laboratory 
tests, as determined by the investigator.  All follow-up results are to be reported to the medical 
monitor.  Any actions taken and follow-up results  must be recorded either on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF or in appropr iate follow-up written correspondence,  as well as in the patient’s 
source documentation.  Follow-up la boratory results should be fi led with the patient’s source 
documentation. 
For all AEs that require the patient to be discontinued fro m the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s). 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessmen t in the study are followed up by 
the investigator or designee for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in 
the eCRF.  The CRO retains the right to request  additional information for any patient with 
ongoing AEs at the end of the st udy, if judged necessary.  
11.11  Pregnancy Reporting 
The NS Pharma, Inc.-designated CRO should be notif ied in the event that a female partner of a 
patient becomes pregnant at any time after the pa tient’s first dose of IP.  Any such pregnancy 
occurring on-study or within 3 months of the la st administration of IP must be reported on a 
Pregnancy Notification Form.  This  must be done whether or not an  AE has occurred and within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The in formation submitted should also include the 
anticipated date of birth or pregnancy termination.  
Written consent is required prior to collecting and reporting any informa tion on a female partner 
of a patient.  
If possible, the investigator should follow the pregnant female partne r of the patient until 
completion of the pregnancy and not ify the medical monitor of the outcome within 5 days or as [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 90 of 117 specified below.  The investigator will provide this information as a follow-up to the initial 
Pregnancy Notification Form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classificati on as an SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital a nomaly [including in an aborted 
fetus]), the investigator should follow the procedures  for reporting SAEs (see Section 11.7.3 ).  
11.12  General Monitoring and Management of Ab normal Clinical Laboratory Findings 
It is the investigator’s responsib ility to review the re sults of all laboratory tests as they become 
available and to sign and date the results indicati ng review.  For each laboratory test outside of 
the laboratory normal range, the investigator must  ascertain if this represents a CS change from 
baseline for the individual pati ent.  The investigator may repe at a laboratory test or request 
additional tests to verify results of the original laboratory test. 
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and CS change from baseline for the 
patient, the investigator should dete rmine if it qualifies as an AE, and if so, an appropriate eCRF 
will be completed.  All CS laboratory abnormaliti es occurring during the study and that were not 
present at baseline should be followed and eval uated with additional tests if necessary, until 
diagnosis of the underlyi ng cause, or resolution.  
11.12.1 Monitoring of Renal Function and Urine Analyses 
All scheduled first morni ng void urinalyses will include urine di pstick protein to be performed at 
the site.  If first morning void urine dipstick protein 2+, UPCR 0.5 mg/mg, or 
UPCR 2 × baseline, a first morning void urine dipstic k protein will be repeated within 1 week.  
If 1 or more of these criteria are met again on the repeat test , a 24-hour urine sample will be 
collected within 1 week of the results to asse ss protein and creatinine.   If proteinuria on a 
24-hour urine sample is 300 mg/day, the patient will be referred to a nephrologist. 
In addition, any instances of hematuria or othe r potentially CS abnormalities on urinalysis will 
be confirmed at the following week ’s visit, or sooner at discreti on of the investigator.  Confirmed 
CS treatment-emergent a bnormalities will be recorded as AE s and discussed with the medical 
monitor.  Abnormalities will be mo nitored and evaluated with additi onal tests or consultations, if 
necessary, until the underlying cause is determined, or the event is brought to an acceptable 
resolution.  Additional c linical and laboratory information ma y be collected and documented in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 91 of 117 order to better characterize abnormalities and id entify etiology and appr opriate management.  
Potential need for interruption or discontinuation of IP should be discussed with the medical 
monitor and sponsor. 
If serum cystatin C 1.5 × baseline, or if serum creatinine 2 × baseline and 0.3 mg/dL, the test 
will be repeated within 1 week of  the results.  If either of th ese criteria are met again on the 
repeat test, the patient will be referred to a nephrologist. 
11.13  Monitoring and Management of  Abnormal Electrocardiograms 
If a CS ECG abnormality occurs th at was not present at baseline (S creening) and the investigator 
determines that the abnormality is related to IP, the abnormality will be discussed with the 
medical monitor.  The ECG abnormality will be m onitored and evaluated w ith additional tests (if 
necessary) until the underlying cause  is determined or the event is brought to an acceptable 
resolution.  Additional c linical and laboratory information will be collected and carefully 
documented in order to better char acterize the ECG abnormality and rule out alternative causes.  
ECG findings determined to be a CS change from baseline should be reported as an AE 
regardless of causality. 
Unscheduled ECG assessments will be complete d at the discretion of the investigator.  
11.14  Intravenous Access Considerations 
IP dosing will be administered through IV infusi on.  Peripheral venous access (IV catheter that 
empties into a peripheral  vein in the arms, hands, legs, or feet) is the preferred route of IP 
administration for this study.   
A CVA (IV catheter that empties into a large centr al vein) will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for patients who have di fficulty with peripheral venous  access.  A TICVAD port is the 
preferred option of CVA, if necessary, for this study.  The sponsor will decide whether or not to 
approve this option after discussions with the investigator and medical monitor have ensured 
mutual agreement that CVA will still maintain a positive benefit/risk ratio for the patient in this 
study.  Before final decision, NS Pharma, Inc. w ill obtain documentation from the investigator 
that the consulting surgeon who will place the port holds hospital privileges as a board 
eligible/board certified surgeon.  The deci sion, rationale, and conc lusion regarding the [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

contraindication to the pl acement of a TICVAD.   
11.15  Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
It is the responsibility of the DS MB to review data quality, releva nt safety data, and AEs for all

12.1 General Considerations 
The statistical analyses described in this sec tion will be performed as further outlined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock.  The SAP will 
supersede the protocol if there are any differences  between the 2 documents in the plans for data 
analysis and the differences will be noted in th e SAP.  The SAP will be included as an appendix 
in the Clinical Study Report fo r this protocol.  The data will be hosted and processed by 
Medpace, Inc. Statistical analys es will be performed using SAS® 9.4 or higher and R 4.05 or 
higher.  
All measurements will be analyzed based upon the type of distribution, and descriptive statistics 
will be presented by time point, as appropriate. 
12.2 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming a sample size of 20, at least 1 adverse drug reaction with  an incidence of 15% may be 
detected at a probability of 95% for the safety profile, which is the primary outcome.  Based on 
this, it was decided that 20 patients should be enrolled to confirm safety.  A minimum of 
8 ambulant patients will be enrolled. 
12.3 Analysis Populations 
The Safety Population will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of IP.  This will be 
the primary analysis population for the ev aluation of safety. 
The modified Intent-to-Treat Population will consis t of all patients who r eceived at least 1 dose 
of IP and have a baseline assessment and at leas t 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment.  This will 
be the analysis population for the evaluation of efficacy. 
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Summaries of patient demographics (age, race, ethnicity, and dominant hand), baseline safety 
characteristics (anthropometrics, vital signs , physical examination, hematology, chemistry, 
urinalysis, ECG, echocardiogram, and antibodies), and baseline efficacy parameters will be done. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

[MedDRA]), by relationship to IP, and by intensity (CTCAE grade). 
12.5.2  Anthropometrics, Vital Signs, Laboratory Assessments, Electrocardiogram, and 
Echocardiogram 
Anthropometrics, vital signs, hematology, chem istry, urinalysis, ECG,  and echocardiogram 
results will be summarized over time using de scriptive statistics for continuous outcomes.  
Actual values and change from Day 1 will be pres ented.  Further, all laboratory abnormalities 
will be listed. 
12.5.3  Physical Examination and Adverse Events 
Physical examination results will be summarized  by frequency of presence  of abnormalities in 
body system (beyond the DMD diagnosis) and in particular any changes in the physical 
examination over time. 
TEAEs will be summarized.  Coding will be don e by system organ class and preferred term 
(using MedDRA).  Level of severity will be  assessed using the CTCAE grading system.  
Summaries will include: 
 Summaries at the patient level 
o How many patients had any TEAE, any SAE,  highest severity of TEAE within a 
patient across all infusions, highest relationship level of TEAE within a patient across 
all infusions, highest intervention level regarding IP (e.g., discontinued versus 
reduced dose versus temporarily stopped ve rsus no interruption in infusions), and 
worst outcome within a patient  (e.g., AE did not resolve a nd has a permanent effect). 
 Summary at the event level 
o Summaries will be done using MedDRA c oding by events and overall, summarizing 
by system organ class and pref erred term, by relationship to  IP, severity, intervention, 
and outcome. 
Listing tables will be provided for all AEs. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

12.6 Efficacy Assessments 
12.6.1  Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective is to co mpare the efficacy of viltolarsen administered IV at weekly 
doses of 80 mg/kg over a 48-week Treatment Period versus natural history controls in ambulant 
and non-ambulant boys 8 years of age with DMD for the following endpoints: absolute and 
percent predicted PEF, FVC, and FEV1, Brooke and Vignos functional scales, and the NSAA.  
The PUL and hand-held dynamometry will be described and the cha nge over time estimated for 
the viltolarsen-treated group only. 
In addition to the comparison methods desc ribed below, all outcomes for both the 
viltolarsen-treated and historical control groups will be summarized and tabulated at each time 
point assessed.  Time points in the historical control will match those of the vilt olarsen-treated 
group within pre-defined tolerances .  Outcomes at baseline will be  compared between viltolarsen 
and control groups using met hods appropriate for the di stribution of each outcome. 
12.6.1.1  Peak Expiratory Flow  
The change in both absolute and percent predicte d PEF rate over the length of the study will be 
compared between patients receiving viltolarsen  and the historical control group using mixed 
models with repeated measures.  These models allow the use of all av ailable assessments per 
patient, will include a random term per individua l, and will assess the a dditional predictive value 
of a random slope term.  Covariates of age and baseline value will be included.  Steroid exposure [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 96 of 117 will be evaluated and included as an additional covariate if necessary.  The pulmonary outcome 
will be the dependent variable, t ime and treatment group will be th e independent variables, and a 
time by treatment group interaction will be included if appropriate.  Percent predicted values will 
be calculated from absolute valu es using equations based on age,  height, and ethnicity (see SRM 
for details).   
12.6.1.2  Forced Vital Capacity  
The change in absolute and percent predicted FVC will use the same methods described above 
for percent predicted PEF rate. 
12.6.1.3  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second  
The change in absolute and percent predicted FEV1 will use the same methods described above 
for percent predicted PEF rate. 
12.6.1.4  Brooke and Vignos Scales  
Brooke scale: The change in the Brooke function scale over the length of the study will be 
compared between patients receiving viltolarsen  and the historical control group using mixed 
models with repeated measures.  These models allow the use of all av ailable assessments per 
patient, will include a random term per individua l, and will assess the a dditional predictive value 
of a random slope term.  These models also have the flexibility to adequately model the 
quasi-continuous nature of the Brooke functional scale.  The pulmonary outcome will be the 
dependent variable, time and tr eatment group will be the indepe ndent variables, and a time by 
treatment group interaction will be included if appropriate.  Covariates of age and baseline value 
will be included and steroid expos ure will be evaluated and included as an additional covariate if 
necessary.   
Vignos scale: The change in the Vignos function al scale will use the same methods described 
above for the Brooke functional scale. 
12.6.1.5  Muscle Strength Outcomes (H and-held Dynamometry)  
The change over time in hand-held  dynamometry values will be estimated in patients receiving 
viltolarsen using a mixed model with repeated measures.  As the historical control group does 
not contain hand-held dynamometry assessments, no comparisons between viltolarsen and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

dynamometry values will act as the dependent va riable, time will be the independent variable, 
and a random term for indi vidual will be included.  C ovariates of age and baseline value will be 
included and steroid exposure will  be evaluated and included as  an additional covariate if 
necessary.   
12.6.1.6  Performance of Upper Limb  
The change over time in the PU L will be estimated in patients receiving viltolarsen using a 
mixed model with repeated measures.  As th e historical control gr oup does not contain PUL 
assessments, no comparisons between viltolarsen and control will be performed.  PUL values 
will act as the dependent variable, time will be the independent variable, and a random term for 
individual will be included.  Covariates of age and baseline value will be included and steroid 
exposure will be evaluated and included as  an additional covariate if necessary.  
12.6.1.7  North Star Ambulatory Assessment  
NSAA will be compared between patients receivi ng viltolarsen and the historical control group 
using mixed models with repeated measures.  Covariates of age and baseline value will be 
included.  Steroid exposure will be evaluated and included as an a dditional covariate if 
necessary.    
12.6.1.8  Analyses Comparing NS-065/NCNP-01 Patients to Historical Controls 
A matched data set from the CINRG DNHS data w ill be created.  The purpose of the matching is 
to create a group data set that corresponds in char acteristics to the patients  in this study.  The 
CINRG DNHS data set includes pa tients from 2 years old to ove r 30 years old, some of whom 
have been followed for close to a decade.  Therefor e, it is important to create a comparator group 
which will allow valid group comparisons.  No patie nt-to-patient matched analysis is proposed.  
The sole purpose of the matching is to create a historical control group wh ich is comparable in 
its basic characteristics to the study patient grou p.  The final CINRG DNHS data set is expected 
to have between 16 and 32 patients included with  time intervals of evaluations between 6 and 
15 months. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

12.6.2.1  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 
Descriptive statistics of the TSQM will be generated at each time point the questionnaire is 
administered for each of the 4 s ub-scores: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global 
satisfaction.  The change over time in scores will be estimated in patients receiving viltolarsen 
using a mixed model with repeated measures.  He re a separate model will be performed for each 
sub-score.  Sub-score values wi ll act as the dependent variable , time will be the independent 
variable, and a random term for individual will be included.  This will allow exploration of the 
change, if any, in sub-scores in resp onse to viltolarsen treatment.   
12.6.2.2  Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument  
Descriptive statistics of the PODCI will be gene rated at each time point the questionnaire is 
administered for global function and each of the sub-scores: upper extremity functioning, 
transfers and basic mobility, sp orts and physical function, co mfort/pain, and happiness with 
physical condition.  The change over time in scor es will be estimated in patients receiving 
viltolarsen using a mixed model with repeated measures.  Here a separate model will be 
performed for each score or sub-score.  Score values  will act as the dependent variable, time will 
be the independent variable, and a random term for individual will be in cluded.  This will allow 
exploration of the change, if any, in sub-sc ores in response to viltolarsen treatment. 
12.6.2.3  Personal Adjustment and Role Skills Scale, 3rd Edition Questionnaire 
Descriptive statistics of the PARS III Questionna ire will be generated at each time point the 
questionnaire is administered for total score a nd each of the 6 sub-sc ales: peer relations, 
dependency, hostility, productivity, anxiety/depression, and withdraw al.  The change over time 
in scores will be estimated in patients receiv ing viltolarsen using a mixed model with repeated 
measures.  Here a separate model will be perfor med for each score or sub-score.  Score values 
will act as the dependent variable, time will be the independent variable, and a random term for 
individual will be included.  This will allow expl oration of the change, if any, in sub-scores in 
response to viltolarsen treatment. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Descriptive statistics of PCF will be generated at  each time point the assessment is performed.  
The change over time in scores will be estimated in patients receiving viltolarsen using a mixed 
model with repeated measures.  PCF values will ac t as the dependent variable, time will be the 
independent variable, and a random term for in dividual will be included.  This will allow 
exploration of the change, if any, in PCF in response to viltolarsen treatment. 
12.6.2.5  ActiGraph GT9x 
Validity will be explored through correlation of al l clinical strength and fu nction tests and patient 
reported outcomes with raw data obtained from the AGT9x during clinical testing.  Information 
such as steps, speed, body position/location (usi ng vector magnitude per minute data) will be 
derived from the raw data; relationships with clin ical tests will result from data conversions, 
descriptive analysis, and correlati ons with the raw data.  Additiona lly, raw data will be analyzed 
throughout the study to explore ch anges in activity a nd sleep-wake patterns.  Throughout the full 
study, 2-week bouts of continuous data will be analyzed through R*Studio (version 3.5.1, 
Vienna, Austria) and the nparACT package (ver sion 0.8) to determine sleep-wake rhythms.  
Sleep-wake rhythms are measured as  intradaily variability (quantif ies the frequency and extent of 
transitions between periods of rest and activity  on an hourly basis) and relative amplitude 
(derived from the normalized difference between the most active 10-hour  period and least active 
5-hour period in an average 24-hour pattern).  Raw data will also be analyzed with ActiLife 
software to identify and score sl eep periods defined as nightly per cent sleep efficiency (total time 
in bed/total time asleep), average number of  nightly awakenings (mean number of nightly 
awakenings longer than 3-minute durations), and average duration of nightly awakenings (mean 
duration of nightly awakenings th at are longer than 3 minutes).  Effect sizes to determine the 
magnitude of differences in change  over time will be computed.  
12.7 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints and Analysis 
Population PK analyses will be pr esented in a separate report. 
12.7.1.1  Antibodies and Pharmacokinetics 
Antibodies and PK concentrations will be summarized by treatment group over time.  PK 
concentrations may be su mmarized at a later date. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

No interim analyses are planned. 
12.9 Handling of Missing Data 
Every effort will be made to collect all data .  However, despite best efforts, missing or 
incomplete data may be reported.  All missing or pa rtial data will be presented in the patient data 
listing, as they are recorded on the eCRF. 
Patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn will be in cluded in statistical analyses up to the point of 
their last evaluation.  Unless otherwise specifie d, no imputation of values  for missing data will 
be performed.  Of note, since patients with DMD are expected to decline over time, imputing 
efficacy parameters by last valu e carried forward mostly biases towards patients appearing 
stronger or faster than they are, since it carries forward potentially a better value than the value at 
the time of the missed observation.  Therefore, for this study, we will summarize how much data 
are missing, but do not expect to need to imput e any data to accomplish the analyses as 
described.  Details of handling missing data will be described in the SAP. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

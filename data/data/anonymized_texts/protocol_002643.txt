CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Overall Rationale for Amendment 2  
The overall rationale of the amendment is to allow patients who enter into the compassionate use 
program (CUP) o r early access program (EAP) to forgo the follow -up period of the study.  The 
follow-up period was intended to be an off -drug follow -up period.  For patients entering EAP, 
there may be no off -drug follow -up period.  In addition, due to difficulties in recr uitment, the 
overall study participant target population is being reduced from 24 to 20, and the part B target is 
being reduced from 18 to 14.    
The following table shows the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections:  
Change Rationale  Sections Changed  
Decreased the target sample 
size in part B from 18 to 14  Despite rigorous efforts, 
recruitment of additional 
pediatric Homozygous 
Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
(HoFH) patients has been 
challenging.  Therefore, the 
sample size has been reduced 
from 18 to 14.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis, Study Design,

Section 11.2 Justification of Sample Size  
Allowed patients who enter 
the CUP or EAP to forgo 
the 24-week follow -up 
period in this study after the 
last dose The 24-week follow -up period 
was intended to be  an off-drug 
period.  With many physicians 
and Principal Investigator s 
(PIs) applying for or 
expressing interest in CUP or 
EAP for evinacumab , the 
sponsor is  amending the 
protocol to allow patients to 
forgo the off -drug follow -up 
period if they are acquiring 
early access to evinacumab.  
This is to avoid the patients 
having a 24 -week period off 
drug with uncontrolled Low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) levels. Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis, Study Design ,

from up to 3 years to 48 
weeks.  efficacy endpoint is percent 
change from baseline in 
calculated LDL -C at 
week 24. As such, the 
treatment period of Part  B 
now matches the timing of 
the efficacy endpoint.  
Part C has been reduced to 
allow the study to complete

Removed  the use of 
acceptable methods of 
contraception (double 
barrier), updated the 
contraception 
requirements to only 
include highly effective 
contraception, and added 
the duration that highly 
effective contraception 
should be used in case a 
patient becomes sex ually 
active during the study 
and initiates 
contraception use.  Highly effective 
contraception should be 
used for 24  weeks after the 
last dose of evinacumab 
because that is generally the 
duration evinacumab 
concentrations remain 
above the lower limit of 
quantitation  Section 7.2.2 Exclusion Criteria, #15 and

Added absolute change in 
LDL-C at week 24 as an 
endpoint. This was an omission from 
the original protocol  Section 4.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Added an exclusion

CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title A Three-Part, Single -Arm, Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Evinacumab in Pediatric Patients with 
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia  
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  The study will be conducted globally (eg, Europe, North America, Asia) at 
approximately 24 sites .  
To be determined  
Objective(s)  Primary 
The primary objective for Part A of the study is to assess the 
pharmacokinetics  (PK) of evinacumab in pediatric patients with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).  
The primary objective for Part B of the study is to demonstrate a reduction 
of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL -C) by evinacumab in 
pediatric (5 t o 11 years of age) patients with HoFH.  
Secondary  
The secondary objective for Part A of the study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of evinacumab administered IV in pediatric patients with HoFH  
The secondary objectives for Part B of the study are:  
• To evaluate the effect of evinacumab on other lipid parameters 
(ie, Apo B, non -HDL-C, TC, lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) in pediatric 
patients with HoFH  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of evinacumab 
administered IV in pediatric patients with HoFH  
• To assess  the PK of evinacumab in pediatric patients with HoFH  
• To assess the immunogenicity of evinacumab in pediatric 
patients with HoFH over time  
• To evaluate patient efficacy by mutation status  
Study Design  Part A is a phase 1B single -dose, open -label study to d etermine the safety, 
PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of evinacumab 15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) 
in approximately 6 patients ages 5 to 11 years with HoFH. To ensure a 
distribution of body weight within Part A of the study, every effort will be 
made to enroll 3 pa tients <25 kg and 3 patients ≥25 kg. Additionally, to 
ensure a distribution of ages, every effort will be made to enroll 2 patients 
<10 years of age. All patients who successfully complete Part A may 
continue receiving evinacumab in an extension of the stu dy, Part C. Initially, 
patients from Part A who enter the Part C will receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV Q4W. When PK data from all patients in Part A have been sufficiently 
analyzed, the dose for Part B will be determined using the cumulative data 
to date wit h evinacumab and data from Part A. If data from 6 patients is

CONFIDENTIAL  insufficient, up to 4 more patients may be enrolled to confirm the dose in 
Part B. The dose for Part B will also be the final dose in Part C. The dose 
for Part B (and final dose in Part C) will likely remain at 15 mg/kg IV every 
4 weeks (Q4W). However, there is a small possibility that the exposure 
analysis or the observed PD effect indicate a small increase in the dose is 
needed for the pediatric population to match the exposure and PD effect 
observed in adult patients. As such, the dose in Part B (and final dose in Part 
C) could be between 15 -20 mg/kg IV Q4W. A maximum dose of 20 mg/kg 
is selected as the top dose because it is the highest dose evaluated in the prior 
evinacumab studies.  
Part A consists of up to 4 periods: run -in, screening, single -dose, open -label 
treatment, and 16 -week observation. Upon completion of Part A, patients 
will have the opportunity to continue into Part C.  
Part B is a phase 3 single -arm, open -label study to assess the  efficacy and 
safety of evinacumab in pediatric patients (age 5 to 11 years) with HoFH.  
Part B will begin once dose -selection for Part B has been completed.  Part 
B will enroll approximately 14 pediatric patients. Patients enrolled in Part B 
will not incl ude patients from Part A. Upon completion of Part B, patients 
will have the opportunity to continue into the extension, Part C.  
Part B consists of up to 4 periods: run -in, screening, 24 -week open -label 
treatment, and follow -up (for patients who do not ente r the extension, Part 
C). 
Part C is an extension of the study for patients from both Part A and Part B 
and consists of 2 periods, a 48 -week treatment period and a 24 -week follow -
up period after the last dose of study drug. All patients from Part A who 
enter Part C will initially receive open -label evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. 
The final dose in Part C will be the same as the dose in Part B; therefore, the 
dose in Part C could be adjusted to align with the dose in Part B. Patients 
who are receiving background LMT or who are undergoing apheresis should 
make every effort to maintain a stable LMT and a stable apheresis schedule 
(as applicable) throughout the duration of the study to the end of the study. 
The frequency of apheresis may be reduced during this part o f the study 
based on the investigator’s judgement. The Sponsor of this study, consistent 
with our corporate policy governing access to investigational drugs in 
confirmatory clinical studies, is committed to provide evinacumab to 
patients after their partic ipation in this trial has concluded, if permitted per 
local laws.  Agreement to continue treatment beyond this study is a treatment 
decision that must be made by the investigator, and the patient or their 
parent/guardian. After completion of the study,  investigators interested in 
continuing treatment with evinacumab in patients considered to have a 
positive response can discuss post -trial treatment options with the Sponsor, 
including participation in a CUP or EAP. 
Study Duration  For a patient in Part A, the duration of the study is up to approximately 34 
weeks, which includes up to an 8 -week run -in period, a 2 -week screening 
period, a 16 -week open -label treatment and observation period, an 8 -week 
follow-up period (for those patients who decide not to ente r Part C). For 
patients who enter Part C, there will be no follow -up period for Part A and 
the combined duration of Part A and Part C could be up to 98 weeks, 
including a 24 -week follow -up period after the last dose of study drug in 
Part C.  Although, pati ents who enter a CUP or EAP  may forgo the 24 -week 
follow-up period after the last dose.

CONFIDENTIAL  For a patient in Part B, the duration of the study is up to 54 weeks, which 
includes, up to an 8 -week run -in period, a 2 -week screening period, a 
24-week open -label treatment period, and a 20 -week follow -up period (for 
those patients who decide not to enter Part C).  For patients who enter Part  C, 
there will be no follow -up period for Part B and the combined duration of 
Part B and Part C could be up to 106 weeks, incl uding a 24 -week follow -up 
period after the last dose of study drug in Part C.  Although, patients who 
enter a CUP or EAP may forgo the 24 -week follow -up period after the last 
dose. 
End of Study Definition  The end of study is defined as the date of the las t visit of the last patient.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  For Part A, approximately 6 patients are planned. If data from 6 patients is 
insufficient, up to 4 more patients may be enrolled to confirm the dose in 
Part B. 
An additional 14 pediatric  patients are planned for Part B and will not 
include patients from Part A. Patients from both Part A and Part B may enter 
Part C of the study.  
 Target Population:  Males and females age 5 through 11 years diagnosed with HoFH receiving 
any combination of lipid-lowering therapies.  
Treatment(s)   
 Study Drug  
 Dose/Route/Schedule:  Evinacumab (REGN1500).  
For Part A, a single administration of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV, given over 
a 65 minute infusion  
For Part B, evinacumab with a dose determined by Part A, will be 
administered IV over a 65 minute infusion Q4W starting at day 1. The last 
dose will be at week 20.  
All patients from Part A who enter Part C will initially receive evinacumab 
15 mg/kg IV Q4W. The final dose for Part C will be based on data from Part 
A and all available data from other evinacumab studies.  Therefore, the dose 
for Part C for patients from Part A may be adjusted once the dose selection 
for Part B is completed.  
 Background Treatment  Patients should be on a maximally tolerated lipid -modifying therapy (LMT) 
regimen.  
Patients in Part B who are receiving background LMT or who are 
undergoing lipid apheresis should maintain stable LMT and a stable 
apheresis schedule (as applicable)  from screening to the end of treatment  
visit (week 24) in Part B. 
Endpoint(s)   
 Primary:  The primary endpoint for Part A is the PK parameters for evinacumab, 
including C max, AUC, and linear t ½ following a single administration of 
evinacumab.

CONFIDENTIAL  The primary endpoint for Part B is the percent change in calculated LDL -C 
from baseline to week 24 (intent -to-treat [ITT] estimand) in Part B. The 
primary endpoint is defined as: 100x (calculated LDL -C value at week 24 - 
calculated LDL -C value at baseline)/calculated LDL -C value at baseline.  
 Secondary:  The secondary endpoint f or Part A is:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE) and 
other safety variables over time  
The secondary endpoints in Part B are:  
• The percent change in Apo B from baseline to week 24 (ITT 
estimand)  
• The percent change in non -HDL-C from baseline to week 24 
(ITT estimand)  
• The percent change in total cholesterol (TC) from baseline to 
week 24 (ITT estimand)  
• The proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in calculated 
LDL-C at week 24 (ITT estimand)  
• The percent change in calculated LDL -C from baseline to 
week 24 in patients who have negative/negative and null/null 
mutations (ITT estimand)  
• The percent  change in lipoprotein a [Lp(a)] from baseline to 
week 24 (ITT estimand)  
• The absolute change in LDL -C at week 24 (ITT estimand)  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE) and 
other safety variables over time  
• Concentrations of total evinacumab over time  
• Incidence and titer of treatment -emergent anti -drug 
antibodies over time  
Procedures and Assessments  The efficacy of evinacumab in th is population will be assessed by clinical 
laboratory evaluation of lipid levels at pre -specified time points throughout 
the study. Overall safety will be assessed by monitoring and evaluation of 
TEAEs, physical examinations, pulse rate, blood pressure, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical safety laboratory tests at 
pre-specified time points. The potential emergence of anti -evinacumab 
antibodies will also be evaluated.  
Statistical Plan  Since this is an open -label, single treatment arm study, formal statistical 
testing is not planned, therefore, a calculation for patient sample size is not 
applicable. Six patients are planned to be enrolled for Part A and 14 pediatric  
patients are planned  to be enrolled for Part B.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis for Part B . The percent change from baseline 
in calculated LDL -C at week 24 will be analyzed in the ITT population using

CONFIDENTIAL  a pattern mixture model (PMM) approach as described below (see 
Appendix  1 for more details).  
In the PMM approach, different imputation strategies will be applied to 
calculated LDL -C values missing during the on -treatment period (ie,  within 
the time period from the first study treatment administration up to the day 
of last study treatment administration +35 days in Part B) versus calculated 
LDL-C values missing due to treatment discontinuation after the 
on-treatment period (ie, after the day of last study treatment administration 
+35 days in Part B) based on the following assumptions:  
• Patients within 35 days of their last study treatment 
administration in Part B would continue to show benefit from 
treatment similar to that observed at the scheduled time point.  
Therefore, calculated LDL -C values missing during the 
on-treatment period (eg, samples obtained outside the specified 
window, no blood sample available although visit was 
performed, etc.) should be considered “Missing at Random” and 
imputed based on other observed measurements in the 
on-treatment period.  
• Patients who stopped taking their study treatment in Part B no 
longer benefited from it after discontinuation, and thus tended to 
have calculated LDL -C values returning to baselin e.  Therefore, 
calculated LDL -C values missing after the on -treatment period 
should be imputed based on patient’s own baseline value.  
Missing data from the ITT population will be imputed 100 times to generate 
100 complete data sets, using the SAS MI proced ure (using Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo).  The 100 completed datasets of observed and imputed 
calculated LDL -C data will be used for the primary analysis.  
For the percent change from baseline calculated LDL -C endpoint, the 100 
complete datasets of observed and  imputed calculated LDL -C data at week 
24 will be analyzed using the SAS MEANS procedure.  The SAS 
MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences 
by combining results from the 100 analyses using Rubin’s formulae. 
Combined estimat e for mean at Week 24 will be provided with the standard 
error (SE) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Formal statistical testing is not 
planned.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a primary hyperlipidemia driven by genetic mutation(s) 
primarily in the low -density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), is the most common 
monogenic hypercholesterolemia condition in children. The most rare and severe form of FH is 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). It is an inherited autosomal dominant  
disorder primarily resulting from mutations in the LDLR or, less frequently, from mutations in 3 
associated genes: proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein B 
(APOB), and LDL receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1). Depending on t he genes affected and 
the mutations that are present, patients are categorized as either true homozygotes, compound 
heterozygotes, or double heterozygotes. True homozygotes have the same mutation on both 
alleles. Compound heterozygotes have different mutat ions on the 2 alleles. Double heterozygotes 
have mutations in 2 different genes. The resulting phenotype includes deficient or defective LDL 
receptors on the surface of hepatocytes causing impaired clearance of circulating low -density 
lipoprotein cholester ol (LDL-C). This leads to severe hypercholesterolemia, often 3 to 6 times 
normal (≥500 mg/dL), starting in infancy, which results in an exceedingly high risk of 
developing premature atherosclerosis, as well as valvular and supravalvular stenosis.  
The etiology of the hypercholesterolemia observed in patients with HoFH is the same for both 
adult and pediatric patients. It is a consequence of the above mentioned abnormal lipoprotein 
metabolism due to mutations in the key genes listed above, and the ma rkedly diminished hepatic 
LDL-C clearance from plasma (Goldstein, 2001 )(Kolansky, 2008 )(Macchiaiolo,  2012) 
(Rader, 2003). These high plasma levels lead to vascular damage starting from birth and 
morphological and functional vascular changes by 8 years of age or earlier. Children as young as 
7 years of age can present with coron ary atherosclerosis even without any clinically apparent 
coronary artery disease. This accelerated atherosclerosis results in premature cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and an increased risk of CV events at a young age. Evidence of accelerated 
atherosclerosis include children with increased carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT) and cIMT 
progression at a rate approximately double that of unaffected siblings. An observational study of 
HoFH patients showed that the mean age for first major CV event was 20 years 
(Goldstein,  2001)(Kolansky, 2008 )(Macchiaiolo, 2012 )(Rader, 2003 ). Indeed, if left untreated, 
children and adolescents with HoFH, have an extremely high risk for premature CVD and 
reduced life expectancy. For example, in a longitudinal st udy of 39 pediatric patients with HoFH 
followed for up to 8 years, 88% of patients >16 years of age and 9% <16 years of age developed 
CVD. Further, during follow -up, 7 patients developed progression of coronary and/or aortic 
valvular disease and 4 required  surgical intervention (Kolansky, 2008 ), demonstrating  the need 
for early aggressive lipid -lowering therapy in pediatric subjects with HoFH.  
The frequency of HoFH in the general population is historically reported as 1/1,000,000. This 
estimate is based on a heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) prevale nce of 1/500 
and the application of the Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium (1/1,000,000 = 1/500 mother * 1/500 
father * 1/4 risk for child). However, based on more recent data, HoFH has an estimated 
prevalence of 1/300,000, which would be the same in children. Pop ulations with a founder effect 
have higher prevalence rates.  
Diagnosis of HoFH can be made based on clinical criteria or genetic criteria (Section  7.2.1 ). An 
LDL-C level ≥13 mmol/L (≥500 mg/dL) is consistent with phenotypic HoFH. However, the 
LDL-C criteria could be lower depending on the presence of positive family history and age of 
                                        VV-RIM-00192921-1.0 Approved - 25 May 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  screening. Additional phenotypic characteristics include premature co ronary heart disease, aortic 
valve disease, and tendon xanthomas in the hands and Achilles tendons. Clinically identified 
patients could undergo genetic testing to confirm diagnosis.  
Patients with HoFH can be further classified based on the phenotype of th e LDLR mutation(s), 
ranging from defective mutations (where the LDLR retains some LDL -binding functionality) to 
null or negative mutations where no functioning LDLR is expressed. Patients who have LDLR 
activity <15% are considered null and patients whose L DLR activity is impaired but >15% are 
LDLR defective (Banerjee, 2019 ). Another method that could be used to categorize these 
mutations is to define a  negative mutation status as having mutations in stop codons, frame 
shifts, splice site changes, small and large insertions/deletions, and copy number variations 
(CNVs) predicted to result in the loss of function of the LDLR. The most extreme cases are tho se 
patients who are LDL -receptor negative or null in both alleles. These patients tend to have LDL -
C levels at the highest end of the range and experience very little efficacy from existing therapies 
such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. As such, significa ntly accelerated atherosclerosis and 
worse clinical outcomes are observed in these patients compared to those who are LDLR 
defective (Kolansky, 2008 ) (Moorjani, 1993 ). Patients who are LDLR null or negative develop 
xanthomas sooner than patients who are LDLR receptor defective, and untreated patients who 
are LDLR null or negative rarely live past the second decade of life (Kolansky, 2008 ) 
(Moorjani,  1993). 
Current approved therapies for patients with HoFH include statins, lomitapide, ezetimibe, 
evolocumab, and lipoprotein apheresis. All but lomitapide are approved for use in pediatric 
patients ≥12 years of age. Some of the statins are approved in younger patients (rosuvastatin 
approved in ages ≥6 years; atorvastatin and simvastatin approved for ages ≥10 years). Because 
the etiology of  the disease is the same for both adult and pediatric patients, the overarching goal 
of therapy is also the same, to lower LDL -C. The current American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines and the European 
Atherosclerosis So ciety (EAS) recommend at least a 50% reduction in LDL -C in all patients with 
FH to reduce the risk of CVD (Gidding, 2015 )(Grundy, 2019 )(Wiegman, 2015 ). The EAS 
further recommends a target LDL -C <130 mg/dl (3.5 mmol/L) in patients >10 years 
(Wiegman,  2015). Lipid-lowering therapy should be started as early as possible (Cuchel, 2014 ) 
(France, 2016) (Wiegman, 2015 ). 
Angiopoietin -like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) has recently emerged as a target for treatment of 
elevated levels of LDL -C.  Individuals who are homozygous for loss of function (LOF) 
mutations in ANGPTL3 have lower levels of LDL -C (mean difference of >50%  versus control 
subjects (Minicocci, 2012 )). The mechanism by which ANGPTL3 LOF mutations result in 
lowering LDL -C is not fully understood but appears to be independent of the LDLR. These data 
suggest that inhibiting ANGPTL3 may be a meaningful and well -tolerated strategy for lowering 
serum LDL -C in patients with HoFH, especially those considered to have LDLR negative 
mutations in both alleles.  
Evinacumab (REGN1500) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb), created with 
Regeneron’s VelocImmune® technology platform, which specifically binds to and inhibits 
ANGPTL3. In an open -label, single -arm, proof -of-concept study in patients with HoFH 
(R1500-CL-1331), evinacumab demonstrated a mean percent reduction  from baseline of 49.2% 
(n=9) at week 4, 2 weeks after a single dose of 15 mg/kg IV, with a duration of effect of at least

CONFIDENTIAL  10 weeks (n=7). A peak mean reduction of 52.1% was observed at week 6. Three patients in the 
study had null/null mutations in the LDL R. Treatment with evinacumab in these difficult -to-treat 
patients reduced LDL -C by an average of 37.3% at week 4 with peak reductions up to 59.5%.  
The LDL-C lowering effect observed with evinacumab in the R1500 -CL-1331 study was 
confirmed in study R1500 -CL-1629, a large randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study 
consisting of adult and adolescent patients with HoFH. On average, patients entered the trial with 
a mean baseline LDL -C of 255 mg/dL, despite treatment with other lipid -lowering therapies, 
including maximally -tolerated statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis and 
lomitapide. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing that adding evinacumab to other 
lipid-lowering therapies decreased LDL -C by a mean of 49% from baseline to week 24 , 
compared to lipid -lowering therapies alone (47% reduction for evinacumab compared to a 2% 
increase for placebo, p<0.0001). This reduction translates to a mean absolute change in LDL -C 
of 132 mg/dL from baseline, compared to placebo (135 mg/dL reduction f or evinacumab 
compared to a 3 mg/dL reduction for placebo, p<0.0001). The decreases in LDL -C were 
observed from the first lipid assessment at week 2 and were maintained throughout the 24 -week 
double-blind treatment period. Importantly, similar levels of LD L-C lowering were observed in 
the most difficult -to-treat null/null or negative/negative patients. The dramatic reduction in 
LDL-C led to the achievement of LDL -C levels <100 mg/dL in 47% of the patients treated with 
evinacumab compared to 23% treated with   placebo (nominal p=0.0203). Evinacumab also 
reduced apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non -high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
(non-HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) compared to placebo.  
The positive efficacy data in the R1500 -CL-1629 study were accompanie d by an acceptable 
safety profile.  Evinacumab was generally well -tolerated. During the double -blind treatment 
period, 66% of evinacumab patients and 81% of placebo patients experienced an adverse event 
(AE). AEs that occurred in at least 5% of patients an d more commonly with evinacumab were 
influenza-like illness (11% evinacumab, 0% placebo) and rhinorrhea (7% evinacumab, 0% 
placebo). During the double -blind treatment period there was no difference in the incidence of 
nausea, abdominal pain or diarrhea bet ween treatment groups, and there were no deaths, major 
adverse cardiovascular events or findings related to hepatic disorders.  
The primary purpose of this current study is to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
evinacumab in pediatric pati ents, aged 5 through 11 years, with HoFH. The study will consist of 
3 parts: Part A (phase 1b), Part B (phase 3), and Part C (phase 3). Part A is a single -dose, 
open-label study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) in approximately 6 patients ages 5 to 11 years with 
HoFH.  Part B is a 24 -week, single -arm, open -label study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
evinacumab in approximately 14 pediatric  patients with HoFH. Part B will be gin when PK data 
from all patients in Part A have been sufficiently analyzed to determine the dose for Part B. Part 
C is an extension of the study available to patients who complete Part A or Part B to continue to 
receive evinacumab.

CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE 
3.1. Hypothesis  
Blockade of ANGPTL3 with evinacumab will reduce LDL -C in pediatric patients with HoFH.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
This study is intended to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of evinacumab in the treatment of 
pediatric patients with HoFH.  Diagnosis of HoFH will be based on either genotyping or clinical 
criteria. The genetic definition will include all individuals considered to be  
• Homozygotes: presence of the same mutation(s) in both alleles for LDLR, Apo B, 
PCSK9 or LDLRAP1 (autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia),  
• Compound heterozygotes: presence of different mutations in the same allele  
• Double heterozygotes: presence of mutati ons in different genes  
The study will be conducted in 3 parts:  
Part A is a single -dose, open -label study to assess the safety, PK, and PD of evinacumab. The 
purpose of this part of the study is to confirm the dose for Part B and  Part C. To address this 
objective, patients will only receive a single dose of evinacumab, followed by semi -dense PK 
sampling to adequately assess the PK profile in these patients. To ensure a distribution of body 
weight within Part A of the study, every effort will be made to enro ll 3 patients <25 kg and 3 
patients ≥25 kg. Additionally, to ensure a distribution of ages, every effort will be made to enroll 
2 patients <10 years of age.  
Part B is a 24 -week multiple -dose, single -arm, open -label study to assess the efficacy and safety 
of evinacumab. The purpose of this part of the study is to evaluate the LDL -C lowering effects of 
evinacumab in pediatric patients with HoFH  
Part C is an extension of the study for patients completing Part A and Part B. The purpose of this 
part of the study  is to evaluate the long -term safety of evinacumab in pediatric patients with 
HoFH. Initially, patients from Part A who enter Part C will receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg Q4W. 
When all patients complete the PK/PD portion (Part A), the dose for Part B will be de termined 
using the cumulative data to date with evinacumab from prior studies and data from Part A. The 
dose for Part B will also be the final dose in Part C.  
The duration of the study for the study participants will be up to approximately  2 years for 
patients in Part A (98 weeks) and for patients in Part B (106 weeks), assuming all patients 
participate in the extension (Part C). This duration was selected to sufficiently assess long -term 
safety and tolerability, including growth and development.  
The primar y endpoint of Part B is the percent change in LDL -C from baseline to week 24. 
LDL-C is an accepted surrogate endpoint for CV risk and has repeatedly been used as the 
primary endpoint for approval of other HoFH treatments. This study is designed as an open -label 
trial with the addition of evinacumab on top of patients’ existing treatment regimens of 
maximally tolerated lipid -modifying therapy (LMT), including lipoprotein apheresis. This study 
                                        VV-RIM-00192921-1.0 Approved - 25 May 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  will utilize a run -in period for those patients whose LMT regimen is not stable. This “add -on” 
design is appropriate because removal of any therapy from patients’ existing treatment regimen 
may lead to an increase in LDL -C and possibly contribute to the serious CV sequelae seen in this 
severe disease with high CV risk.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The initial dose selected for this study is 15 mg/kg IV Q4W, but could be adjusted to up to a 
maximum of 20 mg/kg IV Q4W. Evinacumab exhibits marked target -mediated drug disposition 
(TMDD), on which the impact of age and body -weight has not been thoroughly evaluated. Body 
weight, in general, has an effect on the linear clearance of mAbs, where mAbs exhibit decreasing 
exposure with decreasing body weight. This trend is due to the over -correction effect when the 
dose is scaled down  linearly with body weight, while clearance is scaled down in a 
less-than-linear manner ( Zhang, 2015 ) (Xu, 2019). For this reason, it is pos sible a dose higher 
than 15 mg/kg may be needed in pediatric patients so that similar exposures seen in the adult 
population are achieved. In addition, the similarity or difference in the PK/PD relationship in 
LDL-C lowering between children younger than 1 2 years old and adults has not been evaluated. 
To address these uncertainties, Part A, a single dose PK/PD study will be conducted for pediatric 
patients with HoFH (5 to 11 years of age). Based on current data collected from adult patients 
with HoFH, an ef fect on lowering LDL -C is expected in most patients following a single IV dose 
of evinacumab. Semi -dense PK samples will be collected to characterize PK of evinacumab in 
the pediatric population. Total ANGPTL3 concentrations, a target engagement marker, an d LDL-
C reduction, the efficacy measurement, will be evaluated to characterize the PK/PD relationship. 
These data will be compared to those observed in adults and adolescents and data analysis will 
be facilitated by PK/PD modeling and simulation.  
A single dose of 15 mg/kg IV is selected for Part A. It is the dose tested in adolescents (age ≥12 
to <18 years) and adults (age ≥18 years) with HoFH in the on -going phase 3, double -blind, 
placebo-controlled study, R1500 -CL-1629 and the phase 3 open -label, long -term safety study, 
R1500-CL-1719. Based on the current PK/PD profile, exposures in Part A are not expected to be 
higher than those observed in adults and adolescents who received the same dose. A similar 
degree of LDL -C lowering is also anticipated to those o bserved in the ongoing studies.  The final 
dose selection will be based on PK/PD data analysis from Part A and all other available data in 
the evinacumab program. The goals of the dose selection are to: 1) achieve exposure levels in the 
intended pediatric patients within the range observed in the adult and adolescent patients in phase 
3 studies; 2) achieve a similar magnitude of LDL -C reduction as adult patients with HoFH, or to 
have a magnitude of LDL -C reduction considered adequate for the intended pediat ric population; 
3) maintain an adequate duration of efficacy during the proposed dosing interval.  
The dose for Part B (and final dose in Part C) will likely remain at 15 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks 
(Q4W). However, there is a small possibility that the exposure analysis or the observed PD effect 
indicate a small increase in the dose is needed for the pediatric population. As such, the dose in 
Part B (and final dose in Part C) could be between 15 and 20 mg/kg IV Q4W. A maximum dose 
of 20 mg/kg is selected as the t op dose because it is the highest dose evaluated in the prior 
evinacumab studies.  Preclinical studies in adult cynomolgus monkeys, adult rat, and juvenile 
rats concluded the no -observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) in those studies was considered to 
be 100 mg/kg/dose via IV or subcutaneous (SC). The dose range of 15 to 20 mg/kg IV Q4W 
proposed in the present study is expected to generate steady -state exposure that falls within the 
                                        VV-RIM-00192921-1.0 Approved - 25 May 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  range of systemic exposure measured at the NOAEL levels identified during th ese nonclinical 
toxicology studies.  
A treatment and observation period up to 16 weeks should be an adequate duration to 
characterize the full PK/PD profile in this pediatric population and to allow comparisons with the 
profile observed in the adult patient s and the limited number of adolescent patients in the 
ongoing studies.  
3.3. Risk-Benefit 
Patients with HoFH have extremely high LDL -C levels are far from their target level and will 
require significant reductions to get to their treatment goal. Statins are the  only pharmacological 
LMT approved for use in pediatric patients below the age of 10. Unfortunately, they are unable 
to lower LDL -C sufficiently, even when used in the highest doses and in combination with other 
therapies. Moreover, the unmet need is great est in patients with null/null mutations of the LDLR 
who typically have the highest levels of LDL -C and in whom statins have minimum to no 
effects.  In addition to pharmacologic treatment, lipoprotein apheresis is the standard of care for 
pediatric patient s with HoFH. However, the availability of lipoprotein apheresis is limited, and 
the procedure is expensive, invasive and burdensome for young children and their caregivers. 
Therefore, there is a high unmet need for additional therapeutic options for pediat ric patients 
with HoFH. Evinacumab could be a new addition to the armamentarium of LMT that could 
contribute to lowering the LDL -C of HoFH pediatric patients, including patients with null/null 
mutations.  
In study R1500 -CL-1331, evinacumab demonstrated a me an percent reduction from baseline of 
49.2% (n=9) at week 4, 2 weeks after a single dose of 15 mg/kg IV, with a duration of effect of 
at least 10 weeks (n=7). A peak mean reduction of 52.1% was observed at week 6. Three patients 
in the study had null/null mutations in the LDLR. Treatment with evinacumab in these 
difficult-to-treat patients reduced LDL -C by an average of 37.3% at week 4 with peak reductions 
up to 59.5%. The LDL -C lowering effect observed with evinacumab in the R1500 -CL-1331 
study was confirm ed in study R1500 -CL-1629, a large randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled study consisting of adult and adolescent patients with HoFH. On average, patients 
entered the trial with a mean baseline LDL -C of 255 mg/dL, despite treatment with other 
lipid-lowering therapies, including maximally -tolerated statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, 
LDL apheresis and lomitapide. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing that adding 
evinacumab to other lipid -lowering therapies decreased LDL -C by a mean of 49% from  baseline 
to week 24, compared to lipid -lowering therapies alone (47% reduction for evinacumab 
compared to a 2% increase for placebo, p<0.0001). This reduction translated in this study to a 
mean absolute change in LDL -C of 132 mg/dL from baseline, compared  to placebo (135 mg/dL 
reduction for evinacumab compared to a 3 mg/dL reduction for placebo, p<0.0001). The 
decreases in LDL -C were observed from the first lipid assessment at week 2 and were 
maintained throughout the 24 -week double -blind treatment period.  Importantly, similar levels of 
LDL-C lowering were observed in the most difficult -to-treat null/null or negative/negative 
patients. The dramatic reduction in LDL -C led to the achievement of LDL -C levels <100 mg/dL 
in 47% of the patients treated with evina cumab compared to 23% treated with placebo (nominal 
p=0.0203). Evinacumab also reduced Apo B, non -HDL-C and TC compared to placebo. Based

CONFIDENTIAL  on these data in adults, it is expected that the addition of evinacumab to existing treatments will 
lead to significan t LDL-C reductions in the pediatric HoFH population.  
In non-FH populations, numerous epidemiological studies and CV outcomes studies with 
lipid-lowering therapies have continually demonstrated that lowering LDL -C reduces the risk of 
CV events.  In fact, th e body of evidence from the statin literature shows that the relationship 
between LDL -C reduction and CV event reduction is approximately linear and for every 1 
mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL -C there is a corresponding 22% risk reduction in CV 
events (Baigent, 2010 ). Moreover, results from recent outcomes trials with ezetimibe 
(IMPROVE -IT (Cannon, 2015 )), alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Schwartz, 2018 )) and 
evolocumab (FOURIER (Sabatine, 2017 )) reinforce this concept,  providing additional evidence 
for the relationship between LDL -C lowering through diverse mechanisms and reductions in CV 
events. Within the context of this study in the HoFH pediatric patient population, additional 
reductions in LDL -C at an early age may  get patients closer to their LDL -C target and 
maintaining these levels could translate into significant benefit in reducing CV risk.  
It is also expected that treatment with evinacumab will be well tolerated and have an acceptable 
safety profile. The accum ulated safety information from the most recent phase  2 and phase  3 
studies where evinacumab was given IV in patients with HoFH (R1500 -CL-1629, 
R1500-CL-1719) or persistent hypercholesterolemia (R1500 -CL-1643) shows that the more 
common adverse events acros s all the studies include Nasopharyngitis, Rhinorrhoea, Upper 
respiratory tract infection, Influenza -like illness, Back pain, Pain in extremity, Dizziness, 
Headache, Nausea, Abdominal pain, and Fatigue.  
A review of all available safety data shows there is one identified risk of Systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions, including Infusion reactions, and rarely Anaphylaxis. In most cases, 
the allergic reactions were mild to moderate in intensity, nonserious and, in the case of infusion 
reactions, did not lead to i nterruption or discontinuation of the evinacumab infusion. One event 
of Anaphylaxis was observed in the phase 2 dose ranging study in patients with severe 
hypercholesterolemia (R1500 -CL-1643). Briefly, the anaphylactic reaction was reported in a 
single pat ient randomized to the evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV treatment group. This patient with 
relevant medical history of syncope, palpitations, asthma, obesity, and seasonal allergy 
experienced an anaphylactic reaction during the second infusion of evinacumab on study  day 28. 
Within 5 minutes of initiating the infusion, the patient felt dizzy with a racing heart, followed by 
chest pressure, arms and legs tingling, shortness of breath, itchiness, and feeling warm and 
lethargic. The patient was noticeably flushed with fa ce and chest redness. The infusion was 
stopped. The patient was treated with diphenhydramine orally due to continued itching. The 
event was considered resolved on the same day. The investigator assessed the event as moderate 
in severity and related to stud y treatment. Study treatment was permanently discontinued. 
Further details of this event are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The important potential risks include immunogenicity and embryofetal toxicity. These risks will 
be managed through careful  patient selection and monitoring. Additionally, any potential effects 
of evinacumab on a child’s development during childhood and early adolescence will be 
monitored via Tanner staging, sex hormones, and overall growth by tracking weight and height.  
A risk-benefit statement with respect to the overall development program is provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.

CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This study consists of 3 parts: Part A, Part B, and Part C  
• Part A: phase 1B single arm, single dose PK/PD study  
• Part B: phase 3, single -arm, 24-week, open -label efficacy and safety study  
• Part C: phase 3 , 48-week treatment period and 24-week follow -up period  
− Note, for patients who enter a  CUP or EAP, they may forgo the 24 -week follow -
up period after the last dose.  In this situation, the end of treatment (EOT) visit 
will be their last visit.  
Part A is a phase 1B single -dose, open -label study to determine the safety, PK and PD of 
evinacumab  15 mg/kg IV in approximately 6 patients ages 5 to 11 years with HoFH. To ensure a 
distribution of body weight within Part A of the study, every effort will be made to enroll 3 patients 
<25 kg and 3 patients ≥25 kg. Additionally, to ensure a distribution o f ages, every effort will be 
made to enroll 2 patients <10 years of age. All patients who successfully complete Part A may 
continue receiving evinacumab in Part C. Initially, patients from Part A who enter Part C will 
receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. Wh en PK data from all patients in Part A have been 
sufficiently analyzed, the dose for Part B will be determined using the cumulative data to date with 
evinacumab and data from Part A. If data from 6 patients is insufficient, up to 4 more patients may 
be enrolled to confirm the dose in Part B. The dose for Part B will also be the final dose in Part C. 
The dose for Part B (and final dose in Part C) will likely remain at 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. However, 
there is a small possibility that the exposure analysis or the ob served PD effect indicate a small 
increase in the dose is needed for the pediatric population to match the exposure and PD effect 
observed in adult patients. As such, the dose in Part B (and final dose in Part C) could be between 
15 and 20 mg/kg IV Q4W. A maximum dose of 20 mg/kg is selected as the top dose because it is 
the highest dose evaluated in the prior evinacumab studies.  
Part A consists of up to 4 periods: run -in; screening; single -dose open -label treatment and 16 -week 
observation, and a follow -up period (for patients who do not enter Part C).  Upon completion of 
Part A, patients will have the opportunity to continue into Part C ( Figure 1).

CONFIDENTIAL  Run-in 
The run-in period is optional and available if a patient requires stabilization of background LMT 
or requires genotyping to confirm diagnosis of HoFH.  
Lipoprotein apheresis therapy - Patients who are undergoing lipoprotein -apheresis with a 
schedule and/or setting not stable for approximately 8 weeks before the screening visit will enter 
an 8-week run-in period before the screening period. All patients undergoing apheresis sho uld be 
on a weekly (every 7±1 days) or every other week (every 14±2 days) schedule. After the 8 -week 
run-in period, patients whose lipoprotein -apheresis schedule remains stable will be eligible to 
enter the 2 -week screening period. The use of plasmapheresi s is excluded.  
Pharmacological lipid -modifying therapy  - Patients who are on background LMT not stable for 
at least 4 weeks before the screening visit will enter a 4 -week run-in period to stabilize their 
LMT before entering the screening period.  
Genotyping  - Confirmation of patient’s HoFH status can be made by either genetic or clinical 
criteria. If HoFH diagnosis cannot be confirmed by the clinical criteria listed or from previous 
genotyping results, patients can enter the run -in period to determine their mutation status in 
advance of screening, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  
Screening:  
Patients on a stable background LMT (as applicable) for at least 4 weeks (8 weeks for apheresis) 
before the screening visit, will enter a 2 -week screening period . Every effort should be made to 
perform the screening visit immediately before apheresis, if applicable, to ensure an accurate 
assessment of the lipid parameters.  
Open-Label Treatment and Observation  
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of th e exclusion criteria will be enrolled to 
receive 1 dose of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV at the baseline visit.  
Patients who are receiving background LMT should maintain stable LMT throughout the 
duration of the study, from screening to the end of study visit for  Part A (week 16). Patients on 
apheresis will need to temporarily discontinue apheresis from the baseline visit through 4 weeks 
after the single dose administration of evinacumab. The duration between the apheresis treatment 
prior to the baseline visit and  the baseline visit should be at least either 14 days or 7 days, 
depending on the frequency of the patient’s apheresis treatment regimen. Patients will be allowed 
to resume their apheresis schedule after completing all Week 4 assessments.  
After completion of the 16-week open -label treatment and observation period, all patients who 
have successfully completed Part A may enter Part C, the extension of the study (see below).  
Follow-up Period (if applicable)  
Patients not entering Part C will enter an 8 -week follow-up period after receiving the single dose 
of evinacumab. In general, a follow -up period of 24 weeks after the single dose of study drug 
will be required for any patient who prematurely discontinues study treatment.   
Part B is a phase 3 single -arm, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of evinacumab 
in pediatric patients (age 5 to11 years) with HoFH.  Part B will begin once dose -selection for 
Part B has been completed.  Part B will enroll approximately 14 pediatric  patients. Patients

Run-in 
The run-in period is optional and available if a patient requires stabilization of background LMT 
or requires genotyping to confirm diagnosis of HoFH  
Lipoprotein apheresis therapy  - Patients who are undergoing lipoprotein -apheresis therapy with 
a schedule and/or setting not stable for appr oximately 8 weeks before the screening visit will 
enter an 8 -week run-in period before the screening period.  All patients undergoing apheresis 
should be on a weekly (every 7±1 days) or every other week (every 14±2 days) schedule. After 
the 8-week run-in period, patients whose lipoprotein -apheresis schedule remains stable will be 
eligible to enter the 2 -week screening period. The use of plasmapheresis is excluded.  
Pharmacological lipid -modifying therapy  - Patients who are on background medical LMT not 
stable for at least 4 weeks before the screening visit will enter a 4 -week run-in period to stabilize 
their LMT before entering the screening period.  
Genotyping  - Confirmation of patient’s HoFH status can be made by either genetic or clinical 
criteria. If HoFH  diagnosis cannot be confirmed by the clinical criteria listed or from previous 
genotyping results, patients can enter the run -in period to determine their mutation status in 
advance of screening, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  
Open-Label Treat ment 
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to 
receive evinacumab IV Q4W. The dose can be between 15 to 20 mg/kg but will likely remain at 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg. The final dose will be confirmed at a dose  selection meeting once 
sufficient data from Part A are available.

CONFIDENTIAL  Administration of evinacumab during the treatment period will take place at the study site, 
starting at the baseline visit (visit 2) through week 20 (visit 10). For patients on apheresis, e very 
effort should be made to administer evinacumab within 1 day of completing apheresis.  
Patients who are receiving background LMT or who are undergoing apheresis should maintain 
stable LMT and a stable apheresis schedule (as applicable) throughout the du ration of the study, 
from screening to the end of open -label treatment period visit (week 24).  
After completion of the 24 -week treatment period, all patients may enter  Part C (see below). All 
patients who enter Part C will continue to receive open -label evinacumab at the dose 
administered in Part B.  
Follow-up Period (if applicable)  
Patients not entering Part C will enter a 20 -week follow -up period after completion of the 
treatment period. A follow -up period of 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug will be 
required for any patient who prematurely discontinues study treatment.   
Part C is an extension for patients from both Part A and Part B. It consists of 2 periods: a 
48-week treatment period and a 24-week follow -up period after the last dose of study drug 
(Figure 3). Patients who participate in Part C should enter directly from Part A or Part B. The 
first visit (visit 1) in Part C can occur on the same day as the EOT visit in Part A (visit 11)/Part  B 
(visit 11). Overlapping asses sments completed at the EOT visit do not need to be duplicated 
during visit 1 in Part C.  
All patients from Part A who enter Part C will initially receive open -label evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV Q4W. The final dose in Part C will be the same as the dose in Part B; therefore, the dose in 
Part C for patients entering from Part A may need to be adjusted to align with the dose in Part B.  
Extension  
Administration of evinacumab during Part C will take place at the study site. For patients on 
apheresis, every effort sho uld be made to administer evinacumab within 1 day of completing 
apheresis.

CONFIDENTIAL  Figure 3: Study Flow Diagram – Extension  
 
Patients who are receiving background LMT or who are undergoing apheresis should make 
every effort  to maintain a stable LMT and a stable apheresis schedule (as applicable) throughout 
the duration of the study to the end of the study. The frequency of apheresis may be reduced 
during this part of the study based on the investigator’s judgement.  
The Spons or of this study, consistent with our corporate policy governing access to 
investigational drugs in confirmatory clinical studies, is committed to provide evinacumab to 
patients after their participation in this trial has concluded, if permitted per local laws.  
Agreement to continue treatment beyond this study is a treatment decision that must be made by 
the investigator and the patient and/or their parent/guardian. After completion of the study, 
investigators interested in continuing treatment with evinac umab in patients considered to have a 
positive response can discuss post -trial access options with the Sponsor.  
Follow-up Period  
Patients will enter a 24 -week follow -up period after the last dose of evinacumab in Part C.  
However, for patients entering a compassionate use or extended access program, they may forgo 
the follow -up period.  The EOT visit will be their last visit.    
Throughout the Study  
The efficacy of evinacumab in this population will be assessed by clinical laboratory evaluation 
of lipid levels at pre -specified time points throughout the study. All samples for clinical 
laboratory evaluation must be obtained prior to e vinacumab administration. For patients 
undergoing apheresis, all samples for clinical laboratory evaluation must be obtained

CONFIDENTIAL  immediately prior to apheresis. This is to ensure the effect of apheresis on lipid parameters is 
minimized as much as possible.  
Overall safety will be assessed by monitoring and evaluation of TEAEs, physical examinations, 
vital signs, including blood pressure, ECG, Tanner stages, and clinical safety laboratory tests at 
pre-specified time points. The potential emergence of anti -evinacumab antibodies will also be 
evaluated. Patients who experience an ongoing serious adverse event (SAE) at the pre -specified 
study end -date should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or collection of outcome and 
related data.  
6.1.1.  Description of Dose Sel ection 
Pharmacokinetic, PD, and safety data from Part A of the study will be used to determine the dose 
for Part B and the final dose for Part C. This will occur when PK, PD, and safety data from Part 
A have been sufficiently analyzed and reviewed at a Dos e Determination Review meeting. This 
meeting will be led by a designated member of the Regeneron clinical team (generally either the 
medical director/study director or the clinical study lead) and at a minimum will be attended by 
the Regeneron Medical Moni tor and the Risk Management Lead or designee; other individuals, 
including the Clinical Pharmacology Lead, may be included. The final dose selected will not 
exceed evinacumab 20 mg/kg.  
6.1.2.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient.  
6.2. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned.  
6.3. Study Committees  
6.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) composed of members who are independent 
from the sponsor and the  study investigators, will monitor patient safety by conducting formal 
reviews of accumulated safety data; if requested, the IDMC may have access to any other 
requested data for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment.  
The IDMC will provide the sponsor w ith appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study.  The IDMC 
will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study 
results during the study execution.  
All activities and responsibilities of the IDMC are described in the IDMC charter.

7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right t o withdraw a patient from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow 
study procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the early 
termination  visit, as described in Section  9.1.2.

CONFIDENTIAL  8. STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
In Part A, patients will receive 1 dose of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV infusion over 65 minutes at 
the baseline visit (day 1).  
In Part B, patients will receive evinacumab at a dose assessed from Part A and will be 
administered IV over a 65 -minute infusion Q4W sta rting at the baseline visit (day 1). The last 
dose of evinacumab will be at week 20.  
In Part C, patients from Part A will initially receive evinacumab at 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. The final 
dose selection in Part C will be based on data from Part A and data in adults from other studies.  
Therefore, the dose for patients from Part A entering Part C may be adjusted once the dose 
selection for Part B is completed.  
The IV dose should be prepared using the patient’s most recent weight. The most recent weight 
is either the current visit’s weight or, if the current visit’s weight is not available when preparing 
the dose, the weight from the previous visit. Further instructions on dose preparation are 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
Dosing should fall within a window of  ±7 days; if >14 days have passed, skip the dose and return 
to the original schedule.  
8.2. Run-in Treatment(s)  
Patients who are undergoing apheresis therapy should be on a stable weekly (every 7±1 days) or 
every other week (every 14±2 days) schedule and/or stab le settings for approximately 8 weeks 
prior to screening.  Patients with a schedule and/or apheresis settings not stable for 
approximately 8 weeks before the screening visit will enter an 8 -week run-in period before the 
screening period.  
Patients who are o n background LMT that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks (4 weeks for 
statins and ezetimibe, 8 weeks for PCSK9 inhibitors) before the screening visit will enter a run -in 
period to stabilize their LMT before entering the screening period.  
8.3. Background T reatment(s)  
Patients who are receiving background LMT or who are undergoing apheresis should maintain 
stable LMT and a stable apheresis schedule (as applicable) throughout the duration of the study, 
from screening to the end of the treatment period visit ( week 24) of Part B. For patients who 
enter Part C of the study, and are receiving lipid apheresis, the frequency of apheresis may be 
reduced based on the investigator’s judgement.  
Patients should be on a maximally tolerated LMT regimen. Whether or not a pa tient is 
considered to be on a maximum tolerated regimen of LMT (statin, PCSK9 inhibitor, etc), reasons 
why or why not (eg, due to intolerance, lack of efficacy) the patient is taking/not taking the 
various treatments will need to be documented in the CRF.

Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug should be encouraged to remain in th e 
study.  Those who agree and do not withdraw from the study  will be asked to return to the clinic 
for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients in Part B and Part C who prematurely discontinue study drug  and agree to remain in the 
study should undergo all study visits and procedures with the exception of study drug dosing.  At 
the time of study drug discontinuation, the patient should have, as soon as possible, an 
unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the week 24 EOT vis it (Part B patients) 
or the week 48 visit (Part C patients) and then resume the original study schedule until the end of 
study (EOS) visit.   
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to compl ete study assessments (EOS/early termination [ET]), per Section  9.1.2. 
8.4.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
An individual will permane ntly discontinue study drug dosing in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions considered related to study drug  
• Specific types of liver dysfunction (eg, Hy’s law is met ([ Guidance for Industry Dru g 
Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation FDA 2009 ]) 
• Patient withdraws consent  
8.4.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The investigator may temporarily discontinue study drug dosing at any time, even without 
consultation with the  medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action 
and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest.  
8.5. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.5.1.  Acute Intravenous Infusion Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions must be available 
for immediate use.  All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.4) 
and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2.5. 
8.5.1.1.  Interruption of the Intravenous Infusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if a ny of the following AEs are observed:

• severe chest pain  
• seizure 
• severe hypotension  
• other neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, paresthesia, paralysis, 
etc.) 
• any other symptom or sign that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants 
termination of the IV infusion  
*Consider anaphyl axis if the following is observed  (Sampson, 2006 ): acute onset of an illness 
(minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized 
hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips -tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE 
FOLLOWING  
• Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak

To reduce bias, a central lab will be used.  
8.8. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
8.8.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Open-label study drug will display the product lot number on the label. A medication numbering 
system will be used in labeling investigational study drug.  Lists linking medication numbers 
with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups responsible for study drug packaging 
and labelin g. 
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.8.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or des ignee at 
regular intervals or as needed during the study.  At specified time points during the study (eg, 
interim site monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and 
documentation by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed / 
returned to the sponsor or designee.  
8.8.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened study drug.  These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study medication  
• dispensed to each patient  
• returned from each patient (if applicable), and  
• disposed of at the site or returned to the sponsor or designee.  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by the sponsor and regulatory 
agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.

Any treatment administered, including apheresis, from  the time of informed consent to end of the 
treatment period/final study visit will be considered concomitant medication.  This includes 
medications that were started before the study and are ongoing during the study.  
8.9.1.  Prohibited Medications  
The following concomitant medications and procedures are prohibited in Part A or Part B:  
• Background LMT (if applicable) that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks (e g, 
statins and ezetimibe) with the exception of PCSK9 inhibitors, which is prohibited 
unless stable for 8 weeks before the screening visit (week -2) (unless participating in 
the run-in period to stabilize)  
• Recent discontinuation of lomitapide that has not been washed out for at least 8 
weeks before the screening visit (week -2) 
• Lipid apheresis schedule that is not an approximately every 7 day (±1 day) or an 
every 14 day (±2 days) regimen or has not been stable for approximately 8 weeks 
prior to screening (week -2) 
• Plasma exchange  
• Nutraceuticals or over -the-counter therapies known to affect lipids, at a dose/amount 
that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (week -2) 
• Chronic systemic corticosteroids, unless used as replacemen t therapy for 
pituitary/adrenal disease with a stable regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to the 
screening visit (week -2) 
• Thyroid replacement therapy, unless the dosage of replacement therapy has been 
stable for at least 12 weeks prior to the screening vis it (week -2) 
8.9.2.  Permitted Medications  
The use of all nutritional supplements and approved medications known to alter serum lipids, 
including (but not limited to) statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, fibrates, niacin, bile acid 
resins, red yeast rice is perm itted as long as that therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks for 
most LMT with the exception of PCSK9 inhibitors, which is 8 weeks prior to the screening visit 
(week -2). Patients in Part B should continue taking their background LMT for the duration  of 
the study starting at screening and through visit 10 (week 24). Similarly, patients should maintain 
their apheresis regimen (if applicable) starting at screening and through the end of visit 10 
(week 24). 
Patients on thyroid replacement therapy can be included if the dosage has been stable for at least 
12 weeks prior to the screening visit (week -2). 
Topical, intra -articular, nasal, inhaled and ophthalmic steroid therapies are not considered as 
‘systemic’ and are allowed.

CONFIDENTIAL  9. STUDY SCHEDULE OF EV ENTS AND PR OCEDURES  
9.1. Schedule of Events  
Study assessments and procedures are presented by study period and visit in Table 1, Table 2, 
and Table 3. 
In light of the public health emergency related to COVID -19, the cont inuity of clinical study 
conduct and oversight may require implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms. 
Examples of such mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: phone 
contact, virtual visits, telemedicine visits, onl ine meetings, non -invasive remote monitoring 
devices, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled staff. Additionally, 
no waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 will be granted. All 
temporary mechan isms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures, are to be 
documented as being related to COVID -19 and will remain in effect only for the duration of the 
public health emergency.  
If patients and their physicians decide to enter a compassionate use or early access program, they 
may forgo the 24 -week follow -up period following the last dose of evinacumab.  In this case, the 
EOT visit will be their last visit.  There is no need to com plete the EOS assessments as they are 
identical to the EOT assessments other than the testing of high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs-
CRP).

All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule.  Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnorm al laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for 
any other reason, as warranted.  
9.2. Study Procedures  
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population:  Demographics, medical/surgical history, medication 
history, and thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH).  
9.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
All laboratory samples will be collected before the dose of study drug is administered.  
Blood samples for lipid panels should be collected in the morning, in fasting conditions (ie, 
overnight, at least 8 hours fast, only water) for all clinic visits. Intense physical exercise within 
24 hours, preceding blood sampling is discouraged.  
Total-C, HDL-C, Apo B, Apo A -1, TG, and Lp(a) will be directly measured by the central 
laboratory. LDL -C will be calculated using the Friedewald formula. If TG values exceed 400 
mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L) or if calculated LDL -C values are below 25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L), LDL -C 
will be measured via the beta quantification method (rather than via the Friedewald formula). 
Non-HDL-C will be calculated by subtracting HDL -C from the TC.  
Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage, and shipment are provided in the laboratory 
manual. 
9.2.2.1.  Lipid Panel  
Fasting (at least 8 hours) blood samples will be collected at specified time points shown in 
Section  9.1 for assessment of the lipid pr ofile, comprising calculated LDL -C, HDL-C, non-HDL 
C, TC, and TGs. These samples will also be used for specialty lipid panel assessment when it is 
scheduled at the same time as the lipid panel assessment.  
9.2.2.2.  Specialty Lipid Panel  
Fasting (at least 8 hours) bl ood samples will be collected at specified time points shown in 
Section 9.1 for assessment of the specialty lipid profile, comprising Apo B, Apo A -1, ratio of 
Apo B/Apo A -1, ApoCIII, ApoE, and Lp(a). The specialty lipid panels will be assessed in the 
same sample that is collected for the lipid panel.  
9.2.3.  Safety Procedures  
9.2.3.1.  Vital Signs

other investigations.  
9.2.5.  Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples  
Samples for ADA assessment will be collected at time points listed in Table 1, Table 2, and 
Table 3. 
Samples positive in the ADA ass ay will be analyzed in the NAb assay.  
In case of a suspected SAE such as hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction, additional samples 
may be collected at or near the time of the event.  
Any unused samples collected for ADA assessments may be used for explo ratory research or 
bioanalytical investigations.  
9.2.6.  Ultrasound Imaging  
Carotid ultrasound is a reliable method to measure carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT; in 
mm), which has been shown to be increased in children with HoFH (Kusters, 2014 ). The 
technique has sho wn reliable results with an interobserver coefficient of variation of 7.3% 
(Doyon, 2013 ). 
9.2.7.  Other Assessments  
9.2.7.1.  Review of Diet and Compliance with LMT  
Patients should maintain a stable and exercise routine. Patients will be queried on compliance 
with their diet and compliance with LMT during the study,  at time points according to 
Section 9.1. 
9.2.7.2.  DNA Sample for HoFH Genotyping  
A required blood sample for DNA extraction will be collected from all patients  to identify or 
confirm known mutations in PCSK9, LDLR, APOB, and LDLRAP1 genes.  
9.2.7.3.  Future Biomedical Research (Optional)

additional samples will be collected for future biomedical research.  After 15 years, any residual 
samples will be destroyed. The results of these future biomedical resea rch analyses will not be 
presented in the Clinical Study Report.  
9.2.7.4.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Parents or legal guardians of patients who agree to participate in the genomics sub -study will be 
required to sign a separate genomics sub -study informed c onsent form (ICF) and patients must 
sign a separate informed assent form before collection of the samples. Patients are not required to 
participate in the genomics sub -study in order to enroll in the primary study. Samples for DNA 
extraction should be coll ected on day 1/baseline (predose) but may be collected at any study 
visit. 
DNA samples for the genomics sub -study will be coded as defined by the International Council 
for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15. Sub -study samples will be stored for up to 15 yea rs after 
the final date of the database lock and may be used for research purposes. The purpose of the 
genomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or biomarker response, other 
clinical outcome measures and possible AEs. In addition, associations between genomic variants 
and prognosis or progression of HoFH as well as related diseases may also be studied. These 
data may be used or combined with data collected from other studies to identify and validate 
genomic markers related to the st udy drug or HoFH and other diseases. Analyses may include 
sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of candidate genes and 
surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome sequencing, whole 
genome sequencing, DNA cop y number variation may also be performed. The list of methods 
may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during the course of this 
study or sample storage period.

The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data 
collection period from the time of signing the ICF or first dose to the end of the treatment period 
(see Section  11.4.5.1).  Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the signing of 
the Informed Consent will be recorded as part of medical history.  Abnormal laboratory values 
and vital signs observed at the time of Informed Consent should also be recorded as medical 
history.  Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with  the use of the study drug 
should also be recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
patient.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the patient, or by 
questioning the patient at each study visit.  Patients should be questioned in a general way, 
without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  The Investigator must assess all 
AEs to determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance w ith the definitions in 
Section 10.2.  The Investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source 
documentation with the Investigat or’s signature.  The Investigator should follow up on SAEs 
(and AESIs) until they have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed 
until they are resolved or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not sugge st 
a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic results or findings  should be appraised by the 
Investigator to determine their clinical significance.   Isolated abnormal laboratory  results, vital 
sign findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be 
reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  dose reduction,  
require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in t he investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the serious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is 
not an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre -planned (prior to 
signing the Informed Consent Form) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospitalization for 
pre-existing conditions that do not worsen in severity, and admission for palliative or social care 
should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.2 for Definitions).  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be repor ted as an SAE.  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of the on -treatment period) that 
the Investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) , AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported 
according to the procedures in Section  10.1.4.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.2.  Data Collection Period  
The investigator will record all events, serious and non -serious, that occur from the time of 
signing the informed consent and for 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug (ie, the 
follow-up/post treatment period).  The follow -up/post treatment period applies to all patients 
who complete the study or terminate e arly (excludes those who withdraw consent).  However, 
for those patients entering a CUP or EAP, they may forgo the 24 -week follow -up period.  
From the time of signing the informed consent and prior to first dose of study drug, the 
investigator will report t he following types of events on the AE CRF:  
• SAEs 
• Events, serious and non -serious, attributed to study conduct, such as a 
protocol-mandated procedure or intervention (eg, events related to an invasive 
procedure such as a biopsy)  
Other events that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be reported on the medical 
history CRF.  
From first dose of study drug, report all AEs on the AE CRF until EOS visit, which includes the 
follow-up/post treatment period after last dose.  
10.1.3.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the 
event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the (when applicable: blinded) study drug.  For 
SAEs and AESIs, a detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event,  including its 
evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided on the AE CRF.  Specific or estimated 
dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, when available.  Medical 
history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data th at are relevant to the event should also 
be summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy 
was or will be performed, and include the results if available.  Information not available at the 
time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  Source documents  
(including hospital or medical re cords, diagnostic reports, etc. ) will be summarized in the 
narrative on the AE CRF, and retained at the study center and available upon request.  
Urgent safe ty queries must be followed up and addressed promptly.  Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up. 
10.1.4.  Events that Require Expedited Reporti ng to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
• SAEs. 
• Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI; serious and nonserious) :  Adverse events 
of special interest for this study inc lude the following:  
− Anaphylactic reactions  
                                        VV-RIM-00192921-1.0 Approved - 25 May 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  − Allergic reactions that require consultation with another physician for further 
evaluation or requiring medical treatment  
− Moderate or severe infusion reactions  
− Increase in ALT or AST: ≥3 x ULN (if baseline <ULN), or ≥2 times the baseline 
value (if baseline ≥ ULN)  
− Symptomatic overdose with investigational medicinal product  
− Neurocognitive events  
− Pancreatitis  
− New onset of diabetes (NOD) in patients without diabetes at baseline. New onset 
of diabetes is defined as eith er: 
− At least 2 HbA1c measurements ≥6.5% during the TEAE period (NOTE: 
For patients with only a single measurement available during the 
TEAE period, a single value ≥6.5% will qualify the patient as NOD by 
default) 
− At least 2 fasting glucose measurements ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). For 
patients with several fasting glucose measurements but with only the last one 
≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), this single value ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) will 
NOT be considered and will NOT qualify the patient as NOD)  
− NOTE: Diabetes at baseline is based on documented medical history, baseline 
fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), or baseline HbA1c ≥6.5%  
• Pregnancy:  It is the responsibility of the investigator to report to the sponsor (or 
designee), within 24  hours of identification, an y pregnancy occurring in a female or 
female partner of a male , during the study or within 24  weeks of the last dose of study 
drug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient or female partner 
of a male study patient, and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must 
be reported as an SAE.  Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor . 
10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is 
temporally associated with the us e of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug (ICH E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that a t any dose:  
                                        VV-RIM-00192921-1.0 Approved - 25 May 2022 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol  R1500-CL-17100 Amendment 2  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Page 70 of 96 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate r isk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
In-patient hospitalization is defined  as a hospital admission (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing 
hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally 
anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the de velopment of a new AE as 
determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these even ts. 
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and 
medical interest specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid communication by the i nvestigator to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might 
warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  
10.2.4.  Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any relevant AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2 
hours after the infusion is completed.  
10.2.5.  Severity 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient normal functioning level.  It 
may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are  not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but 
may be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:  Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be  needed. 
Severe: Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the subject’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Page 71 of 96 
CONFIDENTIAL  If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity sho uld be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Infusion Reactions  
The severity of infusion reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of the grade):  
Mild: Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate : Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medica tions indicated 
for ≤24 hours.  
Severe: Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization 
indicated for clinical sequelae; life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
death. 
10.2.6.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical  
judgment, and the following definitions.  The causality assessment must be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new information becomes available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relat ionship: time to onset vs time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs. long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug & same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, when 
applicable  
• Patient’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug (including study drug administration):  
• Related: 
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant med ications), or other 
external factors.

CONFIDENTIAL  − The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its class of drugs, or is 
predicted by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does no t follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or 
can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
Causality to the study conduct (protocol specified procedure):  
• Related: 
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from a protocol specified 
procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
patient’s clinical (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant 
medications), or other external factors.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from a protocol specified 
procedure, or can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s 
clinical state (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant 
medications) or other external factors.  
10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consis tent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The Medical/Study Director will have primary 
responsibility for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other 
departments (eg, Pharmacovigilance; Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  
Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual revie w of SAEs) and on 
a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board /Ethics 
Committee, and Investigators  
During the study, the sponsor and/or the CRO will inform health authorities, IECs/IRBs, and the 
participating investigators of any SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) 
occurring in other study centers or other studies of the active study drug (REGN1500), as 
appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the sponsor and/or CRO wi ll comply 
with any additional local safety reporting requirements.  
Upon receipt of the sponsor’s notification of a SUSAR that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) unless 
delegated to the sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study.  The SAP may be revised  during the 
study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt 
to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses.  The final 
SAP will be issued before the first database lock.  
Endpoints are listed in Section  4.  Analysis variables are listed in Section  5. 
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
No formal statistical testing will be performed for this open -label study.  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Since this is an open -label single treatment arm study, formal statistical testing is not planned, 
Therefore, a calculation for patient sample size is not applicable.  
Six patients are planned to be enrolled for Part A and 14 pediatric patients are planned to be 
enrolled for Part B, considering the recruitment constraints in this rare patient po pulation.

endpoint. The endpoint is considered as evaluable when both of the following conditions are 
met: 
1. Availability of at least 1 measurement value for calculated LDL -C before first dose of 
study drug (ie, baseline).  
2 Availability of at least 1 calculated LDL -C value during the efficacy treatment period and 
within one of the analysis windows up to week 24.  The efficacy treatment period is 
defined as the time from the first study drug administration up to 35 days after the last 
study drug administration in Part B.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively for patients in the 
SAF for Part A, and for patients in  the ITT population for Part B.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis for Part B  
The percent change from baseline in calculated LDL -C at week 24 will be analyzed in the ITT 
population using a pattern mixture model (PMM) approach as described below (s ee Appendix  1 
for more details).  
In the PMM approach, different imputation strategies will be applied to calculated LDL -C values 
missing during the on -treatment period (ie, within the time period from the first study treatment 
administration up to the day of last study treatment administration +35 days in Part B) versus 
calculated LDL -C values missing due to treatment discontinuation after the on -treatment period 
(ie, after the day of last study treatment administration +35 days in Part B) based on the 
following assumptions:  
• Patients within 35 days of their last study treatment administration in Part B would 
continue to show benefit from treatment simila r to that observed at the scheduled time 
point.  Therefore, calculated LDL -C values missing during the on -treatment period 
(eg, samples obtained out -side the specified window, no blood sample available 
although visit was performed, etc.) should be consider ed “Missing at Random” and 
imputed based on other observed measurements in the on -treatment period.  
• Patients who stopped taking their study treatment in Part B no longer benefited from 
it after discontinuation, and thus tended to have calculated LDL -C values returning to 
baseline.  Therefore, calculated LDL -C values missing after the on -treatment period 
should be imputed based on patient’s own baseline value.  
Missing data from the ITT population will be imputed 100 times to generate 100 complete data 
sets, using the SAS MI procedure (using Markov Chain Monte Carlo).  The 100 completed 
datasets of observed and imputed calculated LDL -C data will be used for the primary analysis.  
For the percent change from baseline calculated LDL -C endpoint, the 100 complete d atasets of 
observed and imputed calculated LDL -C data at week 24 will be analyzed using the SAS 
MEANS procedure.  The SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical 
inferences by combining results from the 100 analyses using Rubin’s for mulae. Combined 
estimate for mean at Week 24 will be provided with the standard error (SE) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI). Formal statistical testing is not planned.  
Robustness of this statistical method will be assessed through sensitivity analyses deta iled in the 
SAP, including an ITT analysis and an on -treatment analysis of the percent change in calculated 
LDL-C from baseline to week 24 using a mixed -effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) 
approach. All post -baseline data available within the week 1  to week 24 analysis windows will 
be used and missing data will be accounted for by the MMRM model. The model will include 
the fixed categorical effect of time point, as well as the continuous fixed covariate of baseline 
LDL-C value.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Ana lysis for Part B  
For the secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in Section  4.1.2), descriptive summaries and 
analyses will be performed in the ITT popu lation, using values obtained regardless of adherence 
to study treatment and subsequent therapies (ITT estimand).  
For descriptive summaries, percent change, and when appropriate change from baseline, in 
calculated LDL -C, total-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B, and Lp(a ) will be provided at each time point 
during the 24 -week open -label treatment period. All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled, 
will be assigned to analysis windows defined in the SAP in order to provide an assessment for 
these time points. Laboratory as sessments other than the ones provided by the central laboratory 
will be excluded. The time profile of each parameter will be plotted with the corresponding SEs.  
Multiple types of measurements are planned to be analyzed during differing time points in the 
trial, specifically continuous measurements expected to have a normal distribution (eg, percent 
change in calculated LDL -C), continuous measurements expected to have a non -normal 
distribution [eg, Lp(a)], and binary measurements (eg, proportion of patients  with ≥50% 
reduction in calculated LDL -C). 
I Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution (ie, lipids 
other than Lp(a)) will be analyzed using the same PMM approach as for the primary endpoint. In 
addition, the same sensitivity analyses using MMRM approach as for the primary endpoint will 
be conducted in the ITT population and mITT population.  
II Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a non -normal distribut ion 
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints anticipated to have a non -normal distribution (ie, 
Lp(a)), will be analyzed using a robust regression model (ie, ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with 
M-estimation option) with baseline value as a covariate. Missing value s will be addressed using 
a multiple imputation approach, which will be described in the SAP. The combined means will 
be provided with respective SE estimates and 95% CI.  
III Binary Endpoints  
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed with multip le imputation approach for 
handling of missing values, which will be described in the SAP. Combined proportions will be 
provided with corresponding 95% CI.  
11.4.3.3.  Other Efficacy Analyses for Part B  
For patients who entered Part C, a combined summary including bot h the Part B and Part C 
assessments will be considered, referencing the Part B baseline for variable calculations. 
Prolonged time between last dose of study treatment in Part B and first dose of study treatment in 
Part C will need to be taken into consider ation when combining longitudinal efficacy data.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.5.  Safety Analysis  
The summary of safety results will be presented for patients in the SAF analysis set. No formal 
inferential testing will be performed. Summaries will be descriptive in nature.  
All safety analyses will be performed using the following common rule:  
• The baseline value is defined as the last available value before the first dose of study 
treatment.  
Safety analyses for the Part C treatment period in the Part  C safety analysis set of Part A patients 
will be performed separately for the period pre - versus post -switch to adjusted dose if applicable.  
Safety analyses for the combined treatment period of Part B and Part C will be performed in the 
Part C safety anal ysis set of Part B patients.

It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure that this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the  ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
13.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines f or Good Clinical Practice.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB/EC.  A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before  study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s) prior to the 
patient’s participation in the study and after the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards 
of the study have been explained to the fullest possible extent in language that the patient and the 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can understand.  The ICF shoul d be signed and dated by the 
patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the 
ICF. 
Local law must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both parents/guardians consent is required.  
If only 1 parent or guardian  signs the consent form, the investigator must document the reason 
the other parent or guardian did not sign.  The patient may also be required to sign and date the 
ICF, as determined by the IRB/EC and in accordance with the local regulations and 
requireme nts. 
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the assent form read to them before 
writing their name on the form.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF 
read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who  will sign and date the ICF to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, or if there 
are significant changes to the study procedures, the ICF must be reviewed and updated 
appropriately.  All study patients and their parent(s) or legal guar dian(s) must be informed of the 
new information and provide their written consent if they wish the patient to continue in the 
study.  The original signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a 
copy must be given to the patient’s  parent(s) or legal guardian(s).

approve: 
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patients 
(eg, advertising) before any patient may be enrolled in the study  
• Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before implementation, 
unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patient, in 
which case the IRB/EC should be info rmed as soon as possible  
• Ongoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk  
In addition, the IRB/EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of patients or 
the continued conduct of the clinical study.  
A copy of the IRB/EC approval letter with a current list of the IRB/EC members and their 
functions must be received by the sponsor prior to shipment of drug supplies to the investigator.  
The approval letter should include the study number and title, the d ocuments reviewed, and the 
date of the review.  
Records of the IRB/EC review and approval of all study documents (including approval of 
ongoing studies) must be kept on file by the investigator.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION  OF PATTERN MIXTURE 
MODEL  
As the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (ie, percent change from baseline to 
week 24 in calculated LDL -C for Part B), a pattern -mixture model approach will be used with a 
different imputation strategy applied for m issing calculated LDL -C values during the on -
treatment period (ie, within the time period from the first study treatment administration up to the 
day of the last study treatment administration +35 days or to the day before the first long -term 
extension tre atment administration, whichever comes first for Part B) and missing LDL -C values 
after treatment discontinuation (ie, after the day of last study treatment administration +35 days 
in Part B) based on the following assumptions:  
• Patients within 35 days of t heir last study treatment administration in Part B would 
continue to show benefit from treatment similar to that observed at the scheduled time 
point. Therefore, calculated LDLC values missing during the on -treatment period will 
be considered “Missing at R andom” and imputed using a model estimated using all 
samples collected on treatment.  
• Patients who stopped taking their study treatment no longer benefited from it in the 
future, and thus tended to have calculated LDL -C values returning to baseline. Thus 
calculated LDL -C values missing after treatment discontinuation will be imputed 
based on patient’s own baseline value.  
The assumptions for this approach are based on the following considerations:  
• Missing values during the on -treatment period are mostly conse cutive to:  
− Visits performed outside of the pre -specified time -window 
− No blood sample available although visit was done  
− LDL-C not measurable due to technical reasons  
In addition, these missing data are often intermittent, ie, followed by LDL -C values collec ted 
at subsequent visits. It is therefore considered reasonable to assume that these missing data 
were “At Random”.  
Missing LDL -C values will be imputed 100 times to generate 100 complete data sets. The 
percent change from baseline to week 24 will be deriv ed from observed and imputed LDL -C at 
this time point. The completed data sets will be analyzed using the SAS MEANS procedure. The 
results from the 100 analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formulae. If necessary, the number 
of imputations (100) will be increased until stable estimates are obtained.  
Imputation of missing data during the on -treatment period  
Missing LDL -C values during the on -treatment period will be imputed from other on -treatment 
measurements assuming Missing At Random, using SAS® MI proc edure. 
Only LDL -C values collected during the on -treatment period will be included in the imputation 
model. This way, missing LDL -C values during the on -treatment period will be imputed based 
solely on observed on -treatment LDL -C values. 
                                        VV-RIM-00192921-1.0 Approved - 25 May 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  The imputation mod el will include baseline LDL -C value, and all LDL -C values at pre -specified 
visits. Since the pattern of missing data will necessarily be non -monotone, a Monte -Carlo 
Markov Chain (MCMC) method will be used. A minimum value of 0 will be specified in order 
to avoid negative imputed LDL -C values. 
A sample SAS code is provided below:  
proc mi data=DATAIN out=DATAOUT nimpute=100 minimum=. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 SEED=17100;  
 ovar LDL_BASE LDL_W1 LDL_W2 LDL_W4 LDL_W8 LDL_W12 LDL_W16 LDL_W20 
LDL_W24;  
run; 
As stated above , the input dataset DATAIN will include only LDL -C values collected during the 
on-treatment period. Any LDL -C values collected during the post -treatment period will be 
excluded from the input dataset. In practice, the MI procedure will generate imputed val ues for 
all missing values (whether on -treatment or post -treatment), but only imputed values during the -
on-treatment period will be kept in the final datasets that will be analyzed. Imputed values during 
the post-treatment period will be discarded and repl aced by imputed values described in the next 
paragraph.  
Imputation of missing data after treatment discontinuation  
Missing LDL -C values during the post -treatment period will be imputed assuming LDL -C values 
would on average return to baseline values.  
For each patient, missing post -treatment LDL -C values will be imputed 100 times, using a 
random draw from a normal distribution (SEED=34200), with mean equal to patient’s own 
baseline value and variance equal to the conditional variance at the specific time -point, given the 
baseline value.  
Let Y0 and Y1 denote the LDL -C at baseline and at the specific time -point respectively. Since Y 0 
and Y1 are assumed to have a bivariate normal distribution, the conditional variance of Y 1 given 
Y0 is: 
 
Where  denotes the var iance of Y 1 and ρ the coefficient of correlation between Y 0 and Y1. 
The conditional variance will be estimated from observed data at the specific time -point. 
During the random generation process, a minimum value of 0 will also be applied in order to 
avoid negative imputed LDL -C values.

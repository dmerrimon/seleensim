Note: In both intervention arms (IMI/REL and Active Control), participants with cIAI or cUTI may have an optional switch 
to a specifie d oral antibacterial therapy after the indicated minimum number of days of IV study intervention at the 
investigator’s discretion based on the participant’s clinical condition and local standard of care. The choice of oral switch
therapy should be guided b y culture results and based on local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.
Note: Protocol -allowed comparator medications for each infection type are detailed by generic drug name in the EDC 
system, EDC guidelines, and Appendix 9.
Note: Study intervention, dose, and regimen are listed by infection type inTable 2.

aDoses for all age cohorts will be administered as 60 -minute infusions and will not exceed the adult maximum single 
dose of IMI/REL 500 mg/250 mg. IMI/REL is provided as a single -vial FDC; therefore, the dose for each 
component will be adjusted proportionally during preparation. 
bInitial doses of IMI/REL for partici pants in Age Cohorts 4 and 5 were selected based on results from the single -dose 
safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) study in pediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with proven 
or suspected gram -negative infections (MK -7655A -020) and c onfirmed based on review of safety, tolerability, 
efficacy, and PK data from Age Cohorts 1 through 3 in the current study (PN021). Initial doses for Age Cohorts 4 
and 5 have beencommunicated to investigators and sites via Protocol Amendment (03) prior to initiation of 
enrollment of Age Cohorts 4 and 5.

AE= adverse event; cIAI=complicated intra -abdominal infection; cUTI=complicated urinary tract infection; EFU=early 
follow -up; EOIV= end of IV therapy; EOT=end of therapy; HABP/VABP=hospital -acquired or ventilator- associated 
bacterial pneumonia; IMI/REL=fixed -dose combination imipe nem/cilastatin and relebactam (MK -7655A ); IV=intravenous; 
LFU=late follow -up; OTX=on therapy; PK=pharmacokinetic.
aParticipants receiving IMI/REL will have blood samples for PK analysis collected on Day 1 at 3 time points : (1) 30 
minutes prior to the start of the first dose of IV study intervention; (2) within 10 minutes after the end of the first 
infusion; and (3) at 2 to 6 hours after the start of the first infusion; a nd once at the OTX visit (on Day 2 OR Day 3) at 2 
to 6 hours after th estart of any infusion that day. 
bThe EOIV visit will occur only in participants with cIAI or cUTI whom the investigator deems eligible to switch to oral 
antibacterial therapy (after completion of at least 3 days of IV alone) b ased on the participant’s clinical condition and 
local standard of care. If performed, the EOIV visit must occur ≤24hours after the last IV dose.
cThe total duration of all study intervention (IMI/REL or active control) must be a minimum of 5 days (cIAI an d cUTI, 
IV alone or IV then oral, of which at least 3 days must be IV alone before optional oral switch) or 7 days 
(HABP/VABP, IV alone) up to 14 days (IV alone or IV then oral). Participants with bacteremia or Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa infection should recei ve 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Extension beyond 14 days requires Sponsor approval. 
Participants with cIAI or cUTI who are switched to oral therapy will have the EOT visit ≤24 h ours after the last oral 
dose. For all participants, EOT is the end of all st udy intervention ,and the EOT visit must occur ≤24 hours after 
completion of the last IV or oral dose. 
dSafety and efficacy assessments must occur at the EOIV (for participants who switch to oral therapy), EOT, EFU, and 
LFU visits.
eThe 28-day survival assessment is to be performed on Day 28 post -randomization at either the EFU or LFU visit or by 
telephone call on Day 28 ( +3 days) post -randomization.

2 INTRODUCTION
2.1 Study Rationale
This is the second study in support of the pediatric development of IMI/REL 
(imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, MK -7655A) for the treatment of bacterial infections caused 
by gram -negative bacteria, including HABP/VABP, cIAI, and c UTI, in patients who may be 
infected with carbapenem -resistant gram- negative bacteria.
The goals of this study are to gain additional safety data for IMI/REL in pediatric patients, to 
confirm dose recommendations derived from the first pediatric study (MK- 7655 A-020), and 
to describe efficacy in the pediatric population.
2.2 Background
The FDC of imipenem, cilastatin, and REL was approved as RECARBRIO™ by the US 
FDA on 16 JUL 2019 for use in patients 18 years of age and older who have limited or no 
alternative t reatment options for the treatment of cUTI, including pyelonephritis, caused by 
the following susceptible gram -negative microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia 
coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for the 
treatment of cIAI caused by the following susceptible gram -negative microorganisms: 
Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides stercoris, 
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Citrobac ter 
freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Klebsiella 
aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Parabacteroides distasonis, and P.
aeruginosa. Refer to the IB for detailed background information on REL (relebactam, 
MK-7655) and IMI/REL (imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, MK -7655A) and to the 
PRIMAXIN® USPI [U.S. Prescribing Information 2017] or TIENAM® SPC (ex -US) 
[Summar y of Product Characteristics 2011] for background information on IMI 
(imipenem/cilastatin).
2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
β-lactam antibacterials (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams) are 
among the most frequently used antimicrobial agents in clinical practice. The continuing 
development of resistance to these β- lactam antibacterials poses an ongoing threat to the 
clinical utility of all β- lactams. The production of β -lactamases is the most important 
resistance mechanism among gram -negative bacteria. Therefore, there is an urgent need for 
new BLIs that can be combined with existing β -lactam antibacterials to protect against 
hydrolysis by 1 or more of the 4 classes (A, B, C, and D) of β -lactamase enzymes.
Pediatric patient s are particularly vulnerable to infections caused by drug resistant gram -
negative pathogens due to the few broad -spectrum antibacterials approved for use in pediatric 
patients. For treatment of carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections in pediatr ic 
patients, for example, there are few treatment alternatives; these include aminoglycosides, 
fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin (mostly 
for treatment of uncomplicated UTI). Many of these antibacterials have li mitations, such as 
08RP9Y
PRODUCT: MK-7655A 43
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
the rapid emergence of resistance when aminoglycosides are used as single agents for 
bacteremia and the caution that needs to be exercised when prescribing fluoroquinolones to 
pediatric patients due to osteoarticular side -effects observe d in animal models as well as 
pediatric patients [Hsu, A. J. 2014 ] [U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2018] .
REL is a parenteral (IV), small -molecule BLI that has been developed for administration as 
an FDC in a single vial with imipenem/cilastatin (IMI) for the treatment of infections caused 
by carbapenem -resistant ,gram -negative bacteria. The FDC of 
imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam (MK -7655 A) is referred to as IMI/REL.
REL represents a new generation of BL Is to combat evolving antibacterial resistance and to 
maintain the usefulness of the β -lactam class of antibacterials. REL is an inhibitor of Ambler 
class A and class C β -lactamases. This BLI is highly potent for AmpC, a common class C β -
lactamase encounte red in many bacteria, most predominantly P.aeruginosa. REL is also 
active against the class A β -lactamases, including the KPC present in some 
Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella strains. The IMI/REL β- lactam/BLI combination 
builds on a long history of pediatric safety and efficacy of IMI (Section 2.2.2) and its broad 
spectrum of activity.
2.2.2 Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Details of preclinical and clinical studies are described in the IB. Overall, the preclinical 
toxicity profile observed with REL supported continuation of clinical studies with this 
compound. In addition, there were no REL -related findings in a 1 -month juvenile toxicity 
study conducted in rats, up to 450 mg/kg/day (maximum feasible dose) administered 
subcutaneously (postnatal Day 14 to 34) or intravenously (postnatal Day 35 to 56/57) at 65, 
200, or 450 mg/kg/day (~6 -fold the clinical exposure).
REL has been evaluated in adults either alone or in combination with IMI (as IMI + REL or 
the FDC IMI/REL) in 10 completed Phase 1 studies, 2 completed Phase 2 studies (MK -7655
003 [PN003] and MK- 7655 -004 [PN004]), and 4completed Phase 3 studies (MK -7655A- 013 
[PN013], and MK- 7655 A-014 [PN014], MK- 7655A -016[PN016], MK-7655 A-017 
[PN017]). The details and results of these studies are described i n the IB [IB Edition 14 
2021] . A brief summary of the results is as follows:
•In the Phase 2 studies, coadministration of 500 mg IMI and either 125 mg or 250 mg of 
REL was noninferior to treatment with 500 mg IMI alone in the treatment of cUTI 
(PN003) and cIAI (PN004) in a population in which most participants had an imipenem -
susceptible infection.
•In the Phase 3 studies, the FDC IMI/REL was at least as efficacious as colistin (in the 
form of colistimethate sodium ) + IMI for the treatment of imipenem -nonsusceptible and 
imipenem/REL -and colistin- susceptible bacterial infections (specifically HABP/VABP, 
cIAI, and cUTI) (PN013) and IMI/REL (500 mg/250 mg) q6h IV was generally well 
tolerated, with a favorable safety p rofile, and was an effective treatment for Japanese 
participants with cIAI or cUTI (PN017). In a study of s afety and efficacy of IMI/REL 
compared to PIP/TAZ in 274 participants with HABP/VABP ,IMI/REL was noninferior 
08RP9Y
PRODUCT: MK-7655A 44
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
to PIP/TAZ for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality through Day 28 and t he safety 
profile of IMI/REL was comparable to PIP/TAZ (PN016).
•Safety data from the 835unique participants exposed to REL across the adult clinical 
development program demonstrate that IMI/REL is well tolerated in healthy participants 
and in patients with serious bacterial infections, including critically ill patients and those 
infected with carbapenem resistant gram -negative bacteria. IMI/REL has a favorable 
safety profile that is similar to that of IMI alone and h as a more favorable safety profile 
than that of colistin.
There is 1 completed pediatric clinical study with MK -7655A at this time (MK -7655A -020 
[PN020]). PN020 was an open -label, single -dose study to evaluate the PK, safety, and 
tolerability of IM I/REL in pediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with 
proven or suspected gram -negative infections. The main objective of the study was to 
determine safe starting doses for pediatric c ohorts that yielded exposures associated with 
efficacy in adults.
PN020 showed that im ipenem, REL, and cilastatin exhibited approximately dose -
proportional PK across Cohorts 1 to 5; and both imipenem and REL exceeded protocol -
defined PK targets across Cohorts 1 to 5. A single dose of IV IMI/REL was gen erally well 
tolerated in pediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age and no safety 
concerns were identified.
There has been considerable experience with the use of IMI (imipenem/cilastatin) in both 
adults and pediatric patients since its initial approval over 30 years ago. The 2 pediatric 
clinical studies conducted by the Sponsor were open -label studies to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, and PK of IMI in approximately 233 hospitalized pediatric participants of 
3 mont hs to 12 years of age with serious bacterial infections, including respiratory tract, 
intra-abdominal, and urinary tract infections. IMI was efficacious and generally well 
tolerated in both pediatric studies.
2.2.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies
The current study in pediatric participants, MK -7655A -021, abbreviated as PN021 ,is the 
only ongoing clinical study .
2.2.4 Information on Other Study -related Therapy
Multiple active control regimens will be permitted in this study, as listed in Appendix 9 (see 
Section 4.2.3 on the ra tionale for their selection), consistent with real- world practice for the 
treatment of HABP/VABP, cIAI, and cUTI in pediatric patients. The selected regimen will 
ultimately depend on the needs of the patient per local standard of care.
2.2.4.1 Optional Oral Switch (cIAI, cUTI)
In the treatment of cIAI and of cUTI, it is common practice to switch from parenteral to oral 
antibacterials when the patient is afebrile and/or improving [Becknell, B., et al 2015] [Gra be, 
M., et al 2013] [Stein, R., et al 2015] , [Zorc, J. J., et al 2005] . For participants with cIAI or

cUTI, this study allows the investigator to opt to switch the participant to oral antibacterial 
study inte rvention after at least 3 days of IV study intervention, based on the participant’s 
clinical condition. See Section 8.1.8.1.2 for investigator criteria for determining whether the 
participant’s clinical condition warrants switch to oral antibacterial thera py for treatment of 
cIAI or cUTI in this study.
The acceptable oral switch options listed in Appendix 9 are common oral antibacterials with 
appropriate activity against the most common gram -negative pathogens encountered in cIAIs 
and cUTIs, respectively.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from 
treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
Efficacy data from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 adult development program have demonstrated 
that IMI/REL is noninferior to IMI alone in the treatment of cUTI and cIAI, and is at least as 
efficacious as colistin for the treatment of gram -negative ,imipenem -nonsusceptible, colistin -
susceptible bacterial infections (specifically HABP/VABP, cIAI, and cUTI). The 
pathogenesis and microbiology of these diseases are similar in pediatric patients and in 
adults.
In this study, participants will eit her receive multiple IV infusions of IMI/REL or standard-
of-care treatment (Section 4.1). The risks of administration of multiple doses of IMI/REL are 
considered to be minimal. IMI has a well -established safety and tolerability profile among 
pediatric pati ents, both from the pediatric development program and from decades of clinical 
use for serious bacterial infections. Furthermore, there are no significant or excessive adverse 
effects observed among other preclinical or clinical studies involving REL or IM I/REL to 
date (see Section 2.2.2). There is no evidence of additional risk posed by the addition of REL 
to IMI; the safety profile of the combination is similar to that of IMI alone.
Obtaining blood samples for PK analysis does pose a small risk, which is minimized by 
imposing blood sampling volume limits and reducing the frequency of sampling ( Table 4 ). 
Although more frequent, the proposed study procedures described i n Section 1.3 –SoA are 
generally standard procedures performed for the target patient population (eg, chemistry and 
hematology measurements).
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants in this clinical study 
may be found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents.

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, including prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in Section 1.3 of the SoA. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
This is a randomized, active -controlled, parallel -group, multi -site, open- label study of 
IMI/REL in pediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed or 
suspected gram -negative bacterial infection. Participants with HABP/VABP, cIAI, or cUTI 
will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to re ceive IMI/REL or active control. Participants will be 
stratified by age group and infection type prior to randomization (see Section 6.3.2).
Approximately 140 participants will be enrolled to target having 132 participants 
(approximately 99 in the IMI/REL group and 33 in the active control group) included in the 
safety population (ie, who received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention).
Five pediatric age cohorts will be evaluated in the study as follows, with the following 
minimum or maximum number of participants enrolled in each:
•Age Cohort 1: Adolescents (12 to <18 years) -No more than 12 participants
•Age Cohort 2: Older Children (6 to <12 years) -At least 20 participants
•Age Cohort 3: Younger Children (2 to <6 years) -At least 20 participants
•Age Cohort 4: Infants and Toddlers (3 months to <2 years) -At least 28 participants
•Age Cohort 5: Neonates and Young Infants (birth to <3 months) - At least 28 participants
Three infection types will be evaluated in the study as follows. As differences in the 
distribution of infection types within each age cohort are likely, a balance of infection types 
across age cohorts is unlikely to be achievable; therefore, an IRT system will be used to meet 
the following enrollment targets: 
•At least 28 participants wit hany of the following infections :HABP/VABP or cIAI .
•cIAI - At least 10% of participants with cIAI have a diagnosis other than complicated 
appendicitis.
•cUTI -No more than 48 participants with cUTI in Age Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 combined.
All participants w ill receive multiple IV doses of either IMI/REL or active control for a total 
duration of all study intervention of a minimum of 5 days (cIAI and cUTI, IV alone or IV 
then oral, of which at least 3 days must be IV alone before optional oral switch) or 7 da ys 
(HABP/VABP, IV alone) up to a maximum of 14 days (IV alone or IV then oral). Extension 
of study therapy beyond 14 days requires Sponsor approval as described in Section 4.3.3. 
Doses and treatment regimens are specified in Table 3. For IMI/REL, adolescent participants 
08RP9Y

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
(Age Cohort 1) will receive the approved adult dose and participants <12 years of age (Age 
Cohorts 2- 5) will receive weight -based dosing, not t o exceed the adult dose. 
Safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK assessments will be conducted during the intervention 
and follow -up periods as described in Figure 1and the SoA (Section 1.3). Study visits will be 
performed at randomization (Day 1), OTX, at the end of IV therapy (EOIV, only for 
participants who switch to oral therapy), and at the EOT. The EOT is the end of all study 
intervention (IV alone or IV then ora l). Following the completion of all study intervention, 
participants will be evaluated 7 to 14 days after EOT (at the EFU visit) and 7 to 14 days after 
the EFU visit (at the LFU visit). The investigator may decide to switch participants with cIAI 
or cUTI t o oral antibacterial therapy based on the participant’s clinical condition (see the oral 
switch criteria in Section 8.1.8.1.2) after a minimum of 3 days of IV study intervention; these 
participants will have an EOIV visit (see the SoA) and complete a total duration of all study 
intervention (IV then oral) of a minimum of 5 days up to a maximum of 14 days. All 
participants will have a Day 28 post -randomization survival assessment, which may be 
performed on the same day as the EFU or LFU visit or as a separate telephone contact. In 
addition, all deaths that occur during the study period will be reported as part of routine 
safety assessment.
Safety and tolerability will be monitored periodically throughout the study and at the planned 
interim analysis (describe d below) by an eDMC in conjunction with the Sponsor EOC as 
described in Section 9.7 and Appendix 1 -Section 10.1.4. The enrollment strategy is 
described in Figure 2. For Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 ,enrollment will be initiated in parallel. To 
assess whether the safety and tolerability profile is acceptabl
e overall and for each age cohort 
and to confirm the proposed initial doses for Age Cohorts 4 and 5, an interim analysi s will be 
performed when at least 20 participants in each of Age Cohorts 2 and 3 have complete data 
available (all complete data available from Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will be reviewed at this 
time). No formal efficacy analyses will be conducted for eDMC review; however, PK and/or 
efficacy data will be provided to the eDMC on request to support benefi t-to-risk evaluation. 
Once the proposed initial doses for Age Cohorts 4 and 5 are confirmed based on the findings 
from internal interim review, as described in Section 9.7, enrollment in Age Cohorts 4 and 5 
will begin in parallel. Enrollment in Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will continue beyond the interim 
review up to a maximum of approximately 84 participants across Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, 
until at least 28 partici pants each in Age Cohort s4 and 5 have final data available and the 
target of 132 participants across all age cohorts in the safety analysis population has been 
achieved.
An interim analysis to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK may be performed when 
final data from Age Cohorts 1 to 3 are available. The final analysis of aggregated safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from Cohorts 1 through 5 will be performed when 
enrollment in Age Cohorts 4 and 5 has completed and the total enrollment ha s been achieved.
If needed, dose modifications will be determined and communicated as described in Section 
6.6 – Dose Modification.
Each participant will remain in the study for up to 44 days from the time the participant’s 
legally acceptable representative provides documented informed consent through the final 
08RP9Y

contact. This includes a screening phase of up to 2 days before receiving t he first dose of IV 
study intervention, up to 14 days of study intervention (IV alone or IV then oral), and up to 
28 days of follow -up after the last IV or oral dose of study intervention.
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This study is randomized to m inimize bias. A 3:1 randomization ratio has been selected to 
gain greater experience with IMI/REL and to maximize the opportunity to assess safety and 
efficacy. Randomization is stratified by age and by infection type for balanced distribution 
across age c ohorts and infection types. The oldest 3 age cohorts (Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) 
will be studied in parallel. Enrollment in the 2 youngest age cohorts (Age Cohorts 4 and 5) 
will be initiated after completion of the internal interim review of aggregated safet y, 
tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and confirmation of doses.
A comparative design is used for descriptive analysis of safety and efficacy data and to 
confirm dose selection for all age cohorts based on PN020 results. As described in Section 
4.2.3, multiple active control regimens are permitted; as such, this is an open -label study, as 
blinding of multiple active control regimens is not feasible and the need to administer 
placebo infusions is avoided.
There is no formal statistical testing of hypotheses in this study. Instead, the goal is to 
provide estimates of important safety, efficacy, and PK endpoints in the overall study 
population as well as within the different age cohorts.
4.2.1 Rationale for Study Population
Participants with 1 of 3 primary infection types (HABP/VABP, cUTI, or cIAI) will be 
enrolled in this study. These 3 infection types are consistent with the infections studied in the 
adult development program for IMI/REL. It is well documented that the lun gs, abdomen, and 
urinary tract are some of the most common sites of infection in patients with MDR 
infections, including CR, gram -negative infections ( P.aeruginosa and KPC), as well as 
healthcare -associated infections [Markou, Nikolaos, et al 2003] , [Reina, R., et al 2005] , 
[Falagas, M. E., et al 2005] , [Pintado, V., et al 2008] ,[Garnacho -Montero, J., et al 2003] , 
[Cheng, C.- Y., et al 2010] , [Kallel, H., et al 2007] , [Hachem, Ray Y., et al 2007] , [Bader, M. 
S., et al 2010] . In addition, HABP/VABP, cUTI, and cIAI are important healthcare -
associated infections in pediatric patients, as evidenced by the following :
•Among ventilated PICU patients, VABP occurs in 3% to 9% of patients [Elward, A. M., 
et al 2002] [Patria, M. F. 2013] [Roeleveld, P. P., et al 2011] . Among neonatal ICU 
patients, pneumonia is the second most common healthcare -associated infection, 
occurring at a rate of 0.2 to 1.7 per 1000 ventilator days, with higher rates in the smallest 
weight subsets [Hooven, T. A. 2014] [Dudeck, M. A., et al 201 3].
•Among patients with cIAI, appendicitis as a single entity occurs at an overall rate of 10.9 
cases per 10,000 population for all ages, and at a rate of 12.9 cases per 10,000 population 
for the age group <15 years of age [DeFrances, C. J., et al 2007] . Appendicitis is more 
common in pediatric and young adult populations compared with older adults

[Addiss, D. G., et al 1990] [Andersen, S. B., et al 2009] ; itoccurs in 7% of the population 
over their lifetime [Addiss, D. G., et al 1990] .
•Catheter -associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a subset of cUTI and is the most 
common type of nosocomial infection, accounting for 40% of hospital -acquired 
infections. The Pediatric Prevention Network reported the US point prevalence of 
pediatric CAUTI in PICUs to be 13.3 per 1000 urinary catheter days [Davis, K. F., et al 
2014] [Grohskopf, L. A., et al 2002] .
This study does not limit enrollment to participants with CR infections. In the pivotal Phase 3 
study PN013, adult participants were required to have screening susceptibility testing and 
confirmed CR infection for stu dy entry. However, in this study, the primary objective is to 
evaluate safety and tolerability in pediatric participants, and no formal statistical testing will 
be performed for the efficacy endpoints. Since efficacy against infections due to resistant 
pathogens is not being evaluated, confirmed CR infection is not required for study entry.
4.2.1.1 Rationale for Exclusion of Patients With Renal Impairment
Patients with renal impairment are excluded from participating in this study (Section 5.2).
Imipenem, cilastatin, and REL are all known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and 
the risk of toxic reactions to them may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
Please refer to the PRIMAXIN® (imipenem/cilastatin) USPI [U.S. Prescribing Information 
2017] or TIENAM® Summary of Product Characteristics (ex -US) [Summary of Product 
Characteristics 2011] and to the IB on dose adjustment and detailed co nsiderations regarding 
IMI/REL use in participants with renal impairment. IMI is not recommended in pediatric 
patients weighing <30 kg with renal impairment, as no data are available on use in this 
population, and there are no dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with renal 
impairment in the USPI.
Patients requiring hemodialysis are likewise excluded from this study, as are patients 
requiring peritoneal dialysis, for whom there is inadequate information to recommend usage. 
In adults, patients with CrCl <90 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft- Gault equation) 
require dosage reduction of IMI. In patients with CrCl <30 to ≥15mL/min, there may be an 
increased risk of seizures. Patients with CrCl <15 mL/min should not receive IMI unless 
hemodialysis i s instituted within 48 hours. For patients on hemodialysis, IMI is 
recommended only when the benefit outweighs the potential risk of seizures. Administration 
of IMI to such patients would require individual patient- level evaluation of the risk/benefit of 
treatment (ie, the same rule cannot be applied to all study participants) [U.S. Prescribing 
Information 2017] .
4.2.1.2 Rationale for Exclusion of Patients With Meningitis
Participants less than 3 months of age will be en rolled in this study only after the investigator 
rules out meningitis by perform ingan LP with CSF culture (if clinically indicated per local 
standard- of-care) or by other standard -of-care procedures or clinical assessments (see Section 
5.2 and Section 8.3 .4). Neonates and young infants less than 3 months of age with fever are 
generally treated empirically for meningitis until it can be ruled out 
08RP9Y
PRODUCT: MK-7655A 51
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
[Kadish, H. A., et al 2000] [Ferrera, P. C., et al 1997] [Bonadio, W. A., et al 1993] [Bachur, 
R. G. 2001] [Bedetti, L., et al 2018] . IMI is not indicated in pediatric patients with CNS 
infections, including meningitis, because of the risk of seizures [U.S. Prescribing Information 
2017] . The investigator’s assessment of the absence of meningitis must be documented on 
the source documents at the time of screening. This study excludes participants less than 3 
months of age who have had more than 72 hours of prior empiric antibacterial treatment for 
suspected meningitis prior to initiation of IV study intervention. This 72 -hour window for 
this age cohort allows time for LP with CSF culture results to rule out meningitis (see Section 
8.3.4). Exclusion of meningitis is consistent with the well -established clinical management of 
young infants with serious bacterial infections and guidance on the treatment of bacterial 
infections [European Medicines Agency 2013] , nosocomial pneumonia [West, M., et al 
2003] , HABP/VABP, [Food and Drug Administration 2014] , cIAI [Food and Drug 
Administrati on 2018] , and cUTI [Food and Drug Administration 2018] .
4.2.2 Rationale for Endpoints
4.2.2.1 Efficacy Endpoints
A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the following efficacy endpoints in 
randomized pediatric participants with HABP/VABP, cUTI, or cIAI:
•All-cause mortality through Day 28 post -randomization
•Clinical response assessed at the EOT, EFU (7 to 14 days after EOT), and LFU (7 to 14 
days after EFU) visits 
•Microbiological response assessed at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits
Exploratory objectives of this study are to evaluate the following efficacy endpoints:
•Clinical response assessed at the EOIV visit (for participants who switch to oral therapy)
•Microbiological response assessed at the EOIV visit (for participants who switch to oral 
therapy)
•By-pathogen microbiological response assessed a t the EOIV visit (for participants who 
switch to oral therapy) and at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits (for all participants)
4.2.2.1.1 All-cause Mortality/Survival Status
Survival status (ie, whether the participant is alive or dead) through Day 28 post -
randomization will be evaluated for all participants in support of the key secondary objective.
Evaluation of mortality is appropriate in this study population given the severity of illness in 
hospitalized patients who may have acquired MDR gram -negative bacterial infec tions and 
routinely require in- hospital treatment with IV antibacterials. For example, in recently 
conducted studies in adults with HABP/VABP, approximately 15% of adult participants died 
despite receiving antibacterial drug therapy [Freire, A. T., et al 2010] [Joshi, M., et al 2006] 
08RP9Y
PRODUCT: MK-7655A 52
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
[Torres, A., et al 2000] [Chastre, J., et al 2008] . As in adults, HABP/VABP in pediatric 
patients has been associated with increased mortality and increased hosp ital and/or ICU 
length of stay [Foglia, E., et al 2007] [Gupta, S., et al 2015] [Gautam, A., et al 2012] [Patria, 
M. F. 2013] [Roeleveld, P. P., et al 2011] . Although published data i n pediatric populations 
have been criticized for being unmatched for severity of illness and univariate, they have 
suggested that pediatric patients with VAP may have excess mortality and length of ICU stay 
[Foglia , E., et al 2007] ; a European epidemiology study of hospital -acquired infections found 
a mortality rate of 10% in PICU patients with nosocomial infections [Foglia, E., et al 2007]
and a US multicenter, prospe ctive study found pediatric patients with VAP to have an 
unadjusted mortality rate of 10% to 20% [Gupta, S., et al 2015] .
A 1-month mortality endpoint has commonly been used for evaluation of efficacy of 
antibac terial therapy against HABP/VABP [Kollef, M. H., et al 2012] [Chastre, J., et al 2008] 
[West, M., et al 2003] and against MDR gram -negative infections [Markou, Nikolaos, et al 
2003] [Pintado, V., et al 2008] [Cheng, C. -Y., et al 2010] . In addition to assessing all -cause
mortality at Day 28, all deaths that occur during the entire study period will be reported as 
part of routine safety assess ment.
4.2.2.1.2 Clinical Response
As in the adult studies, clinical response will be assessed for all participants based on 
evaluation by the investigator at the time points specified in the SoA. Based on comparison 
to baseline clinical signs and symptoms of the par ticipant’s infection, the investigator will 
determine the clinical response rating, and the Sponsor will classify the response as 
“favorable” or “unfavorable” at each visit as described in Section 8.2.2.2 ( Table 6 and Table 
7).
The evaluation of clinical response at these time points will p
rovide data to characterize the 
response profile of the test product, relative to the active control. Most cIAI studies evaluate 
efficacy based on clinical response because secondary microbiological cultures are generally 
not available. These analyses are routinely performed at the end -of-study therapy and at post -
therapy follow -up visits, which is consistent with the time points selected in this study.
4.2.2.1.3 Microbiological Response
As in the adult studies in the IMI/REL development program, microbiological response will 
be assessed based on e ach infection- site pathogen isolated in the baseline infection -site 
culture (ie, by pathogen) for:
•Participants with HABP/VABP or cIAI who require a procedure that allows for specimen 
collection postbaseline and in whom at least 1 gram -negative baseline pa thogen is 
isolated; and
•Participants with cUTI who are able to provide a clean urine specimen postbaseline and 
in whom at least 1 gram -negative baseline pathogen is isolated at the minimum colony 
count specified in the cUTI Microbiology criteria ( Appe ndix 8 -Section 10. 8.3).
08RP9Y
PRODUCT: MK-7655A 53
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
Assessment of microbiological response (Section 8.2.3.2) will also consider blood pathogens 
isolated in the baseline blood culture for participants with blood cultures available (Section 
8.2.3.1.4).
The investigator will determine the by-pathogen response rating at visits specified in the SoA 
based on the local laboratory results of infection -site cultures collected for participants at 
each of these visits, when available, relative to the pathogen(s) isolated at baseline as 
described i n Section 8.2.3.2 ( Table 8 and Table 9).
The Sponsor will assess the overall microbiological response (ie, overall microbiological 
response for the participant based on the response of all pathogens present in the baseline 
culture) as “favorable” or “unfavorable” for determining participants’ microbiological 
response for the respe ctive infection type in this study.
See Section 8.2.3.1 for details of the infection- site specimen and blood culture procedures.
In participants with cUTI, it is usually feasible to collect appropriate follow -up specimens 
(ie, urine) at each of the endpoint visits throughout the study. However, collection of 
respiratory and/or intra -abdominal specimens after initiation of study antibacterials may not 
be feasible or medically appropriate for participants with HABP/VABP or cIAI, making it 
difficult to document microbiological eradication in participants with these infections. 
Therefore, presumed eradication may be inferred when no respiratory or intra -abdominal 
specimen is available because a participant is deemed clinically improved or cured of the 
pathogen t hat was found at the time of study entry.
In participants with HABP/VABP, LRT cultures would preferentially include samples 
collected from a tracheostomy or endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoscopy specimens. 
Expectorated or induced sputum samples are also accepted provided the sample does not 
represent oropharyngeal contamination (ie, sample contains fewer than 10 squamous 
epithelial cells and greater than 25 neutrophils on low -power microscopy review of the Gram 
stain).
Most cUTI studies evaluate efficacy based on microbiological eradication of the bacterial 
pathogens from subsequent urine cultures. Such analyses are routinely performed at the end -
of-study therapy and following completion of all antibacterial therapy (usually 1 week and 4 
to 6 weeks followi ng completion of all antibacterial therapy). This is consistent with the time 
points for microbiological response specified in the SoA. Although not typically measured as 
a primary efficacy outcome in HABP/VABP or cIAI studies, microbiological response wil l 
also be measured in participants with these infection types who have post- baseline cultures 
available (as described above) to allow for further characterization of IMI/REL efficacy. 
4.2.2.1.4 Exploratory Endpoint: By -pathogen Microbiological Response
In addition to evaluating microbiological response for each participant who has an acceptable 
post-baseline infection -site specimen available, microbiological response will also be 
evaluated separately for each infection -site pathogen isolated in the baseline culture. See 
Sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4 for details of the procedures, assessments, ratings ( Table 8 and 
08RP9Y

MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
Table 9 ), and categories (“favorable” or “unfavorable”) for determining participants’ by -
pathogen microbiological response for the respective infection type in this study.
4.2.2.2 Safety Endpoints
The primar y objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMI/REL from 
the first dose of IV study intervention through 14 days after completion of all study 
intervention. The safety and tolerability of IMI/REL (as well as of the active control ) will be 
assessed through descriptive statistics within the safety analysis population for each age 
cohort by clinical evaluation of AEs and inspection of other safety parameters including local 
tolerability assessments and standard clinical laboratory ev aluations at the time points 
specified in the SoA. Adverse events are graded and recorded as set out in Section 8.4. 
Participants may be asked to return for unscheduled visits to perform additional safety 
monitoring.
4.2.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Another secondary objective of this study is to characterize the PK profile of imipenem and 
REL following administration of IMI/REL.
At the time points specified in the SoA, only participants randomized to receive IMI/REL 
will have whole blood samples collected for det ermination of plasma concentrations of REL, 
imipenem, and cilastatin. These samples will support further evaluation of the PK profiles of 
these drugs by confirming that participants achieve expected exposures, and will also aid in 
further assessment of the clinical relationship between imipenem and REL plasma 
concentrations and efficacy.
Sparse PK sampling will be performed at 4 time points per participant to minimize the 
number of samples and blood volume drawn from pediatric participants. The sample at the 
end of the first infusion on Day 1 will help further characterize the maximum concentration 
(Cmax), and each sample during the elimination phase window (Day 1 sample taken 2 to 6 
hours after first dose, and the Day 2 to 3 sample) will help characterize t he elimination phase. 
Together, these data will help characterize the entire PK profile using the population PK 
modeling and confirm the ratio of the free area under the plasma concentration -time curve to 
the imipenem/REL MIC ( fAUC 0-24h/MIC) and the percentage of time free imipenem 
concentration is above the imipenem/REL MIC (% fT>MIC) estimation for REL and 
imipenem, respectively. REL and imipenem PK data will be added to existing pediatric PK 
data from PN020 to further update the pediatric population PK m odel. Collecting PK data on 
multiple days on therapy will also enable capturing any impact of disease status on the 
PK/dosing of the drugs. See Section 9.4.3 for further details on the PK analysis endpoints.
Based on established literature in the field and data from the adult IMI/REL development 
program, efficacy of IMI/REL is driven by the % fT>MIC within the dosing interval for 
imipenem and by fAUC 0-24h/MIC for REL. Because the pathogenesis and microbiology of the 
infections for which IMI/REL is being dev eloped are similar in adult and pediatric 
populations, the PK targets selected in this study are the same as those for adults.

The goal of the model -based simulations is to confirm that these targets are jointly achieved 
in a proportion of pediatric parti cipants similarly covered in adults (~90% probability of 
target attainment) for each age cohort; hence, achieving these targets implies similar efficacy 
as that obtained in adults. An absolute (mg) or weight -based (mg/kg) dose, whichever is 
found most suit able for each age cohort, will be selected based on the simulation results.
Plasma concentrations of REL, imipenem, and cilastatin will be determined. As this is an 
estimation study, no formal statistical testing will be performed for the PK data. The 
additional REL and imipenem PK data collected in this study will be used to update the 
pediatric population PK model, based on the adult model, and confirm the adequacy of 
selected doses. The population PK analysis will be summarized in a separate pediatric 
population PK modeling and simulation report; the model will then be used in simulations to 
determine suitable dosing regimens for subsequent and separate pediatric clinical efficacy 
studies. The PK properties of cilastatin based on data from this study will also be described 
on an as -needed basis.
4.2.3 Rationale for the Use of Active Controls
Acceptable active control options per local standard of care for each respective infection type 
are listed by drug class in Table 2 and by generic drug name in Appendix 9 - Protocol -
allowed Comparator Medications by Drug Name. The Sponsor considers these options to be 
clinically appropriate and acceptable active controls with which to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of IMI/REL in pediatric participants with HABP/VABP, cIA I, and cUTI.
In contrast to adults, there are no specific guidelines for the treatment of gram -negative 
bacterial infections, with the exception of cIAI, in the pediatric population, and there is 
considerable variation in clinical practice across healthcar e facilities. Given the variation in 
practice, as well as geographic differences in epidemiology and the wide variety of pediatric 
health conditions that may result in the need for mechanical ventilation (ranging from healthy 
children with traumatic injuri es to pediatric patients with multiple complex medical 
conditions), mandating a single active control regimen would limit study feasibility and 
would be inconsistent with real -world clinical practice. The selected regimen will ultimately 
depend on the need s of the patient.
Empiric gram- positive coverage will similarly be left to the investigator’s judgment, as 
IMI/REL has inherent gram -positive coverage due to its IMI component, as do other 
β-lactam/BLI agents that may be used for HABP/VABP. Coverage for me thicillin -resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) should be considered where necessary based on local 
epidemiology, but will not be required for all participants. Specific considerations for 
treatment of each infection type are discussed in Section 4.3.3.

4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 Starting Dose for This Study
The initial doses of IMI/REL for Age Cohorts 1 through 3 are as follows:
•Age Cohort 1: 500/250 mg q6h administered as a 60- minute infusion
•Age Cohort 2: 15/7.5 mg/kg q6h administered as a 60 -minute infus ion
•Age Cohort 3: 15/7.5 mg/kg q6h administered as a 60 -minute infusion 
These doses were selected based on results from the first 3 age cohorts in PN020 (Section 
2.2.3 – Ongoing Clinical Studies). For weight -based dosing for participants <12 years of age 
(Age Cohorts 2 through 5), the maximum allowed dose is 500/250 mg (or the approved adult 
dose), as noted in Table 3.The doses of IMI/REL for pediatric participant s in Age Cohorts 4 
and 5 were selected based on safety, tolerability, and updated PK modeling and simulation 
analyses, after incorporating observed PK data from Age Cohorts 1 through 3 during the 
interim review. The doses for Cohorts 4 and 5 were based on pediatric -model -based 
simulations with the intent of 1) obtaining similar exposures as achieved in adult cUTI/cIAI 
participants with normal renal function receiving IMI/REL 500/250 mg IV q6h, and 2) 
ensuring high PTA comparable to adults, and meeting safety margin criteria. The proposed 
initial doses in the current study were modified as described in Section 6.6 –Dose 
Modification.
4.3.2 Maximum Dose Exposure for This Study
As described in Section 6.6 –Dose Modification, the doses for each age coho rt in this study 
may be modified based on results of observed safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from 
the interim review of Age Cohorts 1 through 3. The final pediatric doses will not exceed the 
dosage studied for adult participants in the Phase 3 studies (ie, maximum single IV dose of 
IMI/REL 500/250 mg).
4.3.3 Rationale for Dose Interval and Study Design
For participants in the IMI/REL intervention arm, multiple doses of IMI/REL will be 
administered as a 60 -minute IV infusion q6h or q8h, as set out in Table 3 . A multiple -dose 
study design was selected based on the expected clinical use of IMI/REL in both adult and 
pediatric participants. A short half -life (approxima tely 30 to 60 minutes) of both imipenem 
and REL and lack of accumulation of any drug components was observed in adult studies. 
These properties are expected to be the same in pediatric participants, as supported by 
interim results from the PN020 single -dose PK study in pediatric participants with confirmed 
or suspected gram -negative infections.
Appropriate duration of therapy for treatment of pediatric suspected or confirmed gram -
negative bacterial infections (HABP/VABP, cIAI, and cUTI) remains controversia l, but most 
guidelines suggest 5 to 14 days of antibacterial therapy. In this study, the total duration of all 
antibacterial study intervention must be a minimum of 5 days (cIAI and cUTI, IV alone or IV 
08RP9Y

then oral, of which at least 3 days must be IV alone before optional oral switch) or 7 days 
(HABP/VABP, IV alone) up to a maximum of 14 days (IV alone or IV then oral). Of note, 
participants with evidence of concurrent bacteremia or with P.aeruginosa infection should 
receive 14 days of antibacterial treatme nt. For participants who may require extended 
durations of treatment (eg, those with suppressed immunity), extension of study intervention 
beyond 14 days may be allowed with Sponsor approval, as discussed between the Principal 
Investigator and Sponsor and documented on the Sponsor consultation form.
The intervention duration is consistent with practice guidelines and data from clinical studies. 
Current clinical practice guidelines suggest limiting treatment of infection types included in 
this study to 2 wee ks. Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend 
limiting treatment of HABP/VABP to as little as 1 week, cIAI to less than 1 week for most 
infections, and CAUTI to less than 2 weeks [Hooton, T. M., et al 2010] [Solomkin, J. S., et al 
2010] [Niederman, M. S. 2005] [Dellinger, R. P., et al 2013] . The requirement of at least 3 
days (cIAI and cUTI) or 7 days (HABP/VABP) of IV study intervention in this study allows 
for evalu ation of the safety, efficacy, and PK of IMI/REL while minimizing the need for 
prolonged hospitalization and IV access. Preclinical data for IMI/REL support and the 
clinical complexity of participants in this study warrants up to 14 days of study intervent ion. 
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on preclinical toxicity studies and Sections 
4.3.3.1 through 4.3.3.3 below for specific considerations for each of the 3 infection types.
AE data from the pivotal Phase 3 study (PN013) have demonstrated th at treatment with the 
FDC IMI/REL (500 mg/250 mg) q6h for 5 (cUTI and cIAI) or 7 (HABP/VABP) days up to 
21 days has been generally well tolerated in adult participants with imipenem -nonsusceptible 
gram -negative infections (cUTI, cIAI, or HABP/VABP). AE dat a from the 2 Phase 2 studies 
(PN003 and PN004) have demonstrated that coinfusion of IMI 500 mg and REL 250 mg q6h 
from 4 to 14 days has been generally well tolerated in adult participants with cUTI and cIAI, 
respectively, with a safety profile similar to that of IMI alone. Phase 1 studies evaluated REL 
as single doses up to 1150 mg, multiple doses up to 625 mg q6h for 7 days, or multiple doses 
up to 500 mg q6h for 14 days; no dose -limiting toxicity was observed over this range of 
doses up to a maximum of 14 days of dosing in a total of 59 adult participants who received 
REL at or above the proposed marketed dose of 250 mg (up to 625 mg REL) coinfused with 
500mg IMI for >4 days.
Dose interval and study design considerations for participants with HABP/VABP, cIAI, and 
cUTI are discussed in Section 4.3.3.1, Section 4.3.3.2, and Section 4.3.3.3, respectively.
4.3.3.1 Hospital -Acquired and Ventilator -Associated Bacterial Pneumonia 
(HABP/VABP)
For participants with HABP/VABP, IV study intervention will be admin istered for a 
minimum of 7 days up to a maximum of 14 days. Participants with evidence of concurrent 
bacteremia or with P. aeruginosa infection should receive 14 days of antibacterial treatment. 
Extension of study intervention beyond 14 days must be approv ed by the Sponsor as 
described in Section 4.3.3.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) guidelines 
recommend treatment of HABP/VABP for as few as 7 days, provided that the patient has a 
good clinical response and the infection is not caused by P. aeruginosa [Niederman, M. S. 
2005] . If deemed clinically appropriate, participants may receive up to 14 days of study 
intervention for non -Pseudomonas infections. In the setting of Ps eudomonas infection, a 
treatment duration of 14 days is predicated on data from several studies and meta -analyses, 
which show a lesser incidence of persistence or recurrence with ~2 weeks versus ~1 week of 
therapy [Pugh, R., et al 2011] [Chastre, J., et al 2003]. Lower responses and higher mortality 
were also recently seen following treatment with a shorter course of therapy (1 week of 
doripenem) versus a longer course of therapy (10 days of IMI) in P. aeruginosa VABP cases 
[Kollef, M. H., et al 2012]. An antibacterial treatment duration of 14 days for concurrent 
bacteremia is supported by current IDSA guidelines on the treatment of bloodstream 
infections and by standard clinical practice.
Further details of definitive treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients can be 
found in [Bradley, J. S. 2002] . These recommendations are similar to those for treatment o f 
adults with HABP/VABP as suggested by the ATS/IDSA [Niederman, M. S. 2005] .
4.3.3.2 Complicated Intra -Abdominal Infection (cIAI)
In general, cIAIs require a surgical procedure and parenteral antibacterial therapy. Cur rent 
recommendations are to limit the antibacterial course to 4 to 7 days in cases where adequate 
source control has been achieved [Solomkin, J. S., et al 2010] [Skrupky, L. P., et al 2013] . In 
an effort to evaluate the efficacy in this study, the total duration of all study intervention for 
cIAI has been set at a minimum of 5 days (IV alone or IV then oral, of which at least 3 days 
must be IV alone before optional oral switch) up to a maximum of 14 days ( IV alone or IV 
then oral). The investigator, based on the participant’s clinical condition, may decide to 
switch the participant to oral antibacterial therapy after at least 3 days of IV study 
intervention; participants with cIAI who switch to oral therapy will have a total duration of 
all study antibacterial therapy (IV then oral) of a minimum of 5 days up to a maximum of 14 
days. Extension of study intervention beyond 14 days must be approved by the Sponsor as 
described in Section 4.3.3.
Discussion of emp iric treatment options for cIAI in adult and pediatric patients can be found 
in [Solomkin, J. S., et al 2010] .
4.3.3.3 Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI)
Based on American Academy of Pediatrics treatment guideli nes, the total duration of 
treatment for cUTIs may vary from 7 days for a lower urinary tract infection to 10 to 14 days 
for acute pyelonephritis [Finnell, S. M., et al 2011] . In this study, participants with cU TI will 
have a total duration of all study antibacterial therapy of a minimum of 5 days (IV alone or 
IV then oral, of which at least 3 days must be IV alone before optional oral switch) up to a 
maximum of 14 days (IV alone or IV then oral). The investigato r, based on the participant’s 
clinical condition, may decide to switch the participant to oral antibacterial therapy after at 
least 3 days of IV study intervention; participants with cUTI who switch to oral therapy will 
have a total duration of all study a ntibacterial therapy (IV then oral) of a minimum of 5 days

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
up to a maximum of 14 days. Extension of study intervention beyond 14 days must be 
approved by the Sponsor as described in Section 4.3.3.
In general, cUTIs requiring parenteral therapy are routinely treated with a short course of IV 
antibacterial therapy followed by oral antibacterial therapy. This switch facilitates step -down 
antibacterial therapy in anticipation of eventual hospital discharge. See Section 2.2.4.1 on the 
rationale for the optional oral switch for participants with cIAI or cUTI in this study.
4.4 Beginning and End -of-Study Definition
The overall study begins when the first participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent/assent. The overall study ends when the last 
participant completes the last study- related contact, withdraws consent/assent, or is lost to 
follow -up (Section 7.3) .For purposes of analysis and reporting, the overall study ends when 
the Sponsor receives the last labora tory test result or at the time of final contact with the last 
participant, whichever comes last.
If the study includes countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), the local start of the 
study in the EEA is defined as First Site Ready (FSR) in any Membe r State.
4.4.1 Clinical Criteria for Early Study Termination
The clinical study may be terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of 
emerging effects is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population as a whole is 
unacceptable. In addit ion, further recruitment in the study or at (a) particular study site(s) 
may be stopped as described in Appendix 1.10.

•HABP/VABP: IV carbapenem, or IV PIP/TAZ, or IV cefepime 
•cIAI: IV carbapenem or IV third -generation cephalosporin + metronidazole, IV PIP/TAZ 
with optional oral switch to PO β -lactam/β -lactamase inhibitor combination, or PO 
second -or third -generation cephalosporin in combination with metronidazole, or PO 
quinolone (if ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, use in combination with metronidazole) 
•cUTI: IV third -or fourth -generation cephalosporin, IV ciprofloxacin, or IV meropenem 
with optional switch to PO β -lactam/β -lactamase inhibitor combination, or PO 
cephalosporin, or PO quinolone, or PO nitrofurantoin, or PO trimethoprim or 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
Protocol -allowed comparator medications for each infection type are detailed by generic drug 
name in the EDC system, EDC guidelines, and Appendix 9. The option to switch a 
participant with cIAI or cUTI to oral therapy after the indicated minimum number of days of 
IV study intervention is at the investigator’s dis cretion based on the participant’s clinical 
condition and local standard of care. The choice of oral switch therapy should be guided by 
culture results and based on local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.
IMI/REL administered by age -based dose and infusi on duration is summarized in Table 3 ; 
Active Control and oral switch administered per authorized PI, SPC, or international 
treatment guidelines. The total duration of all study intervention must be a minimum of 5 
days (cIAI and cUTI, IV alone or IV then oral, of which at least 3 days must be IV alone 
before optional oral switch) or 7 days (HABP/VABP, IV alone). The total duration of all 
study intervention for any infec tion type must not exceed 14 days (IV alone or IV then oral). 
Extension of study therapy beyond 14 days requires Sponsor approval (Section 4.3.3).

aDoses for all age cohorts will be administered as 60 -minute infusions and will not exceed the adult maximum single 
dose of IMI/REL 500 mg/250 mg. IMI/REL is provided as a single -vial FDC; therefore, the dose for each 
component will be adjusted proportional ly during preparation. 
bInitial doses of IMI/REL and infusion duration for participants in Age Cohorts 4 and 5 were selected based on 
results from the single -dose safety and PK study in pediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with 
proven or suspected gram -negative infections (MK -7655A -020) and confirmed based on review of safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from Age Cohorts 1 through 3 in the current study (PN021). Initial doses and 
infusion duration for Age Cohorts 4 and 5 we re communicated to investigators and sites via a protocol amendment 
prior to initiation of enrollment of Age Cohorts 4 and 5.
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
6.2.1 Dose Preparation
Specific calculations or evaluations required to be performed to administer the proper dose to 
each participant are outlined in a separate document provided by the Sponsor. The rationale 
for selection of doses to be used in this study is provided in Section 4.3.
6.2.2 Handling, Storage, and Accountability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
For all study sites, the local country Sponsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return , or local discard

and destruction if appropriate. Where local discard and destruction is appropriate, the 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that a local discard/destruction procedure is 
documented.
The study site is responsible for recording the lo t number, manufacturer, and expiry date for 
any locally purchased product (if applicable) as per local guidelines unless otherwise 
instructed by the Sponsor.
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appropriate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
interventions in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment
Intervention allocation/randomization will occur centrally using an IRT system. There are 2 
study intervention arms. Participants will be assigned randomly in a 3:1 ratio to IMI/REL or 
active control, respectively.
6.3.2 Stratification
Intervention al location/randomization will be stratified according to the following factors:
1.Age: 5 pediatric age cohorts will be evaluated in the study as follows:
Age Cohort 1: Adolescents (12 to <18 years)
Age Cohort 2: Older Children (6 to <12 years)
Age Cohort 3: Yo unger Children (2 to <6 years)
Age Cohort 4: Infants and Toddlers (3 months to <2 years)
Age Cohort 5: Neonates and Young Infants (birth to <3 months)
2.Infection Type: 3 infection types will be evaluated in the study as follows:
HABP/VABP
cIAI
cUTI
The IRT system will be used to limit enrollment in the study and in specific age cohorts by 
infection type as described in Section 4.1.
6.3.3 Blinding
This is an open -label study; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant will know 
the intervention admin istered.

6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Extensions of any study intervention (IV or oral) of >14 days of therapy and interruptions 
from the protocol -specified study therapy plan of (1) ≥2 doses of IV study intervention 
during the first 3 days of therapy, OR (2) ≥4 doses of IV study intervention from Day 4 to the 
end of IV study intervention, OR (3) ≥4 doses of oral study intervention from the end of IV 
study intervention to the EOT visit all require consultation between the investigator and the 
Sponsor and written documentation of the collaborative decision on participant management .
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during study 
intervention (IV or oral; see Section 5.2). If there is a clinical indication for any medication 
specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study intervention (IV or oral) 
may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the 
Sponsor Clinical Director. The final decision on any supportive therapy rests with the 
investigator and/or the participant ’s primary physician. However, the decision to continue the 
participant on study intervention (IV or oral) requires the mutual agreement of the 
investigator, the Sponsor, and the participant.
Listed below are specific restrictions for concomitant therapy during the course of the study:
1.Within 2 weeks prior to screening through 24 hours after completion of the final dose of 
IV study intervention: valproic acid or divalproex sodium.
2.During the course of all study intervention (IV alone or IV then oral): concomitant IV, 
oral, or inhaled antimicrobial agents with gram -negative activity, in addition to those 
designated in the study intervention groups.
NOTE: Use of IV vancomycin, IV da ptomycin, or IV linezolid to treat confirmed or 
suspected MRSA infection, use of IV linezolid or IV daptomycin to treat confirmed or 
suspected VRE infection, or use of TMP/SMX or other standard of care agent for 
prophylaxis of opportunistic infection (eg, Pneumocystis jiroveci infection) in 
immunocompromised participants is allowed. Daptomycin is not indicated for the 
treatment of HABP/VABP.
3.Planned receipt of suppressive/prophylactic antibiotics with gram -negative activity after 
completion of study interve ntion.
NOTE: Based on site -level standard of care, participants at increased risk of recurrent 
pyelonephritis or cUTI (eg, vesico -ureteral reflux Grade 3 through 5) where there is a 
clear benefit to low -dose antibiotic prophylaxis may be enrolled.
NOTE: Any licensed C OVID -19 vaccine (including for emergency use) in a particular 
country is allowed in the study ifit is an mRNA vaccine , replication -incompetent 
adenoviral vaccine, or inactivated vaccine. T hese vaccines will be treated just as any 
other concomitant therapy .

Investigational vaccines (ie, those not licensed or approved for emergency use) are not 
allowed.
6.5.1 Rescue Medications and Supportive Care
No rescue or supportive medications are specified to be used in this study.
6.6 Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)
The goal of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK profile of 
IMI/REL for each pediatric age cohort at doses that achieve an acceptable safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy profile and similar exposure as that seen in clinical studies in adults and 
pediatric participants. Based on available data from PN020, dose modification for Cohorts 1, 
2, and 3 from those specified in Table 3 is not anticipated in this study.
As noted in Table 3 , the initial doses of IMI/REL and infusion duration for participants in 
Age Cohorts 4 and 5 were selected based on results from PN020 and confirmed based on 
review of safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 in this 
study (PN021). Initial doses for Age Cohorts 4 and 5 are in Section 6.1 .1.
If unexpected PK results r equire dose modification for any age cohort(s) during the study, a 
protocol amendment will be developed.
6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study
There is no study -specified intervention following the end of the study.
6.8 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
This study is open label; therefore, the participant, the study site personnel, the Sponsor, 
and/or designee are not blinded. Study intervention (name, strength, or potency) is included 
in the label text.

7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study.
As certain data on clinical events beyond study interve ntion discontinuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow -
up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all participants 
who discontinue study intervention befo re completion of the protocol -specified treatment 
period will still continue to be monitored in the study and participate in the study visits and 
procedures as specified in Section 1.3 and Section 8.10.3unless the participant has 
withdrawn from the study (Section 7.2).
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason or be discontinued 
from the study intervention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect 
occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or 
for administrative and/or other safety reasons.
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention, but continue to be monitored in 
the study for any of the following reasons:
•The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
study intervention.
•The participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance, which, in the opinion
of the investigator and/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from 
continued administration of study intervention.
•The participant has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test.
•The participant has HABP/VABP and the infection -site specimen Gram stain shows the 
presence of gram -positive cocci only.
•The participant has cUTI, but does not have a positive urine culture result that meets the 
cUTI Microbiological criteria in Appendix 8 -Section 10. 8.3.
•The participant has estimated CrCl (based on the Cockcroft -Gault equation) or eGFR 
(based on the modified Schwartz equation) below the normal level specified for the 
appropriate age range in Table 16; or requires peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or 
hemofiltration.
For participants who are discontinued from study intervention, but continue to be monitored 
in the study, all visits and procedures, as outlined in the SoA, should be completed.
Discontinuation from study intervention is permanent. Once a participant is discontinued, the 
participant shall not be allowed to restart study intervention.

7.2 Participant Withdrawal From the Study
A participant must be withdrawn from the study if the participant or participant’s legally 
acceptable representative withdraws consent from the study.
If a participant withdraws from the study, they will no longer receive study intervention or be 
followed at scheduled protoc ol visits.
Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at the time of withdrawal from the 
study, are outlined in Section 8.1.9. The procedures to be performed should a participant 
repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits and/or if the study site is unable to contact the 
participant are outlined in Section 7.3.
7.3 Lost to Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are t o be performed:
•The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol -specified visit schedule.
•The investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant 
at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last 
known mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.
•Note: A participant is not considered lost to follow -up until the last scheduled visit for the 
individual participant. The missing data for the participant will be managed via the 
prespecified statistical data handling and analysis guidelines.

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
•The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by 
appropriately qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff. Delegation of 
study- site personnel responsibilities will be documented in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent).
•All study- related medical decisions must be made by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The invest igator will maintain a prescreening log 
to record details of all participants prescreened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable .
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be used for screening or baseline purposes 
provided the procedure s meet the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within 
the time frame defined in the SoA.
•Additional evaluations/ testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require t hat additional informed consent/assent be obtained from the participant. In 
these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those 
regulations.
It is recognized that pediatric centers reduce required blood volumes for standard cli nical 
testing based on the size of the child, with many centers suggesting a 0.5 mL blood draw for 
most standard clinical tests in neonates (eg, blood culture, hematology with differential, and 
clinical chemistry panels). With this in mind, expected blood volumes for the youngest 
participants (neonates) are calculated in Table 4 .

majority requirements), the investigator or medically qualified designee must ensure the 
appropriate documented informed consent/assent is in place .
8.1.1.1 General Informed Consent/Assent
Informed consent/assent given by the participant or their legally acceptable representative 
must be documented on a consent/assent form. The form must include the study protocol 
number, study protocol title, dated signatur e, and agreement of the participant (or his/her 
legally acceptable representative) and of the person conducting the consent/assent discussion.
A copy of the signed and dated informed consent/assent form should be given to the 
participant (or their legally acceptable representative) before participation in the study.
The initial informed consent/assent form , any subsequent revised ICF, and any written 
information provided to the participant must receive the IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable 
opinion in advance of use. The participant or his/her legally acceptable representative should 
be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to 
the participant’s willingness to continue participation in the study. The commun ication of 
this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent /assent form or 
addendum to the original consent /assent form that captures the participant’s or the 
participant’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.
Specific s about the study and the study population are to be included in the study informed 
consent/assent form.
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations, 
and Sponsor requirements. The assent, as applicable, will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, 
applicable laws and regulations, and Sponsor requirements .
8.1.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator, who is a qualified 
physician, to ensure that the participant qualifies for the study.
8.1.3 Participant Identification Card
All participants will be given a participant identification card identifying them as participants 
in a research study. The card will contain study -site contact information (including dire ct 
telephone numbers) to be used in the event of an emergency. The investigator or qualified 
designee will provide the participant with a participant identification card immediately after 
the participant provides documented informed consent/assent . At the time of intervention
allocation/ randomization, site personnel will add the treatment/randomization number to the 
participant identification card.
The participant ID card also contains contact information for the emergency unblinding call 
center so that a h ealth care provider can obtain information about study intervention in 
emergency situations where the investigator is not available.

8.1.4 Medical History
A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee. In addition to 
the evaluation of a participant’s medical history in terms of study eligibility, all medical 
conditions present during the 12 months prior to study entry will be documented at the 
screening visit on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).
Any history of prio r HABP or VABP, cIAI, or cUTI episodes or conditions that may 
predispose a participant to the development of a pulmonary, abdominal, or urinary tract 
infection, respectively, will also be documented on the appropriate eCRF, even if the prior 
episode or pre disposing condition was diagnosed more than 12 months prior to study entry.
The details of any primary (HABP/VABP, cIAI, cUTI) or secondary bacterial infection- site 
diagnoses will be documented separately on the appropriate eCRF(s). Details should include 
the diagnosis and any additional diagnostic details associated with the infection site (eg, 
characterization of the complicated nature of the cIAI and/or cUTI).
For participants less than 3 months of age (Cohort 5), details specific to neonates and young 
infants, including details of the meningitis evaluation and assessment of absence of 
meningitis, will also be documented on the appropriate eCRF.
8.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Review
8.1.5.1 Prior Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will review p rior medication use, including any 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the participant 
within 14 days and any antimicrobial medication taken within 30 days prior to the first dose 
of IV study intervention. For breas tfed participants, medications taken by the mother during 
the same timeframe will also be recorded. See Section 5.2 on prior antibacterial therapy.
8.1.5.2 Concomitant Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participant 
during the study. For breastfed participants, medications taken by the mother during the 
study will also be recorded.
See Section 5.2 for excluded medications and Section 6.5 on concomitant therapy during 
study intervention (IV or oral).
8.1.6 Assignment of Screening Number
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify the participant for all procedures that occur before randomization . Each participant 
will be assigned only 1 screening number. S creening numbers must not be reused f or 
different participants.

PRODUCT: MK-7655A 83
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
Any individual who is screened multiple times will retain the original screening number 
assigned at the initial screening visit. Specific details on the screening/rescreening visit 
requirement s are provided in Section 8.10.1. Pre trial screening logs may be collected for 
review by the Sponsor. If applicable, any information that would make the participant 
identifiable will be removed.
8.1.7 Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Number
All eligible par ticipants will be randomly allocated and will receive a randomization number. 
The randomization number identifies the participant for all procedures occurring after 
randomization. Once a randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be 
reassigned to another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 randomization number.
8.1.8 Study Intervention Administration
Study intervention(s) will be administered by the investigator and/or appropriately qualified 
designee according to the specifications within the pharmacy manual andwill be recorded in 
the appropriate eCRF.
Study intervention should begin on the day of randomization or as close as possible to the 
date on which the participant is assigned.
8.1.8.1 Timing of Dose Administration
8.1.8.1.1 IV Study Intervention
The frequency of IMI/REL (Intervention Group 1) IV administration will be q6h or q8h as 
shown in Table 3 . Each infusion should be administered within 60 minutes of the scheduled 
dose. IMI/REL should be administered over the duration appropriate for the age cohort as 
shown in Table 3 .
The frequency and duration of Active Control (Intervention Group 2) IV administration will 
be per the authorized PI, SPC, or international treatment guidelines.
The study intervention must NOT be administered simultaneously through the same infusion 
line/lum en with any other drugs (including other IV study or IV nonstudy interventions). If 
another IV drug is required either prior to or after study intervention and only 1 line/lumen is 
available, an appropriate volume of saline flush must be used between IV infusions. In 
instances when IMI/REL or Active Control require administration at the same hour of the 
day as any other drugs (including other IV study or IV nonstudy interventions), the 2 
infusions should be administered either 1) sequentially with the IMI/R EL infusion first 
followed by an appropriate volume of saline flush prior to administration of the other IV 
drug; OR 2) via a separate infusion line at the same time as the other IV drug.
Additional details for preparation and administration of study inter vention are provided in the 
pharmacy manual. For participants randomized to receive IMI/REL, sites will contact the

IRT to request additional doses beyond the initial supply provided for the minimum 
treatment duration, as needed during the study IV intervention period, as indicated in the 
SoA.
8.1.8.1.2 Optional Oral Switch (cIAI, cUTI)
For participants with cIAI or cUTI, the investigator may decide to switch the participant to 
oral antibacterial therapy, to facilitate step -down in anticipation of discharge, based on the 
participant’s clinical condition and local standard of care. The list of acceptable oral switch 
options is provided in Table 1and Appendix 9 . IV study interventi on is intended to be 
administered to participants with cIAI or cUTI for a minimum of 3 full days as in Table 1, 
after which participants with cIAI or cUTI in either intervention arm (IMI/REL or Active 
Control) who have demonstrated adequate response to IV study intervention may be switched 
to oral antibacterial therapy. The frequency of oral administration will be per the authorized 
PI, SPC, or international treatment guidelines ( Table 1). Some participants with cIAI or cUTI 
may have limited reliable oral options for treatment of their infections and may still require 
IV study inter vention to complete the entire duration of antibacterial treatment.
The decision to switch to oral therapy must be based on investigator assessment of the 
participant’s clinical signs and symptoms related to local and systemic improvement, as 
follows:
1.The participant has received at least 3 full days of IV study inter
vention, as in Table 1;
2.The participant has been afebrile for at least 24 hours, defined as having a maximal daily 
body temperature <38.0°C (100.4°F) and without the influence of aspirin, acetaminophen 
(paracetamol ), or nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs; if the participant is taking 
analgesic medication with antipyretic activity, temperature readings (to determine clinical 
response) should be determined at the end of the analgesic dosing interval.
3.Nausea or vomit ing, if present prestudy, has resolved, and improvement is noted in the 
following (if present prestudy) without evidence of worsening:
a.Flank pain/CVA tenderness, as assessed by severity scoring (none, mild, moderate, or 
severe); AND
b.Leukocytosis
In determi ning the switch to oral antibacterial therapy, the additional clinical signs and 
symptoms of cIAI or cUTI listed in Table 5may also be considered.
4.For participants wi th cUTI, at least 1 follow -up urine culture has shown eradication of the 
uropathogen ( Table 8and Table 9 ). All participants with cUTI must have a repeat urine 
culture obtained after completion of at least 3 days of IV study intervention (ie, prior to 
the oral switch) to assess whether suppression/eradication of admission uropathog ens has 
occurred (repeat catheterization not required) .
These findings will be documented on the appropriate eCRFs for each of these participants.

Participants who discontinue study intervention before completion of the treatment period 
should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining study visits as outlined in 
the SoA and Section 8.10.3.
Participants who withdraw from the study should be encouraged to complete all applicable 
activities scheduled for the final study visit at the time of withdrawal. Any AEs that are 
present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 8.4.
8.1.10 Participant Blinding/Unblinding
This is an open -label study; there is no blinding for this study.
8.1.11 Calibration of Equipment
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinical study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the 
study site.
8.2 Efficacy Assessments
Definition of the efficacy endpoints and a summary of favorable response by efficacy 
endpoint and analysis population are provided in Table 11.
8.2.1 All-cause Mortality (28- day Survival Assessment)
For each participant, 28- day survival status (ie, whether the participant is alive or dead at 
Day 28 post -randomization) will be collected. Results of the assessment, including date and 
cause of death if relevant, will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF at the EFU or LFU visit 
or telephone call, as specified in the SoA. In addition to the Day 28 post -randomization 
survival assessment, all deaths that occur during the study period will be reported as part of 
routine safety assessment.

8.2.3 Microbiological Response
As described in Section 4.2.2.1.3, microbiological response will be evaluated separately for 
each baseline pathogen meeting the culture criteria in Section 8.2.3.1 (ie, by -pathogen).
The investigator will determine the by -pathogen microbiological response rat ing at the visits 
specified in the SoA based on local laboratory results of available infection -site and blood 
cultures collected relative to the pathogen(s) isolated at baseline, as detailed in Section 
8.2.3.2.
8.2.3.1 Infection Site and Blood Specimens for Gram Stain, Culture, and 
Susceptibility Testing
The requirements for collection of infection- site specimens for culture and susceptibility 
testing for participants with HABP/VABP, cIAI, and cUTI are outlined in Section 8.2.3.1.1, 
Section 8.2.3.1.2, and Section 8.2.3.1.3, respectively. Gram stain is only required for 
participants with HABP/VABP (see Section 8.2.3.1.1). The requirements for collection of 
blood samples for culture and susceptibility testing are outlined in Section 8.2.3.1.4.
Infection site and blood specimens should be processed by the local laboratory for Gram 
stain (HABP/VABP only), culture, and susceptibility testing according to recognized 
methods for each specimen/infection type. All organisms isolated from culture that are 
considered to be eti ologic pathogens by the investigator will be retained by the local clinical 
microbiology laboratory and sent to the central microbiology laboratory as instructed in the 
microbiology laboratory manual. Suspected causative bacterial pathogens should also be 
stored at the local laboratory for possible future testing, if needed. 
In addition to testing by the central microbiology laboratory, culture (aerobic and anaerobic) 
and in vitro susceptibility testing may be performed for medical management by the site ’s
local laboratory per each laboratory ’s standard procedures. Relevant culture data, including

date of collection, specimen type (including method of collection), and pathogen 
identification (to the species level, if identified) must be collected on the app ropriate eCRFs.
8.2.3.1.1 HABP/VABP: Lower Respiratory Tract Specimen(s) for Gram Stain, 
Culture, and Susceptibility Testing
Baseline Lower Respiratory Tract Specimen
Participants with HABP/VABP will have a baseline ( at or within 48 hours of the screening 
visit) LRT sample obtained, as medically acceptable, from the infection site for Gram stain, 
culture, and susceptibility testing prior to initiation of IV study intervention as specified in 
the SoA and Appendix 8 –Section 10. 8.1.
Microscopic examination of Gram -stained smears must be performed for LRT specimens 
collected prior to randomization to ensure the adequacy/quality of the specimen and to 
discontinue participants with only gram -positive cocci detected (Section 7.1). For specimens 
obtained by direct sampling of the LRT (ie, via BAL, mini -BAL, or protected brush 
specimen [PBS]), no predefined requirements are required to ascertain the quality of the 
respiratory specimen. However, for baseline specimens not obtained by direct sampling of 
the LRT, such as those o btained by expectorated sputum, the low -power microscopic view of 
the Gram stain can be used to ascertain the quality of the respiratory specimen. This helps to 
ensure that the respiratory specimen sent for culture does not represent oropharyngeal 
contamination (eg, fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells and greater than 25 neutrophils is 
an example of an adequate expectorated/suctioned sputum specimen). In addition, a high -
power microscopic view of the Gram stain can be used to characterize the general ty pe of 
bacteria causing the pneumonia. Specimens should be processed for culture according to 
recognized methods.
Post-baseline Lower Respiratory Tract Specimen (If Clinically Indicated)
Participants with HABP/VABP who have an LRT sample collected from the infection site 
post-baseline (post -randomization), if clinically indicated, will also have culture and 
susceptibility testing of any identified pathogens.
Post-baseline LRT cultures would preferentially include samples collected from a 
tracheostomy or endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoscopy specimens. Expectorated or induced 
sputum samples are also accepted provided the sample does not represent oropharyngeal 
contamination (ie, sample contains fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells on low -power 
microscopy review of the Gram stain).
LRT samples may also be collected if there is clinical or laboratory evidence of persistence 
or progression of the infectious process (including persistent fever, elevated WBC count, or 
significant changes in the participant’s clinical condition). Of note, specimens should also be 
collected at any time of surgical or drainage procedure (if required).

8.2.3.1.2 cIAI: Intra -abdominal Specimen(s) for Culture and Susceptibility Testing
Baseline Intra -abdominal Specimen
Participants with cIAI will have a baseline intra -abdominal specimen collected at or within 
48 hours of the screening visit (intra -or post -operatively) or within 24 hours of 
randomization (preoperative), as medically acceptable, from purulent material from an intra -
abdominal surg ical procedure or percutaneous drainage from the infection site for culture (of 
aerobic and anaerobic organisms) and susceptibility testing prior to initiation of IV study 
intervention as specified in the SoA and Appendix 8 - Section 10.8.2.
Specimens should be collected at the beginning of the surgical procedure prior to 
debridement, removal, or disinfection of the primary site of infection. Aspirates (collected 
with a needle or syringe) or needle biopsy samples are recommended, and s wabs of purulent 
material are discouraged. Specimens should not be obtained from in situ abdominal drains. 
Specimens should not be taken from the gallbladder bile, gallbladder wall, or from bile in the 
common bile duct.
Post-baseline Intra- abdominal Specim en(s) (If Clinically Indicated)
Post-baseline (post -randomization) intra -abdominal specimens for culture and susceptibility 
testing are to be obtained from the site of infection if clinically indicated (eg, if reintervention 
is required, collection during the additional surg ical procedure in participants with cIAI who 
have clinical failure) to evaluate the microbiological assessment. Specimens should not be 
obtained from in situ abdominal drains. All culture and susceptibility testing of any post -
baseline s pecimens should be performed as for the baseline sample. 
8.2.3.1.3 cUTI: Urine Specimens for Culture and Susceptibility Testing
Baseline Urine Specimen
Participants with cUTI will have a baseline ( at or within 48 hours of screening ) urine 
specimen collected prior t o the start of IV study intervention, preferably obtained prior to 
administration of any potentially therapeutic antibacterials. Testing will be performed on all 
organisms considered to be pathogens (quantification of uropathogens is required) in urine 
specimens obtained by MSCC, straight catheter, indwelling urethral catheter, or SPA (urine 
samples obtained from collection bags are not allowed for the study -qualifying baseline urine 
culture specimen), as specified in the SoA and Appendix 8 - Section 10. 8.3.
Post-baseline Urine Specimens
Post-baseline (post -randomization) urine specimens will be collected for culture and 
susceptibility testing at the time points indicated in the SoA from participants able to provide 
a clean urine specimen as for the baseline urine specimen.

Appendix 8 -Section 10. 8.3), then bacterial growth other than the uropathogen at study entry 
may be considered a contaminant rather than a true superinfection or new infection.
8.2.3.1.4 Blood Specimen(s) for Culture and Susceptibility Testing
Baseline Blood Sa mple
As clinically indicated, participants will have a blood sample collected at baseline 
(screening) for blood culture and susceptibility testing.
Postbaseline Blood Sample(s) (If Positive Baseline Culture And As Clinically Indicated)
Participants with positive baseline blood cultures should have follow- up blood cultures 
collected until a subsequent follow -up culture demonstrates no growth. Follow -up blood 
cultures in participants with no evidence of bacteremia (ie, positive blood cultures) at study 
entry should also be performed as clinically indicated, at the investigator’s discretion.
8.2.3.2 Investigator Rating and Sponsor Categorization of Microbiological Response
Microbiological response will be determined for each pathogen for participants with 
infection- site cultures available (see Section 8.2.3.1). For a bacterial organism to be 
considered a pathogen at admission, it must be a typical lung, abdominal, or urinary pathogen 
(ie, not a normal colonizer or contaminant).
The investigator will determine a by- patho gen microbiological response rating for the 
respective infection type at the EOIV (for participants with cIAI or cUTI who switch to oral 
therapy) and EOT visits ( Table 8 ) and at the EFU and LFU visits ( Table 9 ). This rating will 
be based on the local laboratory results of infection -site cultures (Section 8.2.3.1) collected 
for participants at each of these visits (when available) relative to the pa thogen(s) isolated at 
baseline.
The Sponsor will use the by -pathogen microbiological response rating determined by the 
investigator at each of the EOIV (for participants with cIAI or cUTI who switch to oral 
therapy), EOT, EFU, and LFU visits to categorize the overall microbiological response (ie, 
overall microbiological response for the participant based on the response of all pathogens 
present in the baseline culture) as “favorable” or “unfavorable”.
For participants from whom only 1 pathogen is isolated i n the baseline infection- site culture, 
the microbiological response assessment will be based on the microbiological response rating 
for that pathogen. For participants from whom more than 1 baseline pathogen is isolated in 
the baseline infection -site culture, the microbiological response outcome will be based on 
microbiological culture results for all pathogens (ie, a “favorable” overall microbiological 
response requires eradication or presumed eradication of all baseline pathogens).

8.3 Safety Assessments
Details regarding specific safety procedures/assessments to be performed in this study are 
provided. The total amount of blood to be drawn/collected over the course of the study (from 
prestudy to poststudy visits), including approximate blood volumes drawn by visit and by 
sample type per participant, can be found in Section 8.
Planned time points for all safe ty assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.3.1 Full and Directed Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) as per institutional standard.
A complete physical examination, performed at randomization includes the following 
assessments: general appearance, head, eyes, ears/nose/ throat, neck, lymph nodes, skin, 
lungs, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and neurologic evaluations. Breast, rectal, an d 
genitourinary/pelvic exams should be performed when clinically indicated. After the initial 
full physical examination, brief directed physical examinations targeted to the participant’s 
illness, condition, and complaints will be conducted by an investiga tor or medically qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard at the visits indicated 
in the SoA. The directed physical examination should note any changes in the participant’s 
condition (body systems) since the last e xamination and does not preclude examination of 
any of the body systems as clinically indicated.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
Any abnormal or clinically significant findings from the ph ysical examinations must be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF. If observed prior to initiation of IV study therapy, changes 
in physical examination findings (abnormalities) that the investigator considers clinically 
significant will be recorded on the medic al history eCRF. If observed after initiation of IV 
study intervention (including during oral therapy), changes in physical examination findings 
(abnormalities) that the investigator considers clinically significant must be recorded as AEs 
(see Section 8.4 .1).
8.3.2 Height and Weight
An investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) as per 
institutional standard will measure and record the participant’s height (cm) and weight (kg) at 
the visits indicated in the SoA. Weight will be measured without shoes, jacket, or diaper (for 
participants using diapers). A bed scale may be used if needed for participants who cannot sit 
up for any reason (eg, infants, intubated participants).
If applicable, any weight change that occurs during IV study intervention that may result in 
discontinuation (based on the estimated CrCl or eGFR value per Section 7.1 and Table 16) 
must be reported to the IRT as indicat ed in the SoA (IRT Contact) as well as recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.
8.3.3 Vital Signs
•The following will be assessed by an investigator or medically qualified designee 
(consistent with local requirements) as per institutional standard as indicated in the So A:
-Temperature: Oral or rectal temperatures should be taken as appropriate for the 
participant’s clinical condition and age; if not possible, then tympanic or axillary 
methods are acceptable. Temperature readings should be taken at approximately the 
same t ime each day.
-Systolic and diastolic blood pressure
-Heart rate
- Respiratory rate
•Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be assessed with a completely 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available.
•Vital signs will be measured before blood collection for laboratory tests with the 
participants in a seated or semisupine position or, for participants who cannot sit up for 
any reason (eg, infants, intubated participants), in a supine or semisupine position, after 
10 minutes rest.
Any abnormal or clinically significant findings from the vital sign measurements must be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

8.3.4 Meningitis Evaluation
As required in Section 5.2 exclusion criterion #2 for participants <3 months of age, the 
investigator must rule out meningitis and document its absence prior to initiation of IV study 
intervention. The investigator may rule out meningitis by perform ingan LP with CSF culture
(if clinically indicated pe r local standard -of-care)or by other standard -of-care procedures or 
clinical assessment s. Negative results from a previous procedure or assessment may be used 
to document that meningitis has been ruled out for such participants provided these results 
are available at the time of screening. Investigator assessment of the absence of meningitis 
must be recorded on the appropriate source documents.
8.3.5 Adverse Event Monitoring
8.3.5.1 Clinical Adverse Events
Clinical AEs will be collected from the time of initiation of the first dose of IV study therapy 
through 14 days following completion of all study therapy. All AEs should be documented 
on the appropriate eCRF.
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity f rom expected levels are not to be considered AEs. Examples of this 
may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children, and onset 
of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.
See Section 8.4 for details regarding assessment and documentation of AEs.
8.3.5.2 Local Infusion Site Tolerability
Local infusion site tolerability will be evaluated daily during IV study therapy. The 
tolerability of all study therapy at the local IV infusion site will be based on i nvestigator 
inspection and participant comments regarding signs and symptoms of intolerance. The IV 
infusion site should be observed daily during IV therapy to determine the presence/absence 
of erythema, induration, pain, tenderness, warmth, swelling, ulce ration, local phlebitis, rash, 
or other reactions.
8.3.5.3 Laboratory Adverse Experiences
Laboratory adverse experiences will be based on safety laboratory tests (both central and 
local results), including hematology and chemistry tests from blood and urinalysis from 
urine. See the SoA on the timing of sample collection and Section 8.3.7 and Appendix 2 for 
the types of laboratory tests to be performed.
8.3.5.4 Adverse Events Leading to Death
All deaths that occur during the study period will be reported as part of routine safety 
assessment, as described.

A detailed diagnosis and relevant clinical information associated with diagnosis including 
clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics (see Appendix 2) 
related to the primary (HABP/VABP, cIAI, cUTI) and any secondary bacterial infections 
sites will be reviewed by the investigator and documented on the appropriate eCRFs at the 
time points specified in the SoA.
Presence or absence of specific cl inical signs and symptoms relevant for the infection site of 
interest will be reviewed by the investigator and recorded daily during IV study intervention
and at the visits specified in the SoA. Intensity of signs and symptoms will also be graded by 
the investigator as mild, moderate, or severe as described in Appendix 3.
8.3.6.1 Infection Source Control Review
Information related to infection source control must be collected for all participants at the 
visits specified in the SoA. The following information specifi c to the site(s) of bacterial 
infection must be collected for participants with:
•HABP/VABP: (a) details regarding intubation, extubation, reintubation, or replacement 
of the endotracheal tube, (b) details regarding lung procedures/surgeries performed to 
drain/remove a loculated pulmonary infection; and (c) details regarding a thoracentesis 
procedure to drain any accompanying pleural fluid;
•cIAI: details associated with the qualifying abdominal surgical intervention or any 
subsequent interventions, including an anonymized narrative of the operative note and/or 
interventional radiology report; or
•cUTI: baseline information associated with catheterization (eg, recent surg ical procedure
or instrumentation, presence of catheter/stent) as well as any details relat ed to removal 
and/or replacement of urinary catheters at any time during the study.
Relevant information regarding infection source control should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.
8.3.6.2 O2 Saturation (HABP/VABP Only)
In participants with HABP/VABP, oxygen (O2) saturation via pulse oximetry will be 
collected on Day 1 prior to the initiation of IV study intervention, then daily until completion 
of IV study intervention, as well as at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits. All measured values 
should be documented on the appropriate eCRF.
If available, as clinically indicated, in ventilated participants with HABP/VABP who have an 
existing arterial line, PaO2 and FiO2 measured via ABG should also be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.

8.3.6.3 Chest X- ray
In partic ipants with HABP/VABP, a baseline chest x -ray must be performed as required in 
Appendix 8 -Section 10. 8.1 and indicated in the SoA. For randomization, a chest x -ray is not 
required if a prior chest x -ray or chest CT has been performed in association with the current 
infection within 48 hours of randomization.
Post-baseline (including at EOT and, if applicable, at the discontinuation visit), chest x -ray is 
only to be performed if clinically indicated.
Chest x- ray results (or prior chest CT results, if relevant) including a description, location, 
and extent of infiltrates or consolidation must be documented on the appropriate eCRF. The 
presence of a pleural effusion and other abnormalities should also be noted.
8.3.7 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
•All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual a nd the SoA .
•If laboratory values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
•For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 14days after the last dose of study intervention, every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .
8.4 Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Reportabl e Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant ’s legally authorized 
representative).

The investigator and any designees are responsi ble for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators need to document if an SAE was associated with a medication error, misuse, or 
abuse.
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3. The investigator, who is a qualified physician, 
will assess events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safe ty 
events with respect to seriousness, intensity/toxicity ,and causality.
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE, and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant pro vides 
documented informed consent /assent , but before intervention allocation/randomization, must 
be reported by the investigator if the participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in 
treatment; if the event causes the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of 
a protocol -specified intervention, including, but not limited to washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, or a procedure.
From the time of intervention allocation/randomization through 14 days after ce ssation of 
treatment, all AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events must be reported by the 
investigator.
Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside the 
period specified in the previous paragraph must be repor ted immediately to the Sponsor if the 
event is considered related to study intervention.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the investigator 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Spons or.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Spons or or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 10.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events. Open- ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred m ethod to inquire about AE occurrence.
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events, 
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECIs, cancer, and overdose will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). In addition, the investigator will 
make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for 
outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements fo r SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requ irements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.

specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding (spontaneously reported t o the 
investigator or their designee) that occurs in a participant during the study is reportable to the 
Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of 
a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing that the fetus will be 
born with severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that lead s to an elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an SAE for the fetus. Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic 
pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted 
ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as serious 
events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health 
of infant) must also be reported.
8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs
Not applicable.
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest
Selected serious and nonserious AEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the 
Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this study include:
1.Potential DILI events defined as an elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 3 ×the ULN and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 2 ×the ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase laboratory 
value that is less than 2× the ULN, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose 
of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepati c tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study -site guidance for assessment 
and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).

2.A confirmed (ie, verified by repeat tes ting) elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is 
greater than or equal to 5 ×ULN as a result of within -protocol -specific testing or 
unscheduled testing.
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
In this study, an overdose is any dose higher than 10% of the calculated age -appropriate dose 
specified in Section 6.1.1 –Dose by Age Cohort ( Table 3 ) or in subsequent protocol 
clarification letters.
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor Clinical Director based on the clinical evaluation of the 
participant.
8.6 Pharmacokinetics
The de cision as to which plasma samples collected will be assayed for evaluation of 
PK/pharmacodynamics will be collaboratively determined by the Sponsor. If indicated, these 
samples may also be assayed and/or pooled for assay in an exploratory manner for additi onal 
pharmacodynamic markers.
8.6.1 Blood Collection for Plasma Relebactam, Imipenem, and Cilastatin
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for plasma samples will be provided in 
the operations/laboratory manual. All PK samples must be drawn withi n the specified time 
windows, and the actual sampling times must be documented.
The method of collection for PK samples is at the discretion of the investigator (eg, 
peripherally inserted central catheter line, indwelling catheter access, individual periph eral 
phlebotomies, peri -operatively placed arterial line). A separate IV line for PK sample 
collection is highly recommended; if a separate IV line is not clinically feasible, refer to the 
operations/laboratory manual for further details of allowable alter native collection methods.
8.7 Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamic parameters will not be evaluated in this study.
8.8 Future Biomedical Research Sample Collection
Future biomedical research samples will not be collected in this study.
8.9 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection
Planned genetic analysis samples will not be evaluated in this study.

8.10 Visit Requirements
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 1.3.Specific procedure -related details are provided 
inSection 8.
8.10.1 Screening
Approximately 2 days prior to intervention randomization, potential participants will be 
evaluated to determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5. 
Screening procedures may be repeated after consultation with the Sponsor. If the participant 
is rescreened, screening procedures should be repeated, unless they fall within the window 
specified.
8.10.2 Intervention Period
Details regarding procedures, assessments, a nd scheduling windows for the Day 1 
(Randomization), OTX, EOIV (only for participants who switch to oral therapy), and EOT 
visits (ie, Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5) are presented in the SoA; notably, for participants who receive 
IMI/REL, blood samples for plasma PK assessments and vital sign measurements will be 
collected several times at Visit 2 and, for participants who switch to oral therapy, the OTX 
and EOIV visits (Visits 2 and 3) may be combined if both occur on Day 3.
8.10.3 Participants Discontinued From Study In tervention but Continuing to be 
Monitored in the Study
Participants who discontinue treatment (eg, participants who discontinue from IV study 
intervention partway through the infusion or who discontinue from oral study intervention) or 
who withdraw from th e study at any point after the initiation of IV study intervention will 
continue to be monitored in the study. These participants should have all safety assessments, 
including clinical safety laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, directed physic al 
examination, collection of AEs and concomitant medications, and local tolerability 
monitoring (for participants who discontinue from IV study intervention or withdraw from 
the study between the initiation of IV study intervention and the EOT visit) completed as per 
the SoA, but do not need to have PK sampling performed.
Participants who withdraw from the study prior to initiation of the first dose of study 
intervention (eg, due to removal of consent by the legally acceptable representative or due to 
an emergent condition or circumstance, which, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, 
places the participant at unnecessary risk through continued participation, or does not allow 
adherence to the protocol) do not need to have further visits or assessme nts.

8.10.4 Poststudy
Participants will be required to return to the clinic 7 to 14 days (depending on the duration of 
study treatment) after completion of the last dose of all study intervention (IV or oral) for the 
EFU visit and again 7 to 14 days after the EFU visit for the LFU visit (ie, Visits 6 and 7). If 
both poststudy (EFU and LFU) visits occur prior to Day 28 post -randomization, a subsequent 
survival assessment telephone call should be made on Day 28 (+3 days [ie, 28 to 31 days]) 
post-randomization to a ssess the participant’s 28 -day survival. See the SoA for further

Statistical 
Methods for Key 
Efficacy/ 
Pharmacokinetic 
AnalysesEfficacy analysis:
Within -group 95% confidence intervals for the efficacy endpoints will be calculated 
using the Agresti & Coull method. Point estimates and between -group 95% confidence 
intervals for efficacy endpoints will be calculated using unstratified Miettinen and 
Nurminen method.
There will be no efficacy hypothesis testing conducted in this estimation study. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis: 
The pediatric population PK model developed using adult and PN020 pediatric PK 
data will be updated with PN021 PK data and used to calculate the PK endpoints. 
Statistical 
Methods for Key 
Safety AnalysesThe tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. There are no Tier 1 
events. For Tier 2 events, point estimates and 95% CIs will be provided for between -
treatment differences in the percentage of participants with events and these analyses 
will be performed using the Miettinen and Nurm inen method. For Tier 3 safety 
parameters, only point estimates by intervention group will be provided. 
The analysis of safety results will be performed for overall participants. In addition, the 
analysis for some Tier 2 endpoints will be performed for each age cohort and for each 
infection type separately. 
Interim Analyses A review of safety and tolerability data will be conducted by an independent external 
Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) in this study when Age Cohorts 2 and 3 have 
achieved at least 20 participants each with complete data available (all complete data 
available from Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will be reviewed at this time), along with 
periodic reviews as described in the DMC charter.
No formal efficacy analyses will be conducted for eDMC review; however, protocol -
specific summary statistics for PK data and/or key efficacy endpoints can be provided 
to the eDMC on request to support benefit -to-risk evaluation.
An internal interim review of subgroup analyses of safety, tolerability, effi cacy, and 
PK data from each of Age Cohorts 1 through 3 has been performed prior to enrollment 
of Age Cohorts 4 and 5, with the doses communicated via Amendment 03.
Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is planned.
Sample Size and 
Power Approximately 1 40 participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IMI/REL 
or active control to target having 132 participants (approximately 99 in the IMI/REL 
and approximately 33 in the active control group in the safety analysis population). 
In each of the 5 age cohorts, the following number of participants will be randomized:
Age Cohort 1: No more than 12 participants
Age Cohorts 2 and 3: At least 20 participants in each age cohort
Age Cohort s 4and 5 : At least 28participants in each age cohort
By each of the 3 infection types, the following number of participants will be 
randomized:
HABP/VABP and cIAI -At least 28 participants
cIAI: At least 10% of participants with diagnosis other than complicated 
appendicitis
cUTI: No more than 48 participants in Age Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 combined
There are no hypotheses to be evaluated, but Section 9.9 provides information about 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of participants assessed as a 
success under varying assumptions for the number of successes in both treatment 
groups.

9.4.2 Safety Endpoints
A description of safety measures is contained in Sections 8.3 and 8.4. The analysis of safety 
results is described in Section 9.6.2.
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by c linical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs, local tolerability assessments, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements 
and physical examinations.
The safety analysis endpoints are:
•AEs, including:
oAny AE, a drug -related AE, a ser ious AE, an AE which is both drug -related and 
serious, and an AE that resulted in death
oA local infusion site intolerance AE (erythema, induration, pain, tenderness, 
warmth, swelling, ulceration, local phlebitis, rash, etc.) during IV study 
intervention

hematology and chemistry tests from blood and urinalysis from urine)
•IV study intervention discontinuations due to AEs, including:
oDiscontinuation of IV study interventi on due to an AE
oDiscontinuation of IV study intervention due to a drug -related AE
9.4.3 Pharmacokinetics Endpoints
The PK endpoints are: 
•Plasma concentrations of imipenem and REL
•AUC 0-24hrand C eoifor imipenem and REL. AUC 0-24hr for REL will be used to 
calculate f AUC 0-24hr/MIC.
•%T>MIC for imipenem
Plasma concentrations of REL, imipenem, and cilastatin will be measured. Sparse PK 
sampling will be performed during the IV study intervention period on all participants 
enrolled in the study, consisting of 3 samples per participant (30 minutes prior to start of the 
first dose of IV study intervention; within 10 minutes after the end of the first infusion ; and 2 
to 6 hours after the start of the first IV infusion) on Day 1, plus 1 sampl e on 1 additional day 
from Day 2 to 3 at 2 to 6 hours after the start of any infusion that day. Cilastatin PK data will 
be collected and analyzed, but further analyses on cilastatin PK will not be performed unless 
required.
For REL, plasma exposure (AUC 0-24hr), fAUC 0-24hr/MIC and C maxwill be the primary 
endpoints. For imipenem, % fT>MIC, plasma exposure (AUC 0-24hr), and C max will be the 
primary endpoints. Imipenem % f T>MIC represents the percentage of the total dosing 
interval in which the imipenem free (a djusted for protein binding) concentration is higher 
than the MIC. In addition, the following population PK model -based mean PK parameters for 
both REL and imipenem will be determined: clearance (CL) and volume of distribution for 
the central compartment (Vc). All REL and imipenem endpoints and parameters will be 
calculated using a pediatric population PK model. In fAUC 0-24hr/MIC and % f T>MIC, f
means adjusted for REL and imipenem protein binding, respectively. The population PK 
analysis will be summarized in a separate pediatric population PK modeling and simulation 
report.
9.5 Analysis Populations
9.5.1 Efficacy Analysis Populations
The MITT and the mMITT populations will serve as the efficacy analysis populations. 
For analyzing all -cause mortality through Day 28 post -randomization and clinical responses 
in this study, the MITT population will include randomized participants who received at least 
1 dose of IV study intervention.

PRODUCT: MK-7655A 111
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
For analyzing microbiological responses in this study, the mMITT population will include 
randomized participants who meet the following conditions:
•For participants with HABP/VABP and cIAI:
1.The participant received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention; AND
2.The participant’s baseline infec tion-site culture grew at least 1 gram -negative 
pathogenic organism.
•For participants with cUTI:
1.The participant received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention; AND
2.The participant’s baseline urine culture grew at least 1 gram -negative pathogenic 
organism at sufficient quantity (ie, growth at ≥105 CFU/mL of uropathogen) as 
specified in the cUTI Microbiological Criteria in Appendix 8 -Section 10. 8.3.
Participants will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized for the 
analysis of efficacy data using both the MITT and mMITT populations. Details on the 
approach to handling missing data are provided in Section 9.6.2.
9.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations
Safety analyses will be conducted in the APaT population, which consists of all randomized 
participants who received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention. Participants will be 
included in the treatment group corresponding to the study intervention they actually 
received for the analysis of safety data using the APaT populatio n, which will generally be 
the treatment group to which the participants are randomized; however, participants who take 
incorrect study intervention for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment 
group corresponding to the study intervention actually received.
At least 1 laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained after at least one dose of IV study 
intervention is required for inclusion in the analysis of the respective safety parameter.
9.5.3 Pharmacokinetics Populations
The PK population will be used for the PK analysis. This population is the subset of 
participants who comply with dosing and PK sampling sufficiently to ensure that these data 
will be likely to exhibit the anticipated PK endpoints, according to the underlying scientific 
mode l. Compliance covers such considerations as exposure to treatment, availability of 
measurements, and absence of major protocol violations. Participants with major protocol 
violations will be identified to the extent possible by individuals responsible for data 
collection/compliance and its analysis and interpretation. Any participants or data values 
excluded from analysis will be identified, along with their reasons for exclusion, in the 
pediatric population PK modeling and simulation report.
At the end of the study, all participants who are compliant with the study procedure as 
described and have at least 1 postdose PK data point available will be included in the PK 
analysis dataset.

9.6 Statistical Methods
9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
This is an e stimation study; no formal statistical testing will be performed for the efficacy 
endpoints. All of the efficacy endpoints in this study are binary. Within- group 95% 
confidence intervals for these endpoints will be calculated using the Agresti & Coull meth od 
[Agresti, A. and Coull, B. A. 1998] . In addition, 95% confidence intervals for between -
treatment differences in the incidence (or percentage of participants) will be calculated using 
the unstratified Miettine n and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] , an 
unconditional, asymptotic method.
If enrollment in Age Cohorts 4 (3 months to <2 years) and 5 (birth to 3 months) is found to 
considerably delay completion of this study, the primary analysis will be based on Age 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 combined.
Missing values
Any participant missing an evaluation for a specific endpoint (clinical or microbiological) at 
any particular visit will be generally considered as being “indeterminate” for that endpoint in 
the MITT and mMITT populations. The following are exceptions to this rule:
•Participants discontinuing IV or oral study intervention due to lack of efficacy (ie, 
withdrawals with subsequent nonstudy antibacteria l therapy) will be considered as 
“failures” with respect to clinical response at the time of discontinuation and all 
subsequent time points.
•Participants discontinuing IV or oral study intervention due to lack of efficacy will be 
presumed to have “persiste nce” for the microbiological response at the time of 
discontinuation and all subsequent time points.
The efficacy endpoints, analysis population, and statistical methods that will be used for the 
efficacy analyses are presented in Table 12. Since a favorable clinical response at EOIV, 
EOT requires an assessment of “cure” or “improved”, an assessment of “indeterminate” 
would be considered a failure to achieve a favorable clinical response. In addition, since a 
favorable clinical response at EFU and LFU requires an assessment of “cure” or “sustained 
cure,” an assessment of “indeterminate” would be considered a failure to achieve a favorable 
clinical response. Since a fav orable microbiological response at EOIV, EOT, EFU, and LFU 
requires an assessment of “eradication” or “presumed eradication”, an assessment of 
“indeterminate” would be considered a failure to achieve a favorable microbiological 
response.

9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs and laboratory tests. Safety assessment will also include close monitoring for potential 
hepatic toxicity and include protocol -defined ECIs related to elevated transaminase findings.
The following are considered prespecified ECIs:
1.Potential DILI events defined as anelevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 3X ULN and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 2X ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase laboratory value 
that is less than 2X ULN, as a result of within -protocol -specific testing or un scheduled 
testing.
2.A confirmed (ie, verified by repeat testing) elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is 
greater than or equal to 5X ULN as a result of within- protocol -specific testing or 
unscheduled testing.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 13). The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. AEs (specific terms as well as system organ 
class terms), protocol predefined ECIs and events that meet predefined limits of change in 
laboratory are either prespecified as “Tier 1” e ndpoints, or will be classified as belonging to 
“Tier 2 ”or “Tier 3 ”based on the number of events observed.
Tier 1 Events
Safety parameters or AEs of special interest that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” 
safety endpoints that will be subject t o inferential testing for statistical significance. There are 
no Tier 1 events for this protocol as this is an estimation study; no formal statistical testing 
will be performed.
Tier 2 Events
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% confidence intervals 
provided for differences in the proportion of participants with events, also via the unstratified 
M&N method (1985).
Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 12 participants in the experimental intervention 
group (Intervention Group 1 [IG1]: IMI/REL) or 2 participants in the control group 
(Intervention Group 2 [IG2]: Active Control) exhibit the event; all other AEs and predefined 
limits of change will belong to Tier 3. 
The thresholds of events were chosen because the 95% confidence interval for the between -
group difference in percent incidence will always include zero when fewer participants per 
group, respectively, experience events and thus would add little to the interpretation of 
potentially meaningful differences. Because many 9 5% confidence intervals may be provided 
without adjustment for multiplicity, the confidence intervals should be regarded as a helpful 
descriptive measure to be used in review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical 
significance of the between -group differences in adverse events and safety parameters that 
meet predefined limits of change. Only targeted measurements of predefined limits of change 
will be summarized/analyzed as described in the sSAP. 
In addition to individual events that occur in 1 2 or more participants in the experimental 
intervention group and in 2 or more participants in the control group, the broad AE categories 
consisting of the proportion of participants with any AE, a drug -related AE, a serious AE, an 
AE which is both drug -related and serious, discontinuation of IV study intervention due to an 
AE, and discontinuation of IV study intervention due to a drug- related AE will be considered 
Tier 2 endpoints. 
The analysis for some Tier 2 endpoints (any AE, a drug- related AE, a serious AE, a serious 
and drug -related AE, ECIs, discontinuation of IV study intervention due to an AE, and 
discontinuation of IV study intervention due to a drug -related AE) will be provided for each 
age cohort and for each infection type separately.

9.6.3 Statistical Methods for Pharmacokinetics Analysis
The sample at end of infusion will help further characterize C maxand the second sample 
during the elimination phase window will help confirm the AUC and time above MIC 
estimation. Relebactam and imipenem PK data will be added to existing pediatric PK data 
from PN020 to further update the pediatric population PK model. Any missing postdose 
plasma concentrations will be treated as missing. Values below the limit of quantification 
will be assigned a value of zero. A nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach will be used 
for model building.
Adult PK targets for REL and imip enem will be used. The goal of model -based simulations 
will be to confirm that these targets are jointly achieved in a proportion of pediatric 
participants similarly covered in adults (~90% probability of target attainment) for each age 
cohort; hence, achi eving these targets implies similar efficacy as that obtained in adults. An

absolute (mg) or weight -based (mg/kg) dose, whichever is found most suitable for each age 
cohort, will be selected based on the simulation results.
As this is an estimation study; no formal statistical testing will be performed for the PK data. 
In all, the additional REL and imipenem PK data collected in this study will be used to 
update the population PK model and confirm adequacy of selected doses. The population PK 
analysis will be summarized in a pediatric population PK modeling and simulation report.
9.6.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The comparability of the treatment groups for each relevant demographic and baseline 
characteristic will be assessed by the use of summary t ables. No statistical hypothesis tests 
will be performed on these characteristics. The number and percentage of participants 
screened and randomized and the primary reasons for screening failure and discontinuation 
will be displayed. Demographic variables (eg, age, race, and gender), baseline characteristics, 
primary and secondary diagnoses, and prior and concomitant therapies will be summarized 
by treatment either by descriptive statistics or categorical tables.
9.7 Interim Analyses
A review of safety and tole rability data will be conducted by an independent eDMC in this 
study when Age Cohorts 2 and 3 have each achieved at least 20 participants with complete 
data available (all complete data available from Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will be reviewed at 
this time), along with periodic reviews as described in the eDMC charter. A description of 
the structure, function, and guidelines for decision -making by the eDMC, along with the 
timing and content of the safety reviews will be outlined in the eDMC charter. Informati on 
regarding the composition of the eDMC is provided in Appendix 1. 
No formal efficacy analyses will be conducted for eDMC review; however, protocol -specific 
summary statistics for PK data and/or key efficacy endpoints can be provided to the eDMC 
on reque st to support benefit -to-risk evaluation.
Study enrollment is likely to be ongoing at the time of any interim analyses. The results of 
interim analyses will not be shared with the investigators prior to the completion of the study.
The eDMC will serve as t he primary reviewer of the results of the interim analyses of the 
study and will make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or protocol 
modifications (including any potential dose modifications) to an executive committee of the 
Sponsor. Additional details are provided in the eDMC Charter. 
In addition to the eDMC interim review of safety and tolerability data , an internal interim 
review of complete separate and aggregated safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from 
Age Cohorts 1 through 3 wi ll be performed prior to enrollment of Age Cohorts 4 and 5 . This 
internal interim review will be conducted independently from the eDMC interim review, but 
will consider any critical safety findings in the eDMC assessment. Results will be reviewed 
by an int ernal team to assess whether the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK profile is 
acceptable for each age cohort. The findings from the internal interim review were used to 
confirm the proposed doses for Age Cohorts 4 and 5 (Section 6.1.1 ).

An interim ana lysis to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK may be performed when 
final data from Age Cohorts 1 to 3 are available.
9.8 Multiplicity
No multiplicity adjustment is planned.
9.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations
This study will randomize approximately 140 participants in a 3:1 ratio into 2 treatment 
groups (Intervention Group 1 [IG1]: IMI/REL and Intervention Group 2 [IG2]: active 
control), to obtain 132 participants (approximately 99 participants in IG1 and 33 participants 
in IG2) in the safety analysis population. No more than 12 participants will be randomized to 
Age Cohort 1; at least 20 participants will be randomized to each of Age Cohorts 2 and3;
and at least 28 participants will be randomized to each of Age Cohort s 4 and 5. At least 28 
participants with HABP/VABP or cIAI will be enrolled. In addition, no more than 48 
participants with cUTI may be enrolled in Age Cohorts 3, 4 ,and 5 combined, and a target of 
at least 10% of participants with cIAI should have a diagnosis oth er than complicated 
appendicitis. 
As many of the safety endpoints and all of the efficacy endpoints are binary, justification of 
the sample size is based on the precision of these estimates as assessed by the width of the 
95% within- group confidence inter vals ( Table 14 ). Displays of the two- sided 95% 
confidence intervals for the proportion of participants assessed as a success under varying 
assumptions for the number of successes in IG1 (IMI/REL) and IG2 (active control) are 
provided. Estimates are provided for:
•N=3(number of IG2 participants in Age Cohort 1)
•N=9(number of IG1 participants in Age Cohort 1)
•N=5 (number of IG2 participants in each of Age Cohorts 2and 3)
•N=15 (number of IG1 participants in each of Age Cohorts 2 and 3 )
•N=7 (number of IG2 participants in Age Cohort s 4 and 5)
•N=21 (number of IG1 participants in Age Cohort s 4 and 5)
•N=33 (number of IG2 participants combined across age cohorts)
•N=99 (number of IG1 participants combined across age cohorts)

To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the 
incidence of Day 28 all -cause mortality and the proportion of participants with a favorable 
clinical response at EFU within each treatment group (MITT population) will be estimated 
within each category of the following classification variables (assessed prior to or at the point 
of randomization):
•Strati fication variable: Age

9.11 Compliance (Medication Adherence)
This is a study in hospitalized participants in whom study medication is initially administered 
IV and in -hospital and is, therefore, expected to follow the protocol strictly without 
compliance issues. Any medication errors will be monitored and recorded.
In this study, at the discretion of the investigator, parti cipants with cIAI or cUTI may be 
switched to oral antibacterial therapy after at least 3 days of IV study intervention. 
Participants with evidence of concurrent bacteremia or with P. aeruginosa infection should 
receive 14 days of antibacterial treatment.
As part of the routine recording of the amount of antibacterial therapy taken by each 
participant, study staff will record any remaining product (eg, pill count or liquid volume) 
following completion of oral therapy. The number of oral doses dispensed and t aken will be 
counted, reviewed, and recorded at the EOT visit. This information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.
9.12 Extent of Exposure
The extent of exposure to study treatment will be evaluated by summary statistics (ie, N, 
mean, median, standard de viation) and/or frequencies for the “Number of Days on Therapy” 
by treatment group.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I.Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, 
implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the 
highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is 
the overriding con cern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials 
will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations (eg, 
International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH -GCP]) and in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical 
interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) 
employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative 
research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in 
nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -
initiated trials, w hich are not under the full control of MSD .
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -
driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynam ic 
indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct 
outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or 
trials to determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be 
adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Participants must meet 
protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.

PRODUCT: MK-7655A 121
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate 
participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical 
trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are 
evaluated by MSD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the tria l.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol 
and general principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical 
data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source 
documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and 
procedures, if fraud, scientific/research misconduct, or serious GCP -
noncompliance is suspected, the issues are investigated. When n ecessary, the 
clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review 
committees notified .
B.Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish primary and secondary results 
of its registered tria ls of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according 
to the prespecified plans for data analysis. To the extent scientifically appropriate, 
MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to 
patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be 
hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing, in such cases, publication of 
results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses 
complicated by stati stical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, 
authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the 
trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. 
All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD 
funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.
III.Partici pant Protection
A.Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC])
All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated 
at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the pr otocol will be approved by the 
ethics committee prior to implementation, except changes required urgently to protect 
participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. 
For each site, the ethics committee and MSD will approve the participant informed 
consent form.

PRODUCT: MK-7655A 122
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is 
of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and 
benefits of, as well as alternati ves to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs 
will take into account the local standard of care.
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only 
after informed consent is obtained. Participants may withdr aw from an MSD trial at 
any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that 
may otherwise be available to them.
C.Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent 
possibl e. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), 
ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential 
medical records that might identify the participant by name .
D.Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed 
consent authorized by an ethics committee .
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate 
investi gators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed 
in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its 
trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments 
may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate 
referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible 
participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by MSD and that the 
investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing 
the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter t he wording of the 
disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a source 
of funding .
C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of t ravel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, 
investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices .

trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific 
standards .
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor’s responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
financial disclosure information is required. It is the investigator’s/subinvestigator’s 
responsibilit y to comply with any such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submission of compl ete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, frequently known as a financial disclosure form, provided by 
the Sponsor. The invest igator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
10.1.3 Data Protec tion
The Sponsor will conduct this study in compliance with all applicable data protection 
regulations.
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain t he identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local da ta protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant.
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponso r, by 
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.
10.1.3.1 Confidentiality of Data
By signing this protocol, the investigator affirms to the Sponsor that information furnished to 
the investigator by the Sponsor will be maintained in confidence, and such information will 
be divulged to the IRB, IEC, or similar or expert committee ,affiliated institution, and 
employees, only under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such board or 
committee, affiliated institution ,and e mployees. Data generated by this study will be

considered confidential by the investigator, except to the extent that it is included in a 
publication as provided in the Publications section of this protocol.
10.1.3.2 Confidentiality of Participant Records
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees that the Sponsor (or Sponsor representative), 
IRB/IEC, or regulatory authority representatives may consult and/or copy study documents to 
verify worksheet/CRF data. By signing the consent form, the participant agree s to this 
process. If study documents will be photocopied during the process of verifying 
worksheet/CRF information, the participant will be identified by unique code only; full 
names/initials will be masked before transmission to the Sponsor.
By signing t his protocol, the investigator agrees to treat all participant data used and 
disclosed in connection with this study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules, 
and regulations.
10.1.3.3 Confidentiality of IRB/IEC Information
The Sponsor is required to record the name and address of each IRB/IEC that reviews and 
approves this study. The Sponsor is also required to document that each IRB/IEC meets 
regulatory and ICH GCP requirements by requesting and maintaining records of the names 
and qualif ications of the IRB/IEC members and to make these records available for 
regulatory agency review upon request by those agencies.
10.1.4 Committees Structure
10.1.4.1 Executive Oversight Committee
The EOC is comprised of members of Sponsor Senior Management. The EOC will receive 
and decide on any recommendations made by the eDMC regarding the study.
10.1.4.2 External Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC)
To supplement the routine study monitoring outlined in this protocol, an eDMC will 
periodically monitor the interim data from this stud y. The voting members of the committee 
are external to the Sponsor. The members of the eDMC must not be involved with the study 
in any other way (eg, they cannot be study investigators) and must have no competing 
interests that could affect their roles wit h respect to the study.
The eDMC will make recommendations to the EOC regarding steps to ensure both 
participant safety and the continued ethical integrity of the study. Also, the eDMC will 
review interim study results, consider the overall risk and benefi t to study participants 
(Section 9.7 Interim Analyses) and recommend to the EOC whether the study should 
continue in accordance with the protocol.

of eDMC reports, minutes, and recommendations will be described in the eDMC charter that 
is revi ewed and approved by all the eDMC members.
10.1.5 Publication Policy
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. The Sponsor 
will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance with 
standard editor ial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.
If publication activit y is not directed by the Sponsor, the investigator agrees to submit all 
manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor before submission. This allows the Sponsor to protect 
proprietary information and to provide comments.
Authorship will be determined by mutual a greement and in line with ICMJE authorship 
requirements.
10.1.6 Compliance with Study Registration and Results Posting Requirements
Under the terms of the FDAAA of 2007 and the EMA clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC, the 
Sponsor of the study is solely responsibl e for determining whether the study and its results 
are subject to the requirements for submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, 
www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu, or other local registries. MSD, as Sponsor of this study, will 
review this protocol and submit the information necessary to fulfill these requirements. MSD 
entries are not limited to FDAAA or the EMA clinical trials directive mandated trials. 
Information posted will allow participants to identify potentially appropriate studies for their 
disease conditions and pursue participation by calling a central contact number for further 
information on appropriate study locations and study -site contact information.
By signing this protocol, the investigator acknowledges that the statutory obligations under 
FDAAA, the EMA clinical trials directive, or other locally mandated registries are that of the 
Sponsor and agrees not to submit any information about this study or its results to those 
registries.
10.1.7 Compliance with Law, Audit, and Debarment
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to conduct the study in an efficient and 
diligent manner and in conformance with this protocol ,generally accepted standards of GC P 
(eg, ICH GCP: Consolidated Guideline and other generally accepted standards of GCP) ,and 
all applicable federal, state ,and local laws, rules ,and regulations relating to the conduct of 
the clinical study.
The Code of Conduct, a collection of goals and c onsiderations that govern the ethical and 
scientific conduct of clinical investigations sponsored by MSD, is provided in this appendix 
under the Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials.

The investigator agrees not to seek reimbursement from participants, their insurance 
providers, or from government programs for procedures included as part of the study 
reimbursed to the investigator by the Sponsor.
The investigator will promptly inform the Sponsor of any regulatory authority inspection 
conducted for this study.
The investigator agrees to provide the Sponsor with relevant information from inspection 
observations/findings to allow the Sponsor to assist in responding to any citations resulting 
from regulatory authority inspection and will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the 
proposed response for consultation before submission to the regulatory authority.
Persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical studies by any court or regulatory 
authority will not be allowed to conduct or work on this Sponsor’s studies. The investigator 
will immediately disclose in writing to the Sponsor if any person who is involved in 
conducting the study is debarred or if any proceeding for debarment is pending or, to the best 
of the investigator’s knowledge, threatened.
For investigators located in countries with serious breach reporting requirements, investigator 
will promptly report to the Sponsor any serious breach or suspected serious breach that 
occurs in compliance with those requirements. Unless more specifically defin ed in the 
applicable requirements, a serious breach is any breach of the applicable clinical trial 
regulation or of the clinical trial protocol which is likely to affect to a significant degree: (i) 
the safety or rights of a trial participant, or (ii) the reliability and robustness of the data 
generated in the clinical trial .
10.1.8 Data Quality Assurance
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, labora tory data). The investigator 
or qualified designee is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
physically or electronically signing the CRF.
Detailed information regarding Data Management procedures for this protocol will be 
provided separately.
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.
The investigator must permit study- related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and

10.2.1 Renal Function Ranges
Renal function below that specified in Table 16 for the appropriate age range based on 
estimated CrCl (using the Cockcroft -Gault equation) or eGFR (using the modified Schwartz 
equation) is an exclusion criterion for this study (see Section 5.2).
In addition to values obtained from scheduled chemistry blood draws during the study, the 
serum creatinine values used to calculate CrCl or eGFR for eligibility determination will also 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Only those local laboratory abnormalities in serum 
creatinine that res ult in an AE or a clinically significant change in estimated CrCl or eGFR, 
which may or may not result in discontinuation, should be collected on the appropriate eCRF.
Participants whose renal function decreases during study medication administration to a CrCl 
or eGFR value below that specified for the appropriate age range ( Table 16 ), confirmed on 
repeat testing, should generally be discontinued from study medication. However, 
investigators may discuss continuing therapy in participants with transient changes in renal 
function due to acute illness with the Sponsor.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definitions of Medication Error, Misuse, and Abuse
Medication Error
This is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to or has the potential to 
lead to har m to the patient.
Misuse
This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the terms of the product information.
Abuse
This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic intentional ,excessive use of a medicinal 
product for a perceived psychological or physiological reward or desired nontherapeutic 
effect.
10.3.2 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
•Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
•Note: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention includes any pharmaceutical 
product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic agent, medical device, combination 
product, or protocol -specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention), manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laborat ory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.

PRODUCT: MK-7655A 132
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
Events NOT meeting the AE definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
•Surgical procedure(s) planned prior to informed consent to treat a preexisting condition 
that has not worsened.
•Refer to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.3 Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition ab ove, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
- The term “life- threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an eve nt in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizatio n
-Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a preexisting condition that h as not 
worsened is not an SAE.) A preexisting condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
-The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
-This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
-In offspring of participan t taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
-Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
conside red serious.
-Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias ,or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug depend ency 
or drug abuse.
10.3.4 Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require reporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
•Is a cancer .
•Is associated with an overdose .
10.3.5 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE recording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs/worksheets at each examination.
•It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
•There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records be fore submission to the 
Sponsor.
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/S AE.
Assessment of intensity
•An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
•The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE a nd SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following 
categories:
oMild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities (for pediatric studies, awareness of 
symptoms, but easily tolerated).
oModerate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal 
everyday activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong).
oSevere: An event that prev ents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric 
studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities).
Assessment of causality
•Did the study intervention cause the AE?
•The determination of the likelihood that the study intervention caused the AE will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was performed. This 
initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria 
below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the 
likelihood of a relationship between the test prod uct and the AE based on the available 
information.
•The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
study intervention and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the study 
intervention caused the AE:
oExposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the study 
intervention, such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (infusion

completion verification, pill count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or 
measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?
oTime Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)?
oLikely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental fa ctors.
oDechallenge: Was the study intervention discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
◦If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
◦If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the study 
intervention; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) study intervention(s) 
is/are only used 1 time.)
oRechallenge: Was the participant re -exposed to the study intervention in this study?
◦If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
◦If yes, this is a positive rechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) study 
intervention(s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE STUDY INTERVENTION, OR IF RE -
EXPOSURE TO THE STUDY INTERVENTION POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL 
SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT ,THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE 
APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR, AND IF 
REQUIRED, THE IRB/IEC.
•Consistenc y with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the study intervention or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?
•The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by 
an investigator who is a qualified physician according to their best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.

•Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indic ative of a study intervention relationship).
oYes, there is a reasonable possibility of study intervention relationship:
◦There is evidence of exposure to the study intervention. The temporal sequence of 
the AE onset relative to the administration of the study intervention is reasonable. 
The AE is more likely explained by the study intervention than by another cause.
oNo, there is not a reasonable possibility of study intervention relationship:
◦Participant did not receive the study intervention OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the study intervention is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely explained by another cause than the study intervention. ( Also 
entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)
•The investigator must review and provide an assessment of causality for each AE/SAE 
and document this in the medical notes.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor .
•The investigator may change their opinion of causality in light of follow- up information 
and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.6 Reporting of AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic data 
collection tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool.
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).

PRODUCT: MK-7655A 137
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 021-05
MK-7655A -021-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JUL-2023
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
-Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be take n off- line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure email of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.5.1 Definitions
Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile after menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below) :
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes), and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal with 1 of the following:
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
10.5.2 Contraceptive Requirements
Male Participants
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if 
they agree to 1 of the following during the protocol -defined time frame in Section 5.1:
•Be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long -term and pers istent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.
•Use a male condom plus partner use of an additional contraceptive method when having 
penile -vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently pregnant.
-The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
•Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM).

10.8 Appendix 8: Disease Definition sand Diagnostic Criteria
10.8.1 HABP/VABP
•Definitions :
oHABP is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that is associated with 
clinical signs and symptoms accompanied by presence of new or progressive infilt rate 
on chest radiograph occurring in a participant after being hospitalized for more than 
48 hours or within 7 days after discharge from hospital . Of note, such participant s 
may or may not require mechanical ventilation (ventilated HABP and nonventilated 
HABP).
oVABP is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that is associated with 
clinical signs and symptoms accompanied by presence of new or progressive infiltrate 
on chest radiograph occurring in a participant already receiving mechanical

intra-abdominal surgical procedure orpercutaneous drainage for culture and 
susceptibility testing. See Section 8.2.3.1 .2 for additional details.
10.8.3 cUTI
•Definition: cUTI is an infection of 1 or more structures in the urinary system in the 
presence of a functional or anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract or catheterization
and includes:
oComplicated lower UTI (cLUTI) : a type of c UTI that does not invol ve the upper 
urinary tract
oPyelonephr itis: a type of cUTI that affects 1or both kidneys ,regardless of underlying 
abnormalities of the urinary tract
UTIs are a clinical syndrome characterized by pyuria and a documented microbial 
pathogen on culture of urine or blood, accompanied by local and systemic signs and 
symptoms of infection. Establishing a diagnosis of UTI requires both urinalysis results 
that suggest infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of a uropathogen 
cultured from a urine specimen obtained by midstream c lean catch ( MSCC ), straight 
catheter (clean intermittent urethral catheterization), indwelling urethral catheter, or 
suprapubic aspiration (SPA) [Roberts, K. B. 2011] [Stein, R., et al 2015] .

examination of urine sediment or ≥10 WBCs/mm3in unspun urine. The 
requirement for pyuria may be fulfilled on any urine specimen obtained within 48 
hours prior to randomization.
NOTE : If pyuria cannot be determined by urinalysis in a clinically relevant 
timeframe, a urine dipstick may be used asa rapid diagnostic aid. If urine dipstick 
is used, a positive test for leukocyt e esterase is the preferred indicator for the 
presence of pyuria.
If ≥1 year of age : WBC count >10 cells/µL in unspun urine or ≥10cells/ hpfin 
spun urine; OR
If <1 year of age : WBC count >5 cells/µL in unspun urine or ≥5cells/ hpfin 
spun urine
AND
b)Microbiological : Participants with cUTI must have a pretreatment baseline urine 
culture specimen obtained within 48hours of screening, prior to the start of IV study 
intervention, and preferably prior to administration of any potentially therapeutic 
antibiotics. Specimen is to be obtained by MSCC, indwelling urethral catheter, SPA, 
or clean intermi ttent urethral catheterization. Culture results must show ≥105CFU/mL 
of uropathogen.
NOTE : Participants may be enrolled in this study while urine culture resul ts are still 
pending. IV study intervention can be started before the investigator knows the results 
of the baseline urine culture; however, participants who do not have a positive culture 
result that meets 1 of the above criteria must discontinue study in tervention following
the negative culture result .
For participan ts with an indwelling catheter, samples should be collected following 
the placement of a new catheter . If the placement of a new catheter is contraindicated 
or is not feasible, specimens should be collected using aseptic techniques with the 
urine obtained through a properly disinfected collection port. Urine samples obtained 
from a collection bag are not allowed for the study- qualifying baseline urine culture 
specimen.

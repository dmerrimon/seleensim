  2.0 TRIAL DESIGN  
2.1 Trial Design  
This is a single -arm, open -label, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti -PD-1 antibody 
MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with standard of care gemcitabine and cisplatin 
chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum -resistant ovarian cancer (encompasses  ovarian, 
peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer).  Subjects will receive 2 cycl es of gemcitabine and cisplatin 
chemotherapy followed by 4 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin combined with pembrolizumab  in 21 -
day treatment cycles .  Subjects will continue to receive single -agent pembrolizumab every 21 days as 
maintenance therapy for up to an additional 28 cycles until progression o r the subject meets withdrawal 
criteria. Altogether, the maintenance cycles in addition to the 6 combination cycles will total to 
approximately two years of study treatment.  Tumor imaging with CT scan will occ ur at baseline and 
every 6 weeks (after each second  cycle)  during chemotherapy treatment and every 9 weeks during the 
maintenance phase (or earlier than every 6 -9 weeks as clinically indicated per PI discretion) .  The 
primary endpoint is efficacy as define d overall response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST v.1.1).  Secondary endpoints  for efficacy  include progression free survival at 6 and 
12 months, time to progression, duration of response and overall survival.  Safety and tole rability of the 
regimen will be determined by assessing the frequency and intensity of adverse events as defined by 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4).  Quality of life will be measured 
using the FACIT -TS-G and FACT -G (See APPEN DIX).

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background information on MK -
3475.  
4.1.1  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformatio n has 
been known for decades .  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in vari ous mal ignancies  [1-3].  In particular, 
the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems 
to correlate with improved p rognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors  [4]. 
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by t umors to suppress immune 
control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the g ene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -
4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its 
ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD-L2) [5].  The structure of m urine PD -1 has been resolved .  PD -1 and family 
members are type I transmembra ne glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  
Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM 
motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to  the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, 
PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade .  The mechanism by which 
PD-1 down modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules  
regulate an overlapping se t of signaling proteins .  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer cells .  
Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T -cells 
as well as subsets of macr ophages and dendritic cells .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues 
as well as in  various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - 
and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 11 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T -cell activation triggered through the 
T-cell receptor.  PD -L1 is expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, most notably 
on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting 
cells found in lymph oid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell 
function in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers 
were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma .  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -
L1 pathway plays a critical rol e in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction  between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and 
PD-L2.  In September, 2014, KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) was approved in the United State s for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following 
ipilumumab and, if BR AF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.  KeytrudaTM was also granted 
accelerated approval in October 2015 by the FDA  to treat patients with advanced non -small cell lung 
cancer whose disease has progressed after other treatments and with tumors that exp ress PD -L1. 
4.1.2  Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.2 Rationale  
4.2.1  Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject Population  
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies.  Wh ile 75% of patients with 
advanced epithelial ovarian cancer will achieve a clinical remission following surgical cytoreduction and 
platinum and taxane based chemotherapy, the vast majority will relapse and develop chemoresistant 
disease  [6].  Despite aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment, fewer than 50% of patients 
with stage III or IV disease will surviv e longer than 5 years. There is a critical need  for more effective 
therapies for this fatal malignancy.  
In solid tumors including melanoma, lung, kidney, prostate and other cancers, modulation of the 
immune system is showing promise as an effective treatment strategy  [7].  This is an active area of 
research in many tumor types  and the optimal immunotherapy approach for  ovarian cancer patients  
has yet to be defined . 
Therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoin ts releases the silencing of cytotoxic T -cell responses and 
allows for effective anti -tumor immune responses.  In an earlier study, a ntibody treatment against PD -
L1 (BMS -936559) caused tumor regression and prolonged disease stabilization in heavily pretrea ted 
patients with a variety of solid tumors and also showed a milder toxicity profile compared to anti -CTLA -
4 antibody treatment [8].  However, in this trial, on ly 1 of 17 patients with advanced ovarian cancer 
demonstrated an objective response.  In 2015 , Hamanishi and colleagues reported data on the efficacy 
and safety  of an anti -PD-1 antibody  (BMS -936558, nivolumab) in patients with platinum -resistant 
ovarian ca ncer [9, 10].   Used as a single agent, the anti -PD-1 treatment was found to be well tolerated 
and asso ciated with a 15% best overall response rate and 45% disease control rate.  The median 
overall survival time was 20 months at study termination.  Taken together, these data suggest that 
immune checkpoint blockade may have efficacy in the treatment of ovari an cancer.  
Platinum -resistance correlates highly with resistance to other cytotoxic therapies.  When ovarian cancer 
relapses within 6 months of last chemotherapy, response rates to la ter-line agents range from 10 -20%.  
One of the more effective treatment o ptions in this setting has been the combination use of cisplatin 
and gemcitabine chemotherapy.  Laboratory studies demonstrate synergy between the compounds 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 12 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  and the ability of gemcitabine to reverse platinum resistance  [11].  There have been three clinical trials 
testing the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine in platinum -resistant ovarian cancer populations.  
The results are summarized below.  
1. Rose, et al.   Gynecol Oncol 200 3 [12].  In this single institution study, 36 platinum -resistant ovarian 
cancer patients (multiple prior chemotherapy regimens eligible) were tr eated with gemcitabine 750 
mg/m2 + cisplatin 3 0 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  There were 4 (11%) complete 
responses, 11 (31%) partial responses, 9 (26%) stable disease and 11 (31) progressive disease.  
Among the responders, the median duration of response was 11 months.  Progression -free interval 
was 6 months and median overall survival was 12 months.   Responses were seen, even in the setting 
of prior gemcitabine exposure.  Four of six patients who failed prior gemcitabine treatment were 
respond ers to the regimen.  
2. Nagourney, et al. Gynecol Oncol 200 3 [13].  In this single institution study, 27 patients with platinum -
resistant ovarian cancer (multi ple prior chemotherapy regimens eligible) were treated with cisplatin 30 
m/gm2 and gemcitabine 600 -750 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  There were 7 (26%) 
complete responses, 12 (44%) partial resp onses, 7 (26%) stable disease and 1 (4%) disease 
progression.  The median time to progression for objective responders was 8 months.  
3. Brewer, et al.  Gynecol Oncol 2006  [14].  In this multi -center cooperative g roup, GOG trial (GOG 
126-L), 59 patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer (eligibility limited to one prior platinum -based 
regimen) were treated with cisplatin 30 mg/m2 followe d by gemcitabine 750 mg/m2.  The dose of 
gemcitabine was reduced to 600 mg /m2 due to hematologic toxicity.  There were 4 (7%) complete 
responses, 5 (9%) partial responses, 31 (54%) stable disease and 12 (21%) progressive disease.  The 
median time to progression was 5.4 months.  The median overall survival was 15 months.  
Taken to gether, these three studies suggest activity for the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine in 
the platinum -resistant and gemcitabine -resistant ovarian cancer population.  The sequencing of the two 
drugs appears to impact the toxicity profile.  Gemcitabi ne given prior to cisplatin appears to result in 
less hematologic toxicity and better tolerability.  Despite promising response rates, the durability of 
response was limited, ranging from 5.4 to 8 months in the three trials.  The purpose of this study is t o 
determine whether the addition of an anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody to cisplatin and gemcitabine 
treatment will improve upon the responses and durability of remissions in patients with platinum -
resistant ovarian cancer.  
The body of literature addressing t he combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy is growing .  
Because chemotherapy -induced lymphodepletion is predicted to  limit the ability to mount an immune 
response , the combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy has been thought to be antagonisti c.  
However, there is data to suggest that chemotherap y and immunotherapy could work synergistically 
when sequenced properly .  Established tumors employ  a number of powerful immunosuppressive 
mechanisms to escape immune surveillance  [5].  Chemothera py reverses suppression by causing  loss 
of suppressive T -regulatory cells and triggers  a “re-booting” of the  immune system that causes  T-cells 
to become more susceptible to antigen -recognition [15-19].  Removal of tumor burden relieves  the 
immune system from persistent antigen presentation  which subsequently removes tolerance and allows  
T cells to regain anti -tumor function [20].   
Cisplatin  and gemcitabine also have specific impacts on the immune system.  Cisplatin decreases T -
regulatory and myeloid derive d suppressor cells (MDSC)  and sensitizes  tumor cells to T cell -mediated 
lysis [21, 22]. Gemcitabine dow nregulates MDSC  and has direct immunostimulatory effects [23, 24].   
Clinical trials c ombining i mmune checkpo int inhibitors with chemotherapy have  recently been reported 
and the combination  demonstrate s anti-tumor activity with acceptable toxicity .  A phase I study 
combining nivolumab  (anti-PD-1) with platinum -based doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin/gemcitabine, 
cisplatin/pemetrexed, carboplatin/paclitaxel) in non -small cell lung cancer demonstrated antitumor 
activity, no dose -limiting toxicities during the first 6 weeks of treatment, an acceptable toxicity profile 
and encouraging 1 year overall survival (ASCO 2014,  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  [25].  Nivolumab and 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 13 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  pembrolizumab have similar toxicity profiles [26].  As the safety of anti -PD-1 inhibition with cisplatin and 
gemcitabine has been demonstrated in this prior trial (no dose limiting toxicities), we p lan to study the 
combination of pembrolizumab with the cisplatin/gemcitabine platinum doublet  in this trial with a phase 
II design with early stopping rules for safety .   
Additional research suggests that the phasing of immunotherapy with chemotherapy has an impact on 
efficacy of the combination.  A phase II study combining the anti -CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab with 
paclitaxel and carboplatin in first -line treatment of advanced non -small cell lung cancer showed no 
improvement in progression -free survival (PFS)  when  ipilimumab was administered concurrently with 
chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.  However, when ipilimumab was added after two 
rounds of chemotherapy in a phased regimen that allowed for antigen release to occur prior to 
immunotherapy expos ure, there was an improvement in PFS [27].   
Based on this prior experience, we will evaluate the impact of adding the anti -PD-1 antibody MK -3475 
(pembrolizumab) to standard of care cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy in the treatment of 
patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer.  We will administer two cycles of chemotherapy to allow 
for tumor cytoreduction, tumor antigen release, decrease in suppressive T-regulatory and myeloid 
derived suppressor cells and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.  Pembrol izumab will be added 
to cycles 3-6 of chemotherapy and then will be continued as single -agent maintenance therapy  every 
3 weeks  for up to one year  until disease progression or subject meets withdrawal criteria .   
  
4.2.2  Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) has been  conducted by M erck to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three 
dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were 
observed.  This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  
No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest do se tested in PN001, will be the 
dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  
Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of 
MK-3475 and a less f requent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited 
volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) 
suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and 
pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been perfo rmed  by M erck using serum concentration time 
data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters 
of MK -3475 were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance and 
body weight, with an  allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other antibodies 
and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights.  MK -
3475 has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma ind ication.  The 
differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight 
based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for 
MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposu re margins are based on the notion of similar 
efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W 
(i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no 
significant impact of  tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the 
NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between 
different indication settings.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and co mparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors 
is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of pembrolizumab for both 
efficacy a nd safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor 
burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population PK 
model) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab tar get engagement will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose 
of 20 0 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained 
with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure 
range established in melanoma as associated with maximal effic acy response and 3) will maintain 
individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and 
safe.  
4.2.3  Rationale for Endpoints  
We will  assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with cisplatin and gemcitabine c hemotherapy 
in patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer.  We will evaluate  overall response rate as the primary 
efficacy endpoint and progression -free survival at 6 and  12 months, time to progression, duration of 
response  and overall survival  as sec ondary efficacy endpoints.  Efficacy will be determined by  imaging 
at baseline an d every 2 cycles  during chemotherapy and every 3 cycles  thereafter (or earlier as clinically 
indicated per PI discretion) until disease progression or treatment discontinuatio n.  Response will be 
determined by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST .  To determine safety, we will repor t the frequency and 
intensity of adverse events by Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4 criteria) .   
4.2.3.1  Efficacy and Safety Endpoints  
1. Overall r esponse rate  (Proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial response per 
RECIST 1.1 criteria).  
2. Overall response rate by iRECIST [28].    
3. Progression -free survival at 6 months  (Proportion of patients who have not progressed at 6 months 
with progression -free survival calculated from the start of treatment to the date of progression or  death 
from any cause).   
4. Progression -free survival at 12 months  (Proportion of patients who have not progressed at 12 months 
with progression -free survival calculated from the start of treatment to the date of progression or death 
from any cause).  
5. Time to progression  (calculated in months from the start of treatment to disease progression as 
defined by RECIST 1.1).  
6. Duration  of response  (calculated in months as time from documentation of tumor response to disease 
progression).  
7. Overall survival  (calculated in months from the start of treatment to the date of death from any cause) . 
8. Frequency and intensity of adverse events (CTCAE v.4)  as measured at each visit , during safety 
follow up (30 days after discontinuation of treatment) and during follo w up (every nine weeks after 
discontinuation)

  4.2.3.2  Biomarker Research  
Subjects will be given the option to participate in optional biomarker research.   
Subjects will be given the  option to consent for optional  CT-guided biopsy prior to treatment.  Formalin -
fixed, paraffin -embedded slides will be obtained from the primary cytoreductive surgery if available  as 
disclosed in the main informed consent form . 
Tissue  specimens will be assessed for PD -L1 expression by immunohistochemistry .  Other biomarkers 
may also be  tested including , but not limited to  PD-1, CD8, CD4, FoxP3 and Ki67.  
Immunohistochemistry expression will be correlated to treatment response in an exploratory manner.  
Subjects will be given the opportunity to consent for optional blood collection.  If the patient provides 
consent, b lood will be collected at baseline and every 2 cycles  for storage for future correlative studies.  
4.2.3.3  Quality of Life  
Quality of life (QOL) will be measured by the FACIT -TS-G and FACT -G questionnaire s [29].  The FACT -
G questionnaire will be administered at baseline.  The FACT -G and FACIT -TS-G questionnaire s will be 
administered between  cycle  2 - 3 (reflecting QOL after 2 cycles of chemotherapy), between  cycle 4 - 5 
(reflecting QOL after 2 cycles of chemotherapy + pembrolizumab) and at 6 (between cycle 8 and 9) , 12 
months (after cycle 17) and 24 months (after cycle 34) during maintenance therapy.

  5.2.1.2  Dose Modification  
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or 
several months after the  last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug -related 
toxicities and severe or lif e-threatening AEs as per Table 3 A below  and per Appendix G . 
See Appendix G for dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for immune -related AEs 
associated with Pembrolizumab.  
See Section 5.6.1  and Events of Clinical Interest Guidance Document for supportive care guidelines, 
including use of corticosteroids.  
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical r easons not 
related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or 
holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the PI. The reason for interruption should be documented 
in the patient's study record.   
A maximum of two dose level modification  to chemotherapy is permitted before withdrawing the patient 
from further chemotherapy , although patient may continue on Pembrolizumab  monotherapy, should 
they not tolerate the combination treatment.

- Primary prophylaxis with a CSF s tarting with the first cycle and continuing through subsequent 
cycles of chemotherapy is recommended in patients who have an approximately 20% or higher 
risk for febrile neutropenia based on patient -, disease -, and treatment -related factors.  In 
addition t o chemotherapy regimen and type of malignancy, consider the following factors when 
estimating the patient’s overall risk of febrile neutropenia: age ≥ 65 years, advanced disease, 
previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, preexisting neutropenia or bone m arrow 
involvement with tumor, infection, open wounds or recent surgery, poor nutritional status, poor 
renal function, liver dysfunction (most notably elevated bilirubin), cardiovascular disease, 
multiple comorbid conditions.  
- Secondary prophylaxis with a C SF is recommended for patients who experienced a 
neutropenic complication from a prior cycle of chemotherapy (for which primary prophylaxis 
was not received).  
- CSFs should be considered in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for 
infecti on-associated complications or who have prognostic factors predictive or poor clinical 
outcomes.  High-risk features include expected prolonged (> 10 days) and profound (ANC < 
100 cells/mm3) neutropenia, age > 65 years, uncontrolled primary disease, pneumo nia, 
hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction (sepsis syndrome), invasive fungal infection or 
hospitalization at the time of fever development.  
- Pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, tbo -filgrastim, and filgrastim -sndz (and other biosimilars, as they 
become available) can be used for the prevention of treatment -related febrile neutropenia.  The 
choice of agent depends on convenience, cost, and clinical situation.

5.2.2  Treatment after 1st Radiologic Evidence of Disease Progression  
If a patient demonstrates progression of disease on CT prior to cycle 3 of treatment (after receiving 2 
cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine), the patient will b e considered refractory to chemotherapy.  
Cisplatin and gemcitabine will not be administered for further cycles and the patient may continue on 
the trial and receive single agent pembrolizumab.   
Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce a nti-tumor effects by potentiating 
endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such an approach 
can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of 
new lesions.  
After the  site has assessed the first radiographic evidence of progressive disease (PD) by RECIST 1.1 
after the addition of pembrolizumab to trial therapy (cycle 3 and beyond), tumor assessment may be 
repeated ≥ 4 weeks later to confirm PD by iRECIST with the opti on for continuing treatment while 
awaiting radiologic confirmation of disease progression.  
Subjects may continue to receive study treatment while awaiting confirmation of PD if they are clinically 
stable as defined by the following criteria:  
- Absence of si gns and symptoms (including worsening of lab values) indicating disease 
progression  
- No decline in ECOG performance status  
- Absence of rapid progression of disease  
- Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomic sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention  
If repeat i maging shows SD, PR, or CR by iRECIST , the subject may continue on study treatment and 
undergo regularly scheduled imaging assessments.   
Note: If a subject with confirmed radiographic progression (i.e. 2 tu mor images at least 28 days apart 
demonstrating progressive disease) is clinically stable or clinically improved , and there is no further 
increase in the tumor dimensions at the confirmatory tumor image, an exception may be considered to 
continue treatment  upon consultation with the PI.  
 
5.2.3  Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments have 
been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).   
The administration of da y 1 treatment may be adjusted +/ - 3 days to accommodate schedule changes . 
The administration of day 8 treatment may be  adjusted +/ - 1 day to accommodate schedule changes.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Gemcitabine  750 mg/ m2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 will be given on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 -day treatment 
cycle for a total of 6 cycles.  To decrease the risk of hematologic toxicity, gemcitabine will be given prior 
to cisplatin.  Antiemetic agents may includ e, but are not limited  to ondansetron, granisetron, Ativan, 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 24 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  metoclopramide, prochlorperazine , fosaprepitant, aloxi, sancuso and  akynzeo.  Dexametha sone will 
not be administered a s a premedication  in the initial treatment cycle, but may be added at a dose of 10 
or 20 mg IV as a premedication if the patient experiences nausea on the r egimen .  Patients will receive 
hydration with at least 1 liter of fluid prior to chemotherapy.  Hydration will then continue  as clinically 
indicated .  A window of -10 minutes and +10 minutes is permit ted for chemotherapy administration.  
Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 will be administered IV over 30 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes) .  Cisplatin 30 mg/m2 
will be administered IV over 60 minutes  (+/- 10 minutes) .   
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute I V infusion every 3 weeks  on day 1 after 
gemcitabine and cisplatin starting with treatment cycle 3 .  After completion of cycle 6, pembrolizumab 
will be administered as a single -agent for maintenance therapy every 21 days for up to two years or 
the subject m eets withdrawal criteria.   
Every effort  should be made  to target  pembrolizumab  infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitt ed (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min .  The Pharmacy Manual 
contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration 
of infusion solution.  
5.2.4  Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, Merck , investigator , and subject will know the treatment 
administered.  
5.3 Randomization or Treatment Allocation  
This is a single -arm study.  No randomization will occur.  
5.4 Stratification  
Patients will be stratified based on number of prior chemothera peutic regimens (1 versus more tha n 1; 
prior cis/gem versus no prior cis/gem) .  
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the 
ongoing tri al.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  
The investigator should discuss any questions regardi ng this with the Merck C linical team .  The final 
decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's 
primary physician.  
5.5.1  Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necess ary for a subject’s welfare may be administered at 
the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care.  All 
concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over -
the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the 
trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the 
CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before  the first dose of trial treatment and 30 days 
after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  Concomitant medications administered after 
30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in 
Section 7.2. 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 25 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  5.5.2  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment 
Phase (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy o r biological therapy  not specified in this protocol   
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy   
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solit ary lesion may be allowed at the 
investigator’s discretion .   
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in 
the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster , yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  An exception can be made to a llow for  the 
use of  decadon 10  or 20  mg IV as an antiemetic premedication prior to chemotherapy (section 
5.2.3).  Otherwise, t he use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after 
consultation with Merck . 
Subjects who, in the assessment by t he investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describ es other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.6.1  Supportive Care Guidelines  for pembrolizumab  
Subjects should receive appropriate supp ortive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating 
investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in the ECI guidance document. 
Where  appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid ta pering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive car e. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed to 
follow the ECI re porting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in 
the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, can 
be found in the ECI guidance document.  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem

diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities 
of clear fluids.  If sufficien t oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should 
be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation 
and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater th an 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1 week, treat with intravenous 
steroids followed by high dose oral steroids.   
o Restart pembrolizumab when grade 2 or 3 toxicity resolved to grade 0 or 1.  
o For grade 2 or 3 diarrhea/colitis  that does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose 
or inability to reduce corticosteroid to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per 
day within 12 weeks, pembrolizumab should be discontinued.   
o For grade 4 diarrhea/colitis , pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 
5.6.2.3  Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grad e 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
▪ Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and

per day within 12 weeks, then discontinue pembrolizumab.  
▪ For grade 4 toxicity, permanently discontinue pembr olizumab  
 
 
5.6.2.5  Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism:  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluati on) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 3 -4 hypothyroidism):  
▪ In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
▪ In hypothyroidism, thyroid ho rmone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine

5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
5.7.1  Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as 
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
5.7.2  Contraception  
Pembrolizumab  may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore,  it is not known if 
pembrolizumab  has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  Non-pregnant, non -breast -
feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered 
highly unlikely to conceive.  Highl y unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) 
postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year 
will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study.  The 
two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method 
to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from study Visit 1 throughout the study 
period up to 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by the 
partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will 
include any registered and mark eted contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a 
progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study they 
must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of  the study and during 
the follow -up period defined in section 7.2.2 -Reportin g of Pregnancy and Lactation to the PI and to 
Merck .  If there is any question that a subject will not reliably comply with the requirements for 
contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.  
5.7.3  Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently b ecomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab , the subject will 
immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the subject at least monthly and document 
the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the 
pregnancy will be reported  to the IRB and to Merck within 10 days of the PI becoming aware of the 
outcome.   If the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, 
or other disabling or life -threatening co mplication to the mother or newborn) , the PI upon learning of 
the event, will report within 2 working days to Merck .  
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the IRB. 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 31 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  5.7.4  Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab  is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted in 
human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, subjects 
who ar e breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
5.8 Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the discretion 
of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be withdrawn by the 
investigator if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the trial plan is violated, or for administrative 
and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in  
Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent.  
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression  
Note : For unconfirmed radiographic disease progression, please see Section 5.2.2  
Note : A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved, please see Section 5.2.2  
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 5.2.1.2  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
• Noncompliance wi th trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Completed trial treatment with maintenance pembrolizumab . 
• Administrative reasons  
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow Chart)  and 
Section 7.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days 
for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of 
treatment as described in Section 7. 1.5.3.1 ).   
Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post -treatment follow -
up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, withdrawing 
consent or becoming lost to follow -up.   
After doc umented disease progression each subject will be followed by telephone or at their SOC clinic 
visits for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs 
first.

Page 32 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  5.8.1  Discontinuation of Study Therapy after CR  
Discon tinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR that 
have been treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab and had at least two treatments with 
pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.  Sub jects who then experience 
radiographic disease progression may be eligible for up to one year of additional treatment with 
pembrolizumab via the Second Course Phase at the discretion of the investigator if no cancer treatment 
was administered since the las t dose of pembrolizumab, the subject meets the safety parameters listed 
in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is open.  Subjects will resume therapy at the same dose 
and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation.  Additional details are provided in Section 7.1.5.5.  
5.9 Subject Replacement Strategy  
If a subject meets withdrawal criteria before receiving any pembrolizumab treatment (before cycle 3)  or 
voluntarily desires to withdraw from the intervention portion of the trial , the subject may be replaced  
with another one .  The subject withdrawing from the study will be asked whether they will provide 
consent to continue with the subsequent data collection components of the trial.    
 
5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
5.10.1  Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
5.10.2  Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements  
5.10.3  Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies  indicates a 
potential health hazard to subjects  
5.10.4  Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug

administrative reasons (Section 7.1.1.9).  Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of 
medical/s urgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, 
unrelated medical events, patient vacation and/or holidays).  Subjects should be placed back on study 
therapy within 3 weeks for he scheduled interruption, unless ot herwise discussed with the PI.  The 
reason for interruption should be documented in the patient’s study record (Section 5.2.1.2).  
3 Discontinuation and follow -up visits are required only if patient received pembrolizumab

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  4 To be performed up to 7 days pr ior to day 1 of treatment cycles.  Procedures do not need to be 
repeated if day 1 treatment is delayed or held.   
5 Full physical examination at screening, directed physical exam at subsequent time points.  Exam 
includes weight and vital signs  
6 Laboratory  studies may be performed up to 72 hours prior to treatment (Section 7.1.2). Labs on day 
8 are required to be drawn only if patient is scheduled to receive cisplatin and gemcitabine treatment.   
7 Imaging of chest, abdomen and pelvis will be done at screen ing and  after each even cycle of treatment 
with a window of  10-21 days after  day 1 of  cycle 2 , cycle 4 and cycle 6 .  Imaging of chest, abdomen 
and pelvis will be done approximately every 9 weeks during the maintenance and follow up phases  with 
a window of 10-21 days after day 1 of every third cycle  starting with  C9 (C9, C12, C15, etc.) .   Imaging 
may be performed earlier than defined above if clinically indicated per PI discretion.  
8 Optional tissue collection will be performed during the screening phase.  Collection of  archival tissue 
is not required during the screening phase .   
9 FACT -G during screening phase.  FACT -G and FACIT -TS-G at other study time points (between 
cycles 2 – 3, between cycles 4 – 5, between cycles 8 – 9, after cycle 17 , after cycle 3 4).  
10 Pembrolizumab will be administered starting with cycle 3 of therapy.  
11 After end of treatment, subjects will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring.  Serious 
adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment (S ection 5.8).  Subjects with an 
AE of Grade > 1 will be followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0 -1 or until the beginning of a 
new anti -neoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first (Section 7.1.5.3.1).  If a subject initiates new anti -
cancer therapy  within 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment, the 30 -day safely follow -up visit 
must occur before the first dose of the new therapy.  Once new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated, 
the subject will move into survival follow -up (Section 7.1.1.5. 3).   
12 Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR that 
have been treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab and had at least 2 treatments with 
pembrolizumab beyond the date when initial CR was decla red.  Subjects who then experience 
radiographic progression are eligible for up to one year of additional treatment with pembrolizumab via 
the Second Course Phase at the discretion of the investigator if no cancer treatment was administered 
since the last dose of pembrolizumab, the subject meets the safety parameters listed in the 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and the trial is open (Section 5.8.1, Section 7.1.5.5).   Laboratory tests for 
screening or entry into the Second Course Phase should be performed wit hin 10 days prior to the first 
dose of treatment.  
13 After study discontinuation for reasons other than progressive disease, subjects will be followed every 
9 weeks for disease status until progression, initiation of non -study cancer treatment, withdrawal of 
consent or becoming lost to follow -up (section 5.8, Section 7.1.5.4).  
14 After study discontinuation for progression, subjects will be followed by telephone or at clinic visits 
every 9 – 12 weeks for overall survival status until death, withdrawal of c onsent, or the end of the study, 
whichever occurs first (Section 5.8, Section 7.1.5.4.1).  
15 Patients who have had prior hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy are not required to have a 
pregnancy test  (Urine or Serum HCG) . 
16 Laboratory studies may b e performed up to 72 hours prior to treatment (Section 7.1.2).   Labs do not 
need to be repeated if day 1 treatment is delayed or held  unless clinically indicated per PI.

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each visit.  
Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator.  
Furthermore, add itional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator  and/or Merck 
for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially 
sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulat ions may require that additional 
informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be 
performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.1.1  Administrative Procedures  
7.1.1.1  Informed Consent  
Subjects will be asked to sign and date the Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization form after 
receiving a complete explanation of the research study including risks, benefits, and alternatives to 
participation. Eligible subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to s ign a written 
informed consent document.  
7.1.1.2  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee to ensure 
that the subject qualifies for the trial.  
7.1.1.3  Medical History  
A medical history wi ll be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee.  Medical history will include 
all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 years that are considered to be 
clinically significant by the Investigator.  Details regarding th e disease for which the subject has enrolled 
in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as medical history.   
7.1.1.4  Prior and Concomitant Medications Review  
7.1.1.4.1  Prior Medications  
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use a nd record prior medication taken 
by the subject within 28 days before starting the trial.  Treatment for the disease for which the subject 
has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as a prior medication.  
7.1.1.4.2  Concomitant Medications  
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the subject during the 
trial.  All medications related to reportable SAEs and ECIs should be recorded as defined in Section 
7.2. 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  7.1.1.5  Disease Details and Treatments  
7.1.1.5.1  Disease Details  
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain prior and current details regarding disease status.  
7.1.1.5.2  Prior Treatment Details  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all prior cancer treatments including systemic 
treatments, radiation and sur geries.  
7.1.1.5.3  Subsequent Anti -Cancer  Therapy Status  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all new anti -neoplastic therapy initiated after the last 
dose of trial treatment.  If a subject  initiates a new anti -cancer  therapy within 30 days after the la st dose 
of trial treatment, the 30-day Safety Follow -up visit must occur before the first dose of the new therapy.  
Once new  anti-cancer  therapy has been initiated the subject will move into survival follow -up.  
7.1.1.6  Assignment of Subject  Number  
7.1.1.7  Subjects will b e assigned a sequential screening number S 001, S 002, etc .  This 
screening ID number will no longer be used after screening is complete.   
7.1.1.8  Once a screening subject has been determined to meet eligibility criteria and has 
signed the appropriate consents, the subject will be assigned a 3-digit numeric 
subject ID that follows the standard SOCCI format (001, 002, 003, etc.).  
7.1.1.9  Trial Compliance (Medication/Diet/Activity/Other)  
Trial medications will be administered in a chemotherapy infusion area.  Day 1 t reatments will be 
scheduled every 21 days +/ - 3 days.  Day 8 treatments will be schedule with an accommodation of +/ - 
1 day for schedule changes.  
7.1.2  Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
During the screening phase, subjects will sign consent and undergo evaluations for inclus ion and 
exclusion criteria, demographics, medical history, medication review, adverse event review, physical 
examination, vital signs and weight, ECOG performance status, laboratory evaluations (CBC with 
differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, ur ic acid, phosphorus, magnesium, direct bilirubin, 
urinalysis, coagulation studies, thyroid studies, CA125, urine or serum pregnancy test  (if indicated) , 
optional blood for correlative studies), CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and optional CT-
guide d biopsy of tumor if possible.  Pathology reports from the original surgery will be reviewed to 
confirm diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.   
During the treatment phase, subjects will be monitored with history and physical  examination, vital 
signs, weight, assessment of adverse events and mediation review prior to each treatment cycle.  
These assessments may occur during a clinic visit in between cycles that is distinct from a treatment 
day.  Laboratory studies can be perfo rmed up to 72 hours prior to treatment .  Assessment of thyroid 
function and blood collection for correlative studies will be performed prior to every even cycle (cycles 
2, 4, 6).  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed after every secon d cycle during 
chemotherapy ( window of 10 -21 days after day 1 of cycles 2, 4, 6 ) and every 9  weeks thereafter  or as 
clinically indicated  (window of 10 -21 days after day 1 of cycles 9, 12, 15 , etc. ).  Similar assessments 
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 37 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  will occur prior to each cycle of tr eatment when the subject enters the maintenance phase.   Clinically 
significant labs will be repeated within 3 days.   
7.1.2.1  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening A Es as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  Adverse 
experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period 
according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 1 1.2).  Toxicities wi ll be characterized in terms 
regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.  
For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated with 
pembrolizumab exposure should  be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest 
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the 
separate ECI guidance document regarding the identification, evaluation and man agement of potential 
irAEs.   
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.   
7.1.2.2  Full Physical Exam  
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening 
period.   Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history.  A full physical 
exam should be performed during screening .  
7.1.2.3  Directed Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investig ator or qualified 
designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial treatment 
administration  either on the date of treatment or during a clinic visit preceding the date of treatment .   
7.1.2.4  Vital Signs  
The investigator or qua lified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of 
each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respiratory  rate, weight and blood 
pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only.  
7.1.2.5  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section 11.1) at screening, prior 
to the administr ation of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as specified 
in the Trial Flow Chart.   
7.1.2.6  Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
A baseline CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed within 28 days of initiating 
treatment and RECIST 1.1 criteria  (See Appendix C)  will be used to verify eligibility with measurable  
disease.  Patients with allergy to IV contrast will undergo imaging with MRI of the abdomen and pelvis 
with gadolinium and CT scan of the chest without co ntrast.  Imaging  will be performed after every even 
cycle (10-21 days after day 1 of cycles 2, 4, 6) during chemotherapy and every 3 cycles  (10-21 days 
after day 1 of cycles 9, 12, 15 , etc. ) thereafter , or earlier if clinically indicated  to as sess for resp onse.

Page 41 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  7.1.5.2  Treatment Period  
Subjects wil l receive six cycles of chemotherapy  (or less than 6 if indicated  to be held or discontinued  
per protocol) .  Pembrolizumab will be added during cycle 3 and will be administered as maintenance 
therapy every 21 days after the completion of chemotherapy.  Mai ntenance therapy will continue for up 
to an additional 28 cycles until disease progression or the subject meets withdrawal criteria.  
7.1.5.3  Post -Treatment Visits  
7.1.5.3.1  Safety Follow -Up Visit  
The mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit should be conducted approxim ately 30 days after the last dose 
of trial treatment or before the ini tiation of a new anti -cancer  treatment, whichever comes first.  All AEs 
that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade > 1 
will be follo wed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0 -1 or until the beginning of a new anti -neoplastic 
therapy, whichever occurs first.  SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end of treatment or before 
initiation of a new anti -cancer  treatment should also be foll owed and recorded.  Subjects who are 
eligible for retreatment with pembrolizumab (as described in Section 7.1.5.5) may have up to two safety 
follow -up visits, one after the Treatment Period and one after the Second Course Phase.  
The safety follow -up visit is only required if subjects received the study agent, pembrolizumab.  
7.1.5.4  Follow -up Visits  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into the 
Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed every 9 weeks ( 63 ± 14 days) or as clinically indicated by 
radiologic imaging to monitor disease status.  Every effort should be made to collect information 
regarding disease status until the start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, end 
of the study or if t he subject begins retreatment with pembrolizumab  as detailed in Section 7.1.5. 5.  
Information regarding post -study anti -neoplastic treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated.  
Subjects who are eligible to receive retreatment with pembrolizuma b according to the criteria in Section 
7.1.5. 5 will move from the follow -up phase to the Second Course Phase when they experience disease 
progression.  Details are provided in Section 6.2 – Trial Flow Chart for Retreatment.    
Follow -up visits are only req uired if subjects received the study agent, pembrolizumab.  
7.1.5.4.1  Survival Follow -up 
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new anti -cancer  therapy, the 
subject moves into the survival follow -up phase and should be assessed (in clini c or contacted by 
telephone ) every 9-12 weeks to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end 
of the study, whichever occurs first.  
7.1.5.5  Second Course Phase (Retreatment Period)  
Subjects who stop pembrolizumab with SD , PR or CR may be eligible for up to one year of additional 
pembrolizumab therapy if they progress after stopping study treatment.  This retreatment is termed the 
Second Course Phase of this study and is only available if the study remains open and the subject 
meets the  following conditions:  
• Either  
o Stopped initial treatment with pembrolizumab after attaining an investigator -determined 
confirmed CR according to RECIST 1.1, and

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  ▪ Was treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab before discontinuing therapy  
▪ Received at l east two treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the 
initial CR was declared  
  OR 
o Had SD, PR or CR and stopped pembrolizumab treatment after 24 months of study therapy 
for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability  
AND  
• Experienced an investigator -determined confirmed radiographic disease progression after 
stopping their initial treatment with pembrolizumab  
• Did not receive any anti -cancer treatment since the last dose of pembrolizumab  
• Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Pe rformance Scale  
• Demonstrates adequate organ function as detailed in Section 5.1.2  
• Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test 
within 72 hours prior to receiving retreatment with study medication.   
• Female s ubject of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or 
be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 
120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference Section 5.7 .2).  Subjects of child 
bearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have been free from 
menses for > 1 year.  
• Does not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality 
that might interfere w ith the subject’s participation for the full duration of the trial or is not in the 
best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.  
Subjects who restart treatment will be retreated at the same dose and dose interva l as when they last 
received pembrolizumab.  Treatment will be administered for up to one additional year.  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 – Trial Flow Chart.  
 
7.2 Assessing and Recording Adverse Events  
7.2.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse eve nt is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be a ny unfavorable  and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal pr oduct or protocol -specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is 
temporally associ ated with the use of Merck ’s product, is also an adverse event.  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 43 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  Change s resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or 
severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples of this may include, 
but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children and onset of menses or menopause 
occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.  
Merck ’s product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent or 
protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (inclu ding placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by or distributed by Merck for human 
use. 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of Merck ’s product in clinical trials or within the 
follow -up period specified by the protocol, or prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline period as a 
resul t of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, 
placebo treatment or a procedure.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered to be 
drug related by th e investigator.  
All adverse events  with the exception of grade 1 or 2 laboratory abnormalities  will be recorded from the 
time the consent form is signed through 30 days following cessation of treatment and at each 
examination on the Adverse Event case repo rt forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse 
events meeting any serious criteria is described in section 7.2.3.1.  
7.2.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
All non -hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE v4 is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
Mild (grade 1 ): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities.  
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.  
Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or s ignificantly 
affects his/her clinical status.  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  
Fatal (grade 5):  the event caused death.  
 
7.2.3  Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the IRB and 
to Merck  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose 
of pembrolizumab. Appropriate support ive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the 
event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  If an adverse event(s) is associa ted with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck product, the adverse 
event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without  any associated 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -serious Event of 
Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
As per institutional policies, an overdose is considered an SAE and must be reported (See section 
7.2.5)  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 2 working days to 
Merck Global Safety.  See section on SAE reporting for further information regardin g institutional policy 
for reporting SAEs. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) . 
7.2.4  Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the IRB and to Merck  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously 
reported to them), that occurs during the trial or within 120 days of completing the trial completing the 
trial, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if th e subject initiates new anticancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier.  All subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the completion/termination 
of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform 
mole, bli ghted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of 
infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported w ithin 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product 
Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220)  
7.2.5  Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the IRB and to Merck  
7.2.5.1.1  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or durin g any use of Merck’s 
product that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
• Is associated with an overdose;  
• Is another important medical event  
Refer to Table 6 for additional details regarding each of the above criteria.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unl ess it results in 
hospitalization or death.  
Any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause 
that occurs to any subject from the time the consent is signed through 90 days following cessation of 
treatment , or the initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or not related to 
Merck ’s product, must be reported within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety  upon the PI becoming 
aware of the event .  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 45 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  Non-serious Events of Clinical Interest  will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety and will be handled in the 
same manner as SAEs.  
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified physician to 
be related to Merck ’s product that is brought to the attention  of the investigator at any time outside of 
the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the IRB and 
to Merck.  
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the Merck Global 
Safety facsimile number:  +1 -215-993-1220  
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by FDA, European 
Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local regulators. 
Investigators will cross reference  this submission according to local regulations to the Merck 
Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.  Additionally 
investigators will submit a copy of these reports to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; 
FAX 215 993 -1220) at the time of submission to FDA.  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.  
 
7.2.5.2  Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets and reported within 
2 working days to Merck Global Safety (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) .  Events 
of clinical interest for this trial include:  
1.  An overdose of Merck product, as defined in Section 7.2.1 - Definition of an Overdose for This 
Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the IRB, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or 
abnormal laboratory results.  
2.  An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is gr eater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and 
an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at 
the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of nor mal, as 
determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of 
the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional 
evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of these 
criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). 3. Additional adverse 
events:  
 A separate  guidance document has been provided entitled “Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document” (previously entitled, “Event of Clinical Interest and Immune -Related Adverse Event 
Guidance Document”).  This document provides guidance regarding identification, evaluation and 
management of ECIs and irAEs.   
 ECIs (both non -serious and serious adverse events) identified in this guidance document from the 
date of first dose through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days after the initiation of 
a new a nticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, need to be reported within 2 working days to Merck 
Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220), regardless of attribution to 
study treatment, consistent with standard SAE reporting guidelines.  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
Page 46 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
   Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dose.  Lab results should be evaluated 
and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune -related event.  
Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune -related should have additional testing to rule 
out other etiologic causes.  If lab results or symptoms indicate a possible immune -related ECI, then 
additional testing should be performed to rule out other etiologic causes.  If no other cause is found, 
then it is assumed to be immune -related.  
 
7.2.6  Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI 
Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event which changes 
CTCAE grade over  the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the 
adverse event case report forms/worksheets.  
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.  
Grade 1 and 2 lab abnormalities will not be coll ected. The study will only collect grade 3 and 4 lab 
abnormalities  as adverse events.  
7.3 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
7.3.1  Expedited reporting  
The Principal Investigator must be notified by study staff within 24 hours of learning of any serious 
advers e events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 days of the last 
administration of the study drug.  
 
Phone number for expedited reporting: Christine Walsh, Phone number: 310-423-5456  
 
7.3.2  Reporting to the Institutional Review Board  (IRB)  
The CSMC IRB requires that investigators report all adverse events that may represent an 
unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others as defined below. All adverse events (those 
involving subjects who were enrolled at CSMC), that have  a reasonable possibility of relationship to the 
study AND meet the following criteria must be reported to the IRB:  
 • Unanticipated (regardless of severity); OR  
• Anticipated and serious  
All reportable events should be submitted in Webridge to the Offic e of Research Compliance and 
Quality Improvement as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days from the investigator’s  
awareness of the event. The report must contain at least:  
• Identification of the PI, study coordinator (if applicable), contact informa tion, study title, and IRB 
number.  
• A detailed summary of the problem, including all relevant details and the PI’s assessment of the 
events leading up to the problem, to assist the IRB in its evaluation.  
• A description of any action taken to address or  remedy the problem, including a description of the 
resolution, if any, or current status.  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem

  Table 6 Evaluating  Advers e Events  
An investigator,  who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal , local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental 
ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor product that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (Note: This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death. ); or 
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient  admission, 
regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization [including hospitalization for an elective procedure] for a preexisting condition which has not worsened does  not 
constitute a serious adverse event.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study)  or 
 Is an overdose  (whether acc idental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious 
adverse event. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest 
and must be reported within 2 bus iness days to Merck . 
 Other important medical events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be 
considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize th e subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of ti me and units  
Action taken  Did the adverse event cause the Sponsor product to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
to test drug  Did the Sponsor product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor  product caused the 
adverse eve nt will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the

  source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment 
of causality w as done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test dr ug 
and the adverse  event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor  product and the AE ; the 
greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensi ty), the more likely the 
Sponsor product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the Sponsor  product such as: reliable history, 
acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expecte d pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the Sponsor  product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effec t (applies to trials with investigational 
medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or 
other host or environmental factors  
 
 
 
 
Relationship  The following  components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)  
to Sponsor  
product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the Sponsor  product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE 
resolved/improved despite continuation of the Sponsor  product; or ( 3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) 
Sponsor  product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the Sponsor  product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If n o, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the 
trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (3) Sponsor  product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A REC HALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR  PRODUCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO THE SPONSOR  
PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE

  7.3.3  Investigator  Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and to Merck  in accordance with 
all applicable global laws and regulati ons.  
 
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
8.1 Trial Design  
The design for this one -arm phase II trial follows the classical two -stage design proposed by 
Simon (1989) [31].  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ov erall response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of 
patients who achieve a complete or partial response per RECIST 1.1 criteria [32, 33].  
- Compl ete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
- Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
- Stable disease (SD): Neither insufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD (see below), taking as reference the smallest sum diame ters 
while on study.  
- Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative  increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  The appearance of one 
or more new lesions is also considered progression.   
 
Response will be assessed at each time point and the best overall response rate will be 
determined accounting for response at subsequent time points through the first 6 cycles of 
therapy [33].   
A proportion of patients with a favorable response of less than 11.1% will be  of no interest.  The 
new treatment would be of interest if the proportion of patients with response is at least 30.0%.  
Twenty -five patients would be needed to test the null hypo thesis: p ≤ 0.111 against the alternative 
hypothesis: p ≥ 0.300 at the 5.0% level of significance and with 80% power.  If the trial progresses 
until 25 patients are evaluated and 6 or more patients with favorable response are observed then 
the null hypothe sis is rejected.  
8.2 Early Stopping for Futility  
The early stopping point is 18 patients.  If 2 or fewer patients with favorable response are 
observed when 18 patients are accrued, then the null hypothesis is accepted and the trial is 
terminated.  The probabil ity of early stopping under the null is 0.68 and under the alternative is 
0.06.

8.4 Early Stopping for Safety  
An undesirable event is defined as a grade 3 or 4 pembroli zumab attributable  toxicity  that 
results in permanent discontinuation of the drug (see table 3 and section 5.6.1).   Let Pt be the 
true probability of an undesirable event. The trial will stop if there is statistical evidence that Pt 
exceeds 0.4. We will u se a Bayesian sequential design by checking whether Pt exceeds this 
threshold value after each patient is evaluable for this event. The decision rule is to stop the 
trial if the posterior probability that Pt exceeds the threshold is 0.95; for example, P ( Pt > 0.4 | 
data) > 0.95. A noninformative prior distribution for Pt will be used. Tables 7A and 7B give the 
stopping rules for the design at each look and column 2 gives the maximum number of patients 
with undesirable events in order for the trial to procee d. For example, in Table 7A, if 13 or more 
undesirable events are observed after enrolling 18 patients, the trial stops. The third column 
gives the probability of stopping the trial when in fact, the true Pt = 0.40. This is the equivalent 
of the Bayesian t ype I error probability. The target type I error probability was set at 0.05.  
Table 7B gives the design operating characteristics under selected values of the true probability 
Pt. It gives the probability of stopping the trial under the alternative hypothe sis, the expected 
sample size, and the average sample size given that the trial stopped. For example, if the true 
value of Pt is 0.7, then there is an 81% chance that the trial is stopped early and the average 
sample size is about 11.

8.5 Statistical Analyses  
Distributions of time -to-event data will be estimated with the nonparametric Kaplan -Meier estimator. 
Median progression -free survival at 6 and 12 months, time to progression, duration of res ponse, and 
overall survival will be estimated from these distributions.  
Although a phase II trial is unlikely to definitively establish whether a marker can be used to predict 
clinical benefit, we may identify an association that can then be further explor ed in definitive phase III 
trials [34, 35].  Therefore, the following analyses are of exploratory nature. Depending on the distribution 
of the expression levels of the selected biomarkers (PD -1, PD -L1, CD8, CD4, FoxP3 and Ki67), 
Pearson’s and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients will be used to assess the pairwise association 
between them. Univariate analys is based on log -rank test will be used to evaluate the association 
between biomarkers measured as categorical variables and time -to-event outcomes. Univariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression models will be used to assess which biomarkers measured as 
continuous variables are predictive of patient time -to-event outcomes.

9.4 Storage and Handling Requirements  
Commercial  supplies must be stored in a secure, limited -access location under the storage conditions 
specified on the label.   
Receip t and dispensing of trial medication must be recorded by an authorized person at the trial site.  
Commercial  supplies may not be used for any purpose other than that stated in the protocol.  
9.5 Returns and Reconciliation  
The investigator is responsible for keep ing accurate records of the commercial  supplies received from 
Merck or designee, the amount dispensed to and returned by the subjects and the amount remaining 
at the conclusion of the trial.  
Upon  completion  or termination  of the study,  all unused  and/or  partially used investigational product 
will be destroyed at the site per institutional policy. It is the Investigat or’s respon sibility  to arrange 
for disposal of all empty containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been 
established accord ing to applicable federal, state, local and institutional guidelines and procedures, 
and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.  
10.0   STUDY MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Conflict of Interest  
Any reportable conflict of interest will be disclosed to the local IRB and will be outlined in the Informed 
Consent Form.   
10.2 Institutional Review Board and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally 
mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent fo rm and protocol.  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
 
Page 56 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declarat ion of Helsinki.  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the 
study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all 
the relevant elements currently r equired by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once 
this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the 
patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be  asked to give 
consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB -approved consent form.  
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and 
personally dated by the patient and by the person who conduc ted the informed consent discussion.  
 
10.3 Registration Procedures  
All subjects that sign informed consent will be assigned a subject number sequentially by their date of 
consent.  Those subjects that do not pass the screening phase will be listed as screen fai lures on the 
master list of consented subjects.  Eligible subjects, as determined by screening procedures and 
verified by a treating investigator, will be registered on study at Cedars Sinai Medical Center by the 
Study Coordinator.   
Issues that would caus e treatment delays after registration should be discussed with the Principal 
Investigator (PI). If a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s 
registration on the study may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be  notified of cancellations 
as soon as possible.  
The study team will track all subjects who sign consent on a subject screening/enrollment log using a 
unique screening ID (S 001, S 002, etc.).  Subjects found to be ineligible will be recorded as screen 
failur es.  Subjects found to be eligible will be registered.  Please see section 7.1.1.6 for more information 
on subject ID assignment.  
 
A) Eligibility Verification  
 
Prior to registration, all subjects must undergo eligibility verification by the SOCCI Clinical Rese arch 
Office (CRO). The following documents will be completed and provided for review:  
 
o Registration form (or equivalent)  
o Copy of required laboratory tests  
o Copy of required imaging reports  
o Eligibility checklist (signed by investigator)  
o Signed patient consen t form and Subject’s Bill of Rights  
o HIPAA authorization form  
 
B) Registration  
 
After eligibility is verified, registration is completed as follows:  
CSMC IIT2015 -13-Walsh -PemCiGem  
 
Page 57 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  o Assign a patient study number  
o Enter the patient in OnCore  
o Notify the investigational pharmacy and treating phys icians that a subject has gone on study 
and anticipated treatment start date  
 
Oversight by the principal investigator is required throughout the entire registration process  
 
11.0  DATA AND SAFETY MON ITORING  
11.1 Data Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
Adherence to the  protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and institutional policy will be monitored by 
the PI during the course of the study through routine Disease Research Group (DRG) meetings or 
equivalent. In addition, the SOCCI CRO Quality Management Core (QMC) will  conduct the following:  
 
• Audit preparations (AP) prior to audit conducted by any external auditing agency (i.e. NCI or 
FDA). The purpose an AP is to ensure adequate source documentation to support protocol compliance 
and data integrity are present and o rganized and to identify and correct any major findings prior to the 
external audit  
• A thorough review of selected subject cases, regulatory files, and IP accountability records (if 
applicable) within 2 -3 months after the first subject is enrolled and ann ually thereafter while subjects 
are receiving investigational intervention.   
• Central eligibility verification for all subjects enrolled as described in protocol section 10.3.   
• Central review of all eligibility waiver requests by a SOCCI Medical Revie wer to assess 
appropriateness and risk to ensure quality data and ensure subject safety protections for investigator -
initiated research  
 
For any protocol, QMC has the authority to request more frequent reviews or closer safety monitoring 
if it is deemed ap propriate for any reason.  
 
11.2 Safety Monitoring  
Oversight of the progress and safety of the study will be provided by the PI. The PI will maintain 
continuous safety monitoring for the duration of the study by reviewing subject/study data. Adverse 
events and u nanticipated problems are not expected, but if they occur they will be documented and 
reported according to CSMC IRB policies and procedures. If the PI becomes aware of any new safety 
information that may place subjects at increased risk than what was prev iously known the IRB will be 
promptly notified and if warranted, enrollment may be held until the PI determines whether a 
modification to the study is necessary and/or the informed consent documents are updated accordingly.  
 
In addition, this protocol will  utilize oversight by a Safety Committee On Early Phase Studies 
(SCOEPS). Committee membership includes experts in the field of oncology and early phase studies 
and biostatistics. SCOEPS’ responsibilities are governed by the committee charter or equivalent .   
 
The SCOEPS will provide routine monitoring of safety and enrollment for all early phase investigator -
initiated trials (IITs). The committee meets routinely and is responsible for reviewing and adjudicating 
all dose -limiting toxicities, dose escalation s and appropriateness of the escalation, cohort expansion, 
subject replacements, select AEs, SAEs, and confirmation of attainment of maximum tolerated dose.  
 
The SCOEPS findings and recommendations will be reported in writing to the Principal Investigator.  A 
summary report will be forwarded by the Principal Investigator or his/her designee to the Cedars -Sinai 
Medical Center IRB.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
   
11.3 Adherence to the P rotocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and well -being of 
the study patient requires alternative treatment , or a protocol exception request approved by the 
SOCCI Medical Director and CSMC IRB , the study shall be conducted exactly as described in the 
approved protocol.   
 
11.3.1  Emergency Modifications  
Investigators may imp lement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB approval. For any such emergency modification 
implemented, the IRB must be notified as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days from the 
investigator’s awareness of the event .  
 
11.3.2  Protocol Exceptions and Eligibility Waivers  
An exception is a type of planned deviation  to the  protocol, such as an eligibility waiver to enroll a 
subject who does not meet the approved inclusion/exclusion criteria. Unlike an amendment, a protocol 
exception most often involves a single subject  and is not a permanent revi sion to the research protocol. 
The PI or her/his designee is responsible for submitting a protocol exception  to the SOCCI Medical 
Director for review of the request and its supporting documentation to make a determination for further 
action. If the determination  is an approval, then the request must be submitted  in Webridge  to the 
CSMC IRB. If the request is acknowledged by the IRB, then the   protocol exception/eligibility waiver 
may be implemented.  
Logistical deviations from the protocol (e.g., minor changes to the study schedule for an individual 
subject) do not require prior IRB approval unless the deviation has the potential to affect the subject’s 
safety. Such planned deviations that do not affect the subject’s safety should be noted in the subject’s 
research record.  Planned exceptions to the protocol that are more than logistical and/or have the 
potential to affect the subject’s safety o r study integrity may not be implemented without prior approval 
from the SOCCI Medical Director and IRB . 
 
11.3.3 Other  Protocol Deviations/Violations  
Unintentional deviations from the protocol that might affect subject safety or  study integrity should be 
reported to the IRB within 10 days from when the  investigator becomes aware that such a deviation 
has occurred. In this case, a Protocol Deviation report must be submitted in Webridge.  All submissions 
should include a description of the plan to avoid simil ar deviations in the future.   
11.4 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and documented 
by the Principal Investigator. It should also be noted that when an amendment to the protocol 
substant ially alters the study design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be 
required.  
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to the IRB for 
approval prior to implementation.  
Repeat e xceptions  or deviations to the protocol may suggest a protocol amendment is needed.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  11.5 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in accordance with 
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulatio ns and/or the Declaration of Helsinki. The Principal Investigator 
is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study patients. The Principal Investigator 
must assure that all study site personnel, including sub -investigators and other stud y staff members, 
adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials 
both during and after study completion.  
The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the required 
data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms  and into the HIPAA -compliant study 
database . Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal Investigator will provide 
access to his/her original records to perm it verification of proper entry of data. At the completion of the 
study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final 
signature to verify the accuracy of the data.  
11.6 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source 
documents, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB 
correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
Source documents include a ll recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports 
and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
Government agency regulations and directives require that the study investigator m ust retain all study 
documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial. Study documents should be kept on file until 
three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study or as required by 
institutional guidelines.

Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  APPENDIX C: RECIST 1.1  
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  Version 1.1  
C1. Measurability of tumor at baseline  
Measurable disease .  
Tumor lesions : must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plan e 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
- 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
- 10 mm caliper m easurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded  as non -measurable)  
- 20 mm by chest x -ray 
Malignant lymph nodes : to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be meas ured and followed.   
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions ). 
Lesions considered truly non -measurabl e include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses /abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible 
imaging techniques.  
C2. Methods of Measurements  
All measurements should be reco rded in metric notation, using  calipers  if clinically assessed . All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more th an 28 days before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation  should always 
be done rathe r than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by clinical exam.   
C3. Baseline Documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions  
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline  and at the specified interval during treatment . Target lesions should be selected 
on the basis of their size ( lesions with the longest diameter) , be representative of all involved organs, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  A sum 
of the diameter s (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions)  for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . The baseline sum diameters  will be used as 
reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.  
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) sh ould be identified as non-target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required  and these 
lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.

Page 66 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  C4. Tumor Response Eval uation  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.   
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% dec rease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters  of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the b aseline sum if that is the smallest sum on 
study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions  is also considered progression.  
Stable D isease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.  
Special note on assessment of lymph nodes : When lymph nodes are included as target lesi on, the 
‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node 
is defined as having a short axis < 10 mm.  In order to qualify ofr CR, each node must achieve a short 
axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the a ctual short axis measu rement of the nodes is to be inc luded 
in the sum of target lesions.   
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’ : If the radiologist believes the lesion has likely 
disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If a lesion is believed to be present but 
is too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If the radiologist is able to provide 
an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.   
Lesions that split or coalesce on treat ment : When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters 
of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  As lesions 
coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter  
measurement of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that the are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter 
for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions  and normalization of tumor marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesions  and/or maintenance of tumor marker 
level above the normal limits , 
Progressive Disease (PD) : unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  or the appearance 
of one or more lesions.  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease or progressive disease.

  C5. Evaluation of Response  
 
When both target and non-target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded 
separately.  Determination of tumor response at each assessment is summarized in the following table:  
Target Lesions  Non-target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR 
CR Not evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No SD 
Not all evaluated  Non-PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any response  PD Yes or No  PD 
Any response  Any response  Yes PD 
 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until the end of 
treatment  taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  To be assigned a status of PR or CR, 
changes in tumor measurements with responding tumors should be con firmed by repeat imaging 
performed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.  In the case of SD, follow -up 
measurement must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 
weeks.   
 
RECIST version 1 .1* will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT or 
MRI may be utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study.

of new lesions.  The  iRECIST  criteria  were developed as an adaptation to RECIST criteria to account 
for this observation , iRECIST  will be assesse d secondarily following the addition of pembrolizumab to 
treatment.  i RECIST utilizes the following adaptations to RECIST 1.1.

  APPENDIX G : Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related AEs Associated with Pembrolizumab  
General instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE i mproving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and 
corticosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or 
corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
3. For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated f irst followed by oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment 
should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

Amending Protocol Version 2 dated 05FEB2016 received IRB approval on February 11, 2016.  
Amendment 2: The following changes were made primarily to acco mmodate the use of pre -
medications sooner than previously written. Other protocol clarifications and edits are included in the 
list below.  
1. Title page – Version date updated  
2. List of Abbreviations – CSF (colony -stimulating factor) added  
3. Section 4.2.3.2 – Updated to clarify biomarker endpoints.  
4. Section 5.1.1.3 – Added “platinum -based” for internal consistency in defining platinum -
resistant ovarian cancer.

Page 76 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  7. Section 5.2.1.2 – A section was added to allow for growth factor support as re commended by 
the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline.  The prior 
language that restricted growth factor support use to after a second episode of febrile 
neutropenia was removed as this was too restrictive, posed a safety concern, and did not 
reflect current guidelines for standard of care growth factor support use.  A protocol exception 
was approved by Dr. Sandler and the IRB on 3/10/2016 to allow for growth factor support to a 
patient who experienced febrile neutropenia d uring cycle 1 of chemotherapy in this study.   
8. Section 5.2.3 – the language surrounding antiemetic and hydration regimens was modified to 
be less restrictive and more reflective of current standard of care.  A statement was added to 
allow for the addition of decadron 10 mg IV as an antiemetic premedication.  This was 
approved by Merck on 2/29/2016.  A protocol exception was approved by the IRB on 
3/1/2016 to allow a subject to receive decadron as an antiemetic premedication during cycle 
2 of chemotherapy in  this study.   
9. Section 5.5.2 – this language was updated to allow for use of decadron 10 mg IV as an 
antiemetic premedication.   
10. Section 6.0 – days were removed from the first row of the study flow chart as these were 
potentially inaccurate given the admin istrative leeway allowing for +/ -3 days on day 1 and +/ - 
1 day on day 8 of therapy.  “+21” was added to cycles 2 -6 and maintenance to reflect the fact 
that these are 21 day cycles.  
11. Section 7.1.1.6 – clarification was provided on the assignment of patient numbers.  
12. Section 7.1.1.9 – a return carriage was added to indicate that this is a new section.  
13. Section 7.1.2 – the language was updated to clarify the timing of assessments.  Exam, vital 
signs, weight, assessment of adverse events and medication review m ay be performed 
during a clinic visit in between cycles.  Laboratory studies can be performed up to 72 hours 
prior to treatment (this is internally consistent with existing language on page 43 of the 
protocol).  
14. Section 7.1.2.3 – the language was updated t o clarify the allowed timing of directed physical 
exam.  
15. Section 7.1.2.6 – the language was updated to clarify alternative imaging assessment for 
patients with allergy to IV contrast.  
16. Section 10.3 – add a line referencing section 7.1.1.6 for more informat ion on subject 
registration.  
17. Section 11.1 – the Data and Quality Assurance language was updated to reflect current 
SOCCI practice.  
18. Section 11.2 – subsection title was updated to delete the word data. This section only 
addresses current SOCCI practice for s afety review of IITs, the Safety Committee On Early 
Phase Studies.  
19. Section 11.2.1 – the original section was duplicative of the text in subsection 11.1 and is now 
deleted.  
20. Section 11.2.2 – this section was deleted as it is no longer relevant. IMM was repla ced by 
SCOEPS.  
21. Section 11.3 – a line was added to clarify that an approved protocol exception is an instance 
when the protocol is not adhered to in addition to an emergency modification.  
22. Section 11.3.1 – some text was deleted and is now included in the fol lowing sections 11.3.2 
and 11.3.3.  
23. Section 11.3.2 – new section was added to clarify when an exception or an eligibility waiver 
may be implemented.  
24. Section 11.3.3 – formerly section 11.3.2 was edited to only address protocol deviations.

Page 77 of 81 
Protocol Version 11:  02 Jan 2019  
  25. Section 11.4 – a line was added to clarify that a protocol amendment may be necessary if 
there are repeated exceptions or deviations.  
26. Section 11.5 – added a line to include data entry into a HIPAA -compliant database is also a 
study obligation of the PI.

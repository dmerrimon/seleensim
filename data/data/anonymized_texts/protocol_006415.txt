 Project Summary  
Peripheral intravenous (PIV) therapy is one of the most common invasive procedures performed 
in US hospitals. PIV failures often occur when fluids leak out of the vein into surrounding tissue. This failure is called an infiltration for the leakage of non -vesicant solutions or an extravasation for 
vesicant solutions. The ivWatch Model 400 is a device that assists medical professionals in monitoring patients for PIV infiltration and extravasation events using an optical sensor. This device received FDA clearance for use in the adult and pediatric age groups in February 2015 and December 2016, respectively. The corresponding FDA letters are included on Page 51.  
ivWatch is enhancing the Model 400 to support a new disposable electronic sensor, called SmartTouch. In this study, the SmartTouch sensor cable will be tested to show equivalence to the original Model 400 fiber optic sensor. The new sensor design includes optical components in the 
sensor package, similar to a typical pulse oximeter. This design allows the sensor to be lower cost and disposable. The goal of this study is to validate the performance of the ivWatch SmartTouch 
sensor  for detecting the early st ages of an IV infiltration, as collected from healthy adult 
volunteers. The Model 400 Fiber Optic sensor is used for performance comparison.  
The study objectives include:  
Primary Objective : Demonstrate a statistically significant improvement for detecting  early stage 
infiltrations in comparison to hourly observation by a perfect clinician.  
Secondary Objectives : 
1. Demonstrate statistical equivalence in infiltration detection volume of the SmartTouch and Fiber Optic sensors.  
2. Demonstrate statistical equivalence  in infiltration sensitivity of the SmartTouch and Fiber 
Optic sensors.

Rationale and Background 
Peripheral intravenous (PIV) therapy is one of the most common invasive procedures performed 
in US hospitals. Over 25 million patients, or approximately 80% of hospital patients, require intravenous  therapy each year in the United  States  [1]. Despite wides pread use, a number of 
potential complications can occur during PIV therapy.  Infiltration is the most common mode of PIV catheter failure, with an average incidence rate of 23.9% according to a prospective randomized review of controlled studies from 1999 to 2014 [2]. The other common modes of failure 
are catheter occlusion / mechanical failure (18.8%), catheter -related phlebitis (15,4%), catheter 
dislodgement (6.9%), and catheter -related infection (0.2%) [2]. A multicenter trial indicated 
infiltrations oc curred 27 -32 times per 1000 intravenous catheter days in adults  [3].  Infiltration is the 
leakage of non -vesicant fluids like saline into the surrounding tissue. Extravasation is the leakage 
of vesicant fluids, which include cytotoxic drugs, intraveno us nu trition, and calcium, potassium, 
and bicarbonate solutions [4].  
IV infiltration or extravasation is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and/or edema in the vicinity of the insertion site. Severe infiltration and extravasation may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation  [5].
 One common area of malpractice lawsuits filed 
against physicians and nurses involves infiltration or extravasation  [6]. It has been reported that 
the infiltration rate for contrast media injections i s independent of infusion rate and it does not vary 
significantly with regard to injection site, catheter size, or catheter type  [7]. A randomized 
controlled trial including 3,283 adult medical and surgical patients with 5,907 total catheters indicated tha t PIV catheter occlusion rate (including infiltration) is improved by forearm insertion 
versus hand, antecubital fossa, or upper arm [8]. T he reported incidence of infiltration in the 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) population is between 23% and 78% an d carries the potential 
for long- term sequelae [9] .  
ivWatch, LLC has developed the ivWatch Model 400 – a Class II medical device that is cleared for 
use on adults and pediatrics. The ivWatch Model 400 is indicated for the detection of subcutaneous infiltrations and extravasations of 10 cc or less of optically clear infusates, as an adjunctive device to the clinical evaluation in the healthcare setting of adults and pediatrics with PIVs.  
The ivWatch Model 400 consists of the ivWatch Patient Monitor (IPM), reusable fiber optic sensor cable, and sensor cable receptacle. As illustrated in Figure 1 below, the reusable fiber op tic sensor 
delivers visible and near -infrared  light to the ti ssue and transmits reflected light back to the IPM.  
The IPM contains an optical system that generates light signals that are sent to the patient’s skin (via the reusable fiber optic sensor cable), and measures the light returning from the patient’s skin (also via the reusable fiber optic sensor cable).  The sensor head of the reusable fiber optic sensor 
cable is held in place and attached to the patient using the sensor receptacle. The IPM also contains the hardware for executing the proprietary ivWatch signal processing algorithm, and for displaying system status on a user interface, including audible and visual notifications indicating changes to the state of the PIV.  
When changes in the diffuse reflectance in the tissue near the peripheral IV insertion si te are 
consistent with an infusate pooling in the subcutaneous tissue, the IPM emits audible and visual

notifications intended to prompt the clinician to inspect the peripheral IV site for a possible 
infiltration event.  Prompt identification of infiltrations reduces the risk of injury to patients undergoing peripheral IV therapy and improves the likelihood of receiving the correct dosage of medications delivered intravenously.  
 
Figure 1. ivWatch Model 400 Infiltration Monitoring System  
The ivWatch Model 400 system has been expanded to support both the fiber optic sensor cable configuration of the existing Model 400 as well as an electronic sensor cable configuration (SmartTouch). The SmartTouch sensor consists of low -cost optical components built into the sensor 
head, like disposable pulse oximeter sensors. This design allows the SmartTouch sensor to be a more cost effective single -use sensor, as opposed to the costlier reusable fiber optic sensor. An 
extension module compatible wi th the existing ivWatch Model 400 was developed to support an 
electronic sensor cable configuration, (Figure 2). The Extension Module is connected to the IPM via USB. The SmartTouch sensor was designed to be an electronic version of the Model 400 fiber 
optic sensor. The sensor is placed on the skin of a patient near the PIV site, following the protocol 
as the Model 400, and the same indications for use apply.

ivWatch Model 400 Clinical Studies  
The ivWatch Model 400 was tested in a series of IRB -approved studies on healthy adult research 
subjects, as summarized in Table 2. The Design Verification studies evaluated the performance of 
the device under different co nditions. The NIR Detection of PIV Infiltration study evaluated two 
models of PIV infiltration as well as potential algorithm correction for changes in tissue blood 
volume. The Signal Variation of Normal Tissue study evaluated the sources and rates of non -
infiltration alarms when monitoring normal, non -infiltrated tissues. In this protocol document, the 
terms ‘alarm’ and ‘notification’ are considered interchangeable. Two clinical studies evaluated how the infiltration rate and catheter depth affected the di agnostic performance of the ivWatch 
Model 400. The device detected all 10mL infiltrations for common adult infusion rates ranging from 5 mL/hr to 150 mL/hr. The device detected all infiltrations with a catheter depth less than 5 mm deep although deeper inf iltrations caused a reduced sensitivity by the device. The final study 
assessed the adhesion of the ivWatch receptacle over a 96 hour period. There were no adhesion issues with the receptacle when used with an occlusive dressing.  
After completing the desig n verification studies, two additional studies were performed to validate 
the final design. The study, titled Device Validation for Non -Infiltrated Tissues, evaluated non -
infiltrated sites over a 24 hour period. The device issued a false red notification once every 4.2 days and a false yellow notification once every 2.0 days. These notifications were often caused by compression of the IV site. The next study, titled Device Validation for Infiltrated Tissues, evaluated the performance of the ivWatch Model 400 for detecting 140 infiltrated IV sites. Of the 140 IV sites, the ivWatch device issued 135 red notifications (96% sensitivity) and 139 yellow notifications (99% sensitivity). These results demonstrated the ivWatch Model 400 is highly sensitive

to infiltr ated PIV sites on the hands and forearms of adults while having a false notification rate 
that should have negligible effects on clinical alarm fatigue.  
Three additional IRB -approved studies were performed to (1) examine the infiltration detection 
performa nce as a function of the distance separating the catheter tip and ivWatch sensor, (2) 
examine the infiltration detection performance when the sensor is placed above and below a 
transparent occlusive dressing, and (3) examine the false notification rate when the sensor is placed above a transparent occlusive dressing.  
After the FDA clearance for ages 18 and up, an IRB -approved clinical study was conducted to 
measure the performance of the ivWatch Model 400 device for detecting early stage infiltrations on pediatric patients at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Hospitalized pediatric patients under the age of 18 who received continuous IV therapy were monitored with the device. The study was broken into two groups, 156 subjects in a blinded non -alarming group, and 57 
subjects in an alarming group. The objectives of the study were to determine the amount of time between infiltration detection by the clinician and the device as well as the device sensitivity and specificity. Each site was continuousl y monitored during IV therapy and the IV was terminated if 
an infiltration was detected or other complications were identified. In the nonalarming group, the device issued red “Check IV” notifications a median time of 15.2 hours before clinician detection.  
The device issued notifications for 18 out of 23 clinician -confirmed infiltrations in the non -alarming 
group, for a sensitivity of 78.3%. In the alarming group, the device issued notifications for 12 out of 15 clinician -confirmed infiltrations. The result s from this study were used to support the FDA 
clearance for all age groups including pediatrics in December of 2016.  
ivWatch SmartTouch Sensor Clinical Study Plan  
A series of new clinical studies are taking  place to test  feasibility  as well as to  verify and validate 
the SmartTouch sensor in a similar way to the Model 400.  Two feasibility studies were  completed 
to examine  the ‘alpha’ design of the SmartTouch sensor in terms of  (1) infiltration signal 
performance and (2) false notification rate of the Smar tTouch sensor  (Table 3). These studies have 
indicated the optical design of the alpha SmartTouch sensor performs equivalently to the Model 
400 fiber optic sensor.  Four verification  studies were  performed to test the ‘beta’  SmartTouch 
design and show equiva lence to the Model 400 in terms of (1) device sensitivity and (2) false 
notification rate.  The beta SmartTouch design contains the same optical sensor as alpha, but 
improvements were  made to the sensor for increased durability  and manufacturability . Signal  
data from the se verification studies may be used to improve signal processing algorithms prior to 
final software design.   
This clinical protocol is the validation study that will examine the infiltration sensitivity performance 
of the ivWatch SmartTouch sensor versus the Model 400 fiber optic sensor. This study is modeled 
after the clinical protocol used to validate the Model 400 system, Device Validation for Infiltrated Tissues (Table 2). The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a statistical ly significant 
improvement for detecting early stage infiltrations in comparison to hourly observation by a perfect clinician , the current clinical standard . The secondary objectives are to demonstrate 
statistical equivalence in (1) infiltration detection volume and (2) infiltration sensitivity of the SmartTouch and Fiber Optic sensors.

Infiltration Detection by the Perfect Clinician  
To be an effective product, the ivWatch sensors must detect early stage infiltrations significantly 
better than the current n ursing standard of care. To facilitate this comparison and provide 
conservative estimates of the device performance, the idea of a perfect clinician is used, that is, a clinician who assesses the IV site hourly and perfectly classifies the IV site as norma l or infiltrated, 
regardless of how much fluid has been infiltrated into the tissue.  
The primary metric used to compare the performance of the ivWatch device with the perfect clinician is the early infiltration sensitivity. The infiltration sensitivity is the percentage of early stage 
infiltrations (<10mL) detected by the ivWatch device or the perfect clinician. For the ivWatch device, the infiltration sensitivity is the ratio of the sites that generate a red alarm to the total number of monitored sites. For the perfect clinician, the infiltration has the same probability of occurring at any time between clinical assessments. Consequently, the percentage of infiltrations detected by the perfect clinician prior to 10mL of infiltrated volume is given by  
S
𝐶𝐶= min ( 100% ,𝑉𝑉𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝑅𝑅∙𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶∗100% ) 
where V lim (mL) is the 10mL volume limit, R (mL/hr) is the infiltration rate, and T C is the observation 
period (hr). For example, at 100 mL/hr (R=100), the perfect clinician making hourly assessments (T
C=1) of the site would be expected to detect 10% ( Clinician Sensitivity = SC) of the infiltrations 
prior to 10mL (V lim=10).  
Figure 3 illustrates the infiltration sensitivity of a perfect clinician for different infiltration rates and 
observation periods. A highlighted box indicates common adult infusion rates. The performance of the perfect clinician is limited by how frequently the site can be assessed. If the perfect clinician could monit or the site continuously (observation period = 0), the clinician’s infiltration sensitivity 
would be perfect.

Figure 3. The sensitivity of a perfect clinician for identifying early infiltrations (infiltrated volume < 
10mL).  
The f requency of IV site assessments can vary significantly in practice depending on the clinician’s 
workload and the perceived risks to the patient. Table 1 includes the assessment frequency 
recommended in a position paper published by the Infusion Nurses Society  [10]. Discussions with 
clinicians suggest most peripheral IV sites are checked either once per hour or less frequently. As 
described later, the primary statistica l objective in this validation study was performed assuming 
hourly observation by a perfect clinician.  
Table 1. The recommended site assessment frequency by the Infusion Nurses Society.  
Assessment Frequency  Description  
At least every 4 hours  • Patients who are receiving nonirritant/nonvesicant 
infusions and who are alert and oriented and who are 
able to notify the nurse of any signs of problems such as

Study Goals and Objectives  
The goal of this study is to validate the performance of the ivWatch SmartTouch sensor for 
detecting the early stages of an IV infiltration, as collected from healthy adult volunteers. The Model 400 Fiber Optic sensor is used for performance comparison. The study objectives include:  
Primary Objective : Demonstrate a statistically signi ficant improvement for detecting early stage 
infiltrations in comparison to hourly observation by a perfect clinician.  
Secondary Objectives : 
1. Demonstrate statistical equivalence in infiltration detection volume of the SmartTouch and Fiber Optic sensors.  
2. Dem onstrate statistical equivalence in infiltration sensitivity of the SmartTouch and Fiber 
Optic sensors.  
Study Design 
Approximately 115 subjects may be enrolled in the study with the goal of achieving 98 accepted 
case studies . The study coordinator will attempt to enroll at least 20 subjects (20%) with dark skin 
pigmentation and at least 20 subjects (20%) who are classified as obese by their body mass index 
(BMI) , but these are not required enrollment criteria as skin pigmentation and BMI have proven to 
be insignificant variables in previous ivWatch studies . The intent is to include subjects with different 
skin pigmentations and body types such that the study represents the intended population of the device. The duration of each study depends on the random ly selected infiltration rates. A study 
may take up to 2 hours to complete. This corresponds to the subjects receiving the 5mL/hr 
infiltration rate.  
Medical professionals  will be used for the health screening of the subject and placement of the 
catheters.  If the research subject is deemed acceptable for the study, various metrics of each 
subject will be measured, as summarized in Figure 4. These measur ements include the weight, 
height, blood pressure, forearm circumference, skin tone (light, medium, or dark), and skin 
classification. The skin classification is performed by using the subject pigmentation worksheet to determine the subject’s Fitzpatrick s kin type. The subject’s body mass index is calculated from the 
weight and height measurements and is used as a measure of the subject’s body type (underweight, normal, overweight, obese). These metrics are recorded for post -study analysis to 
identify corre lations between the measured signal and anatomical/physiological characteristics 
of the research subjects.

Figure 4. Pre-study measurements performed on each subject.  
After completing the informed consent and health history forms, the subject is taken to the test 
room, which is designed to approximate an infusion center . The room also includes two IV pumps 
and two ivWatch patient monitors per subject . The study configur ations have been randomized 
and are included in  Table 4.  
During the study, each subject will receive two subcutaneous injections of isotonic saline solution. These injections will be randomly selected from the four possible locations shown in Figure 5. These 
four locations represent the most common injection sites for PIV therapy. The subcutaneous injections closely approximate the conditions of a PIV infiltration without exposing the research subject to additional risks and discomforts associated with puncturing a vein (e.g. ecchymosis, 
hematoma, phlebitis, thrombosis, embolism). The subcutaneous injections will be performed using the same equipment as a PIV procedure.

All subcutaneous injections in this research protocol are infiltrated between 5mL/hr and 150mL/hr, 
as listed in  Table 4. Each injection is limited to a total of 10 mL of saline solution to minimize subject 
discomfort. This 10mL volume limit corresponds to a 2 hour infiltration at the 5 mL/hr IV pump rate 
and a 4 minute infiltration at the 150mL/hr IV pump rate.  
The nurse will examine each site before placing the IV catheters. Photographs of the illumination 
by a NIR vein viewer will be captured as a record o f the subject’s vascular structure at the site. 
The nurse will place the IV catheters at approximately the same anatomical location on each arm. The catheter depth will be monitored and recorded using the SonoSite S -Series ultrasound 
imaging system, shown in Figure 6. The nurse places the catheter immediately adjacent to a vein 
typically used for IV therapy. Placing the catheter tip close to the vein wall ensures the saline diffuses similar to a real -world infiltration.  
 
Figure 6. The Sonosite S -Series commercial ultrasound imaging system.  
After placement of the catheter, each subject will receive the SmartTouch sensor on one side and 
the Model 400 fiber optic sensor on the other side according to the random study configuration. 
The sensor is placed next to the injection site. An example of the ivWatch SmartTouch sensor is 
shown in Figure 7. The nurse will dress the site using standard hospital procedures and occlusive 
dressings. Photographs will be captured to record the position of the sensor with respect to the catheter. The sensor cable will be taped to the IV tubing and rout ed to the IV pole. The IV tubing 
/ ivWatch sensor cable bundle will be secured to the subject using medical tape following standard hospital procedures.

Figure 7. Example of the ivWatch SmartTouch sensor  
 
The sensor is connected to the IPM . A rendering of the patient monitor is included in Figure 8. The  
rendering identifies the user interface elements on the front face of the IPM. The IPM is attached 
to the IV pole. The IPM records data during the study and is attached to the IV pole.  
Once the ivWatch sensors have been placed on the subject, data acquisition will be started on 
the two ivWatch patient monitors. This represents t ime zero (t = 0) in the study. Study staff will record 
the timing of study events (starting and stopping IPMs, starting and stopping pumps) using a digital 
wall clock.  The pumps will be turned on after 5 minutes of monitoring. The IV pumps will stop after 
10mL of isotonic saline solution has been injected into the tissue. Once the pumps have been 
stopped for both sites, the IPMs will collect data for an additional 5 minutes.  
Once the data acquisition is complete, the research assistant  captures photographs of the two 
sites to record the visual appearance of the region. The ivWatch components are removed from 
the sites. An ultrasound technician will then capture ultrasound images of the sites to record 
structure of the infiltrated tissue under the sensor and measure catheter depth . The IV’s are then 
removed from the research subject. A final photograph is captured of the bare sites. The photographs are intended to record the skin integrity, such as whether the research subject had an allergic reaction to any m aterials or if the skin was damaged when removing adhesive- backed 
sensors.  
ivWatch, LLC believes this study design provides the signal characteristics that are representative of those expected in a clinical setting. This data will enable the researchers to  understand 
differences, if any, between the optical signal characteristics of infiltrated tissue data collected with the SmartTouch sensor versus the Model 400 sensor.

Methodology  
Subject Recruitment 
Previous  research participants of ivWatch clinical studies will be recruited to participate in the 
study. Advertisements are not needed to obtain the number of accepted case studies. The study 
will be limited to healthy adult volunteers (18 years or older). During  the initial recruitment,  
interested participants will be provided an overview of the study and an initial pre- screen will be 
completed. If eligibility is unclear during the pre-screening process, the registered nurse can 
consult the chief nursing officer or  investigator to determine eligibility. The pre -screening form is

included on page 42. If the participant is interested in the study, 18 years or older, and deemed 
an acce ptable research subject, a time and date for the study will be scheduled with the subject. 
The formal consent and screening process will be performed on the day of the study, as described 
in the following section.  
Preliminary Information and Consent 
The pr e-study procedure is listed in detail on p age 46. Once arriving at the study site, the subject 
fills out a sign -in sheet indicating their name and the time of their arrival. The subject is then taken 
to a private screening room. A research assistant will w elcome the subject and provide the 
informed consent document. The research assistant  will discuss the main points of the study  and 
the subject’s rights, as described in the consent form.  
If the subject understand s and signs the consent form, the subject wi ll be asked to fill out a  
participant health history form. The purpose of the health history form is to prevent potentially sick 
or unhealthy subjects from participating in the trial.  Each subject must complete the health and 
consent forms before participating in the study.  As part of the health history form, the nurse  will 
measure the body  temperature of the subject with the goal of preventing sick individuals from 
participating in th e study.  
The nurse  reviews the subject’s health report form to determine if the subject qualifies for the study. 
A list of exclusion criteria is included in Table 5. Any additional concerns or questions will be 
directed to the on -staff chief nursing officer and/or medical doctor. They  may use their  
professional judgment to exclude a subject for reasons not included in this list of exclusion criteria.

The data collection checklist is included on page  47. The data collection consists of three 
processes: (1) subject preparation, (2) data collection, and (3) study completion.  
Subject Preparation  
Once the preliminary information is collected, the subject will be taken to the test area. The nurse and ultrasound tech will perform hand hygiene and put on latex -free medical -grade gloves. Each 
subject has two injection sites. The sites are prepared using the same procedure, except one site 
will use the SmartTouch  sensor and one site will use the fiber optic sensor . The nurse and research 
assistant  will examine the potential sites. A photograph of the VeinViewer illumination will be 
captured as a record o f the vascular structure at the site. A second photograph will be captured 
of the bare site where the injection will occur. This photograph will be compared to a post -study 
photograph to see if there is any skin irritation associated with the ivWatch senso r. The filenames 
of these photographs are recorded in Section 7 of the case report form.  
Using protocols based on hospital procedures, the nurse cleans the site with a CHG swabstick for 30 seconds and allows to air dry for 30 seconds. The nurse inserts the  catheter next to a vein that 
would typically be used for a PIV therapy. Once the insertion is complete, a shallow high -resolution  
ultrasound image of the catheter and surrounding tissue is captured. The image should show as much of the catheter length as possible, while also including the catheter tip. The depth of the catheter tip relative to the skin surface is measured and the corresponding image is saved. The ultrasound image File ID and the measured depth are recorded in the case report form.  
The nurs e places the ivWatch sensor  within 5 mm  of the approximate location of the catheter tip. 
After sensor and occlusive dressing placement, the sensor cable and IV tubing are secured to the subject’s arm using medical tape.  
Once complete, the research assistan t will capture a photograph of the dressed site. This 
photograph can be used to measure the separation between the catheter tip and the ivWatch sensor in a post study analysis. The nurse will measure the circumference of each site. The photograph file ID a nd circumference are recorded in the case report form.

CONFIDENTIAL  26 of 58 
Data Collection 
After both sites have been set up, the nurse will start the data acquisition  on the ivWatch patient 
monitors (t=0). A digital clock is used to record the ivWatch acquisition and infiltr ation start times. 
The acquisition start times are recorded in the case report form. The IPMs collect data for 5 minutes.  
After the normal acquisition period is complete, the IV pumps are started at their specified rate 
(either 5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, or 150 mL/hr). The pumps will stop automatically after a total of 10mL of isotonic saline is pumped into the subcutaneous tis sue. The stop times will be recorded in the 
case report form. The data acquisition will be stopped on the two IPMs five minutes after the slower of the two infiltrations is complete. The research assistant  will record the times of these actions in 
Section 8 of the case report form.  
 
End of Study  
Once the ivWatch data acquisition is complete, additional data is recorded from both sites. First, a post study circumference measurement of the site is performed by the nurse and recorded in the case report form. Then, a photograph is captured of the injection site as a record of the visual swelling. The file identification information of this photogra ph is recorded in the case report form.  
The occlusive dressing and ivWatch sensor are carefully removed from the injection site without pulling out the catheter. The research assistant  captures a photograph of the VeinViewer 
illumination and records the photo ID in the case report form. A series of ultrasound images are captured to record the state of the tissue under the sensor. The file identification information for the ultrasound image is recorded in the case report form. Once the ultrasound imaging is  
complete, the catheter is removed. Light pressure is applied if there is any bleeding (usually there is no bleeding since this is a subcutaneous injection). A final photograph is captured of the site as a record of skin integrity and whether the ivWatch sensor caused any irritation to the skin. An adhesive bandage is applied to the site.  
Once this procedure has been completed for both sites, the research assistant  completes the 
remaining sections of the case report form, which include areas for adding misc ellaneous notes, 
a description of any device deficiencies/malfunctions  that occurred , a description of any adverse 
events  that occurred , and an area for an investigator  to authorize the case report form.  Once the 
case report form is complete, the subject i s taken to the front reception desk and given the 
participation payment. The subject is asked to sign and date a check- out sheet to verify receipt 
of payment. A copy of their informed consent form with c ontact information will be given to the 
subject should they have any questions or concerns after departing ivWatch.  
The research assistant  is responsible for cleaning and re- organizing the test area after the subject 
has departed. This includes removing tape connecting the IV tubing to the ivWatch sensor, disposing the used IV tubing, and cleaning the ivWatch sensor and monitor with hospital -grade 
disinfectant wipes. Data saved during the study will be removed from the corresponding machines and saved to a secure network server. The data includes IPM data (tr ansferred via USB 
drive), ultrasound images (transferred via USB drive), and camera images.

The research assistant  will store all paperwork from the study (case report forms, subject 
pigmentation forms) in a manila folder in a secure location. All paperwor k containing private 
health information is given to the HIPAA officer  or designee  for separate and secure storage.  
Data Analysis 
After the study is complete, a series of analyses will be performed on the collected ivWatch data. 
Specific statistical tests and rationale are included in the Statistical Considerations section of this protocol (page 31).  
Possible reasons a study may be rejected include, but are not limited to:  
1. Equipment (infusion pump, catheter, patient monitor) not operating properly. 
2. Leaking catheter or IV site.  
3. Early termination by research subject.  
4. Sensor placement more than 2 cm from the catheter tip.  
5. Significant deviations from research protocol.  
All data analyses will be independently reviewed and verified by a second researcher.  
Risk Ben efit Analysis  
Injection of Isotonic Saline 
The study design is considered to have minimal risk to the healthy adult volunteers participating in this study. Previous studies have generated infiltrations by intentionally pushing the needle through the vein w all into the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. The placement of the needle into the vein 
introduces additional risks such as ecchymosis, hematoma, phlebitis, thrombosis, and embolism. This study generates an infiltration by performing subcutaneous injections of isotonic saline solution. This method of generating infiltrations is believed to be much safer for the research subject, including being less painful than puncturing a vein wall.  
The most likely complication associated with subcutaneous injections wou ld be an infection. The 
risk of an infection is reduced by (1) only enrolling healthy adult volunteers (that is, subjects are not immunocompromised) and (2) using safe procedures based on standard hospital practices (PIV therapy) and medical -grade sterile materials (e.g. ultrasound gel, occlusive dressing). 
Another complication could include hitting a nerve causing significant pain for the subject. This risk is minimized by using an experienced nurse to perform the injections at common sites for PIV therapy . 
A registered nurse or physician  with significant PIV therapy experience will perform all of the 
injections and will be onsite throughout the study. ivWatch, LLC has two medical doctors available 
by phone  should any medical related questions arise during a study. 
Infusion of saline solution into the subcutaneous tissue does not pose a significant risk to the study subjects. Hypodermoclysis is a common medical practice of injecting saline into subcutaneous tissues for treatment or prevention of dehydration. This is typically used for elderly patients. Hypodermoclysis is performed on a variety of sites including back, abdomen, and upper regions 
IVW-CLR-CS27- 400 ivWatch SmartTouch Sensor:  
Device Validation  for Infiltrated Tissues  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  28 of 58 
of the arms and legs. Pump rates range from 20 to 125mL/hr with a total delivered volume less 
than 1500mL in a 24 hour period  [10]. In comparison to the hypodermoclysis procedure, the study’s 
10mL maximum volume and 5 to 150 mL /hr flow rates of 0.9% saline do not pose a significant 
health risk to the study subjects.  
The ivWatch Technology 
The ivWatch technology is a non- signifi cant risk device as determined by the FDA. In a face -to-
face meeting with the FDA on March 28, 2014, the FDA classified the ivWatch Model 400 as a Class II, NSR device. The ivWatch Model 400 has received marketing clearance from the FDA for adults and pediatrics . Earl y prototypes  of the Model 400  were evaluated in previous clinical studies with 
IRB approval. A list of these studies is included in  Table 6. 
The electronic  sensor is designed to perform identically to the Model 400 fiber optic sensor.  The 
materials used for the electronic sensor are common medical grade materials and are generally 
regarded as safe. The amount of LED light emitted by the sensor into the patient’s skin is significantly less than the maximum permissible ocular and skin exposures published in the ANSI Z136.1 Laser safety standard. To our knowledge, there is no standard regulating the safety of LED emitting products, so the laser safety standard h as been used to demonstrate the safety of the 
emitted optical powers.  The amount of heat generated by the LEDs in the sensor head is much 
lower than conventional pulse oximeters, due to a low duty cycle and optical power, as well as an optimized photodiode  amplification circuit.

Follow -Up 
There is no anticipated need for a follow -up protocol after this study. Prior to departure, the 
research personnel will provide the subject  with contact information should they have any 
questions or concerns after leaving the study.  
Data Management and Statistical Considerations  
Data Management 
The data management process includes recording data during the study, transferring data to a 
secure electronic database, and data validation. 
Five forms of data are recorded during each study: 
1. Information on the health of the study subject is recorded in the health history form. This form is provided in the Participant Health History Form section of thi s document. This form 
is completed by the subject prior to the study. The form requests only information relevant to the study. The health history form is stored in a locked filing cabinet at the ivWatch facility.  
2. Study -related information is recorded usin g the study’s case report form ( including the 
subject activity log ). The case report form includes study information (gender , age, body 
measurements, skin classification, product serial numbers, times, and filenames).  
This form is completed by the researc h assistant  during the study. The case report form 
does not include any personal identifiers. The original forms are stored at the ivWatch facility.  
3. The ivWatch data is recorded using the investigational device that store the data 
internally. The filename does not contain any personal identifiers.  
4. The ultrasound images are saved to the ultrasound machine during the study. The filename does not contain any personal identifiers.  
5. Digital photographs and video images are recorded throughout the study . The filenames 
do not contain personal identifiers although the subjects may be identifiable in the images. The informed consent form discloses the collection of photographic images and 
video recordings . 
Once a study is complete, the case report form data, the ivWatch data, ultrasound images, and 
camera images are transferred to an electronic database. The ultrasound and photographic images are deleted from the ultrasound machine and digital camera, respectively. The database 
IVW-CLR-CS27- 400 ivWatch SmartTouch Sensor:  
Device Validation  for Infiltrated Tissues  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  31 of 58 
has been designed such that no perso nal identifiers are available to match a study dataset with 
a particular subject. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data, the password -
protected database can only be accessed by authorized users. The privileges of each authorized 
user are  set by the database administrator. All changes made to the database are recorded in 
an audit log. The log includes (but is not limited to) which fields were changed and which user made the changes. This audit trail is necessary for data integrity as well as meeting regulatory guidelines. Double data entry by two people is used to verify that data is correctly entered into the database. After validation is complete, the database will be available to the authorized users.  
Statistical Considerations 
The goal of this study is to validate the performance of the ivWatch SmartTouch sensor for detecting the early stages of an IV infiltration, as collected from healthy adult volunteers. The Model 400 Fiber Optic sensor is used for performance comparison. The study o bjectives include:  
Primary Objective : Demonstrate a statistically significant improvement for detecting early stage 
infiltrations in comparison to hourly observation by a perfect clinician.  
Secondary Objectives : 
1. Demonstrate statistical equivalence in infiltration detection volume of the SmartTouch and Fiber Optic sensors.  
2. Demonstrate statistical equivalence in infiltration sensitivity of the SmartTouch and Fiber Optic sensors.  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the sensitivity for early stage infiltrations compared to the current nursing standard of care, where the performance of the current nursing standard is estimated using the concept of a perfect clinician. The perfect clinician assesses the IV site hourly and perfectly classifies the tissue as normal or infiltrated 
regardless of the volume of fluid that has been infiltrated.  The performance of the perfect clinician can be theoretically calculated. For the study configuration listed in Ta ble 7, the perfect clinician 
would capture 28.2% of the infiltrations prior to an infiltrated volume of 10mL.

A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to evaluate the hypothesis test comparing the perfect 
clinician (H 0) and a device with a sensitivity of 90% (H 1). The 90% sensitivity is a conservative 
assumption based on sensi tivities measured in previous ivWatch studies . A total of one million trials 
were simulated using the study con figuration shown in Table 7.  The infiltration detection times for 
the perfect clinician were uniformly distributed between 0 and 60 minutes. The perfect clinician provided early detection of an infiltration if the detection time was less than the time req uired to 
infiltrate 10mL at the given rate. The simulation code is included in the Statistical Monte Carlo 
Analysis Appendix (page 56) . Figure 9 shows the results of the Monte Carlo analysis. A threshold of 
35% corresponded to an alpha of 0.04 1 (0.05 was not possible due to the discrete nature of the 
sampled sensitivities), that is, 95. 9% of the null hypothesis trials (perfect clinician) had sensitivitie s 
less than 35%.  
 
Figure 9. The Monte Carlo simulation of a device operating with an infiltration sensitivity 
equivalent to the perfect clinician (null hypothesis) and a device operating at a 90% sensitivity 
(alternative hypothesis). The red line shows the location of α=0.04 1 thresh old (one -sided).  
Figure 10 shows the statistical power analysis for this Monte Carlo simulation. A statistical power 
exceeding 90% was calculated for ivWatch device sensitivities greater than 4 2%. For the specific 
alternative hypothesis of 90% sensitivity, the statistical power was estimated to be essentially 100%. A sample size of 98 is assumed in this simulation, which is based on the detection volume  
comparison objective. In addition to the large statistical power, a sample size of 98 also provides 
a reasonable confidence interval on our estimated sensitivity. For a sensitivity of 9 1% (89/98) , the 
95% confidence interval would be 0.83 to 0.96 .

The hypothesis test for a binomial distribution will be performed following the study to ensure the 
measured sensitivities of both sensors are significantly greater (alpha = 0.05) than the perfect 
clinician.  
Secondary Objectives  
Detection Volume Comparison  
The first secondary objective is to demonstrate equivalent detection volume between the SmartTouch (ST) and Fiber Optic (FO) sensor. In the clinical study ivWatch Model 400: Validation 
for Infiltrated Tissues  (FO sensor), where the same infusion rate confi guration from Table 7 was 
implemented, the mean and standard deviation detection volume was found to be in 3.75 mL ±2.13 mL. In order to test if the mean detection volume for the ST sensor ( μ
ST) is less than or equal 
to  the mean detection volume of the FO  sensor ( μFO) with a margin of error ( Δ0), the following 
single -sided hypothesis test configuration is used:  
Null Hypothesis ( H0): μFO- μST = Δ 0 
Alternative Hypothesis (H 1): μFO- μST > Δ0 
The sample size (n) needed to show equivalence is defined by the fol lowing equation:  
𝑛𝑛=(𝑧𝑧𝛼𝛼+𝑧𝑧𝛽𝛽)2(𝜎𝜎𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹2+𝜎𝜎𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆2)
(∆−∆0)2 
where Δ is the difference in means (μ FO - μST), and σ the standard deviation of each sensor. The 
σST is estimated to be equal to σ FO. The margin of error (Δ 0) is assumed to be 1.0 mL, which is less 
than half of the standard deviation. An analysis of statistical power versus sample size is shown in Figure 11, (alpha = 0.05). A sample size of 98 subjects will provide a statistical power of 95%. Sample

size for t his clinical study is based on this objective. Following the study a single -sided student’s t -
test will be used to compare the sensor detection volumes.  
 
Figure 11. Statistical power vs sample size for detection volume comparison  
Sensitivity Comparison  
Approximate confidence intervals for the difference in sensor sensitivities (p FO – p ST) will be found 
using the following equation:  
𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹−𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆−𝑧𝑧𝛼𝛼�𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹(1−𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹)
𝑛𝑛𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+ 𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(1−𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)
𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ≤ 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹−𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆≤ 𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹−𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆+𝑧𝑧𝛼𝛼�𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹(1−𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹)
𝑛𝑛𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+ 𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(1−𝑝𝑝𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)
𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 
In order for the ST sensor to be equivalent (≥) the FO sensor, the lower bound of the confidence 
interval should be < 0. Figure 12 illustrates a range of possible confidence intervals in a study with 
nFO = n ST = 98, an d a p FO = 96%. In this case, if the ST sensitivity (p ST) is 89% or lower, the lower 
confidence interval is greater than zero, and the ST sensitivity would be considered significantly less than the FO sensitivity.

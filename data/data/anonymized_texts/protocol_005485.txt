Title of Study:   A Randomized, Do uble-blind, Placebo -Controlled Phase II Study to Evaluate the 
Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacoki netics of ARGX -113 in Patients with Myasthenia 
Gravis who have Generalized Muscle W eakness 
Protocol No:   ARGX-113-1602 
Study site s:  This study will be con ducted in up t o 25 sites. 
Study duration: The study duration for each patient is 13 weeks. It 
consists of a Screening  period of 15 days, a 3 week Treatment period , 
and an 8 week Follow -up (FU) period. Phase: II 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives: 
• To evaluate the safety an d tolerability of ARGX -113. 
Secondary Objectives : 
• To evaluate the clinical effect  of ARGX -113 using: 
o Myasthenia Gravis -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) score . 
o Quantitative -Myasthenia Gravis score (QMG) . 
o Myasthenia Gravis  Composite  score (MGC). 
• To evaluate the impact of ARGX- 113 on quality of life using 15-item quality of life scale for 
Myasthenia Gravis ( MGQoL15r [revised version] ). 
• To investigate  the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARGX -113. 
• To assess the pharmacodynam ic (PD) markers (e. g., total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and subtypes , 
anti-acetylcholine receptor [ AChR] antibodies ). 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of ARGX -113. 
Methodology:  This is a ra ndomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , multicenter  Phase II study to 
evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ARGX -113 for the treatment of autoimmune 
Myasthenia Gravis (MG) with generalized muscle weakness . 
Approximately 24  patients will be randomized.  
The study will include a Screening period of maximum 15 days, a Treatment period of 3  weeks from 
Visit 1 to Visit 7 and a Follow-Up (FU) period of 8 weeks starting after completion of Visit  7 to Visit 16. 
Although the FU period is from Visit  8 to Visit 16, the FU in fact starts immediately after the last 
Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP) infusion at Visit 7. 
During the Screening Period , patients’ eligibility will be evaluated for study participation.  
During the Treatment period, eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive ARGX -113 
(10 mg/kg) or placebo in 4 infusions administered one week apart in addition to Standard of Care (SoC).  
The total dose per IMP infusion is capped at 1200 mg for patients with b ody weight ≥ 120  kg. 
Patients will receive ARGX -113 or placebo according to the following regimen:  
• Patients will receive ARGX -113 or matching placebo via intravenous (IV) infusion over a 
period of 2 hours on Days 1  (Visit 1), 8±1 (Visit 3), 15±1 (Visit 5), and 22±1 (Visit 7). 
• The Treatment period consists of 7 visits (of which the 3 visits between the weekly dosing 
visits are optional).  
At the end of the 3 weeks Treatment period, the patient will enter  a FU period for 8 weeks. 
During the FU period, 9  visits (of which 1 visit is optional) will take place as detailed in  Table 1. 
Study procedures including e ndpoint assessments will be performed  according to the Schedule of

2016-11-28 Confidential 7 Assessments as detailed in  Table 1. 
In this study, SoC for a patient is the stable dose and administration of their M G treatment prior to 
enrollment. Permitted SoC for MG treatment under this protocol include  azathioprine (AZA), other 
non-steroidal immu nosuppressant drugs (NSIDs: e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide), steroids, as wel l as cholinesterase  inhibitors . Patients 
should be on a stable dose and frequency  of SoC prior to enroll ment as detailed in of Section 5.3.1 
(Criterion 5 ) that should be maintained througho ut the study without any increase or decrease. 
Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors will be required to be on a stable dose for >2  weeks prior  to 
Screening . In addition, cholinesterase inhibitors must be held for at least 12 hours consistent with the 
revised manual for the QMG test as recommended by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Inc 
[MGFA]1, prior to performing the MGQoL15r, M G-ADL, QMG, and MGC assessments  at Screening, 
Visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,  10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 . 
During the study, no changes in the dose level and frequency of ARGX -113 or the SoC will be allowed. 
However, if necessary, patients may receive r escue therapy if their MG deteriorates as judged by the 
Investigator  on the basis of parameters such as changes in MG QoL15r, MG-ADL, QMG, MGC on any 
study day . 
Rescue the rapy will be determined by the Investigator based on an overall clinical assessment . Rescue 
therapy may include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg ), plasma exchange ( PE), or any other treatment 
chosen by the Investigator . In case a patient need s rescue therapy according to the treating Investigator, the 
Medical Director at the Sponsor should be informed  in addition to the  Medical Monitor  at the Sponsor’s 
designated contract research organization (CRO, Quintiles) ; where possible prior to actual implementation 
of the rescue therapy. In case rescue therapy is needed (due to deterioration of MG) , patients will be 
discontinued from  treatment with IMP, but will be followed up for safety . Any patient who discontinues 
study treatment due to safety concerns will be followed up for safety and wherever possible for efficacy. 
For patients who  discontinue the study  early, all the procedures listed for Early Discontinuation (ED) visit 
(same procedures as for the End -of-Study [EoS] visit or Visit 16) in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) 
are to be performed (early discontinuati on). This study is exploratory and not powered to a ddress any pre -
defined hypothesi s. The safety and efficacy analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which 
includes all patients who re ceived at least one infusion of ARGX -113 or placebo . 
Planned number of P atients: Approximately 36  patients will be screened in order to randomize 
approximately 24 patients (12  patients per tr eatment arm) to get at least 
20 patients who received at least 3  doses of IMP  (either ARGX -113 or 
placebo) and who completed at least 2  weeks of follow -up post last dose  
(See Appendix 14.6 ). Patients may be replaced in certain circumstances  
(See Section 5.3.6 and Table 2). Final decision for replacement of 
patients will be done on a case -by-case basis in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor  at the Sponsor’s designated contract research 
organization (CRO, Quintiles) and/or the  Medical Director  at the 
Sponsor’s end.

Test product, dose and mode 
of admini stration: In this study, t he Investigational Medicinal Product is ARGX-113 which 
is a human anti -neonatal Fc receptor Ig G1 Fc fragment with immune 
modulating properties. A dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight of 
ARGX-113 will be administered as an  intravenous  (IV) infusion over a 
period of 2 hours at Visits  1, 3, 5, and 7. The total dose per IMP 
infusion is capped at 1200  mg for patients with body weight ≥ 120  kg. 
Placebo, dose, and mode of 
administration:  Matching placebo with same buffer components but without the active 
ingredient will be administered intravenously over a period of 2 hours at 
Visits 1, 3, 5, and 7 . 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary Endpoint: 
• Evaluate the incidence and severity of adver se events (AEs) and serious AEs  (SAEs). 
• Evaluate vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and l aboratory assessments . 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Score change from B aseline (defined as the score  immediately prior to first dose at Visit  1) at 
Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16  for the following:  
o MG-ADL 
o QMG 
o MGC 
o MGQoL15r 
• Maximum reduction from Baseline across  visit days for MG-ADL, QMG, MGC, and MGQoL15 r 
score. 
• Pharmacokinetic  parameters of ARGX -113 including maximum observed concentration (C max), 
time of maximum concentration (t max), concentration prior to dosing (C trough), half-life, (t 1/2,λz), and 
accumulation ratio (R ac). 
• Evaluation  of PD markers: t otal IgG (and subtypes) and anti-AChR antibodies . 
• Evaluate the incidence of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) to ARGX -113. 
• Exploratory  pharmacogenetic assessments in patients who sign a separate pharmacogenetic ICF to 
examine FcRn polymorphisms . 
Statistical methods:  For the primary objective of safety and toler ability, AEs, SAEs, vital signs , ECGs 
and clinical laboratory assessments at specific time points will be evaluated. All safety data will be 
summarized descriptively. Baseline will be the last assessment before the first dose of the I MP. Number 
and percent age of AEs will be pre sented for each treatment by Preferred T erm (PT) and System Organ 
Class (SOC) of the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA)  dictionary. 
Individual listings of a ll serious AEs and discontinuati on from IMP will be summarized usin g the current 
MedDRA dictionary . 
For the secondary objective of clinical effect, the change from B aseline will be eva luated. Actual and 
change in data from B aseline will be summarized descriptively for each treatment by visits.  For change 
from Baseline, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used for continuous variables; (unless otherwise specified) with the terms of treatment as fixed effects and Baseline value as covariate in the model. All 
tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a two -sided alpha level of 0.05 or with 2- sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). No inferential hypothesi s are tested in these secondary variables and summary 
statistics and CIs for these are not adjusted for multiplicity. The p -value if presented will not be considered 
for any inference. Analysis of Baseline characteristics will be summarized appropriately via descriptive statistics or visual presentation. For analysis of categorical data, Fisher’s exact test, Chi -squared test, or 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel ( CMH) test will be performed.

2016-11-28 Confidential 25 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
Myasthenia G ravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized in most cases by T cell 
and antibody responses to neuromuscular junction proteins such as ske letal muscle nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Antibodies against epitopes of the AChR of the 
neuromuscular junction cause failure of neuromuscular transmission, resulting in the 
characteristic fatigue and weakness associated with this severe disorder. The muscle 
weakness fluctuates with activity, and periods of rest offer only a temporary reprieve .3 
2.1 Background Information  
Antibodies, especially IgG, play a predominant role in the pathogenesis and the trea tment of 
many autoimmune diseases such as MG. In most cases, MG  is characterized by antibody 
responses to n euromuscular junction proteins such as skeletal muscle AChR . High-affinity, 
anti-AChR antibodies bind to the muscle endplate leading to AChR dysfunction or loss via 
activation of complement, cross-linking of AChR receptors, or direct blockade of 
acetylcholine (Ach) binding sites, thereby leading to an impaired signal transduction and 
resulting muscle weakness.4, 5 The disease is typically managed with acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors and immunosuppressive medications. Acute exacerbations are treated using either 
therapeutic plasma exchange (PE), immunoadsorption (IA) or intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIg). These  therapeutic opti ons, except  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, aim at reducing the 
levels of pathogenic autoantibodies but suffer from severe side effects and/or comorbidities.6 
In order to treat IgG -mediated autoimmunity, it would be beneficial to lower levels of 
pathogenic autoantibodies rapidly and sustainably . Antagonizing the neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn) could be a therapeutic approach to achieve this as FcRn is a m ultifunctional molecule 
primarily involved in IgG transport and homeostasis, that influences immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) serum levels and tissue distribution  at all stages of life.7, 8. Following IgG uptake by 
pinocytosis, the Fc part of IgGs binds FcRn with high affinity in early, acidic endosomes 
with pH <6.5. Through its ability to rescue IgG from destruction in the lysosomal 
compartment, FcRn is responsible for the main tenance of high concentrations of IgG in 
circulation and concomitantly for the long half-life of IgG compared to other Ig isotypes. 
Thus, targeting the FcRn-IgG interaction would be a rational therapeutic approach to rapidly 
clear pathogenic autoantibodies in IgG-driven autoimmune diseases such as MG.  
2.2 Investigational Medicinal Product 
ARGX-113 is a human IgG1-derived Fc fragment of the za allotype that binds with nanomolar affinity to human FcRn. ARGX-113 encompasses IgG1 residues D220-K447 (EU 
numbering scheme) and has been modified with the so- called ABDEG™ technology

2016-11-28 Confidential 26 (ABDEG™ = antibody that enhances IgG degradation )9 to increase its affinity for FcRn at 
both physiological and acidic pH. The increased affinity for FcRn of ARGX-113 at both 
acidic and physiological pH results in a constitutively blockage of FcRn-mediated recycling 
of IgGs. 
Given the essential role of the FcRn receptor in IgG homeostasis, inhibiting this FcRn 
function, as achieved by ARGX -113, leads to rapid degradation of endogenous IgGs, which 
is expected to include autoantibodies in IgG-driven autoimmune diseases. 
This concept has been validated in various murin e disease models together with 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies in cynom olgus monkeys, either by 
using ARGX-113 or a full- length mAb analogue (HEL- ABDEG™)10, 11 
In murine in vivo  disease models for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis a clear 
improvement in disease score was observed after treatment with an ABDEG™-equipped 
molecule. This improvement was accompanied  with systemic lowering of autoantibody 
levels. 
Pharmacokinetic and PD  studies in  cynomolgus monkey confirmed the antibody- clearing 
properties of ARGX -113 in a relevant animal model. A single infusion of ARGX-113 
resulted in a decrease of endogenous IgG up to 55% without altering serum albumin 
concentrations as well as IgM or IgA levels. This PD effect was proven to be more potent 
than IVIg, which is considered a standard of care therapy in MG, both in rapidity of onset as 
in depth of the PD effect . Repeated dosing could improve the PD effect up to a maximum  
IgG reduction of 75%. 
These pre -clinical data validated the further development of ARGX-113 for assessing its 
therapeutic potential in IgG -driven autoimmune indications. 
To this end, a Phase I dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers was initiated. In this study 
ARGX-113 was administered to healthy volunteers in single doses (up to 50 mg/kg) as well 
as multiple doses (up to 25 mg/kg). ARGX -113 was proven to be safe and tolerable in this 
healthy volunteer study a nd pre-clinical PD  parameters could be confirmed in a  human 
setting. 
The proposed Phase II study aims to further establish th e safety, efficacy, PK and PD of 
ARGX-113 in a patient setting, namely in patients with autoimmune MG with generalized 
muscle weakness,  and thereby validating the concept of autoantibody reduction as a 
therapeutic treatment modality in this indication.

2.3 Rationale  and Standard of Care 
The mainstays of MG  treatment are  AChE inhibitors, immunosuppressants and 
immunomodulating therapies. In the mild form of the disease, AC hE inhibitors are used 
initially. These agents include pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and edrophonium and their effectiveness varies widely. Patients wi th generalized MG  are treated with corticosteroids. 
Unfortunat ely, corticosteroids are typically characterized by  delayed onset of effects. 
Because of their multiple side effects, the lowest effective dose of corticosteroids is recommended for long-term treatment that is often indicated for chronic conditions such as 
MG. Other non-steroidal immunosuppressive (NS IDs) agents are commonly used and 
include azathioprine  (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and 
rituximab. However, the effectiveness of many of these medications varies widely among 
patients, take a long time to take effect and have numerous adverse consequences.
12 
Plasma exchange (PE) , immunoadsorption and IVIg are used for short- term treatment of MG  
exacerbations and when it is desirable to achieve a rapid clinical response. Plasma exchange temporarily reduces the concentrations of circulating anti- AChR antibodies and in most 
patients produces improvement in a matter of days. Typically, one exchange removing one to 
two plasma volumes is done every other day up to a total of four to six times, to improve muscle strength or ameliorate a myasthenic crisis. Unfortunately, this treatment is invasive 
and has common side- effects such as hypotension, paresthesia, infections, and thrombotic 
complications. IVIg is widely used for patients with exacerbating MG and data from 
randomized controlled studie s show efficacy similar to  PE. The mechanisms by which IVIg 
produce improvement ar e not clear, but two important possibilities are competition with 
autoantibodies (i.e., FcRn binding) and Fc receptor binding. It is important to note that a 
higher degree of auto- antibody reduction, faster onset and better clinical efficacy has been 
observed for PE and immunoadsorption when compared with IVIg. A fast onset is important 
for treatment of patients experiencing exacerbations.
13, 14 
In preclinical studies,  ARGX-113 demonstrated high potency and rapid onset of action in 
IgG autoantibody reduction. In murine in vivo  disease models, ARGX-113 demonstrated a 
high therapeutic potential linked to a rapid clearance of IgG autoantibodies. Studies in cynomolgus monke ys confirmed this rapid onset of IgG reduction, and demonstrated 
specificity of this effect as IgA, IgM, and albumin levels were not affected.

5.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter Phase II study to evaluate 
the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARGX-113 for the treatment  of 
autoimmune MG wit h generalized muscle weakness.  
Approximately 24 patients will be randomized. 
The study will include a Screening period of maximum 15 days, a Treatment period of 
3 weeks from Visit  1 to Visit 7 and a Follow-Up (FU) period of 8 weeks starting after 
completion of Visit 7 to Visit 16. Although the FU period is from Visit 8 to Visit 16, the FU 
in fact starts immediately after th e last Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP) infusion at 
Visit 7. 
During the Screening Period, patients’ eligibility will be evaluated for study participation. 
During the Treatment period, eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 
ARGX-113 (10 mg/kg) or placebo in 4 infusions administered one week apart in addition to 
Standard of Care (S oC). The total dose per IMP infusion is capped at 1200 mg for patients 
with body weight ≥ 120 kg. 
Patients will receive ARGX-113 or placebo according to the following regimen: 
• Patient will receive ARGX -113 or matching placebo via intravenous (IV) infusion 
over a period of 2 hours on Days 1 (Visit 1) , 8±1 (Visit 3) , 15±1 (Visit 5), and 
22±1 (Visit 7). 
• The Treatment period consists of 7 visits (of which the 3 visits between the weekly 
dosing visits are optional). 
At the end of the 3 weeks Treatment period, th e patient will enter a FU period for 8  weeks. 
During the Follow-Up period, 9 visits (of which 1 visit is optional) will take place as detailed in Table 1. 
Study procedures including endpoint assessments will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments as detailed in  Table 1. 
In this study, SoC for a patient is the stable dose and administration of their MG treatment 
prior to enrollment. Permitted SoC for MG treatment under this protocol include azathioprine

2016-11-28 Confidential 35 (AZA), other non-steroidal immunosuppressant drugs ( NSIDs: e.g., methotrexate, 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide) , steroids, as well 
as cholinesterase inhibitors. Patients should be on a stable dose and frequency of SoC prior to 
enrollment as detailed in of Section 5.3.1 (Criterion 5) that should be maintained throughout 
the study without any increase or decrease. 
Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors will be required to be on a stable dose for 
>2 weeks prior to Screening. In addition, cholinesterase inhibitors must be held for at least 
12 hours consistent with the revised manual for the QMG test as recommended by the 
Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Inc [MGFA]1, prior to performing the 
MGQoL15r, MG- ADL, QMG, and MGC assessment s at Screening, Visit s 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 
11, 12, 14, and 16. 
During the study, no changes in the dose level and frequency of ARGX-113 or the So C will 
be allowed . However, if necessary, patients may receive rescue therapy if their MG 
deteriorates as judged by the Investigator on the basis of parameters such as changes in 
MGQoL15r, MG- ADL, QMG, MGC on any st udy day. 
Rescue therapy will be determined by the Investigator based on an overall clinical 
assessment . Rescue therapy may include IVIg, PE, or any other treatment chosen by the 
Investigator. In case a patient needs rescue therapy  according to the tre ating Investigator, the 
Medical Director  at the Sponsor should be informed in addition to the  Medical Monitor  at 
Sponsor’s designated contract research organization (CRO, Quintiles) ; where possible prior 
to actual implementation of the rescue therapy. In case rescue therapy is needed (due to 
deterioration of MG ), patients need to  be discontinued from the treatment, but will be 
followed up for safety. Any patient who discontinues study treat ment due to safety concerns 
will be followed up for safety and wherever possible for efficacy. 
For patients who discontinue the study early , all the procedures listed for the Early 
Discontinuation (ED) visit (same procedures as for the End -of-Study [EoS] v isit or Visit 16 ) 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) are to be performed  (early discontinuation ). This 
study is exploratory and not powered to address any pre-defined hypothesi s. The safety and 
efficacy analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who 
received at least one infusion of ARGX-113 or placebo. 
A schematic of study design is presented in  Figure 1.

2016-11-28 Confidential 37 5.2 Discussion of Study Design 
ARGX-113, a novel immunomodulator, has been found to be safe and well tolerated in 
non-clinical studies and a single and multiple dose P hase I study . The safety and tolerability 
assessments in the Phase I study was judged sufficient  to fulfill the primary objective of this 
study. Prelimina ry evidence suggests that ARGX-113 has shown promising effect with 
decreased serum IgG levels. This effect has been well characterized in pre -clinical studies 
and justifies its further development in patients with IgG driven autoimmune diseases such as 
MG. 
In the current study, ARGX-113 will be adm inistered for the first time in  patients with MG 
who have generalized muscle weakness, with the aim to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
PK-PD of ARGX-113. This study is designed as  a randomized, double-blind, an d placebo 
controlled study to distinguish the effect of the I MP from other influences such as placebo 
effect or biased observation. P atients will continue to receive their routine SoC during the 
study irrespective of the treatment they receive because of r andomization. Furthermore, 
patients randomized to ARGX -113 will receive the I MP as an add -on therapy to the routine 
SoC. Since patients with autoimmune MG eligible for this study continue to have significant 
residual symptoms that affect  their quality of life  whilst on SoC, this study offers an 
opportunity to receive ARGX-113 (a potential new treatment for MG) that may offer 
additional benefit on top of their routine SoC. It serves as a rational therapeutic approach for 
IgG mediated immune diseases such as MG by targeting the FcRn-IgG interaction and 
alleviating autoimmunity by rapidly clearing pathogenic autoantibodies. 
The efficacy of ARGX -113 versus placebo will be explored using clinical activity tools 
commonly used in MG clinical research and clinical p ractice. Patients achieving clinically 
meaningful response by studying change from Baseline will be used to explore efficacy data 
in the current study.  All efficacy  and safety assessments used in this study are standard, i.e., 
widely used and generally rec ognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant .

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) > 40 IU/L  or are surgically sterile (i.e. , who had a 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy , or have current documented tubal ligation or any 
other permanent female sterilization procedure). Determination of FSH levels can be used 
to confirm postmenopausal status in amenorrhe ic patients  not on hormonal replacement 
therapy if the test result is within the postmenopausal range per the central laboratory .

contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine devices (IUDs), intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), true sexual 
abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant), bilateral tubal occlusion, or a female participant who is not of childbearing potential. 
Female participants and female partners of male study participants using a hormonal 
contraceptive must al so use a barrier method (i.e., condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm 
or cervical/vault caps]) and should have been stable on their hormonal contrac eptive 
treatment for at least 4  weeks before Screening .

5.3.7 Protocol Deviations /Violations  
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedure that is under the Investigator’ s responsibility and oversight (as defined by 
regulations) without prior written IRB/IEC approval or favorable opinion of an appropriate 
amendment, and that may or will have a major impact on the pati ent’s rights, safety, or  
well-being, or on the integrity and authenticity of the study data. Information regarding 
definition and classification of protocol deviation is detailed in the Protocol Deviation 
guidance document. 
All deviations from the approved protocol must be documented and notified to the 
Sponsor/Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) at the earliest. The I nvestigator should not 
deviate from the protocol, except for patient safety reasons, in which case the deviation must be reported to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) immediately. The Sponsor will not assume any resulting responsibility or liability from  unapproved deviations. The 
Investigator, according to applicable regulations and the Ethics Committee’ s established 
procedures , will inform the Ethics Committee of protocol deviations.  
All instances where the requirements of the study protocol are not complied with, will be 
captured in the eCRF and the study monitor will prepare a Protocol Deviation/Violation Log.

eligibility criteria will be co nsidered screen failures.  
Patients may  be rescreened once under the following conditions: 
• Patients who required treatment for an acute illness that resolved (e.g., a urinary tract 
infection) or had stabilization of  a chronic medical problem ( e.g., uncontrolled 
hypertension). 
• Patients who are not on a stable dose of a concomitant medication prior to randomization as per inclusion and exclusion criteria may be re- screened once the 
stable dose criteria is met . 
• Patients with an indeterminate QuantiFERON®- TB Gold test result (for 
tuberculosis).  
The decision to rescreen patients may  be optional based on clinic al state of the patient and 
the decision to rescreen will solely be made based on Sponsor’s discretion on a case -by-case 
basis. 
5.3.9 Early Termination of Study or Site  
The study may be terminated at any time by the S ponsor for safety concerns due to serious 
AEs, inability to achieve the recruitment target within reasonable time or if in the Sponsor's judgement, there are no further benefits to be expected from the study. In such a case, the 
Sponsor or delegate will inform the study I nvestigators, institutions , and all Regulatory 
Authorities.  
The study can also be terminated by the Regulatory Authority for any reason or at a s ite level 
as decided by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee  (IDMC), Independent Ethics

2016-11-28 Confidential 48 6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol- required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the Investigator that may make i t unfeasible to 
perform the assessment . In such cases, the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure 
the safety and well -being of the patient. When a protocol required procedure cannot be 
performed, the Investigator will document the reason and any corrective and preventive 
actions that he/she has taken to ensure that the normal processes are adhered to in source documents. The study team should be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. 
Patients should be seen for all visits on the designated day or as closely as possible to the 
original planned visit schedule. Visits 2, 4, 6 (in the Treatment period) and Visit 8 (in the 
Follow-Up period) are optional. There is a permissible window of ±1  day both for study 
visits in the Treatment period (Visit  1 to Visit 7) and during the FU period ( after Visit 7 to 
Visit 16). Every effort should be made to schedule every visit on the exact Day (which is relative to the Baseline visit) as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). 
The assessments to be performed at each study visit will be conducted  respecting the order of 
assessments as follows:  
At all visits, the efficacy assessments should be performed first, pr ior to any  other study 
specific procedure with the only exception of obtaining informed consent at Screening. 
6.1 Informed Consent and Enrol lment 
Any patient who provides informed consent (i.e., signs and dates the ICF)  will be considered 
enrolled in the study. A Screening number will be obtained by the site using IxRS . In 
addition, patients will be invited to give informed consent (on a separate ICF) for the 
pharmacogenetic sampling . The pharmacogenetic assessment is optional and patients will not 
be excluded from the study if they do not consent to the sampling for this assessment . 
6.2 Screening  
After informed consent has been obtaine d, patients will be screened at the site for eligibility 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Section  5.3.1 and 5.3.2 respectively.  
Screening procedures must be performed within 15 days prior to  randomization. 
In addition to obtaining written informed consent, the following ass essments will be 
performed at S creening:

7.6 Selection of Doses in the Study  
Based on the preliminary safety and PK/PD da ta of the aforementioned Phase I  study in 
healthy subjects  (ARGX-113-1501), a weekly dose of 10 mg/kg ARGX-113 was  selected for 
investigation in this exploratory Phase II study as this dose regimen resulted in a maximum 
PD effect and was considered safe.  
There was a dose- dependent decrease of serum IgG concentrations following a single dose 
administrati on of ARGX-113. T here was a maximum decrease of serum IgG concent rations 
at a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg while a lower dose of 2 mg/kg resulted in less reduction 
of IgG concentrations. Pharmacodynamic data after multiple dosing showed that a dose of 
10 mg/kg either administered every 4 or 7 days resulted in what was anticipated to be a 
maximum effect on serum IgG concentrations in terms of both depth of the PD effect and 
time to reach nadir.  
As a lower drug exposure and a less frequent dose administrations are  considered more 
convenient for patients, the dose regimen of 4 weekly doses of 10  mg/kg was selected for 
investigation in Phase II studies. ARGX-113 was found to be safe and well tolerated 
following administration of four weekly 2 -hour IV 10 mg/kg infusions to healthy subjects. 
It has been reported that reduction of serum IgG concentrations in MG patients following 
short-term treatment with plasma exchange, immunoadsorption or IVIg results in a clinically 
meaningful effect (i.e. , amelioration of sig ns and symptoms )13, 14. 
The impact of reducing serum IgG concentrations with ARGX-113 on the clin ical effect of 
MG patients is currently unknown. Thus, the dose which was found to be safe and resulted in 
a maximum PD effect was selected for investi gation in this study. Additional doses and dose 
regimens may be considered for future studies.  
During this  study, no changes in the IP dose will be allowed. 
7.7 Timing of Dose  for Each Patient 
ARGX-113 and placebo will be administered intravenously as 4 infusions administered one 
week apart over a period of 2 hours at Visits  1, 3, 5, and 7. Patients will be asked to remain at 
the site for a minimum of 2 hours after the end of infusion as part of routine safety 
monitorin g at Visits 1, 3, 5, and 7.

This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study with limited access to the 
randomization code. The I MP and placebo will be identical in physical appearance. The 
treatment each patien t receives will not be disclosed to the Investigator, investigational  site 
staff, patient, Sponsor, the Sponsor’s designated CRO ( Quintiles) The study will only be 
unblinded following the database hard lock. 
7.8.1 Emergency Unblinding  
The process for breaking the blind will be handled through the IxRS. Investigators are 
strongly discouraged from requesting the blind to be broken for an individual patient, unless 
there is a patient safety issue that requires unblinding and would change patient management. If possible, Investigators/Sponsor’s medical expert should discuss with the Medical Monitor  
at Sponsor’s designated CRO ( Quintiles) before approaching Ix RS to break the blind. If the 
blind is broken, it may be broken for only the patient in question. 
The Sponsor and Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) Medical Monitor  must be notified 
immediately if a patient and/or Investigator is unblinded during the course of the study. 
Pertinent information regarding the circumstances of unblinding of a patient’ s treatment code 
must be documented in the patient’s source documents and electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs). Once  unblinded, the patient will be discontinued early from the study. 
7.9 Prior and Concomitant Treatments 
All concomitant medications whether allo wed or not must be recorded in the eCRFs. All 
clinically relevant prior medications received by the patient including previous treatment for 
MG with patient’s response at least 12  months before Screening must be recorded in the 
eCRFs. 
7.9.1 Prohibited Medication s during the Study  
The following medications will not be permitted during the study and will result in early 
discontinuation from the study when they need to be started: 
• Any IgG therapy; 
• Introduction of a new immunosuppressant that the patient was not already taking at Screening; 
• Dose increase in the immunosuppressant that the patient was  taking from Screening;

7.9.2 Rescue Therapy  
Patients are eligible fo r rescue therapy as judged by the Investigator on the basis of 
parameters such as changes in MGQoL15 r, MG-ADL, QMG, and MGC on any study day. 
Rescue therapy will be determined by the Investigator based on an overall clinical 
assessment and could include IV Ig, PE, increase in the dose and  frequency of SoC or any 
other treatment chosen by the Investigator. In this study, ARGX-113 may interfere with the 
efficacy or duration of efficacy of IVIg considering the half- life of IVIg.  Additional details 
about ARGX-113 is present in Section 2.2. 
In case a patient needs rescue therapy according to the treating Investigator, the Medical 
Director at the Sponsor should be informed in a ddition to the  Medical Monitor  at the 
Sponsor’s designated contract research organization (CRO, Quintiles); where possible prior 
to actual implementation of the rescue therapy.  
If rescue therapy is administered, patients need to be discontinued from the study. For 
patients who discontinue the study early, all the procedure s listed for the Early 
Discontinuation (ED) visit (same procedures as for the End -of-Study [EoS] visit or Visit 16 ) 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) are to be performed (early discontinuation visit) 
prior to starting on rescue therapy wherever possible.

continue in the study and maybe evaluable for safety and efficacy evaluation, for details refer 
to Table 2. 
7.13 Accountability of Investigational Medicinal Product 
The Investigator or delegated site staff is responsible for ensuring that the I MP received at 
the clinical site is  inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. 
Infusion of the IMP must be completed under the supervision of the Investigator, by a qualified member of the clinical staff . The Investigator or delegated site staff must maintain 
accurate records, demonstrating date and amount of IMP supplied and by whom. 
The Sponsor’s designated site monitor will periodically check the suppl ies of IMP held by 
the Investigator or pharmacist to ensure accountability and appropriate storage conditions of 
all IMP used.  
Unused IMP must be accessible for verificatio n by the site monitor during on-site monitoring 
visits. Used IMP should be kept on site and its accountability will be checked by the site 
monitor. Only after appropriate verification and confirmation from the site monitor, used 
IMP (vials) can be discarded/destroyed in accordance with the site procedures.  
After the database lock, any remaining unused IMP will be returned to the S ponsor, or 
destroyed at the clinical site with the S ponsor’s written permission (in this case a certificate 
of destruction will be provided and filed in the Tri al Master File). 
Hazardous materials such as used  needles, syringes, and infusion bags, containing hazardous 
liquids, should be discarded immediately after use in a safe manner and must not be retained 
for drug accountability purposes or verification by th e site monitor.

PHARMACODYNAM IC ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Safety 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including SAEs, and 
pregnancies; suicidality assessment; safety laboratory testing , measurement of vital signs , 
ECGs, physical examinations; and other tests that are  deemed critical to the safety evaluation 
of the study in all patients who receive at least 1 dose of the IM P. As discussed in 
Section 8.1.1.4, any pregnancy that  occurs while a patient is enro lled in the study will also be 
monitored and reported according to the appropriate regulations. 
8.1.1 Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs observed during the study from the time 
the patient signs the ICF until the last contact of the patient. 
Definition of AE : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient 
whether or not a pharmaceutical product is administered and which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or IMP, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product or IM P. 
An AE can also be a new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition). 
Abnormal laboratory values, or test results, physical examination findings, and other 
abnormal investigational findings (i.e., ECG) should not be reported as AEs unless they are 
associated with clinical signs and symptoms that are considered clinically significant, require 
therapy (e.g., hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or he matological stem cell 
support), or lead to treatment disco ntinuation. 
Death is not considered an AE but an outcome. 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IMP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease und er study and/or increase in the symptoms of the disease and should be considered 
as disease progression and not an AE.

2016-11-28 Confidential 63 Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR): Any untoward and unintended response in a subject to an 
IMP which is related to any dose administered to tha t subject. 
Definition of Serious AE (SAE): An SAE, experience or reaction, is any untoward medical 
occurrence (whether considered to be related to I MP or not) that at any dose: 
• Results in death;  
• Is life-threatening (the patient is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: Hospital 
admissions and/or surgical operations planned b efore a study are not considered SAEs or 
if the illness or disease which caused hospitalization existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. However, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; 
• Other: Medically significant events, which do not meet any of the criteria above, but may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are blood dyscrasias (e.g. neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions t hat do not result in inpatient hospitalization.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions and Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
Any suspected adverse reaction that is serious, unexpected, and considered to be related to drug exposure is defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR).  
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, which is not listed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or intensity that has been observed.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. The following examples provide types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the I MP and the AE: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome)

2016-11-28 Confidential 64 • One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study  (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group.  
An untoward and unintended post-dosing response to a non-study drug is, by definition, not a 
SUSAR, but is, however, an AE.  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness and causal relation ship to the 
IMP or study procedures. The action taken with the investigational drug and the outcome of 
the event must also be recorded.  
Overdose 
For the purposes of this study, exceeding the dosage requirements specified in this protocol represents an overdose. In case of suspected overdose, the patient should be treated according 
to standard medical practice based on the Investigator’s judgment. 
Severity 
All AEs observed will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The NCI CTCAE is a 
descriptive terminology which can be utilized for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale is 
provided for each AE term. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. If a particular AE’s 
severity is not specifically graded by the guidance document, the Investigator is to use the general NCI -CTCAE definitions of Grade 1 through Grade 5 following his or her best 
medical judgment. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on the following general guideline: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
interventio n not indicated. 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non- invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).

2016-11-28 Confidential 65 • Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living (ADL).  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE. 
Relationship  
The causal relationship between the I MP/study procedures and the AE has to be 
characterized as unrelated, unlikely, related, possible, and probable. 
• Events can be classified as “unrelated” if there is not a reasonable possibility that the 
IMP caused the AE.  
• An “unlikely” relationship s uggests that only a remote connection exists between the 
IMP and the reported AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, progression or 
expression of the disease state, or reaction to concomitant medication, appear to 
explain the reported AE. 
• A “related” relationship suggests that the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of I MP, it follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
IMP, and it cannot reasonable be explained by known characteristics of patient’s 
clinical state . 
• A “possible” relationship suggests that the association of the AE with the IMP is 
unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by other conditions. 
• A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with drug administration exists and, in the Investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely 
that a causal relationship exists between the drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of disease state, or 
concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE. 
In final evaluation for reporting the relationship will be converted into “Binary 
Determination” as per CIOMS. Unrelated and Unlikely will be clubbed into “Unrelated” and 
Related, Possible and Probable will be clubbed into “Related” for final reporting purpose. 
8.1.1.1 Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs, that occur during the study from signature of informed consent until EoS ( Visit 16), 
are to be recorded on the appropriate AE pages (e ither ‘serious’ or ‘non -serious’) in the 
System Version: 1.0, Status: Approved, Document ID: VV-TMF-48138

2016-11-28 Confidential 66 eCRF. The Investigator should complete all the details requested , including dates of onset, 
stop date (when applicable), severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to  IMP, and to 
study procedures. Each event should be recorded separately  in the eCRF . 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question 
from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?’, or revealed by  observation will be collected and recorded in the e CRF. 
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study after signature of 
informed consent, whether or not related to the IMP , must be reported immediately (within 
24 hours of the study site’s knowledge of the event) . All SAEs will be recorded (within 
24 hours) on the electronic SAE report form and the AE form in the eCRF, the Investigator or delegated site staff should check that all  entered data is consistent. An alert  email for the 
SAE report will then be automatically sent by email to the Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) s afety mailbox via the electronic data capture ( EDC) system. In case the EDC 
system is not functioning corre ctly or the system is down, all SAEs should be reported by 
fax/email to Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) using the SAE paper report form. 
The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE to enable the Sponsor (or an authorized r epresentative) to file a report, which satisfies regu latory reporting 
requirements. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs  and to all follow-up reports. 
Criteria for documenting the relationship to IMP as well as severity, outcome, and action 
taken will be the same as those previously described. 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days of a patient 's last visit are to be 
collected and rep orted as previously described. 
Additional follow-up information should be completed and entered on an SAE report form in 
the eCRF with again a copy automatically sent to the Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) 
by email via the EDC system . 
8.1.1.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigators 
The Sponsor’s designee will be responsible for reporting all SUSARs and any other 
applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and Investigators, in

to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the Sponsor’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted within 7 days for fatal and life -threatening events and 15 days for other 
SUSARs, unless otherwise required  by national regulations. The Sponsor’s designee will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safety issues where applicable.  
The investigational site will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her 
IEC/IRB in accordance with national regulations. 
8.1.1.3 Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Any AEs observed from signing the informed consent to the end of the study will be 
followed up to resolution. Resolution means that the patient has returned to a baseline state of 
health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. 
All AEs that occur after the last dose of the I MP should be (pro- actively) followed- up and 
assessed by the Investigator until (EoS visit or Visit 16 ) or for 30 days after the early 
discontinuation visit (regardless o f discontinuation occurring in T reatment period or FU 
period), and until satisfactory resolution or stabilization.  
Serious AEs will be captured and followed up until resolution (if needed, also after the EoS 
visit). 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days of a pati ent's last dose of I MP 
and/or last visit (EoS visit or Visit 16) are to be collected and reported a s previously 
described (as per Section 8.1.1.1) and will be followed -up regardless of the Investigator’s 
opinion of causality . The Investigator should follow each SAE until the event has resolved to 
the baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the Investigator, until the 
patient is lost to follow -up, or until the patient withdraws consent. If the patient is lost to 
follow-up, the SAE will be categorized based on the Investigator’s last assessment. Every 
effort should be made to follow all SAEs consider ed to be related to I MP or study procedures 
until an outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the SAE page of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. If, after follow -up, return to the baseline status or 
stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF. 
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome. 
For SAEs, nonserious AEs, and pregnancies, the Sponsor’s designee may follow-up by 
telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and

8.1.1.4 Reporting and Follow- Up Requirements for Pregnancies  
8.1.1.4.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients  
A serum pregnancy test will be conducted in all females of childbearing potential at 
Screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be conducted locally thereafter at Visit s 1, 3, 5, 7, 
11, and 16 as presented in the Schedule of events ( Table 1). 
If a patient becomes pregnant after the administration of IMP and up to 90 days after the patient received the last infusion , the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee should be informed 
immediately. The patien t should be discontinued early from the study treatment as soon as 
the pregnancy is known and the following should be completed: 
• The patient should immediately discontinue from the study. 
• The patien t should have an early discontinuation visit . 
• All assessments for early discontinuation visit ( See Section 5.3.4 and 6.6) must be 
performed unless contraindicated by pregnancy (harmful to fetus) or unless the 
patient withdraws informed consent. 
The Investigator must inform the patien t of information currently known about potential risks 
and about available treatment alternatives. The pregnancy should be followed-up to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. 
Full details will be recorded on a Pregnancy Report eCRF and submitted via the Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system, and reporting details will be detailed in the study  manual. The 
Investigator will update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with additional information as soon as the outcome of the pregnancy is known. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy is an SAE, then this must be additionally reported as an SAE 
on the appropriate eCRF page.

Male patients will be instructed through the ICF to immediately inform the Investigator if  
their partner becomes pregn ant during the study and up to 90 days after the patien t received 
the last infusion . A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by the Investigator within 
1 working day after learning of the pregnancy and submitted via t he EDC system. Attempts 
should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in 
the partner of a male patien t exposed to the IMP. 
The pregnant partner will need to sign an ICF to allow for follow -up on her Pregnancy. Once 
the ICF has been signed, the Investigator will update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with 
additional information on the course and outcome of the Pregnancy. An Investigator who is 
contacted by the male patien t or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of 
the Pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in co-operation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician.  
8.1.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be collected and analyzed at a central lab as indicated in the S chedule of Assessment s 
(Table 1). Patients need to be fasting for at least 8  hours prior to the sampling for clinical lab 
tests. 
Urine pregnancy test and ECG will be done at local lab. 
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed (on the samples taken for clinical laboratory tests) 
for all patients of childbearing potential at Screening, and a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed locally at the  site (can be done on the urine sample taken for urinalysis) at 
Visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 16. 
The total volume of blood wil l not exceed 226 mL for the duration of the study. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all 
time points throughout the study. The Investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory values. If the Inv estigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
will be considered as a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is 
consistent with a current diagnosis, it may be documented accordingly without being reported as an AE .

8.1.3 Vital Signs, Physical Examination,  and ECGs 
Assessment of vital signs (supine blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral body temperature) will 
be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). 
Supine blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured using standard equipment after 
10 minutes rest on a bed. 
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening, Visit  7, and at 
Visit 16/EoS/ED visit as indicated in the S chedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and will include 
an assessment of general appearance, skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and 
throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal/extremities, abdomen, breast, and cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and genital/rectal systems. An abbreviated 
examination will be done at all other visits . In addition, weight will be assessed at each of 
these time points. 
On IMP infusion days, physical examination, includi ng weight, will be assessed pre -dose. 
Height will be measured at S creening visit only.  For assessment of height and weight, 
patients will be required to remove their shoes and wear light indoor clothing for these 
measurements.  
The digital ECG assessments w ill be performed at the time points indicated in the  Schedule 
of Assessmen ts (Table 1). 
A ECG will be recorded in the supine position after the patient has rested in this position for 
at least 10  minutes. The assessment on heart rate, PR, QT, and QRS intervals will be locally 
read by the Investigator or delegate. 
8.1.4 Suicidality assessment  
As is recommended for studies involving a biological product for a neurological indication, a 
prospective assessment for suicidal id eation and behavior will be  included in this clinical 
study. 
This so called suicidality assessment will be conducted by specifically asking the following 
question, derived from the Patient Health  Questionnaire item 9 (PHQ-9):

be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way?" 
The patient will be asked this question at each scheduled visit, except the optional visits to 
collect PK/PD blood samples, and the response documented. Response options as per the 
PHQ-9 are limited to the following: "not at all", "several days", "more than half the days" or 
"nearly every day" . 
This specific question was selected for the reported significant linear relationship between the item 9 score of the PHQ-9 and the risk of subsequent suicide attempt .

8.1.5 Medical History  
All significant findings that are present at Screening must be reported on the relevant medical 
history/current medical conditions p age of the eCRF. 
As part of medical history details must include and is not limited to all previous 
treatment/therapy taken for MG, patient’s response to each of the previous MG 
treatment/therapy received . 
8.1.6 Independent Data  Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC consisting of members who are independent from the Spons or will be established. 
The IDMC  will be established prior to the enroll ment of the first patient in the Treatment 
period. The IDMC  membership will have 4 independent members (3 physicians and 
1 unblinded biostatistician), including at least one neurologist with expertise in treatment of 
MG, as appropriate. The IDMC quorum will comprise  of 3 independent members with 2 
physicians and 1 unbl inded biostatistician . Three data review meetings are planned. The 
IDMC will review the safety data during the first and second data review meeting, and during 
the third data review  meeting, efficacy and safety data will be reviewed.  
The IDMC  is responsible for reviewing and evaluating unblinded safety data collected after  8 
patients complete treatment period and have had a minimum of 2 weeks follow-up. The 
IDMC will subsequently review unblinded safety data after 16  patients complete treatment 
period and have had a minimum of 2 weeks follow-up and after the final database lock all 
safety and efficacy data will be reviewed for all randomized patients. 
The IDMC  may also meet in ad hoc meetings at its discretion as needed in response to events 
occurring in the study. The IDMC  will review the unblinded safety data during the Da ta 
review meetings. The roles and responsibilities of the IDMC , their operational procedures, 
and method of communication with argenx will be described in a separate IDMC charter.

8.2 Efficacy 
8.2.1 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Efficacy assessments will be done using MG -ADL, as QMG, MGC, and quality of life will 
be measured using MGQoL15r. These assessments will be completed at Screening, and have 
to be performed pre-dose on all IM P infusion days i.e., at Visits  1, 3, 5, 7; in addition to 
Visits 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16. 
8.2.2 Myasthenia Gravis- Activities of Daily Living  
The MG-ADL is an 8-item patient -reported scale to assess MG symptoms and their effects 
on daily activities. It evaluates the capacity to perform different activities of daily living such 
as talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, brushing the teeth/combing the hair, or arising 
from the chair and it also assesses double vision and eyelid d roop. It is a discrete quantitative 
variable in which the 8 items are rated from 0 to 3 and the total score can point from 0  to 24; 
with higher scores indicating more  impairment. The assessments to be performed using 
MG-ADL does not require any equipment or training. The assessments that will be 
performed using MG-ADL is included in Appendix 14.1. 
8.2.3 Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis  
The QMG quantifies  disease severity based on impairments of body functions and structures 
as defined by the International Classifica tion of Disability and Health.15 
The QMG consists of 13 items that assess ocular, bulbar, and limb function. Out of the 13 
items, 6 are timed tests of endurance measured in seconds. Each item has a possible score 
from 0-3. The total possible score is 39, where higher scores indicate more severe 
impairments.  It is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups to assess limb 
function. It requires minimal equip ment such as spirometer, mouthpieces that fit the 
spirometer, nose clips, stopwatch, cups and water for swallowing tests, goniometer, 
dynamometer, and is based on physician’s examination. The items that will be tested is 
included in Appendix 14.2. 
8.2.4 Myasthenia Gravis Composite  
The MGC has 10 items combining physician examination and patient reported outcomes. The 2 ocular items are derived from QMG. It has 3 items on muscle strength (deltoids, hip flexors, and neck flexors or extensors) and 4 items on bulbar function (swallowing, chewing,

ordinal scale with 4 possible categories, but the items are weighted, whereby bulbar impairments weigh more than ocular ones. The impairments that need to be examined by the 
Investigator include ptosis or upward gaze, double vision, eye closure, neck flexion, shoulder 
abduction, and hip flexion. The patient reported outcomes under MGC are talking, chewing, swallowing, and breathing. The maximum possible score is 50, with higher scores reflecting 
more severe impairments.  The items that will be tested is included in Appendix 14.3. 
8.2.5 15-Item Quality of Life Scale for Myasthenia Gravis 
The 15-item Quality of Life scale for Myasthenia Gravis (MGQoL15r) is a quality of life 
scale or survey of patient’s responses and addresses MG -specific psychological well -being 
and social functioning. It is a brief questionnaire that is to be completed by the patient that 
uses 3 response options. The MGQoL15r is helpful in informing the clinician about the 
patient’s perception of the extent of and dissatisfaction with MG -related dysfunction.  Each 
item is scored from 0 to 2  according to its frequency, with a maximum score of 30. The 
questions that patients should provide a r esponse to assess their quality of life is included in 
Appendix 14.4. 
8.3 Pharmacokinetic s 
In order to assess the PK parameters of ARGX -113, blood samples will be collected from 
each patient as presented in  Table 1. Concentrations will be determined using a validated 
assay. The actual date and time of collection of blood sample will be recorded in the relevant 
section of the eCRF.  
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed by Quintiles using Quintiles SOPs and 
standard non-compartmental and/or compartmental methods, as appropriate. 
The appropriate PK parameters will be  calculated after single ( Visit 1) and multiple 
administrations ( Visits 3, 5, and 7 ) of ARGX -113 using individual concentration data in 
plasma and actual sampling times:  
Cmax maximum observed plasma concentration  
tmax the time of occurrence of C max

8.5 Additional Assessment of Immunoglobulins  
The blood sample used to assess the PD markers, will be used to assess IgA, IgM, IgE, and 
IgD. 
8.6 Anti-drug Antibodies 
Blood sample to assess A DA will be collected pre -dose at Visits 1, 5, and 7. Subsequently 
ADA will be  assessed at Visits 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 during the Follow-up period. 
8.7 Pharmacogenetic s 
This study includes an optional Pharmacogenetic assessment which requires signature of a 
separate informed consent if the patient agrees to participate. It is required as part of this 
protocol that the Investigator presents  this option to the patient. As this is an optional 
assessment, if the patient refuses consent he/she will not be excluded from the study . In this 
study, pharmacogenetic analysis will not be used for making regulatory judgments pertaining 
to the safety or efficacy of the I MP. 
However, these data may be considered for voluntary submission, consistent with applicable 
regulatory guidance on this topic, in order to develop the knowledge base necessary t o 
establish the validity of new genomic biomarkers.  
If patients consent for this optional assessment, a blood sample will be collected prior to first 
dosing on (Visit 1) and will be stored for pharmacogenetic analysis (limited to the assessment 
of FcRn polymorphisms). In case the blood draw at Baseline is missed, the sample should be 
taken at Visit  3 prior to the administration of IMP. 
Blood samples taken for this pharmacogenetic analysis will be stored for up to 15 years at 
Quintiles Q2 lab during which the assessment of FcRn polymorphisms may be done on the 
DNA derived from the samples, and these will not be used for additional gene analysis.

9.3 Monitoring  
The Sponsor has engaged the services of a CRO, named Quintiles, to perform all monitoring 
functions within this clinical study . Sponsor’s designated CRO ( Quintiles’) monitors will 
work in accordance with Quintiles’ standard operating procedures ( SOPs) and have the same 
rights and responsibilities as monitors from the Sponsor organization. Monitors will establish and maintain regular contact between the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
Monitors will evaluate the competence of each study  site, informing the  Sponsor about any 
problems relating to facilities, technical equipment, or medical staff . During the study, 
monitors will check that written informed consent has been obtained from all patients correctly prior to any study related procedures performed and that data are recorded correctly 
and completely. Monitors are also entitled to compare entries in eCRFs with corresponding 
source data and to inform the Investigator of any errors or omissions. Monitors will also control adherence to the protocol at the study site . They will arrange for the s upply of IMP 
and ensure appropriate storage conditions are maintained. 
Monitoring visits will be conducted according to all applicable regulatory requirements and 
standards. The I nvestigator must permit study related m onitoring by providing direct access 
to source data and to the patients’ medical histories. The Clinical Monitors will perform 
monitoring visits at each site at regular intervals during the study and after the study has 
completed, as appropriate. The monit or will make written reports to the Sponsor on each 
occasion when contact with the Investigator is made, regardless of whether it is by phone or 
in person. 
Monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH -GCP guidelines to 
ensure protoco l adherence, quality of data, study treatment accountability, compliance with 
regulatory requirements, and continued adequacy of the investigational site and its facilities. During monitoring visits, entries in the eCRF s will be compared with the original source 
documents (source data verification). For this study, the data will be 100% checked and 
verified.

Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the SOPs of the Data 
Management and B iostatistics dep artments of the Sponsor’s designated CRO ( Quintiles). 
Data for this study will be recorded via InForm 5.5 EDC system using eCRFs . It will be 
transcribed by the site from the paper source documents onto the eCRF. The information 
collected on eCRFs must be i dentical to the corresponding information appearing in original 
source documents. There are no exceptions to this rule. Appropriate training and security 
measures will be completed with the Investigator and all authorized study site staff prior to 
the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any study patients at 
the site. 
All data must be entered in English. The eCRFs should always reflect the l atest observations 
on the patients participating in the study. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible during or after the patien t’s visit. To avoid inter-observer variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and safety e valuations. The Investigator must verify 
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct . 
As a matter of regulation, the Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered onto eCRFs. The Investigator should also ensure that 
patient submits completed and correct questionnaires. Prior to submission, each completed 
eCRF must be reviewed for accuracy by the Investigator, corrected as necessary and then 
approved. The Investigator’s e-signature serves to attest that the information contained on the 
eCRFs has been reviewed by the Investigator and is true and accurate. The Investigator will be required to electronically sign off on the eCRF and SAE data. 
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluat e them for completeness and consistency . The 
eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections and alterations are to be made by the 
responsible Investigator or his/her designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. 
Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the 
data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person 
who performed the change, together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of 
the site staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in 
advance. If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data Manager will 
raise a query in the EDC application . The appropriate study site staff will answer queries sent

2016-11-28 Confidential 78 to the Investigator. This will be audit trailed by the EDC application meaning that the name 
of investigational staff, time, and date stamp are captured.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified . Source documents are all documents 
used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the patien t’s medical  history, that ve rify the 
existence of the patien t, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and  all records covering the 
patient’s participation in the study . They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, patient files, etc. The eCRFs should be completed by the 
Investigator or a qualified designee from the site as soon as the data are available. Instructions for the completion of eCRFs will be provided. 
The eCRFs will be considered complete when all missing, incorrect and /or inconsistent data 
have been accounted for. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not 
available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF 
using appropriate item or form level comments.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made 
available for inspection by the study monitor at each monitoring visit. The Investigator must 
submit a completed eCRF for each patien t who receives IMP, regardless of duration. All 
supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, 
should be clearly identified with the study and patient number. Any personal information, 
including patient name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality. 
The eCRF  records will be automatically appended with the identification of the creator, by 
means of their unique User  Identification (ID ). Specified records will be electronically signed 
by the Investigator to document his/ her review  of the data and acknowledge that the data are 
accurate. This will be facilitated by means of the Investigator’s unique User ID and 
password; date and time stamps will be added automatically at time of electronic signature. If 
an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be made in accordance with the 
relevant software procedures. All changes will be fully recorded in a protected audit trail, and 
a reason for the change will be required. 
Adverse events, concomitant diseases/medical h istory terms will be assigned to a lowest 
level term (LLT) and a preferred term (PT) and will be classified by high level term (HLT), 
high level group term, and primary system organ class (SOC) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) thesaurus.

approval of the protocol and informed consent documents before the study may begin at the 
study sites. The Investigator will supply documentation to the Sponsor or designee of the 
required IRB/IEC’s annual renewal of the protocol, and any approvals of revisions to the informed consent document or amendments to the protocol. 
The Investigator will report promptly to the IRB/IEC, any new information that may 
adversely affect the safety of patients or the conduct of the study. Similarly, the Investigator will submit written summaries of the study st atus to the IRB/IEC annually, or more 
frequently if requested by the IRB/IEC. Upon completion of the study, the Investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if required. 
11.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will  be conducted and the informed consent will be obtained according to the 
ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki (2008), the applicable guidelines for GCP, or the applicable drug and data protection laws and regulations of the countries where the study will be conducted. 
11.3 Patient Information and Informed Consent 
The informed consent form ( ICF) will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study 
participation to the patient in simple terms be fore the patient is enro lled into the study. A 
separate ICF will be given in case a patient consents for Pharmacogenetic analysis and for 
Pregnancy in case of a female partner of male patient. The ICF contains a statement that the 
consent is freely given, that the patient is aware of the risks and benefits of entering the 
study, and that the patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time . Written consent 
must be given by the patient  and/or legal representative, after the receipt of detailed 
information on the study. 
All ICFs must be available in  the local and vernacular languages required at the site and 
include patient information sheets/brochures that outline the study procedures. All ICF(s) 
must be signed and dated by the patient or a legally acceptable representative.  
For patients who are una ble to read and write, the patient information sheet and ICF(s)

2016-11-28 Confidential 86 should be read to the patient in his/her native language in the presence of an impartial witness 
who is literate and not affiliated with the study. The patient having understood the 
information given to him/her in the presence of an impartial witness will thumbprint the 
ICF(s) and the same will be countersigned by the impartial witness. If the patient or legally 
acceptable representative cannot read, then an impartial witness will witness and  attest the 
entire consent process and will be required to sign the consent form. 
Confirmation of a patient’s informed consent must also be documented in the patient’s 
medical record prior to any testing under this protocol, including Screening tests and  
assessments.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed cons ent is obtained from each 
patient or legal representative and for obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the 
informed consent document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to 
the administration of IMP. The Investigator will provide each patient with a copy of the 
signed and dated consent form. 
11.4 Patient Data P rotection  
The ICF will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislation. 
Sponsor or representative will not provide individual genotype results to patients, any 
insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician, or any other 
third party, unless required to do so by law. 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked 
to the identity of the patient. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals 
might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patien t. For example, in the 
case of a medical emergency, a Sponsor or representative physician or an Investigator might 
know a patient’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files.

1. Patients must be off pyridostigmine (or any acetylcholinesterase inhibitor medication) for twelve (12) hours prior  to testing, 
(if medically safe to do so). 
 
2. Perform the tests in the order given in this Manual and shown on the Videotape. 
 
3. Calibrate the respiratory  equipment  on the day of the test, per manufacturers’  instruction,  before the test begins. Place the calibration 
record in folder in an accessible pl ace. 
 
4. For all measurements,  record actual numbers as well as grade, i.e., if it takes 30 seconds before a patient sees double,  record on the 
far right box 30/1 for 30 seconds and a grade of 1. 
 
5. Patients must remain seated for the respiratory test. 
 
6. At the end of the scoring sheet, add up the grade for that patient and that becomes the Total 
QMG Score.

2016-11-28 Confidential 97 QUANTITATIVE MG SCORE  
I. DOUBLE VISION: 
Patients' preparation: Patient is sitting. Ask if the patient is experiencing  double vision looking strai ght ahead. If ye s, record 0/3 
(actual time/grade) on the scoring sheet. If no, ask the patient  to look to the right for just an instant and then to the left without moving 
their head. If the patient sees double in only one direction,  record side and record result as 0/3. If there  is no eye movement,  record as 
0/3. If the patient does not see double, or sees double in  both directions,  have them perform the test as described b elow gazing to the 
right. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to face forward. When I ask, look over to your right (left) side without  turning your head. If or 
when you start  to see double, please let me know." 
 
Notes to examiner: Patient's head will usually start to turn in the direction of the gaze. Try to maintain the head in a forward position. 
Record the time and grade. Example: double vision is evident at 15 sec. In the scoring section, record 15/1. 
 
 
 
II. PTOSIS (upward gaze): 
Patients' preparation: Patient is sitting. Ask the patient to look straight ahead. If the upper lid is touching the pupil, record as 
0/3. Ask the patient to look up at the ceiling without moving the head. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need you to face forward. When I ask,  look up at the ceiling without moving your head. Keep looking up 
until I tell you to relax." 
 
Notes to examiner: Patient's head will usually start to move up. Try to maintain the head in a forward position. Record time and grade 
when you see either eyelid (lashes) start to droop. Ex: Right eyelid starts to droop at 9 sec., record 9/2. If neither eyelid touches the 
pupil, record 60/0.

2016-11-28 Confidential 98 III. FACIAL MUSCLES:  
Patients' preparation: Patient is sitting facing forwar d. 
 
Explanation to patient: "Squeeze your ey es shut. Do not allow me to open your ey es." 
 
Notes to examiner: If the patient cannot fully close either eye shut, record the grade as 3. No time score is needed on this test. R ecord 
grade of the weaker eye. 
 
 
 
IV. SWALLOWIN G: 
Patient's p reparation: Patient is sitting. Four ounces of water (no ice) is poured into a cup. The water should  be no cooler  than water 
fountain cool. 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to drink this water as you normally would." 
 
Notes to examiner: Listen for coughing and/or throat clearing during the te st and immediately post test. 
Don't ask patients to drink faster than what they feel comfortable doing.  
 
 
 
V. SPEECH: 
Patient's p reparation: Patient is sitting. 
 
Explanation to patient: "Count out loud from 1 to 50 at a comfortable  pace." 
 
Notes to examiner: This is one of the most di fficult tests to score because of varying accents. Record number when you notice a nasal 
or slurring  of the speech.

2016-11-28 Confidential 99 VI. RIGHT & LEFT ARM OUTSTRETCHED: 
Patient's p reparation: The patient needs to be sitting in a chair with both feet on the floor. They must be seated without leaning 
against the back of a chair. Test both arms at the same time. Arms need to be out to the side at 90o, palms down. (Demonstrate  this 
position).  If the patient cannot raise an arm out to 
90o due to a shoulder problem, do not test that arm. The elbows are ex tended through full mechanical ran ge. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to hold both arms out to the side like this. Keep the arms out as long as possible.  If one arm 
tires more than the other, y ou may lower that arm and keep the other arm  up." 
 
Notes to examiner: It is not uncommon that the arms start to droop. If the arms drop more than 10o from starting position, remind the 
patient to pull the arms up. If the patient can pull the arms up but cannot maintain  that position for longer than two seconds, stop the 
test. If one arm is lowered, be careful that the patient does not start to lean to the side that the arm was lowered  to give the appearance 
that he/she is maintaining a 90o angle. Record time/grade (ex: 45 sec for right arm is 45/2; whereas 100 sec for left arm is 100/1). 
 
 
 
VII: FORCED VITAL CAPACITY: 
Patient preparation: Patients must remain seated for this test. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I am te sting total lung capacity. I am going to ask you to hold this mouthpiece away from your face. I will then 
place the nose-clips on your nose. I will tell you to take a deep b reath in, and then place the mouthpiece in y our mouth. You will blow 
out as hard and as fast as you can. Keep blowing until I tell you to stop. 
Notes to examiner: We are only testing FVC. A minimum  of three trials and a max imum of five trials will be performed. The  goal is 
to get the best two trials within 5% of each other. Give a lot of encoura gement. Record best FVC (liters and percentage) and grade 
on sheet, (ex: 2.55 - 60% /  2). 
 
The “normal” FVC values, and therefore the percent  predicted calculations  can vary with the spirometer that  is used. Some 
spirometers come with specified normal  values. That  is why the same spirometer should be u sed each time you test a subject. 
For multi-site studies, parameters and norm al  values should be decided so that all sites are using the same information.

VIII: RIGH T & LEFT HAND GRIP: 
Patient preparation: Patient is sitting in a chair. The elbow should be at 90o. Support should be under the  medial aspect of the 
forearm and under the dy namometer.  
 
Explanation to patient : "I am testing grip strength. I need for you to squeeze as hard as you can. Nothing will move, but it is 
measuring how hard you are squeezing." 
 
Notes to examiner: Give vocal encouragement. Record the two trials (kgs) in column and score (ex: if testing a female and results are 
10 and 8 kg s, record as 10/1.) 
 
  
IX. HEAD LIFTED: 
Patient preparation: The patient will lie down without a pillow under the head. A pillow may be placed under the knees or the knees 
bent so that the feet are flat on the bed. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to lift your head off of the table. Keep it up as long as possible." 
 
Notes to examiner: Place your hand under their head (without touching) to  provide some  cushion if the head drops back. The head 
should come up and forward, not just up to the ceiling. If the head drops within 10o of neutral,  stop the test. 
 
 
 
X. RIGHT & LEFT LEG OUTSTRETCHED: 
Patient preparation: Patient is supine with a pillow under the head. Both legs must be out straight and shoes off. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to hold your right leg up. Hold the leg up in this position as long as possible."

2016-11-28 Confidential 105 14.6 Appendix 6: Sample Size  
Assuming MG -ADL scores as a key indicator for efficacy. To detect the difference of 4 
points between MG- ADL scores of Active and Placebo with variability (1) SD=1.80 for 
active and SD=3.72 for placebo, a sample size of 10 subjects per group would be 
sufficient to achieve 80% power. Approximately 36 patients will be screened in order to 
randomize approximately 24 patients (12 patients per treatment arm) to get at least 20 
patients who received at least 3 doses of IMP (either ARGX -113 or placebo) and who 
completed at least 2 weeks of follow-up post last dose. Based on below calculation data 
of 10 to 12 subjects per group would be sufficient to produce clinically meaningful data 
for further exploratory analysis. Although this study is exploratory and not statistically powered, descriptive efficacy assessments will be analyzed to assist in  designing future 
studies.

Introduction  
 
The removal of corneal foreign bodies  is a common ophthalmologic procedure in the emergency 
department (ED)  [1].   There are a few different techniques for removing  corneal foreign bodies 
[2]. A cotton -tipped applicator  is useful for superficial foreign bodies that can be swept away, 
but this does not work for adherent foreign bodie s.  For adherent corneal foreign bodies, the most 
common technique in the ED is to use  a needle to dislodge the foreign body.  Using a burr drill is 
also an  option, but this device is less commonly available and may lead to significant epithelial 
damage.   
 
The vast majority of c orneal foreign bodies are metallic [3] and thus are frequentl y 
ferromagnetic .  Consequently, it may be possible to use a magnet to remove most corneal foreign 
bodies.  The use of a magnet has been described for removal of soft tissue foreign bodies [5 ,6] 
and nasal foreign bodies [7 ], but the use of a magnet to remov e corneal foreign bodies in the ED 
has not been studied.  In a letter to the editor  [4], it was suggested that magnetized forceps might 
be used to  remove a corneal foreign body, but this technique never became commonplace.   
 
There is literature supporting  magnetic extraction of intrao cular metallic foreign bodies [8,9,10 ].   
 
Thus, we propose a prospective study to assess the effectiveness of a rare earth magnet to 
remove corneal foreign bodies.  
 
 
Methods  
 
This will be a prospective interventional study to  assess the use of a rare earth magnet for the 
removal of corneal foreign bodies.  Patients may be included if they are over 18, and present to 
the emergency department with a metallic corneal foreign body.  Patients will be e xclude d if they 
are prisoners,  pregnant women, have  pacemakers , have metallic facial implants, or if there is any 
suspicion of a globe rupture . 
 
After the patient sign written, informed consent, the  physician will attempt to remove the corneal 
foreign body with an N45 3” x 1/2" x 1/4" Neodymium bar magnet  OR the North by Honeywell 
326734G Eye Magnet with Loop .  The treating physician will make sure that there are no 
magnetic objects within one foot of the patient’s eye while the magnet is being used for this 
procedure.  If the physician is unable to remove the corneal foreign body wit h the magnet, he or 
she may proceed with standard care.  
Only the investigators of the study who have established an agreed upon method for this 
technique will be allowed to perform this proc edure .  The patient will be asked to remove any 
metallic nose, ear, or facial jewelry prior to the procedure.   The approach should be parallel to 
the floor and at the height of the foreign body.  This approach should minimize the risk of the 
foreign body s liding on the surface of the eye.  The magnet will be brought next to the foreign 
body and then it will gently touch the foreign body.  If that does not result in the foreign body 
latching onto the magnet, the attempt to remove the foreign body with the ma gnet will be 
discontinued.   
 
The treating physician will fill out a brief data collection form for each patient including the 
patient’s age and gender, the type of substance thought to be on the patient’s cornea, the time 
since the incident, whether or no t the technique was successful, whether or not there was 
increased fluorescein uptake after the attempt with the magnet, whether or not the patient 
experienced discomfort with the procedure, and (if the magnet did not remove the corneal 
foreign body) other  techniques used to remove the corneal foreign body.  
 
The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients with metallic corneal foreign bodies in 
whom the foreign body was successfully removed.   Secondarily, we will assess to see if this 
technique results in any adverse outcomes such as discomfort to the patient or epithelial damage 
to the surface of the eye.  As this technique has never before be en studied in the ED, we intend to 
enroll 10 -20 pat ients.

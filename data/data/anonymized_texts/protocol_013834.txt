Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Tables for previous amendments are provided in
Section 10.15(Appendix 15) .
Amendment 6 (13 July 2023)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment : to add the Long-term Extension (LTE)  Phase, which
requires modification of the Study Completion, End of Study, and Subject Completion definitions.
The LTE Phase will allow continued access to study drug for subjects who continue to derive
benefit from treatment, as determined by their investigator. As an alternative to entering the LTE
Phase, subjects receiving erdafitinib may exit the study and continue to receive treatment on any
other post-trial access program, when permitted by local regulations. Otherkeychanges made with
this amendment include:
 to update statistical language within the protocol to reflect early enrollment termination and
change in study's regulatory intent from registrational to non-registrational;
 to state that no additional subjects will be allowed to crossover from Investigator’s Choice to
erdafitinib;
 to clarify visit windows for the End-of-Treatment (EOT)  visit and for Disease Assessment
Follow-up visits in the Follow-up Phase;
 to remove requirement for urine collection for assay development at the time of high-risk
disease recurrence; and
 to state that it is no longer required to send redactedimages of OpticalCoherence Tomography
(OCT)scans, photographs, and fluorescein angiograms to the sponsor-selected central vendor.

 Evaluation of health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) removed as secondary objective for
all cohorts, therefore, patient-reported outcome
(PRO) assessment/data collection is no longer
required for all subjects in all phases.
 Stated that due to early enrollment termination
and change in study’s regulatory intent for
Cohort 1 from registrational to
non-registrational, no formal hypothesis
testing will be performed for any of the
cohorts.
 Actual numbers of subjects enrolled to each
cohort are shown along with planned sample
sizes
 Removed all analyses other than descriptive
reporting
 Revised to show that interim analyses are no
longer planned
 Streamlined planned summaries for clinical
laboratory tests and electrocardiograms
 Streamlined planned pharmacokinetic (PK)
analyses
Removed planned medical resource utilization
(MRU)analyses, therefore, MRU data
collection is no longer required for all subjects
in all phases.
 Cessation of Independent Data Monitoring

enrollment, the risk-benefit of
erdafitinib has not been established
for this indication, therefore new

Schedule of Activities. The LTE Phase is also 
reflected as appropriate in the synopsis and body of 
the protocol. As an alternative to entering the LTE 
Phase, subjects receiving erdafitinib may exit the
study and continue to receive treatment on any other
post-trial access program, when permitted by local
regulations.
Within Section 4.4, to align with incorporation of
the LTE Phase, definitions for Study Completion,
End of Study, and Subject Completion have been
modified.The LTE Phase will allow continued
access to study drug for subjects
who continue to derive benefit from
treatment, as determined by their
investigator.

1.1. Synopsis
A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Erdafitinib Versus Investigator Choice of Intravesical Chemotherapy in
Subjects Who Received Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)  and Recurred With High Risk Non-Muscle-
Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)  and FGFR Mutations or Fusions
Erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493)  is an oral pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)  1-4 inhibitor with
demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with solid tumors, including urothelial carcinoma, with alterations
in the FGFR pathway.
OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
Cohort 1 (papillary disease only)
Primary Objective: To evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS)  in subjects treated with erdafitinib vs
Investigator’s Choice, forsubjects with high-risk NMIBC who harborFGFR mutations or fusions, and who
recurred after BCG therapy.
Secondary Objective and Endpoints: To evaluate other measures of efficacy. Endpoints include time to
progression, overall survival (OS) , and RFS rate at 6 months and 12 months.
Cohort 2 (carcinoma in situ [CIS] with or without papillary disease)
Exploratory Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of erdafitinib in terms of the complete response (CR)  rate
at 8 weeks, CR rate at 32 weeks, and duration of response (DOR) in subjects with high-risk,
BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and FGFR mutations or fusions.
Cohort 3 (intermediate-risk marker lesion) at select study sites
Exploratory Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of erdafitinib in terms of the CR rate, best overall response
(BOR) , and DOR in subjects with intermediate-risk NMIBC and FGFR mutations or fusions.
Other secondary objectives f or all cohorts
Secondary objectives for all cohorts include the following:
 To evaluate erdafitinib pharmacokinetics
 To evaluate safety and tolerability of erdafitinib
Hypothesis
For Cohort 1, erdafitinib treatment will delay the onset of tumor recurrence for subjects with papillary
disease only, who recurred after BCG therapy, with FGFR mutations or fusions, and with all lesions
removed.
For Cohort 2, erdafitinib treatment will lead to CR for subjects with CIS with or without papillary disease
and FGFR mutations or fusions.
For Cohort 3, erdafitinib treatment will lead to CR in the marker lesion for subjects with a papillary marker
lesion and FGFR mutations or fusions.
Due to early enrollment termination and change in study’s regulatory intent for Cohort 1 from registrational
to non-registrational, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed for any of the cohorts.

us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023OVERALL DESIGN
This is an open-label, global, multicenter, randomized, Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of erdafitinib
in subjects with NMIBC and FGFR mutations or fusions (see Section 5.1) .
Cohort 1 (n=240 planned)  will include subjects with high-risk NMIBC presenting as papillary tumor only,
with disease recurrence after BCG therapy, and who either refuse or are not eligible for cystectomy. The
reason for not being eligible for cystectomy or for refusing cystectomy will be entered into the electronic
case report form (eCRF) . Subjects will be assigned randomly 2:1 to treatment with erdafitinib or the
investigator’s choice of either intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) /hyperthermic
MMC, respectively. Randomization will be stratified by tumor stage (Ta vs T1)  and type of prior BCG
therapy (BCG-unresponsive vs BCG-experienced) . BCG strain administered will also be documented in
the eCRF. Subjects in the BCG-experienced strata will be capped at approximately 50% of the total study
population (See Section 6.3) . Investigators must choose between intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical
MMC/hyperthermic MMC for each subject at screening, and the choice of the agent must take prior
exposure into consideration. Subjects in Cohort 1 with locally confirmed high-risk recurrence on
Investigator’s Choice may cross over to treatment with erdafitinib. Note: no additional crossover from
Investigator’s Choice to erdafitinib will be permitted. Molecular screening must start within 12 weeks after
the last transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)  done for high risk recurrence if molecular testing
is being done on post-BCG specimen. Peri-operative intravesical chemotherapy prior to study entry per
local standard of care and prior immunotherapy (eg, PD1 inhibitor etc)  are allowed.
Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 are exploratory.
Cohort 2 (n=20 planned)  will include subjects with high-risk, BCG-unresponsive NMIBC presenting as
CIS with or without concurrent papillary tumor, and who either refuse or are not eligible for cystectomy.
The reason for not being eligible for cystectomy or for refusing cystectomy will be entered into the eCRF.
All subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 will receive treatment with erdafitinib. Peri-operative intravesical
chemotherapy prior to study entry per local standard of care and prior immunotherapy (eg, PD1 inhibitor
etc)  are allowed. Additionally, subjects in this cohort may receive chemotherapy as bridging therapy after
adequate BCG therapy while being considered for trial.
Cohort 3 (n=20 planned)  will be enrolled at select study sites and will include subjects with intermediate-
riskNMIBC presenting as papillary disease only. All previous tumors for these subjects must be low grade
(G1-G2) , Ta, or T1, with no previous CIS. Furthermore, subjects must have a risk of progression less than
5% for 2 years, and the risk of recurrence must be greater than 50% as calculated using the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)  risk calculator.19 There are no predefined
BCG or intravesical chemotherapy requirements for subjects enrolled in Cohort 3. All tumors must be
removed except for a single, untouched 5 to 10 mm lesion. All subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 will receive
treatment with erdafitinib.
Molecular eligibility will be determined before screening for remaining eligibility criteria. The Treatment
Phase will begin on Day 1 for subjects meeting all eligibility criteria. The Follow-up Phase includes a
30-day Safety Follow-up Visit, disease assessment follow-up, and survival follow-up. An Independent Data
Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  will be commissioned for the study. Due to the company decision to
terminate study enrollment and considering the recent IDMC review (6 July 2022) found the safety of
erdafitinib in this study to be consistent with the known safety profile of erdafitinib, no further monitoring
by the IDMC will be conducted.
The Long-term Extension (LTE)  Phase will allow continued access to study drug for subjects who continue
to derive benefit from treatment, as determined by their investigator. Subjects may enter the LTE Phase
following implementation of Amendment 6, provided they meet the criteria for entry specified in the
protocol. No data will be collected in the eCRF during the LTE Phase, and only serious adverse events
(SAEs)  will be reported to the company safety repository. As an alternative to entering the LTE Phase,

us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023subjects receiving erdafitinib may exit the study and continue to receive treatment on any other post-trial
access program, when permitted by local regulations.
TREATMENT GROUPS AND DURATION
Subjects receiving erdafitinib will take erdafitinib tablets orally, at a starting dose of 6 mg, once daily for
28 days in a 28-day cycle. After review of safety and tolerability data from approximately 5 to 10 additional
subjects dosed with the 6-mg daily regimen (without up-titration) , the IDMC may recommend a
modification of the dosing regimen to include up-titration to 8 mg daily. The details of the IDMC
recommendation will be communicated in writing to the investigative sites and, per local regulation, to
health authorities. With the exceptions noted below for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, treatment may continue for
a maximum of 2 years or until the subject has disease recurrence or progression, intolerable toxicity,
withdraws consent, there is a decision by the investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is closed,
whichever occurs first.
 For Cohort 2, erdafitinib must be discontinued if CR is not observed within 3 months.
 For Cohort 3, after 3 months of study treatment: 1)  Subjects with stable disease or progression of the
marker lesion must discontinue erdafitinib and a TURBT of the marker lesion must be performed. 2)
Subjects with CR may continue erdafitinib. 3) Subjects with partial response (PR)  may, at the
investigator’s discretion, either continue treatment with erdafitinib or discontinue erdafitinib and
undergo TURBT of the marker lesion.
Subjects in Cohort 1 assigned to Investigator’s Choice will receive intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical
MMC/hyperthermic MMC as described in Section 6.1.2. All dose modifications or omissions will be
managed by the treating physician per local standard of care after discussion with the sponsor. Investigator’s
Choice treatment will be given once weekly for at least 4 doses of induction followed by monthly
maintenance for at least 6 months. Additional doses of induction or maintenance are allowed per local
standard of care. This treatment may continue until it is completed, disease recurrence, intolerable toxicity,
withdrawal of consent, a decision by the investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is closed,
whichever occurs first.
Subjects in Cohort 1 with locally confirmed high-risk recurrence on Investigator’s Choice may cross over
to treatment with erdafitinib (Section 10.10) . Note: no additional crossover from Investigator’s Choice to
erdafitinib will be permitted.
EVALUATIONS
The timing of all study evaluations is provided in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) . Disease
assessments include regularly scheduled cystoscopy, bladder mapping, local assessment of urine cytology,
and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)  or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  urograms.
Central histopathologic review of biopsied tumor tissue will be performed for Cohort 1. Biomarker
assessments include molecular screening to determine eligibility for the study and exploratory DNA, RNA,
and protein analyses using archival or fresh biopsy tissue, urine, and blood. Erdafitinib concentration will
be measured in blood and biopsied tissue for pharmacokinetic analysis. Safety assessments will include
adverse event reports, physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) , clinical laboratory tests,
vital sign measurements, β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy tests, and ophthalmologic
examinations.
STATISTICAL METHODS
The cohorts will be analyzed separately. Descriptive statistics and subject listings will be used to summarize
the data. For continuous variables, number of observations, means, standard deviations, medians,
interquartiles (IQs) , and ranges will be used. For discrete variables, frequency will be summarized. The
comparisons between the 2 treatment groups in Cohort 1 will be performed using descriptive statistics.

Erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493)  is an oral pan-FGFR 1-4 inhibitor with demonstrated clinical activity
in subjects with solid tumors, including urothelial carcinoma, identified to have alterations in the
FGFR pathway. In the United States, erdafitinib (BALVERSATM)  was approved on 12 April 2019
for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that
has susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations and has progressed during or following at
least 1 line of prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, including within 12 months of neoadjuvant
or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. This Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and
efficacy of erdafitinib in subjects with high-risk NMIBC and FGFR mutations or fusions, who
received BCG therapy and recurred.
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding erdafitinib, refer to the
latest version of the Investigator's Brochure (IB)  and Addenda for erdafitinib.
The term "sponsor" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact
Information page(s) , which will be provided as a separate document.
2.1. Study Rationale
Bladder cancer is the tenth most common malignancy worldwide, with an estimated 549,000 new
cas
es and 200,000 deaths reported in 2018.7 Seventy percent of these patients are diagnosed with
an 
early stage NMIBC.26 Approximately 25% of NMIBC patients with poorly differentiated, low-
stage tumors are considered to have ‘high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer’ (high-risk
NMIBC; including high-grade pTa, pTis, and pT1) .24The natural history of high-risk NMIBC is
unpredictable; rates of recurrence vary from 15 to 78%, and rates of progression to muscle invasion
and metastasis vary from <1 to 45%,42and long-term outcomes suggest that around 20 to 25% of
these patients die from bladder cancer.43
The mainstay of treatment for high-risk NMIBC is TURBT (biopsy only for patients with CIS)
followed by intravesical treatment with BCG. Primary radical cystectomy is an option for some
patients. Approximately 30 to 40% of patients will experience recurrence after BCG therapy.6
Valrubicin is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved intravesical treatment
for BCG-refractory CIS in patients who are unfit or unwilling to undergo cystectomy. Valrubicin
is not approved for treatment of papillary disease. The CR rate after valrubicin treatment is 18%,
and 4% of patients are disease-free 2 years following therapy.15 Once the disease progresses to
muscle-invasive bladder cancer, prognosis is poor, even with combined-modality therapy, with a
10-year OS of 36%. Hence, radical cystectomy is considered the standard of care for any patient
with BCG-unresponsive high-grade NMIBC.5,29
Radical cystectomy entails high morbidity (up to 60%)  and negatively affects HRQoL. These
comorbidities occur even in high-volume centers of excellence and regardless of open versus
robotic approaches.34The procedure itself has a mortality rate of 3%.40Hence, some patients refuse
surgery. Additionally, some patients are medically unfit for surgery due to such factors as age,
functional status, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, comorbidities, body mass

intact bladder.
Fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR1 to FGFR4 are tyrosine kinases that are present in many
types of endothelial and tumor cells and are shown to play an important role in tumor cell growth,
survival, and migration as well as in maintaining tumor angiogenesis.25 There are varied
mechanisms for FGFR-related oncogenesis, including gene amplification, mutations, and
fusions.13  FGFR3 genetic alterations are found in 60to 70% of early stage NMIBC.28The observed
frequency of FGFR alterations in bladder cancer changes with tumor stage and grade. For example,
in one study, TaG1 (158/257)  and TaG2 (139/239)  tumors displayed similar mutation frequencies
of 61.5% and 58.1%, respectively. The mutation frequency was lower among TaG3 (30/88;
34.1%) , T1G2 (7/26; 26.9%) , and T1G3 tumors (20/119; 17%) .23 Hernandez et al, in a prospective
cohort of 772 patients with NMIBC, showed that FGFR3 mutations are prevalent in low-grade Ta
and that these mutations are independent predictors of recurrence in patients with low-grade Ta
tumors.23,26
Erdafitinib is a pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In Study 42756493BLC2001
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , erdafitinib demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with metastatic urothelial
cancer and prespecified FGFR  mutations and fusions.36 The presence of  in

patients with NMIBC who recurred following BCG treatment. Erdafitinib differs in 3 aspects from
existing therapies: 1)  the treatment is a targeted therapy for a subset of patients with an activating
FGFR genetic aberration in the tumor; 2)  selected patients may benefit by avoiding or delaying
cystectomy; and 3)  erdafitinib is systemic therapy with proven efficacy in advanced disease and,
therefore, may safeguard against risk of developing invasive/metastatic disease.
2.2. Background
2.2.1. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors
Fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR1 to FGFR4 are tyrosine kinases that are present in many
types of normal and tumor cells and are shown to play an important role in tumor cell growth,
survival, and migration as well as in maintaining tumor angiogenesis.25 Upon binding to their
natural ligand, FGF family members, FGFRs dimerize and autophosphorylate the tyrosine residue
in the kinase domain activation loop to become fully activated. Activated FGFR further
phosphorylate multiple signaling proteins bound to their intracellular portion, resulting in
activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)  and PI3-kinase/Akt signaling
pathways. Other downstream signaling components of FGFRs include Src and Rsk. The result is
FGFR stimulation of cell growth, survival, migration, and differentiation, depending on the cell
type.
Overexpression of FGFRs, or aberrant regulation of their activity, has been implicated in many
forms of human malignancies including urothelial carcinoma. There are varied mechanisms for
FGFR-related oncogenesis including gene amplification, mutations, and fusions. Therefore,
targeting FGFRs with a small molecule kinase inhibitor is an attractive strategy for the
development of a novel cancer treatment.

FGFR3 genetic alterations are found in 60 to 70% of early stage NMIBC.28 The timing and
sequence of FGFR3 (and other mutations)  may correlate with bladder cancer stage and grade. The
observed frequency of FGFR alterations in bladder cancer changes with tumor stage and grade.
For example, in one study, TaG1 (158/ 257)  and TaG2 (139/239)  tumors displayed similar
mutation frequencies of 61.5% and 58.1%, respectively. The mutation frequency is lower among
TaG3 (30/88; 34.1%) , T1G2 (7/26; 26.9%) , and T1G3 tumors (20/119; 17%) .23 Hernandez et al,
in a prospective cohort of 772 patients with NMIBC, showed that FGFR3 mutations are prevalent
in low-grade Ta and that these mutations are independent predictors of recurrence in patients with
low-grade Ta tumors.23,26 In a more recent study with pooled dataset of matched clinical and
genomic data for 263 patients with stage pT1 showed that FGFR alterations were frequent in high-
risk pts(39% mutations, 6% fusions, not mutually exclusive) . Additionally, this study distinct from
previous reports, showed that prognosis for patients with FGFR alterations was not different from
those without FGFR alterations .8
2.2.2. Erdafitinib
Nonclinical Studies
Erdafitinib has been shown to have high affinity and low nanomolar inhibitory activity for all
FGFR family members, FGFR 1, 2, 3 and 4. It has demonstrated activity in FGFR
pathway-activated cancer cell lines including squamous non-small cell lung cancer, gastric, breast,
hepatocellular cancer, endometrial, bladder, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia.
Target inhibition and pathway modulation have been demonstrated in cellular models at active
cellular concentrations. Brief exposure to erdafitinib has been demonstrated to result in long-term
target inhibition. Erdafitinib has been shown to have in vivo antitumor activity in mouse xenograft
models of FGFR-driven gastric, bladder, and squamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
tumor models, and in patient-derived xenografts from squamous NSCLC, gastric, breast, and
hepatocellular tumors.
An in vitro metabolism study in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes showed major
involvement of cytochrome 450 (CYP)  enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Long terminal phase half-
life of erdafitinib (>50 hours)  in plasma was observed resulting in approximately 3-fold
accumulation of C maxand area under the curve (AUC)following multiple daily dosing.
Clinical Studies
In humans, erdafitinib exhibited dose-related increase in the maximum concentration (C max)  and
AUC and time-independent PK within the dose range of 0.5 mg to 12 mg, both after single and
multiple daily dosing. Median time to maximum concentration (t max)  observed ranged from 2 to 4
hours (erdafitinib as capsule) . Relative bioavailability was comparable under fed and fasted
conditions. Erdafitinib is highly bound to plasma proteins such as α1-acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) .
Free fractions of erdafitinib in human plasma were small (average ~0.36%) . Erdafitinib is a
P-glycoprotein (P-gp)substrate.

observed in subjects with urothelial cancer with selected FGFR aberrations, as well as other solid
tumors. For all subjects with relapsed/refractory urothelial cancer, the overall response rate (ORR)
across dose levels was 40.0% (12/30 subjects) . At the 9 mg dose level, ORR was
70.0% (7/10 subjects)  for response-evaluable subjects with urothelial cancer who harbored
selected FGFR aberrations. The most frequently reported adverse events were hyperphosphatemia
(65%) , dry mouth (46%) , asthenia (45%) , stomatitis (39%) , constipation (37%) , and decreased
appetite (34%) .
In the global Phase 2 study (Study 42756493BLC2001, n=210) , the antitumor effect of erdafitinib
was further demonstrated in subjects with relapsed/refractory advanced urothelial cancer with
defined FGFR mutations and gene fusions. In this study, multiple dosing regimens were evaluated
including the 6-mg and 8 mg-daily regimens with up-titration. Subjects enrolled in the erdafitinib
6-mg daily regimen (78 subjects)  received the 6-mg daily starting dose with up-titration to 8 mg
daily or remained at the 6-mg daily dose based on the phosphate level measured at Cycle 2 Day 1.
Subjects enrolled in 8-mg daily regimen (99 subjects)  received the 8-mg daily starting dose with
up-titration to 9 mg daily or remained at the 8-mg daily dose based on the phosphate level
measured on Cycle 1 Day 14. Selected efficacy and safety data from the BLC2001a study for the

2.2.3. Comparator Drugs
Subjects in Cohort 1 who are assigned to receive treatment with Investigator’s Choice will receive
either intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic MMC. The subject’s treating
physician will determine during screening based on clinical judgment, which comparator,
gemcitabine or MMC/hyperthermic MMC, is appropriate for the individual subject.
2.2.3.1. Gemcitabine
Gem
citabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibition of DNA
poly
merase and ribonucleotide reductase. It is cell cycle-specific for the S-phase of the cycle.
Gem
citabine has been extensively studied as a salvage intravesical chemotherapeutic option with
man
y different regimens. Intravesicular gemcitabine may have similar efficacy and lower
inc
idence of dysuria and hematuria compared with BCG.45 For patients with high-risk NMIBC
who are unresponsive to BCG and who are unsuitable for radical cystectomy, bladder sparing
strategies are warranted, indicatingthatthe use of intravesical use of gemcitabine and MMC should
be considered.18 In a multicenter Phase 2 study of 58 patients who had undergone 2 or more prior
BCG courses, gemcitabine demonstrated a 12-month disease-free rate of 28%.38 Although a

of ind
uction intravesical BCG, a Phase 2 randomized trial demonstrated that intravesical
gem
citabine was associated with a superior 2-year RFS compared to BCG (19% versus 3%;
p<0
.008)  among patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive recurrence after a single course of
BCG,
 albeit with no significant difference in progression.14
An 
intravesical regimen of 2 g gemcitabine weekly for 6 weeks and then monthly to 12 months
was
 used in the SWOG S0353 study.38 Intravesical administration of gemcitabine can lead to local
irritation of bladder, which can lead to a sense of urination, burning during urination, infection,
abdominal pain, fever, and rarely ulcers in bladder. Refer to current product labeling for additional
information.
2.2.3.2. Mitomycin C
Mitomycin C is the only approved chemotherapeutic among the class of mitomycin therapies and
is 
often referred to as mitomycin. Mitomycin alkylates DNA to produce DNA cross-linking
(pr
imarily with guanine and cytosine pairs)  and inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. Mitomycin is
not 
cell cycle-specific but has its maximum effect against cells in late G and early S phases.
Mul
tiple studies have evaluated MMC for the treatment of bladder cancer. Intravesicular MMC
has also been evaluated extensively and widely used in patients who are unresponsive to BCG and
who 
are unsuitable for radical cystectomy. Mitomycin C was evaluated by Addeo et al. in 120
pre
viously treated patients. After a median follow-up of 36 months, MMC demonstrated a
rec
urrence-free rate of 61%,and therapy was generally well tolerated.1Di Stasi et al used a regimen
of 6 w
eekly treatments, a further 6 weekly treatments for nonresponders, and 10 monthly follow-
up 
treatments for responders.16 Intravesical administration of MMC can lead to local irritation of
bladder, which can lead to a sense of urination, burning during urination, infection, abdominal
pain, fever, and rarely ulcers in bladder. Refer to current product labeling for additional
information.
2.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment
Patients with high-risk NMIBC who recurred after BCG treatment are at high risk for adverse
outcomes with an 11.4% probability of progression at 1 year and a disease-specific death rate of
4.8% at 1 year.9 Hence, both the American Urological Association (AUA) and European
Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend radical cystectomy as the only standard
therapy for these patients. There is an ongoing shortage of BCG necessitating development of
strategies to prioritize use of intravesical BCG (alternate schedule and reduced dose approaches)
and identify alternate treatment approaches, such as use of intravesical chemotherapies.
Consequently, many patients are either not receiving the full prescribed dose of BCG, or not
receiving BCG treatment at all, and are being treated with intravesical chemotherapeutic agents.
Additionally, a proportion of patients do not tolerate the full dose or course of BCG treatment.
Data presented by Richards et al of US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER) -Medicare database evaluating 39,532 NMIBC patients demonstrated that only 30% of
intermediate-risk and 29% of high-risk patients received adequate BCG.33

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023The superiority of BCG compared with intravesical chemotherapy to prevent recurrence of
high-risk NMIBC is proven. However, the optimal number of induction instillations and the
optimal frequency and duration of maintenance instillations is not fully known. Afull dose of BCG
must comprise 1 full vial with a minimum of 1 x 108 colony forming units (CFU) . The largest
individual study of 1,355 patients (EORTC 30962)  compared different BCG strengths (full dose
vs 1/3 dose)  and different BCG maintenance schedules (1 year vs 3 years)  and found no difference
in RFS between 1/3 dose and full dose administered for either 1 year or 3 years.31 Although a
subset of high-risk patients treated with a 3-year full dose schedule had an improved RFS with no
difference in progression or survival, the study was not formally powered to test this hypothesis.
Many patients are medically unfit to undergo surgery and some refuse due to the high morbidity
(up to 60%)  the procedure entails and negative effects on quality of life. These comorbidities occur
even in high-volume centers of excellence and regardless of open versus robotic approaches.34The
procedure itself has a mortality rate of 3%.40 Hence, some patients refuse surgery. Additionally,
some patients are medically unfit for surgery due to such factors as age, functional status,
American Society of Anesthesiologists class, comorbidities, body mass index, etc. Valrubicin is
the only FDA-approved intravesical treatment for BCG-refractory CIS in patients who are unfit or
unwilling to undergo cystectomy. The CR rate after valrubicin treatment is 18%; 4% of patients
are disease-free at 2 years following therapy.15 Other salvage therapies such as intravesical
gemcitabine have shown activity.12
The FGFR pathway has a central role in the pathogenesis of NMIBC. Thirty percent of patients
progressing to high-risk NMIBC harbor FGFR3 mutations. Furthermore, the molecular luminal
subtype of bladder cancer, which is enriched with the FGFR3 mutation, has an immunoquiescent
immune signature suggesting that they may not benefit from immunotherapy.11 In clinical studies
in the advanced bladder cancer disease setting, erdafitinib treatment resulted in durable antitumor
response. Corresponding DoR, progression-free survival (PFS) , and OS endpoints suggest clinical
benefit for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have FGFR
alterations and have relapsed after platinum-based chemotherapy. FGFR mutation is an early
molecular event in bladder cancer and appears to be one of the main drivers of bladder
carcinogenesis. Study BLC2001 demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy in heavily pretreated
metastatic bladder cancer patients. Metastatic bladder cancer is well known to have clonal
evolution and higher genomic instability compared with earlier stages of disease, such as NMIBC.
Therefore, it was hypothesized that testing erdafitinib in early-stage bladder cancer might offer
clinically meaningful benefit for patients with FGFR mutations.
The potential risks of erdafitinib to adults, include central serous retinopathy and

HY POTHESIS
For Cohort 1, erdafitinib treatment will delay the onset of tumor recurrence for subjects with
papillary disease only, who recurred after BCG treatment, with FGFR mutations or fusions, and
with all lesions removed.
For Cohort 2, erdafitinib treatment will lead to CR for subjects with CIS with or without papillary
disease and FGFR mutations or fusions.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
Thi
s is an open-label, global, multicenter, randomized, Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of
erd
afitinib in subjects with NMIBC and FGFR mutations or fusions (see Section 5.1) .
Cohor
t 1 (n=240 planned) will include subjects with high-risk NMIBC presenting as papillary
tum
or only, with disease recurrence after BCG therapy, and who either refuse or are not eligible
for 
cystectomy. It is essential that the subject’s refusal to receive or medical ineligibility for
cys
tectomy be documented clearly in source documents at screening (see Section 10.2, Source
Docu
ments) . The reason for not being eligible for cystectomy or for refusing cystectomy will be
ent
ered into the eCRF. These subjects will be assigned randomly 2:1 to treatment with either
erd
afitinib or the investigator’s choice of either intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical
MMC
/hyperthermic MMC (Investigator’s Choice) , respectively. Randomization will be stratified
by t
umor stage (Ta vs T1)  and type of prior BCG therapy (BCG-unresponsive vs BCG-
exp
erienced) . BCG strain administered will also be documented in the eCRF. Investigators must
choo
se between intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic MMC  for each
sub
ject at screening, and the choice of agent must take prior exposure into consideration. Peri-
oper
ative intravesical chemotherapy prior to study entry per local standard of care and prior
imm
unotherapy (eg, PD1 inhibitor etc)are allowed.
Cohor
t 2 and Cohort 3 are exploratory.
Cohor
t 2 (n=20 planned)  will include subjects with high-risk, BCG-unresponsive NMIBC
pre
senting as CIS with or without concurrent papillary tumor, who either refuse or are not eligible
for 
cystectomy. The reason for not being eligible for cystectomy or for refusing cystectomy will
be 
entered into the eCRF. All subjects enrolled into Cohort 2 will receive treatment with
erd
afitinib. Peri-operative intravesical chemotherapy prior to studyentry per local standard of care
and
 prior immunotherapy (eg, PD1 inhibitor etc)  are allowed. Additionally, subjects in this cohort
may
 receive chemotherapy as bridging therapy after adequate BCG therapy while being considered
for 
trial.
Cohor
t 3 (n=20 planned)  will be enrolled at select study sites and will include subjects with
int
ermediate-risk NMIBC presenting as papillary disease only. All previous tumors for these
sub
jects must be low grade (G1-G2) , Ta or T1, with no previous CIS. Furthermore, subjects must
hav
e a risk of progression less than 5% for 2 years, and the risk of recurrence must be greater than
50% 
as calculated using the EORTC risk calculator.19 There are no predefined BCG or intravesical
che
motherapy requirements for subjects enrolled in Cohort 3. All tumors must be removed except

a single, untouched 5 to 10 mm lesion. All subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 will receive treatment
wit
h erdafitinib.
The
 first approximately 20 subjects participating who receive erdafitinib (from any cohort)  will
prov
ide a 24-hour urine collection for assessment of erdafitinib pharmacokinetics.
The
 primary endpoint for Cohort 1 is RFS. Exploratory endpoints for Cohort 2 are CR rate at
8 wee
ks, CR rate at 32 weeks, and DOR. Exploratory endpoints for Cohort 3 are CR rate, best
over
all response (BOR) , and DOR. A diagram of the study design is provided in Section 1.2,
Sche
ma.
The study comprises molecular eligibility, screening, treatment, follow-up, and LTE phases. For
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, molecular eligibility will be established for each potential subject before
screening for other eligibility criteria. This assessment may be performed by either the central
laboratory or by sponsor review of existing local laboratory reports generated by a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) -certified10 or equivalent laboratory. Molecular-
eligible subjects may then be screened for remaining eligibility criteria. For Cohort 3, see
Section 8.1.1.2 for guidelines to establish molecular eligibility. Subjects being considered for the
study before the TURBT, will provide a voided urine sample after disease recurrence and before
TURBT. These subjects must sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF)  for Urine Sample for Assay
Development. Subjects being considered for study after TURBT will not provide this urine sample.
Subjects with T1 disease will undergo TURBT of the base of the lesion (the biopsy should contain
muscle fibers)  before study entry to ensure the absence of muscle-invasive disease. If there are no
muscle fibers in the biopsy, the subject must undergo re-TURBT before randomization or
enrollment and must have evidence of uninvolved muscularis propria in the pathologic specimen
from either the first or the second TURBT.
The Treatment Phase will begin on Day 1 for subjects meeting all eligibility criteria, at which time
subjects will receive their study drug. Subjects receiving erdafitinib will take erdafitinib tablets
orally, 6 mg once daily for 28 days in a 28-day cycle. After review of safety and tolerability data
from approximately 5 to 10 additional subjects dosed with the 6-mg daily regimen (without up-
titration) , the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  may recommend a modification
of the dosing regimen to allow up-titration to the 8-mg daily regimen. The details of the IDMC
recommendation will be communicated in writing to the investigative sites and, per local
regulation, to health authorities. With the exceptions noted below for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3,
treatment may continue until the subject has high risk disease recurrence or progression,
intolerable toxicity, withdraws consent, there is a decision by the investigator to discontinue
treatment, or the study is closed, whichever occurs first. Treatment with erdafitinib may continue
for a maximum of 2 years.
 For Cohort 2, erdafitinib must be discontinued if CR is not observed within 3 months.
 For Cohort 3, after 3 months of study treatment: 1)  Subjects with stable disease or progression
of the marker lesion must discontinue erdafitinib and a TURBT of the marker lesion must be
performed. 2) Subjects with CR may continue erdafitinib. 3)  Subjects with PR may, at the

and undergo TURBT of the marker lesion.
For subjects in Cohort 1 who have locally confirmed high-risk recurrence on Investigator’s Choice,
the subject may cross over to erdafitinib (Section 10.10) . Note: no additional crossover from
Investigator’s Choice to erdafitinib will be permitted.
The Follow-up Phase includes a 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit, disease assessment follow-up, and
survival follow-up.
The LTE Phase will allow continued access to study drug for subjects who continue to derive
benefit from treatment, as determined by their investigator. Subjects may enter the LTE Phase
following implementation of Amendment 6, provided they meet the criteria for entry specified in
LTE Figure 1 . Limits for continuation of study drug in this phase are described in Section 6.7. No
data will be collected in the eCRF during the LTE Phase, and only SAEs will be reported to the
company safety repository. As an alternative to entering the LTE Phase, subjects receiving
erdafitinib may exit the study and continue to receive treatment on any other post-trial access
program, when permitted by local regulations. Detail regarding the LTE Phase (including a
Schedule of Activities)is provided in Section 10.14, Appendix 14.
Subjects will be assessed for disease response by cystoscopy and bladder mapping for detection of
new lesions, local assessment of urine cytology, and CT/MRIurograms. Tissue slides/blocks from
subjects in Cohort 1 with any locally confirmed recurrence or progression will be sent for central
histopathologic review. Health-related quality-of-life assessments will use the following PRO
measures: PGIS, PGIC, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24, and EQ-5D-5L. Note: PRO
assessment/data collection is no longer required for all subjects in all phases. Refer to Section 8.2,
Efficacy Assessments, for additional information. Safety assessments will include medical review
of adverse events, ophthalmologic assessment, targeted physical examinations, vital sign
measurements, 12-lead ECG assessments, clinical laboratory tests, and pregnancy testing (see
Section 8.3, Safety Assessments) .
An IDMC will be commissioned to review safety and efficacy data during the study, primarilyfor
Cohort 1 (refer to Committees Structure in Section 10.2, Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight
Considerations for details) . Due to the company decision to terminate study enrollment and
considering the recent IDMC review (6 July 2022)  found the safety of erdafitinib in this study to
be consistent with the known safety profile of erdafitinib, no further monitoring by the IDMC will
be conducted. The originally planned interim analyses will not be conducted.
Subjects who receive erdafitinib during the main study will have plasma erdafitinib concentration
measurements during the Treatment Phase for pharmacokinetic assessment.
Biomarker assessments will be performed for all subjects. Biomarker assessments include
molecular screening to determine eligibility for the study and exploratory DNA, RNA, and protein
analyses using archival or fresh biopsy tissue and blood (ctDNA) , as well as urine samples, for
exploratory biomarker research (see Section 8.9) . An additional urine sample will be collected for
assay development (see Section 8.9) .

Choice of Comparator for Cohort 1
While the primary treatment for high-risk NMIBC is transurethral resection (biopsy only for
patients with CIS)  followed by intravesical treatment with BCG, approximately 30 to 40% of
patients will experience recurrence after BCG therapy. For patients with , papillary NMIBC who
have high-risk NMIBC, the only recommended treatment option following progression or
recurrence after BCG therapy is radical cystectomy. However, many patients either are medically
unfit to undergo surgery or refuse it. In this setting, there are few effective treatment options
available.
There are very limited treatment options to treat BCG-unresponsive, high-risk papillary NMIBC.
In a multicenter Phase 2 study of 58 patients who had undergone 2 or more prior BCG courses,
gemcitabine demonstrated a 12-month disease-free rate of 28%.38 Furthermore, National
Comprehensive Cancer Care guidelines acknowledge gemcitabine as an option for treatment of
these patients.30 While a second induction of BCG may be an option for patients who recur or
per
sist after a single course of induction intravesical BCG, a Phase 2 randomized trial
dem
onstrated that intravesical gemcitabine was associated with a superior 2-year RFS compared
to BC
G (19% versus 3%; p<0.008)  among patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive recurrence
aft
er a single course of BCG, albeit with no significant difference in progression.14Mitomycin C
has also been evaluated and widely used in this setting, and in one study where BCG-refractory
NMIBC patients were followed up over a 15-month-period, 31% remained recurrence-free.39
Valrubicin is approved in the United States only for treatment of CIS; however, subjects in Cohort
1 are limited to those with papillarydisease only, and efficacy in the approved indication is limited
(see Section 2.1) .
Thus, the choice of gemcitabine and MMC/hyperthermic MMC as comparators to erdafitinib is
supported by current treatment practice and clinical data.2
Three-cohort Design
Urothelial bladder cancer is a heterogenous disease with 2 distinct pathways leading to bladder
carcinogenesis.28 The two-pathway’ model proposes that papillary NMIBC develops via epithelial
hyperplasia and recruitment of a branching vasculature; whereas, CIS is proposed to develop via
flat dysplasia. These 2 subtypes pose distinct challenges for clinical management and appear to be
directed by 2 separate molecular drivers.
Papillary bladder cancers, which constitute 80% of bladder cancer at diagnosis, have a more
insidious course compared with CIS. Despite its high recurrence rate (40-80%) , papillary NMIBC
generally shows a favorable prognosis. However, progression to muscle-invasive and/or metastatic
disease occurs in approximately 15% of patients, and once patients develop progression, their
prognoses are generally unfavorable.20 Papillary cancers are characterized by very high
frequencies of activating mutations in FGFR3 (>70% in early stages) . Conversely, CIS patients
make up ~20% of bladder cancer patients at diagnosis but have a high risk for progression to
muscle-invasive and metastatic disease. Patients with CIS commonly test positive for classical

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023tumor suppressor genes, most notably TP53 and RB1.28 Pietzak showed FGFR mutations in 5/22
(23%)  of NMIBC samples with concurrent papillary and CIS. FGFR positivity in a pure CIS
population has not been reported.32 Hence, Cohort 2 was originally planned to be a 20-subject
exploratory cohort.
Papillary disease and CIS are distinct entities at a molecular level and have different clinical
outcomes. However, aside from the option to resect papillary disease (but not CIS) , they are
currently treated uniformly with intravesical BCG, which is a tuberculosis-like mycobacterium
that produces a local immune response that mediates tumor regression. Even though most patients
initially respond to BCG, approximately 30 to 40% of patients will become unresponsive and
experience recurrence after BCG. These tumors are at high risk for progression, with a 1-year rate
for TiG3 of 11.4%, and patients are faced with the option of removal of the bladder.9 For patients
who are either unfit or refuse cystectomy there are very few treatment options available. Treatment
has not advanced for several decades, and new approaches to systemic therapy are needed.
It is prudent to differentiate across 2 separate cohorts, because papillary NMIBC and CIS are
different molecularly and prognostically. In Cohort 1 (papillary disease)  without active disease at
study entry, a randomized controlled study design using a time-to-event endpoint such as RFS is
acceptable. In Cohort 2 (CIS) , in absence of pharmacologic intervention or cystectomy, disease
will progress; and, therefore, a single-arm study with CR  rate as the primary endpoint is
appropriate (FDA BCG-unresponsive NMIBC: Developing Drugs and Biologics for Treatment;
Guidance for Industry) .
All current available treatments are applied as adjuvant therapy in patients with papillary NMIBC.
This precludes on-target efficacy assessment, as studies are done without measurable disease.
Hence, it is logical to test newer therapies on measurable cancer, such as a marker lesion, which
offers the prospect of avoiding treatment of patients with ineffective agents. A review of 23 well
documented marker lesion studies involving more than 1,200 patients suggest that marker lesion
studies are safe to perform without risk of progression in patients who have multiple recurrent,
non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors with all previous tumors being low grade (G1-G2)  Ta or T1,
no previous CIS, and negative urinary cytology. Subjects must have a risk of progression less than
5% for 2 years, and the risk of recurrence must be greater than 50% as calculated using EORTC
risk calculator.19,22 Hence, it is prudent to evaluate the marker lesion study as a separate cohort
(Cohort 3) , given that it will enroll a different risk group (intermediate risk)  compared with
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (high risk) .
Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Treatment Groups
An active control will be used in Cohort 1 to determine the sensitivity of the clinical endpoints in
this study. Randomization stratified by tumor stage (Ta vs T1)  and type of prior BCG therapy
(BCG-unresponsive vs BCG-experienced) will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of
subjects to treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes
(eg, demographic and baseline characteristics)  are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and
to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Neither the sponsor,
investigators, nor subjects will be blinded to treatment assignment in Cohort 1. Using a placebo

emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimately

Patient-reported Outcomes Research
Patient-reported outcome data complement data collected by other methods to support the clinical
data and cost-effectiveness modeling as well as contributing to enhanced communication of value
to patients, clinicians, regulators, and payers. The PRO endpoints of interest include domain scales
from the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC NMIBC24, and EQ-5D-5L. These PRO measures will be
administered to test the hypothesis that treatment with erdafitinib maintains HRQoL as measured
by time to symptom and functional deterioration by a prespecified meaningful change threshold.
PRO data will be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3)  to understand
how the endpoints change over time, with treatment and with the clinical state of the subject. Note:
PRO assessment/data collection is no longer required for all subjects in all phases.
Medical Resource Utilization Data Collection
Treatment of NMIBC with erdafitinib versus Investigator’s Choice may result in lower utilization
ofhealthcare resources.
4.2.1. Study-Specific Ethical Design Considerations
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during the
study, subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue
participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and
potential adverse events of the study, and provide their consent voluntarily will be enrolled.
The intermediate-risk population selected for the marker lesion cohort (Cohort 3)  has a low risk of
disease progression(less than 5% for 2 years) . Furthermore, the subjects are a molecularly selected
subgroup being treated with a targeted therapy given systemically that has shown clinical
efficiencyin metastatic bladder cancer. This mayfurther reduce any risk of progression. The safety
of subjects in this cohort will be closely monitored, as outlined in the Schedule of Activities.
Guidance has been provided in the protocol to limit the possibility that an ineligible subject is
enrolled into Cohort 3 (see Section 8.1.1.2 ) . This is expected to minimize the risk that subjects
with non-qualifying marker lesions will need to undergo additional cystoscopy and resection.
The total blood volume (approximately 682 mL)  that will be collected is considered within the
normal range allowed for this subject population over this time frame. An additional 682 mL may
be collected from subjects who participate in the Erdafitinib Crossover (see Section 10.10) . For

4.2.2. Participant Input Into Design
The results of the study may be made available to all participants through a plain language
summary; a technical summary of results on registries such as clinicaltrials.gov,
clinicaltrialsregister.eu or other national registries at the conclusion of the study according to local
standards/restrictions.
4.3. Justification for Dose
4.3.1. Erdafitinib Dose Selection
The starting dose of erdafitinib will be 6 mg daily. Erdafitinib will be provided as tablets for oral
administration. Subjects will be instructed to take a 6-mg daily dose on a continuous dosing
schedule. A cycle is defined as 28 days.
Clinical efficacy and safety data considered for dose selection are summarized in Section 2.2.2.
The erdafitinib dosing regimen of 6 mg daily (with and without up-titration)  has demonstrated
clinical activity with lower rates of Grades 3 to 4 drug-related TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs leading
to dose interruption, and drug-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation relative to the 8-mg daily
regimen (with up-titration)in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
The BLC2003 IDMC  reviewed safety data for the first 4 subjects treated with erdafitinib and
recommended the change in dosing to 6 mg daily. The lower dose of 6 mg daily (without up-
titration)
 this regimen with a lower dose of 6 mg
daily may be better suited, with respect to the overall risk-benefit profile, for the NMIBC patient
population without advanced, imminently life-threatening disease.
4.3.2. Gemcitabine Dose Selection
The 
dose of intravesical gemcitabine is 2,000 mg. Gemcitabine will be provided by the sponsor.
It will be administered at the site once weekly for at least 4 weeks of induction and then monthly
for at least 6 months. Additional doses of induction or maintenance are allowed per local standard
of care. Please refer to the gemcitabine Investigational Product Preparation Instructions (IPPI)for
additional information on the preparation, handling, and administration of gemcitabine.
It is the expert opinion in the AUA and EAU Guidelines that indicate if a high-risk NMIBC patient
is unwilling or unfit for cystectomy following BCG, a clinical trial or intravesical chemotherapy
is appropriate.4,17,18 Therefore, receiving intravesical gemcitabine in a clinical trial is a reasonable
option for patients who refuse or are unfit for cystectomy.

additional information on the preparation, handling, and administration of MMC.
Mitomycin C is indicated for intravesical infusion at the dose of 40 mg/40mL and the European

5.4. Screen Failures
Subject Identification, Enrollment, and Screening Logs
The investigator agrees to complete a subject identification and enrollment log to permit easy
identification of each subject during and after the study. This document will be reviewed by the
sponsor study-site contact for completeness. This study will use IWRS. The investigator will
generate screening and enrollment logs directly from IWRS.
The subject identification and enrollment log will be treated as confidential and will be filed by
the investigator in the study file. To ensure subject confidentiality, no copy will be made. All
reports and communications relating to the study will identify subjects by subject identification
and age at initial informed consent. In cases where the subject is not randomized (Cohort 1)  or
enrolled (Cohort 2 and Cohort 3)  into the study, the date seen and age at initial informed consent
will be used.
If insufficient tissue is available at the first molecular eligibility assessment, another tissue sample
may be submitted (this is not considered rescreening) . Subjects will be allowed to be rescreened
once for main study eligibility after consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor, if the
investigator has a valid reason to rescreen (eg, resolution of conditions previously meeting the
exclusion criteria) .
6. STUDY DRUG
For this study, study drug refers to erdafitinib (administered during the main study or Erdafitinib
Crossover; Section 10.10)and Investigator’s Choice provided by the sponsor. Study drugs used as

6.1.1. Erdafitinib
Erdafitinib will be provided as tablets for oral administration. Subjects will be instructed to take a
6-mg daily dose (without up-titration) beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1, with continuous dosing on a
28 day schedule. With the exceptions noted below for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, treatment with
erdafitinib may continue for a maximum of 2 years or until the subject has high risk disease
recurrence or progression, intolerable toxicity, withdraws consent, there is a decision by the
investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is closed, whichever occurs first.
 For Cohort 2, erdafitinib must be discontinued if CR is not observed within 3 months.
 For Cohort 3, after 3 months of study treatment: 1)  Subjects with stable disease or progression
of the marker lesion must discontinue erdafitinib and a TURBT of the marker lesion must be
performed. 2)  Subjects with CR may continue erdafitinib. 3)  Subjects with PR may, at the
investigator’s discretion, either continue treatment with erdafitinib or discontinue erdafitinib
and undergo TURBT of the marker lesion.
The erdafitinib dose may be modified with guidance to up-titrate to the 8-mg daily regimen, after
IDMC review of safety and tolerability data from approximately 5 to 10 additional subjects who
received the 6-mg daily regimen. Details of any such recommendation will be communicated
separately. Should the dosing regimen be modified to include up-titration, please follow the
instruction in Section 10.12Appendix 12.
Each dose should be taken at approximately the same time each day, with or without food.
Erdafitinib is to be taken with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces)  of water. The tablets should be
swallowed intact. Subjects shouldavoid consuming foodor drinks containing grapefruit orSeville
oranges due to CYP 3A4/5 inhibition. Refer to the pharmacy manual/study site investigational
product manual for additional guidance on study drug preparation, handling, and storage.
If a dose of erdafitinib is missed, subjects should take the missed dose as soon as possible up to
6 hours after the normal schedule of that day. If it has been more than 6 hours since the missed
dose, then that dose should be skipped, and resume the regular daily dose schedule for erdafitinib
the next day. Extra tablets should not be taken to make up for the missed dose. If vomiting occurred
with drug administration, no replacement dose will be taken. If the subject vomits up to 4 hours
after the study drug administration, document the study drug as administered on the dose form in
the eCRF, with a comment noting that the subject vomited and at how many hours after the study
drug administration.
On days when pharmacokinetic sampling is performed, erdafitinib dosing and predose
pharmacokinetic sample collection must be coordinated so that at least 4 hours have elapsed
between the last dose of erdafitinib and collection of the predose pharmacokinetic sample. This
may require that subjects receive their daily dose of erdafitinib at the study site after collection of
the predose pharmacokinetic samples.

be captured in the source documents. Unused study drug in the issued bottles and empty bottles
must be returned to the site at each study visit. Study drug must be returned to the site when a
subject discontinues study treatment. Returned tablets may not be reissued in this study or outside
the study (follow study drug accountability guidelines in the study Investigational Product
Procedures Manual [IPPM]) . Erdafitinib administration must be captured in the source documents
and the eCRF.
Erdafitinib will be manufactured and provided under the responsibility of the sponsor. Refer to the
IB for a list of excipients.
The exposure of erdafitinib is predicted to increase by 50% in subjects with the CYP2C9 *3/*3
genotype, estimated to be 0.4% to 3% of the population among various ethnic groups. Therefore,
monitor for increased adverse reactions in subjects who are known or suspected to have
CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. Dose titration is guided by serum phosphate levels in all subjects
irrespective of genotype; therefore, the implications of higher exposures of erdafitinib including
safety may be addressed.
6.1.2. Investigator’s Choice of Treatment –Cohort 1 Only
Subjects in Cohort 1 assigned to receive Investigator’s Choice will receive either intravesical
gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic MMC. Investigator’s choice treatment will be
given once weekly for at least 4 doses of induction followed by monthly maintenance for at least
6 months. Additional doses of induction or maintenance are allowed per local standard of care.
If more than 4 induction doses are given and the start of the monthly maintenance dose falls on
Day 8, Day 15, or Day 22 of subsequent cycles, all corresponding pre-dose assessments should be
done on the same day (±2 days)  as the maintenance dose is administered as highlighted in the
example below:
 If subject starts monthly maintenance at C2D8, the following visits will occur at C3D8;
C4D8; C5D8; C6D8; C7D8; C8D8.
 If subject starts monthly maintenance at C2D15, following visits will occur at C3D15;
C4D15; C5D15; C6D15; C7D15; C8D15.
 If subject starts monthly maintenance at C2D22, following visits will occur at C3D22;
C4D22; C5D22; C6D22; C7D22; and C8D22.
Treatment may continue until treatment is completed, high risk disease recurrence, intolerable
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, a decision by the investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study
is closed, whichever occurs first. As all subjects in Cohort 1 would have recurred within 12 months
of last dose of BCG, they are considered not to be candidates for re-treatment with BCG.21
Dose modifications or omissions will be managed by the treating physician per local standard of
care after discussion with the sponsor. Investigators must indicate their Investigator’s Choice
selection for each subject in the interactive web response system (IWRS)  at screening, and the

Refer to the IPPI provided separately for additional information on the preparation, handling, and
administration of MMC/hyperthermic MMC.
6.1.3. Continuation of Treatment After Disease Recurrence
Subjects will not continue erdafitinib treatment after high risk disease recurrence or progression.
For subjects in Cohort 1 who have locally confirmed high-risk recurrence on Investigator’s Choice,
the subject maycross over to erdafitinib, if bythe assessment of investigator, this is best treatment
option for subject (Section 10.10) . Subjects will have an End-of-Treatment (EoT) Visit for the
comparator and begin the crossover with erdafitinib beginning at C1D1. Note: no additional
crossover from Investigator’s Choice to erdafitinib will be permitted.
In Cohort 2 or Cohort 3, erdafitinib must be discontinued at the time of progression or recurrence
as described in Section 6.1.1.

6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Preparation/Handling/Storage
Refer to the study pharmacy manual (Investigational Product Binder) /study IPPI and IPPM for
additional guidance on study drug preparation, handling, and storage.
Accountability
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study drug received at the site is inventoried
and accounted for throughout the study. The dispensing of study drug to the subject, and the return
of study drug from the subject (if applicable) , must be documented on the drug accountability
form. Subjects, or their legally acceptable representatives where applicable, must be instructed to
return all original containers, whether empty or containing study drug. All study drugwill be stored
and disposed of according to the sponsor's instructions. Study-site personnel must not combine
contents of the study drug containers.
Study drugmust be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label and must
be stored at the study site in a limited-access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate
environmental conditions. Unused study drug, and study drug returned by the subject, must be
available for verification by the sponsor's study site monitor during on-site monitoring visits. The
return to the sponsor of unused study drug, or used returned study drug for destruction, will be
documented on the drug return form. When the study site is an authorized destruction unit and
study drug supplies are destroyed on-site, this must also be documented on the drug return form.
Study drug should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified member of
the study-site personnel, or by a hospital/clinic pharmacist. Study drug will be supplied only to
subjects participating in the study. Returned study drug must not be dispensed again, even to the
same subject. Whenever a subject brings his or her study drug to the study site for pill count, this
is not seen as a return of supplies. Study drug may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other
subjects. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study drug from, nor store it at, any site
other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. Further guidance and information for the
final disposition of unused study drugs are provided in the study IPPI and IPPM.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
This is an open-label study; neither the sponsor, investigators, nor subjects will be blinded to
assigned treatment. Central randomization will be implemented in this study. In Cohort 1, subjects
will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 randomization ratio (erdafitinib:
Investigator’s Choice)based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the
study by or under the supervision of the sponsor. The randomization will be balanced by using
randomly permuted blocks and will be stratified by the type of resected papillary disease (Ta vs
T1)  and type of prior BCG therapy (BCG-unresponsive vs BCG experienced) . Subjects in the

IWRS will assign a unique code, which will dictate the study drug assignment and matching study
drug kit for the subject. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal
identification number when contacting the IWRS and will then give the relevant subject details to
uniquely identify the subject. Investigators must indicate their Investigator’s Choice selection for
each subject during screening. All tissue samples with a local investigator assessment of any
recurrence will be sent to central lab for an independent pathologic assessment regardless of risk
category in order to decrease bias.
All subjects in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will be assigned to treatment with erdafitinib.
6.4. Study Drug Compliance
The investigator or designated study personnel will maintain a log of the amount of study drug
dispensed and returned, if applicable. Drug supplies will be inventoried and accounted for
throughout the study.
Subjects will receive instructions on erdafitinib compliance at their Cycle 1 Day 1 visit. The time
of erdafitinib intake will be recorded on days when PK sampling occurs. On days when the subject
visits the study site for dose administration or PK sampling, the investigator or designee will
supervise administration of the study drug and the exact time of administration will be recorded in
the eCRF. During the study, the investigator or designated study research staff will be responsible
for providing additional instruction to reeducate any subject who is not compliant with the study
drug schedule.
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant therapiesmust be recorded at the time of study screening(concomitant therapy within
the 35 days before Cycle 1 Day 1) , during the Treatment Phase, and up to 30 days after the last
dose of study drug(30-day Safety Follow-up Visit) . All therapies (prescription or over-the-counter
medications)  continued at the start of the study or started during the study and different from the
study drug must be recorded in the eCRF.
The sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter)  of any instances in
which prohibited therapies are administered.
In addition to concomitant therapy, all prior anticancer therapy will be recorded in the eCRF.
6.5.1. Permitted Medications
Permitted medications are to be recorded at the time of screening (within 35 days prior to the first
dose of study drug) , throughout the study, and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug in the
appropriate section of the eCRF.
 Symptomatic treatment: Supportive care, such as antibiotics, analgesics, transfusions, etc.,
and concomitant medications for the symptomatic treatment of related toxicities (Grade 1 to
4)  may be administered according to the standard of care at the site, and the treating
physician’s discretion, as clinically indicated.

 Chronic supportive therapies are permitted as medically necessary.
 COVID-19 vaccination: Note: Administration of non-live vaccines approved or authorized
for emergency use (eg, COVID-19)  by local health authorities are allowed before or during
this study.
6.5.2. Prohibited Medications
The following concomitant medications are prohibited during the study. The sponsor must be
notified in advance, or as soon as possible thereafter, of any instances in which prohibited therapies
were administered.
 Concurrent investigational agents during the Treatment Phase
 Concurrent antineoplastic agents or hormonal anticancer therapy during the Treatment Phase,
except as allowed by Exclusion Criterion no. 4 (see Section 5.2)
6.5.3. Precautions for Concomitant Medications
The following precautions are advised:
 Based on in vitro data, erdafitinib is metabolized by cytochrome CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. A
clinical DDI study showed that on average, erdafitinib exposure (C max and AUC)  was
increased by 5% to 34%, respectively, when co-administered with itraconazole (a strong
inhibitor of CYP3A4)  and 21% to 48%, respectively, when co-administered with fluconazole
(a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9) . For this reason, strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9
inhibitors should be used with caution (See Section 10.9) . Consider alternative therapies with
no or minimal CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inhibition potential during treatment with erdafitinib. If
co-administration of a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 or strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 is
unavoidable, monitor the subject closely for adverse reactions and consider dose
modifications accordingly. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the erdafitinib dose may be
increased in the absence of drug-related toxicity.
 The impact of moderate CYP2C9 inducers and strong CYP3A inducers (such as rifampin)  on
erdafitinib was not clinically studied. Co-administration of erdafitinib with these agents may
significantly decrease erdafitinib exposure. Therefore, the concomitant use of these agents
with erdafitinib should be avoided (see Section 10.9) . Co-administration of erdafitinib with
moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease erdafitinib exposure. Caution should be exercised
for concomitant administration of erdafitinib and moderate inducers of CYP3A4
(see Section 10.9) .
 Until further data become available, concomitant use of erdafitinib with CYP3A4 substrates
with narrow therapeutic indices should be avoided.
 Erdafitinib was shown to inhibit, via in vitro experiments, human P-gp at concentrations
achieved at therapeutic doses in humans. If the compound is administered with drugs that are
substrates of P-gp, there is the potential for observing increased concentrations of the substrate
drug. Caution should be exercised for co-administered drugs that are P-gp substrates; separate

us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023erdafitinib administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates
with narrow therapeutic index.
 Erdafitinib was shown to be an OCT2 inhibitor in vitro. PBPK simulations with metformin,
an OCT2 substrate, predicted a lack of clinically relevant interaction with erdafitinib.
However, until further data are available, consider reducing the dose of OCT2 substrates or
consider alternative agents based on tolerability.
 For subjects taking erdafitinib, medications known or thought to increase serum levels of
phosphate including potassium phosphate supplements (oral or IV) , vitamin D supplements,
antacids, and phosphate-containing enemas and laxatives (oral/rectal) should be used with
caution in case of strong medical need and when the benefit outweighs the risk. Check
phosphate levels more regularly during treatment.
6.6. Dose Modification
Any dose/dosage adjustment should be overseen by medically-qualified study-site personnel
(principal or subinvestigator unless an immediate safety risk appears to be present) .
6.6.1. Erdafitinib Up-titration Guidelines
The erdaftinib dose is modified to the 6-mg daily regimen (without up-titration) . After review of
safety and tolerability data from approximately 5 to 10 additional subjects who received the 6-mg
daily regimen, the IDMC may recommend that the erdafitinib dose be modified to allow
up-titration to the 8-mg daily regimen. Details of any such recommendation will be communicated
separately. Should the dosing regimen be modified to include up-titration, please follow the
instruction in Section 10.12, Appendix 12.
6.6.2. Erdafitinib Dose Interruptions
Treatment with erdafitinib should be discontinued or modified based on toxicities as described in
Table 1 . For eye, skin/nail, dry mouth/mucositis, and phosphate toxicity, specific
recommendations in the management guidelines are provided in Section 6.6.2.1 .

 If erdafitinib is interrupted consecutively for 1 week or longer due to drug-related toxicity, the
study drug may be reintroduced at either the same dose level or the first reduced dose level
following recovery from the toxicity (see dose reduction levels in Table 2 ) . A second dose
reduction may be implemented following a second occurrence of drug-related toxicity.
 If erdafitinib must be withheld for more than 28 days for a drug-related adverse event that
fails to resolve to an acceptable level (eg, ≤Grade 1 non-hematologic toxicity or back to
baseline) , treatment with erdafitinib should be discontinued except when the subject has been
deriving benefit from treatment, and the investigator believes, based on his or her clinical
judgment, that continued treatment with erdafitinib is in the best interest of the subject.
Erdafitinib may be restarted at the same or a lower dose ( Table 2 )  if the sponsor’s medical
monitor concurs with the assessment.
 If the erdafitinib dose was reduced and the adverse event that was the reason for this dose
reduction has completely resolved, the dose may be re-escalated to the next higher dose if the
subject was deriving benefit from treatment, and the investigator believes, based on his or her
clinical judgment, that dose re-escalation of erdafitinib is in the best interest of the subject and
the sponsor’s medical monitor concurs with the assessment.
 In all cases of clinically significant impaired wound healing or imminent surgery or potential
bleeding complications, it is recommended that dose administration be interrupted,
appropriate clinical laboratory data (eg, coagulation parameters)  be carefully monitored, and
supportive therapy administered, where applicable. Dose administration may be restarted
when it is considered safe and at an appropriate dose, according to the investigator’s
assessment.

Vision Changes
Any new or worsening visual symptoms, for example, blurred vision, partial or complete loss of
vision, double vision, floaters or color spots or halos around light, change in color or night vision,
photophobia, ocular pain or stinging sensation, or foreign body sensation should be further
evaluated and managed per the guidelines in Table 11 .
Amsler grid (illustrated in Section 10.8) : For any positive Amsler grid test, the subject should be
referred for a full ophthalmologic examination within 7 days. However, if the subject has an
abnormal Amsler grid test and otherwise normal ophthalmologic examination at baseline (during
screening) , a repeat ophthalmologic examination would be recommended only if, in the opinion
of the investigator, there is a likelihood of significant change from the subject’s baseline Amsler
grid test at screening, or the subject has developed new clinical symptoms.

 General considerations: Avoid unnecessary exposure to sunlight, use sunglasses in bright
light.
 Prophylactic management: Frequent use of artificial tear substitutes and ocular demulcents
is strongly recommended, ie, every 2 hours during time awake.
 Reactive management :
 Withhold erdafitinib for Grade 3 toxicity
 Artificial tear substitutes if not started, every 2 hours during time awake
 Ocular demulcents
 Severe treatment-related dry eye should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist
6.6.3. Investigator’s Choice Dose Modification
Changes to intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic MMC dose or regimen
for subjects in Cohort 1 assigned to receive Investigator’s Choice (ie, additional doses of induction
or maintenance)  will be directed by local standard of care at the study site (see Section 6.1.2) .
6.7. Access to Study Drug in the Long-term Extension Phase
The LTE Phase will allow continued access to study drug for subjects who continue to derive
benefit from treatment, as determined by their investigator. Subjects may enter the LTE Phase
following implementation of Amendment 6, provided they meet the criteria for entry specified in
LTE Figure 1 .
The continuation of study drug in the LTE Phase is limited as follows:
 Erdafitinib (Cohort 1, Cohort 2, Cohort 3) : Provision of erdafitinib may continue for a
maximum of 2 years in total (inclusive of administration in the Treatment Phase, Erdafitinib
Crossover, and the LTE Phase, as applicable) or until the investigator decides it is in the best
interest of the subject that erdafitinib be discontinued, whichever comes first.
 Investigator’s choice of either intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic
MMC (Cohort 1) : provision of intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic
MMC may continue per local standard of care.

7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG/SUBJECT
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL/STUDY CLOSURE
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug
A subject's study drug must be discontinued if:
 The subject withdraws consent to receive study drug.
 The investigator believes that for safety reasons or tolerability reasons (eg, adverse event)  it
is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study drug.
 The subject becomes pregnant; discontinuation of study drug in this instance should be
discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor.
 High-risk recurrence (Cohort 1)  or progression of disease (Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and Cohort 3)
is assessed, except as described in Section 6.1.3.
 Subject reaches the maximum treatment duration as defined in Section 6.1.
 The sponsor closes the study.
 The sponsor reserves the right to close the study or close the study site at any time for
any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor, e.g. in case of unacceptable risk,
intolerable toxicity, or change in the risk/benefit profile; this might include recurrence of
adverse events of which character, severity, or frequency is new in comparison to the
existing risk profile. Also, data derived from other clinical trials or toxicology studies
which negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment might cause discontinuation or
termination of the study.
Ifa subject discontinues study drug for any reason before the end of the Treatment Phase, an EoT
Visit should be performed. The primary reason for drug discontinuation will be clearly
documented in the subject’s medical record and recorded in the eCRF. Study drug assigned to the
subject who discontinued study drug may not be assigned to another subject.
7.2. Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
 Lost to follow-up
 Withdrawal of consent
 Death
When a subjectwithdraws before studycompletion, the reason for withdrawal is to be documented
in the eCRF and in the source document. If the reason for withdrawal from the study is withdrawal
ofconsent, then no additional assessments are allowed.

A subject declining to return for scheduled visits does not necessarily constitute withdrawal of
consent. Alternate follow-up mechanisms that the subject agreed to when signing the consent form
apply as local regulations permit.
7.2.1. Withdrawal From the Future Use of Research Samples
The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples for future research. In such a case, samples
will be destroyed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study. Details of the sample
retention for research are presented in the ICF.
7.3. Lost to Follow-up
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. A subject cannot be deemed lost to follow-
up until all reasonable efforts made by the study-site personnel to contact the subject are deemed
futile. The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the study site for a required
study visit:
 The study-site personnel must attempt to contact the subject to reschedule the missed visit as
soon as possible, to counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit
schedule, to ascertain whether the subject wishes to or should continue in the study.
 Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every
reasonable effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls, e-mails,
fax, and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address, or local
equivalent methods) . Locator agencies may also be used as local regulations permit. These
contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.
 Should the subject continue to be unreachable, they will be considered to have withdrawn
from the study.
Should a study site close, eg, for operational, financial, or other reasons, and the investigator cannot
reach the subjectto inform them, their contact information will be transferred to anotherstudy site.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The study comprises molecular eligibility, screening, treatment, follow-up, and LTE phases. The
frequency and timing of assessments and procedures to be performed are outlined in the Schedule
of Activities (Section 1.3)  and further discussed within this section.
All PRO assessments should be conducted and completed before any other tests, procedures, or
consultations to prevent influencing subject perceptions. Note: PRO assessment/data collection is
no longer required for all subjects in all phases.
Assessments and procedures should be completed on the day indicated (± window indicated) ; if
this is not possible because of a weekend, holiday, or emergency, the assessment or procedure
should be completed within 48 hours of the scheduled day.

us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023The amount of blood drawn from each subject in this study will be approximately 24 mL during
screening; 241 mL from C1D1 through Cycle 6; 288 mL from Cycle 6 through Cycle 24; 37 mL
at the EoT Visit; 12 mL during the safety follow-up; and 80 mL for subjects who have disease
assessments after recurrence/progression during the Follow-up Phase, for a total volume of
682 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons. Serum or urine
pregnancy tests should be performed for women of childbearing potential, as determined necessary
by the investigator or required by local regulation to establish the absence of pregnancy at any
time during the subject's participation in the study. The calculated volume of blood is an estimate;
the actual amount may vary depending on local laboratory standard procedures, a subject’s visit
schedule, and childbearing potential.
The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the source document and
laboratory requisition form. Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of
samples are found in the Laboratory Manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage,
and shipment of samples mustbe under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature
conditions as indicated in the Laboratory Manual.
8.1. Study Procedures
8.1.1. Screening
Screening will consist of a Molecular Eligibility Screening Phase and a Full-study Screening
Phase. Also, subjects being considered for the study before the TURBT, will provide a voided
urine sample after disease recurrence and before TURBT. These subjects must sign the ICF for
Assay Development prior to collection of this urine sample.
8.1.1.1. Molecular Eligibility Screening Phase (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)
Molecular eligibility can be established either by central laboratory testing or local testing. Consent
for molecular eligibility screening (but not full-study screening)  may be performed remotely
including consent by telephone or video consultation, unless not permitted according to local
guidance.
The molecular eligibility informed consent process may occur in 1 of 3 ways:
 If archived tissue is available, the Molecular Eligibility ICF is signed.
 If a new tissue biopsy is required, the Main-study ICF is signed.
 If a historical report (local testing)  is available indicating the subject is molecularly eligible
for the study, the Molecular Eligibility Requirement is determined complete and the subject
will sign the Main-study ICF.
If tissue is insufficient at the first molecular eligibility assessment, another tissue sample may
be submitted to the central laboratory (this is not considered rescreening) .
 During the Molecular Eligibility Screening Phase, tissue from 2 different times points may be
used to determine eligibility for this study, ie, pre-BCG Tissue specimen (tumor tissue
collected before subject receives BCG treatment for NMIBC)  or post-BCG Tissue specimen
(tumor tissue collected from recurrence after BCG treatment)(see Figure 2) :

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023Pre-BCG Tissue Molecular Screening
1) Archival tissue sample will be sent to the central laboratory for testing if the subjects meet both
of the following criteria:
a) Have had prior history of high or intermediate risk NMIBC
b) Have completed a minimum of initial BCG induction (at least 5 of 6 full doses of an initial
induction) .
The central laboratory will evaluate subjects for molecular eligibility by analyzing specimens
for the presence of FGFR mutations and gene fusions. The sponsor or central
laboratory/designee will communicate results of the molecular eligibility testing to the site. If
the subject is deemed molecularlyeligible for the study, the subject will be followed at the site
with routine standard of care. If the subject has a recurrent high risk NMIBC within 12 months
of last dose of BCG, then the subjectmaysign the Main-study ICF. If the subject does nothave
a recurrent high risk NMIBC at less than 12 months of last dose of BCG, then the subject is
molecularly ineligible for the study and is considered a molecular screen failure.
2) Subject with a historical report (local testing)  indicating the subject is molecularly eligible for
the study will be determined to have completed Molecular Eligibility Requirement. If the
subject has a recurrent high risk NMIBC within 12 months of last dose of BCG, then subjects
may sign the Main-study ICF.
Post-BCG Tissue Molecular Screening
1) Subjects with archival post-BCG tissue specimen with recurrent high risk NMIBC within
12 months of last dose of BCG will have a specimen sent to the central laboratory for testing.
The central laboratory will evaluate molecular eligibility by analyzing specimens for the
presence of FGFR mutations and gene fusions. The sponsor or central laboratory/designee will
communicate results of the molecular eligibility testing to the site. If a subject is deemed
molecularly eligible for the study, then the subject may sign the Main-study ICF.
2) Subjectswith recurrent high risk NMIBC within12 months of last dose of BCG and ahistorical
report (local testing)  indicating the subject is molecularly eligible for the study will be
determined to have completed Molecular Eligibility Requirement. These subjects maysign the
Main-study ICF.
For subjects with both pre-BCG and post-BCG tissue specimen available, the site pathologist
will determine best tissue for molecular testing. Additional tissue may be requested if a
specimen is not adequate for testing. If FGFR status is known from a locally tested NGS/PCR
assay, a subject will need to sign the Main-study ICF in order for tissue to be submitted to the
central laboratory for retrospective molecular eligibility confirmation.
Eligibility must be determined before randomization (Cohort 1)  or the first dose of study drug
(Cohort 2 and Cohort 3) . See Section 5.1, inclusion criteria for requirements regarding FGFR
mutations or fusions. For subjects in Cohort 2 with concurrent papillary disease, molecular

central confirmation of Molecular eligibility status. The results of this retrospective central
confirmation do not affect the subject’s eligibility for the study. Results of retrospective testing
will not be communicated to the site. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for instructions.
In countries/territories where the ANNAR protocol pre-screening has received approval to be
implemented, as required by health authorities or ethics, subjects may be identified for this study
by participation in the ANNAR pre-screening protocol (Study 42756493BLC0002) , during which
subjects with urothelial carcinoma undergo molecular eligibility testing. Those subjects who test
positive for the select FGFR mutations or fusions required for this study, will sign the Main-study
ICF and proceed to the Screening Phase. Tissue for central confirmation of FGFR status is not
submitted for these subjects as this step was completed as part of the ANNAR pre-screening
protocol.
8.1.1.2. Cohort 3 Molecular Eligibility
Additional provisions have been put in place to limit the possibility that subjects will be enrolled
into Cohort 3 without meeting molecular eligibility criteria.
1) It is anticipated that investigators will identify subjects with low-grade /intermediate-risk,
multi-focal papillary-only disease for possible enrollment into Cohort 3.
2) Identified subjects will sign the Molecular Eligibility ICF to determine FGFR status from
archived tissue sample, if available.
3) Subjects whose archived tissue sample meets the Molecular Eligibility Requirement will sign
the Main-study ICF before the next plannedTURBT and before any study-specific procedures
take place once routine surveillance cystoscopy shows multi-focal papillary only recurrence
(see Section 1.3) . Eligibility criteria will be assessed prior to the TURBT, so that a marker
lesion can be left behind after resection of other papillary lesions as appropriate. Submit tissue
from on-study TURBT for central confirmation of FGFR status. The results of this
retrospective central confirmation do not affect the subject’s eligibility for the study. Also,
results of retrospective confirmation studies will not be communicated to the site.
4) Subjects identified by the investigator but without archived tissue samples available for
molecular eligibility testing will sign the Main Study ICF before any study-specific procedure
takes place once routine surveillance cystoscopy shows multi-focal papillary-only recurrence
(see Section 1.3) . Before the TURBT is performed, the site will assess that the subject will
meet the other inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to leaving behind a marker lesion.
Molecular eligibility testing will be performed on recurrent papillary disease tissue collected
during the on-study TURBT. Subjects who fail the Molecular Eligibility Requirement at the
time of recurrence, will have the marker lesion resected.
8.1.1.3. Full-study Screening Phase
During the Full-study Screening Phase all subjects who have qualifying FGFR mutations or
fusions, as determined during the Molecular Eligibility Phase, will consent to the main study by
signing the Main-studyICF. The Full-study Screening Phase includes the interval between signing
the Main-study ICF and the day the subject is randomized (Cohort 1) or receives the first dose of

Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be performed over the course of 1 or
more days during the screening process. Molecular screening must start within 12 weeks after the
last TURBT done for high risk recurrence if molecular testing is being done on post-BCG
specimen.
The first HRQoL assessments will occur during the Screening Phase using the following PRO
measures: PGIS, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24, and EQ-5D-5L. Assessment of
PGIC will only occur during the Treatment Phase. The PRO measures will be electronically
(ePRO)  collected, according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) , to understand change over
time (all cohorts)  and difference between treatment groups (Cohort 1) . Patient-reported outcome
questionnaires should be completed before any other assessments at each clinic visit. Subjects
should be provideda private, quiet area to complete the questionnaires. The study site staff should
instruct the subject to carefully read the instructions and questions of the PRO instrument before
marking responses, that there are no right or wrong answers, and that their responses to the
questionnaire will not be used to determine their study eligibility. If a subject cannot read for any
reason, it is acceptable for the subject to have the questions read and responses marked on the
ePRO by an independent witness. Note: PRO assessment/data collection is no longer required for
all subjects in all phases.
Procedures conducted, before signing the Main-study ICF, as part of the subject’s routine clinical
management (eg, blood count, disease assessment)  may be used for screening orbaseline purposes
provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed within 35 days
prior to dosing (see Section 1.3) . All information associated with eligibility requirements must be
entered onto the appropriate eCRF. Requirements for biopsy specimens for histologic assessment
at screening are provided in Section 8.2.1. The subject’s previous anticancer therapies and TURBT
details, the dose and timing of administrations, and the subject’s responses to each therapy will be
collected and recorded in source documents and the eCRF.
Results from the screening evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before
enrollment. Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during
screening if the investigator believes that the results suspected to be due to test error or that the
underlying issue has been resolved. For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent
available results before initiation of study drug will be used to determine subject eligibility.
8.1.2. Treatment Phase
The Treatment Phase will begin on Cycle 1 Day 1 following randomization or enrollment into the
study. Subjects may be randomized up to 1 day before C1D1 but no later than C1D1 predose. With
the exceptions noted below for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, treatment may continue until the subject
has high risk disease recurrence or progression, intolerable toxicity, withdraws consent, there is a
decision by the investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is closed, whichever occurs first.
For subjects receiving erdafitinib, treatment may continue for a maximum of 2 years.
 For Cohort 2, erdafitinib must be discontinued if CR is not observed within 3 months.

of the marker lesion must discontinue erdafitinib and a TURBT of the marker lesion must be
performed. 2)  Subjects with CR may continue erdafitinib. 3)  Subjects with PR may, at the
investigator’s discretion, either continue treatment with erdafitinib or discontinue erdafitinib
and undergo TURBT of the marker lesion.
For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, during the Treatment Phase, subjects who demonstrate a positive urine
cytology with a negative cystoscopy will remain on study drug until the next disease assessment.
If both the urine cytology and cystoscopy are positive for high-risk recurrence (high-grade Ta, T1
or CIS)  or progression at the next disease assessment, the subject will discontinue study drug.
For subjects randomized to Investigator’s Choice, refer to Section 6.1.2 for study drug
administration.
Adverse events occurring any time after the subject signs the Main-study ICF until 30 days after
the last dose of study drug in the Treatment Phase are to be recorded for all subjects. With the
exception of hyperphosphatemia (see Table 3 ) , adverse event information will be graded using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) ,
Version 5.0. See Section 10.3 for complete details on adverse event reporting. Concomitant
medications will also be recorded following the discontinuation of treatment until 30 days after
last dose of study drug in the Treatment Phase.
Throughout the Treatment Phase, the investigator will assess response to study drug using findings
from cystoscopy, bladder mapping, urine cytology, and CT/MRI urogram. Biopsy of visible
lesions will be performed during cystoscopy or TURBT. Tissue slides/blocks from subjects in
Cohort 1 with any locally confirmed recurrence or progression will be sent for central
histopathologic review. In addition, tissue from any positive biopsy (any grade of recurrence or
bladder mapping) should be sent to central laboratory for exploratory biomarker analysis (all
cohorts) . For subjects receiving erdafitinib only, tissue from all biopsies performed (normal and
abnormal) will be sent to central laboratory for determination of erdafitinib level. On Cycle 1
Day 14, the first approximately 20 subjects receiving erdafitinib (from any cohort) will have
24-hour urine PK samples collected. Efficacyassessments are describedfurtherin Section 8.2. For
subjects who discontinue study drug without documented disease recurrence or progression, every
effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status according to the disease
assessment schedule, until (1)  the start of new anticancer treatment, (2)  high risk diseaserecurrence
or progression, (3)  withdrawal of consent, (4)  death, or (5)  18 months have elapsed since the first
dose of study treatment (ie, Cycle 1 Day 1) , whichever occurs first.
End-of-Treatment Visit
An EoT Visit will be performed within 7 days after a subject’s permanent discontinuation of
erdafitinib or Investigator’s Choice, either at the end of the Treatment Phaseor for any otherreason
before then. If the EoT Visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EoT evaluations will be
conducted in lieu of the regular visit assessments, and the data will be entered into the EoT Visit
in the eCRF. The subject should be encouraged to return for the Safety Follow-up Visit.

8.1.3. Follow-up Phase
8.1.3.1. Safety Follow-up
The safety follow-up period is the interval between the EoT Visit and 30 days (+7 days)  after the
last dose of study drug. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the Safety
Follow-up Visit, to be scheduled 30 to 37 days after the EoT Visit (or after the last dose of
treatment if the EoT Visit was not performed) , and to report any adverse events and new
concomitant medications that occur during that time. Adverse events and serious adverse events
must be reported up until at least 30 days (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug, the date of
the Safety Follow-up Visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible,
whichever is longer. If a subject begins new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period
for non-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment started.
8.1.3.2. Long-term Follow-up
Required follow-up for subjects in Disease Assessment Follow-up and Survival Follow-up at the
time of Amendment 6 implementation is described in Section 10.14(Appendix 14) .
8.1.3.2.1. Disease Assessment Follow-up
For subjects who discontinue study drug without documented disease recurrence or progression,
every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status according to the disease
assessment schedule and continue to perform other assessments during this period (see
Section 1.3)  until (1)  the start of new anticancer treatment, (2)  high risk disease recurrence or
progression, (3)  withdrawal of consent, (4)  death, or (5)  18 months have elapsed since the first
dose of study treatment (ie, Cycle 1 Day 1) , whichever occurs first. The results of the disease
assessments will be documented in the eCRF. At the time of recurrence or progression, tissue
sampling will be sent to the central laboratory for blinded independent central review (BICR) .
8.1.3.2.2. Survival Follow-up
Once a subject has confirmed disease recurrence or progression or starts a new anticancer therapy,
he or she will begin the follow-up for survival status for a maximum of 2 years. New anticancer
therapy will be collected in the eCRF. The subject will be contacted by telephone or email, or the
subject will visit the study site, at least every 12 weeks (±2 weeks)  from the confirmed date of
disease recurrence or progression or start of new anticancer therapy to assess for survival status
until death, withdrawal of consent, or study discontinuation following Amendment 6
implementation, whichever occurs first. The results ofstandard-of-care follow-up cystoscopy will
also be collected during this period.

Clinic visits or diagnostic laboratory visits not prescribed in the protocol may be performed at any
time as clinically indicated. Results of assessments performed at these visits will be entered as
“unscheduled” visit in the eCRF. The sponsor may also request that an additional visit be
performed, if needed, based on emerging safety data.
8.1.5. Long-term Extension Phase
The LTE Phase will allow continued access to study drug for subjects who continue to derive
benefit from treatment, as determined by their investigator. Subjects may enter the LTE Phase
following implementation of Amendment 6, provided they meet the criteria for entry specified in
LTE Figure 1 . Limits for continuation of study drug in this phase are described in Section 6.7. No
data will be collected in the eCRF during the LTE Phase, and only SAEs will be reported to the
company safety repository. As an alternative to entering the LTE Phase, subjects receiving
erdafitinib may exit the study and continue to receive treatment on any other post-trial access
program, when permitted by local regulations. Detail regarding the LTE Phase (including a
Schedule of Activities)  is provided in Section 10.14, Appendix 14.
8.2. Efficacy Assessments
8.2.1. Disease Assessments
8.2.1.1. Cohort 1
Cohort 1, papillary tumors only, subjects with T1 disease must undergo TURBT of the base of the
lesion (the biopsy should contain muscle fibers)  before study entry (baseline)  to ensure the absence
of muscle-invasive disease and to determine histopathology staging at the time the subject was
deemed to have recurred after BCG therapy. If there are no muscle fibers in the biopsy, subjects
must undergo re-TURBT before randomization.
8.2.1.2. Cohort 2
Cohort 2, CIS, is not expected to be completely excised at baseline, but concurrent papillary
disease must be completely excised before enrollment and documented at baseline cystoscopy.
Urine cytology is not expected to be negative for malignant cells.
8.2.1.3. Cohort 3
Cohort 3, marker lesion, must have recurrent intermediate-risk disease with all previous tumors
being low grade (G1-G2)  Ta or T1 and no previous CIS at baseline. Additionally, subjects must
have a risk of progression less than 5% in the next 2 years and a risk of recurrence greater than
50%, calculated using the EORTC risk calculator.19 All tumors must be removed except for a
single untouched 5 to 10 mm lesion (marker lesion) .
Cohort 3 will perform a urine cytology during bladder washingor from a voided urine specimen
(bladder wash specimen is preferred) at time of CR only. Subjects in Cohort 3 with PR or CR
within 3 months after start of treatment may continue erdafitinib for up to 2 years until progression,
intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, there is a decision by the investigator to discontinue

progression must undergo TURBT of the marker lesion and discontinue erdafitinib. Subjects with
PR may, at the investigator’s discretion, either continue treatment with erdafitinib, or discontinue
erdafitinib and undergo TURBT of the marker lesion.
8.2.1.4. Histopathologic Assessment and FGFR (All Cohorts)
For all cohorts, the histopathology assessment will be performed per local standard practice, and
subjects may be enrolled based on local histopathology results If a subject has a positive local
result of FGFR status either by NGS or by PCR, the subject may be enrolled in the Main Study
based on those results. Otherwise, a subject must wait for central FGFR results from the central
laboratory to meet molecular eligibility criteria. For subjects in Cohort 1, after a positive FGFR
status is known, tissue slides/blocks from the post-BCG specimen maybe submitted to the central
laboratory for central histopathologic review. A detailed outline for collection, handling, and
evaluation of bladder tissue and interpretation of biopsy specimens will be provided in the
Laboratory Manual. Blinded independent central histopathological review (BICR)  will not have
any bearing on enrollment status of the subject. If the central histopathological assessment reveals
T2 or higher disease, the results will be communicated by the medical monitor to the principal
investigator.
During the Treatment Phase and Follow-up Phase, tissue slides/blocks from subjects in Cohort 1
with any locally confirmed recurrence or progression will be sent for BICR.
8.2.1.5. Cystoscopy, Urine Cytology, Bladder Mapping, and CT/MRI Urogram
Cystoscopy (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)  will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Activities
to assess disease response. Whenever possible, the same individual should perform cystoscopy
throughout the study for a given subject. For subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, cystoscopy will
be done at screening, at C3D1, then every 12 weeks (±1 week)  for up to 2 years of treatment or
until high risk disease recurrence or progression. After treatment has stopped, cystoscopies will be
performed every 24 weeks (every 6 months)  (±2 weeks)  for an additional 2 years or until high risk
disease recurrence /progression. Note that if a TURBT was done within 6 weeks before
randomization, then the findings of the complete resection from TURBT can be used instead of a
screening cystoscopy.
Cystoscopy (Cohort 3)  will be done at screening, and then at C2D1, C3D1, and C4D1 (±1 week)
or until CR, whichever occurs first. After a subject experiences CR, cystoscopy will be performed
every 12 weeks (±1 week)  for up to 2 years oftreatment or until disease recurrence or progression.
After treatment has stopped, cystoscopies will be performed every 24 weeks (every 6 months)  (±2
weeks)  for an additional 2 years or until disease recurrence/progression. If the subject experiences
stable disease or progression of the marker lesion, study drug will be discontinued, an EoT Visit
will be conducted, and the subject will undergo TURBT of the marker lesion. Subjects with PR
after 3 months of treatment may, at the investigator’s discretion, either continue treatment with
erdafitinib or discontinue erdafitinib and undergo TURBT of the marker lesion. Subjects with PR
who continue treatment with erdafitinib will have cystoscopy and other study assessments
performed, as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) .

us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023Urine for cytology will be collected from bladder washing or from a voided urine specimen
(bladder wash specimen is preferred)during cystoscopyfor local assessment for subjects in Cohort
1 and Cohort 2. Urine cytology results for subjects being screened for Cohort 1 must be negative
for high-grade urothelial carcinoma before randomization; for Cohort 2, urine cytology does not
have to be negative at screening. Urine for cytology will be collected from bladder washing or
from a voided urine specimen (bladder wash specimen is preferred) for local assessment for
Cohort 3 at the time of CR only.
Bladder mapping will include biopsies of any suspicious mucosal area (if noted) ; otherwise,
biopsies should be taken from normal looking mucosa. Samples must be taken from each of the
following regions: 1)dome, 2)  anterior wall, 3)  right lateral wall, 4)  left lateral wall, 5)  posterior
wall, and 6)  bladder neck/trigone (See Section 10.11) . For Cohort 1 subjects bladder mapping at
screening will be only done if there is prior history of CIS. Furthermore, during treatment or
follow-up phase repeat bladder mapping will only be done if urine cytology is positive for
malignant cells and cystoscopy is negative. In Cohort 2,all subjects will have bladder mapping at
screening and at Cycle 12. No bladder mapping will be done for subjects in Cohort 3. Biopsy
samples collected during bladder mapping will be evaluated by the local histopathology laboratory.
Computed tomography/MRI urograms (contrast enhanced) or retrograde pyelograms (if
applicable) will be performed to evaluate subjects for the presence of locally advanced disease to
the upper urinary tract or prostatic urethra. If a subject cannot tolerate intravenous contrast, a
retrograde pyelogram is acceptable. All scheduled CT/MRI urograms will be performed as
indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) . CT/MRI urograms should be evaluated by
the same individual throughout the study to limit inter-reviewer variability.
Additionally, unscheduled cystoscopy or CT/MRI urograms may be performed if clinically
indicated. Other diagnostic modalities should not be used exclusively to assess disease status in
the absence of cystoscopy or CT/MRI urogram confirmation. Identical methodology should be
used for disease assessment at baseline and throughout the course of the study.
Local histopathologic findings will be used for the following assessments of recurrence,
progression, and disease response.
Recurrence is defined as follows:
 Histologicallyproven first appearance of high-grade Taor T1 lesion bladder cancer in patients
with papillary disease only.
Complete response for Cohort 2 is defined as at least one of the following:
 Negative cystoscopy and negative (including atypical)  urine cytology
 Positive cystoscopy with biopsy-proven benign or low-grade NMIBC and negative cytology

 Negative urine cytology
Partial response for Cohort 3 is defined as the following:
 Marker Lesion reduction by 50%35
For subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, a new low-risk/low-grade papillary lesion may be resected
by TURBT if deemed appropriate by investigator. A new low-risk/low-grade papillary lesion does
not constitute recurrence. Subjects with a positive urine cytology (not atypical cells)  but with
negative cystoscopy will continue treatment until next scheduled evaluation in 12 weeks. Tissue
slides/blocks from subjects in Cohort 1 with any locally confirmed recurrence or progression will
be sent for central histopathologic review.
However, tissue from any positive biopsy (any grade of recurrence)  should be sent to the central
laboratory for exploratory biomarker analysis (all cohorts) and determination of erdafitinib level
(subjects receiving erdafitinib only) . Refer to the Laboratory Manual for instruction on sample
handling.
8.2.2. Patient-Reported Outcomes
Note: PRO assessment/data collection is no longer required for all subjects in all phases.
The PGIS and PGIC are single-item questionnaires to evaluate a patient’s global impression of
severity and global impression of change of cancer, respectively.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a core questionnaire for evaluating the HRQoL of patients participating
in cancer clinical studies. It is a 30-item questionnaire with 9 multi-item subscales and 6 single
items. It incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social
functioning) , 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea or vomiting) , and a global health status
or HRQoL scale. The single items assess dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,
diarrhea, and perceived financial impact of disease and treatment. Ratings for each item range from
1 (not at all)  to 4 (very much) . The QLQ-C30 is designed to be used across cancer populations and
takes about 11 minutes to complete.
The EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 is a 24-item questionnaire for evaluating the HRQoL of patients
with superficial (non-muscle-invasive)  bladder cancer. The questionnaire is designed to
supplement the QLQ-C30 and incorporates 6 multi-item scales and 5 single items. Ratings for each
item range from 1 (not at all)  to 4 (very much) . The scales cover urinary symptoms, malaise,
worries about the future, bloating and flatulence, sexual function, and male sexual problems. The
single items assess intravesical treatment issues, sexual intimacy, sexual enjoyment, risk of
contaminating partner, and female sexual problems. The EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 takes about 8
minutes to complete.

system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort,
and anxiety/depression, as well as the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) . The EQ-5D-5L can
be completed in under 5 minutes.
8.3. Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of
vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests,
ophthalmologic examinations, and other safety evaluations at specified time points as described in
the Schedule of Activities.
Any clinically significant abnormalities or toxicities persisting at the time of study discontinuation
or transition to the LTE Phase will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until reaching
a clinically stable endpoint. For adverse events such as skin/nail and mucosal toxicity, upon subject
consent, photographs may be taken for assessment and monitoring of the toxicity.
Details regarding the IDMC are provided in Committees Structure in Section 10.2, Regulatory,
Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations. Due to the company decision to terminate study
enrollment and considering the recent IDMC review (6 July 2022) found the safety of erdafitinib
in this study to be consistent with the known safety profile of erdafitinib, no further monitoring by
the IDMC will be conducted.
8.3.1. Physical Examinations
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at screening. Subjects
should have a repeated physical examination at Cycle 1 Day 1 before dosing if the previous
physical examination during screening occurred more than 14 days previously. Targeted physical
examinations, including involved organs of the disease state,will be performed at subsequent visits
as listed in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) . Height and weight measurements are not
required after screening. The investigator must review physical examination results and record any
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the adverse event section of the eCRF.
8.3.2. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed per the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) . Blood pressure (systolic
and diastolic) , heart rate, and temperature will be assessed. The investigator mustreviewvital signs
results and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the adverse event
section of the eCRF.
8.3.3. Electrocardiograms
12-lead electrocardiograms will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Activities
(Section 1.3) . Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated. During the Treatment
Phase, ECGs should be performed before study drug is taken for the day. The subject should rest
in a supine position for at least 5 minutes before ECG recording and should refrain from talking
or moving arms or legs. The 12-lead ECG recorder device used should have been recently serviced

QTcF (Fridericia)  will be used for assessment of QTc interval. It is recommended that all ECGs
be performed at approximately the same time each day to minimize circadian variation in QT
interval. The investigator will comment on the clinical relevance and document this in the eCRF
(along with details of clinically significant findings) .
8.3.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology will be collected for all subjects as indicated
in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) . Subjects receiving erdafitinib will have additional
assessments of phosphate and parathyroid hormone as described separately in the Schedule of
Activities. More frequent clinical laboratory tests may be performed, as indicated by the overall
clinical condition of the subject and for abnormalities that warrant more frequent monitoring. The
investigator must review the laboratory results, document this review, and record any clinically
relevant changes occurring during the study in the adverse event section ofthe eCRF.
Laboratory test results completed on Cycle 1 Day 1 (except parathyroid hormone and
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)  should be reviewed prior to dosing, and subjects should continue to
meet eligibility requirements per the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
The following tests will be performed by the local laboratory:
Hematology Panel (All subjects)
-hemoglobin -white blood cell count
-platelet count -absolute neutrophil count
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (All subjects)
-alanine aminotransferase (ALT) -calcium
-aspartate aminotransferase (AST) - potassium
-total bilirubin - albumin
-creatinine 
-sodium  
-magnesium- bicarbonate (if feasible)
- alkaline phosphatase
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (All subjects)
Parathyroid Hormone: All subjects at screening and only subjects receiving erdafitinib from
C1D1.
Phosphate: All subjects at screening and only subjects receiving erdafitinib from C1D1.
8.3.5. Ophthalmologic Examination
All subjects must have an ophthalmologic examination performed regardless of symptoms during
the Screening Phase and during the Treatment Phase as specified in the Schedule of Activities
(Section 1.3) . Ophthalmologic assessment must include visual acuity, fundoscopy (examination of
both central and peripheral zones should be performed) , slit lamp biomicroscopy, and Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT) . The Amsler grid test will also be administered by the treating

Activities (Section 1.3) . Any additional follow-up examination may be performed by the
ophthalmologist as clinically necessary based on the findings of the Amsler grid tests and clinical
assessment. A repeat OCT scan may be done in case of quality issue.
When central serous retinopathy (CSR) /retinal pigment epithelial detachment is suspected, or
fundoscopic retinal abnormalities are observed, as well as each time ocular adverse events lead to
the subject being referred to an ophthalmologist, an OCT should be performed. Fluorescein
angiography could be considered appropriate in conditions such as suspected retinal vein
occlusion. In subjects with suspected retinal pathology such as CSR or retinal vein occlusion, a
consultation with a retina specialist should be considered.
Data from all fluorescein angiograms, retinal photographs, and all OCT scans should be added to
the subject’s case report form. All images of the OCT scan, photographs, and/or fluorescein
angiograms must be stored in the subject’s records and a redacted copy sent to the sponsor-selected
central vendor for possible future independent assessment. Additionally, when OCT is abnormal,
any retinal imaging or angiographic studies conducted must also be stored in the subject’s records
and a redacted copy sent to the sponsor-selected central vendor for possible future independent
assessment. Note: sending redacted copies to the sponsor-selected central vendor is no longer
required.
Amsler Grid Testing
Amsler grid (Section 10.8)  testing will be administered to all subjects according to the Schedule
of Activities (Section 1.3) . Additional assessments should be performed as clinically indicated.
Observation of wavy, broken or distorted lines, or a blurred/missing area of vision is equivalent to
a positive Amsler grid test. For any positive Amsler grid test, subject should be referred for full
ophthalmologic examination within 7 days.
8.3.6. Pregnancy Testing: Urine or Serum β-hCG
Urine or serum samples will be obtained for β-hCG pregnancy testing in female subjects of child
bearing potential at time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) . Pregnancy
tests will be performed to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject's
participation in the study.

Adverse events will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or
the subject's legally acceptable representative)  for the duration of the study. During the LTE Phase,
only SAEs will be reported to the company safety repository (see Section 10.14, Appendix 14) .
For further details on adverse events and serious adverse events (Definitions and Classifications;
Attribution Definitions; Severity Criteria; Special Reporting Situations; Procedures)  as well as
product quality complaints, refer to Section 10.3, Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for
Recording, Evaluating, Follow-Up, and Reporting.
8.4.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious
Adverse Event Information
All Adverse Events
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported
from the time a signed and dated Main-study ICF is obtained until 30 days after the subject's last
dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever is longer.
Serious adverse events, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days
after the last dose of study drug, must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The
sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator
beyond the time frame specified in the protocol.
Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events occurring during the study must be reported to the appropriate sponsor
contact person by study-site personnel immediately but no later than 24 hours of their knowledge
of the event.
Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious
Adverse Event Form and Safety Report Form of the case report form (CRF) , which must be
completed and reviewed by a physician from the study site and transmitted to the sponsor within
24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of a serious adverse event should be transmitted
electronically or by facsimile (fax) .
8.4.2. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events or serious adverse events.
Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire
about adverse event occurrence.

Anticipated Events
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory
authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational
institute where required)  all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) . The
investigator (or sponsor where required)  must report SUSARs to the appropriate Independent
Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB)  that approved the protocol unless
otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB.
An anticipated event is an adverse event that commonly occursin the study population independent
of exposure to the drug under investigation. For the purposes of this study the following serious
adverse events will be considered anticipated events:
 hematuria
 dysuria
 nocturia
 bladder perforation
 ureteric stenosis
 urinary incontinence
 urinary hesitation
 stranguria ureteric obstruction
 urine flow decreased
 urinary retention
 urinary tract obstruction
 urinary tract pain
 urinary tract infection
 urosepsis
Reporting of Anticipated Events
These anticipated events will be periodically analyzed in aggregate by the sponsor during study
conduct.  The sponsor will prepare a safety report in narrative format if the aggregate analysis
indicates that the anticipated event occurs more frequently in the treatment group than in the
control group and the sponsor concludes there is a reasonable possibility that the drug under
investigation caused the anticipated event.
The plan for monitoring and analyzing the anticipated events is specified in a separate Anticipated
Events Safety Monitoring Plan. The assessment of causality will be made by the sponsor’s
unblinded safety assessment committee.
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of the listed anticipated events
according to the requirements of the countries/territories in which the studies are conducted.
8.4.5. Pregnancy
All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported to
the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the
appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  are considered serious

pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. Male subjects receiving
gemcitabine or mitomycin C will refrain from sperm donation or fathering a child until 6 months
after the last dose of study drug.
8.4.6. Disease-Related Events and Disease-Related Outcomes Not
Qualifying as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events
All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) will be reported as SAEs,
regardless of whether they are protocol-specific assessments.
Progression of disease should not be considered nor should be reported as an AE (or SAE) .
However, signs and symptoms of disease progression or of clinical sequelae resulting from disease
progression/lack of efficacy that are determined by the investigator to be of clinical significance
should be reported per the usual reporting requirements (Section 8.4and Section 10.3) .
8.4.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Central serous retinopathy (CSR)  is considered an adverse event of special interest. Instructions
for assessing vision abnormalities during the study are provided in Section 8.3.5.
8.5. Treatment of Overdose
There is no information on overdosage with erdafitinib. There is no known specific antidote for
erdafitinib overdose. In the event of an overdose, stop erdafitinib and undertake general supportive
measures until clinical toxicity has diminished or resolved. See Section 10.3 (Special Reporting
Situations)  for additional information.
8.6. Pharmacokinetics
8.6.1. Evaluations
Subjects who receive erdafitinib will have biological specimens collected for measurement of
erdafitinib concentration as follows:
 Scheduled collection of venous blood during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2
 Tissue specimens from newly detected or progressing lesions during the Treatment Phase
 Matching venous blood samples collected at the time tissue specimens are collected from new
or progressing lesions
 A 24-hour urine collection, first approximately 20 subjects who receive erdafitinib (from any

 Predose PK sample: On Cycle 1 Day 14 and Cycle 2 Day 1, erdafitinib should be taken in the
clinic after the predose PK sample. The time of dosing, and the collection time of the PK
sample must be recorded accurately.
 Postdose PK sample: On Cycle 2 Day 1, a 4-mL venous blood sample will be taken together
with a 3-hour (±1 hour) postdose blood sample for the determination of erdafitinib plasma
protein binding (ie, alpha-1-acid glycoproteins, total protein, and fraction unbound)  (see
Schedule of Activities, Section 1.3) . The time of dosing, and the time of the protein binding
sample must ±be recorded accurately.
 If indicated by the emerging safety findings or if the scheduled PK samples are not collected
due to treatment interruption, blood samples may be collected at a later site visit (on Cycle 2
Day 14, Cycle 3 Day 1, or Cycle 3 Day 14) . The total number of samples and blood volume
will not be substantially increased without approval of the IEC or IRB.
Erdafitinib Pharmacokinetic Assessment in Urine
A 24-hour urine sample will be collected from the first approximately 20 subjects who received
erdafitinib enrolled (from any cohort) at specified time point in the schedule of assessments.
8.6.2. Analytical Procedures
Analytical procedures to determine erdafitinib concentration in blood and tissue are provided in
this section.
Erdafitinib Pharmacokinetic Blood Samples
Blood samples will be processed to obtain plasma for measurement of erdafitinib concentration by
a validated analytical method under the direction of the sponsor. Plasma protein binding, if needed,
will be determined by equilibrium dialysis. After dialysis, the buffer and plasma samples will be
analyzed for erdafitinib content using a qualified liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
method by the sponsor's Bioanalytical Laboratory. Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP)  will also
be measured in the plasma.
Pharmacokinetic Tissue Samples
Biopsy tissue concentrations of erdafitinib will be determined with a qualified liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry method by the sponsor's Bioanalytical Laboratory. Refer to
the Laboratory Manual for details on sample handling.
8.6.3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Evaluations
Erdafitinib pharmacokinetic data in different metrices (plasma and tissue)  will be listed for all
subjects with available plasma erdafitinib concentrations. Subjects will be excluded from the
pharmacokinetic analysis if their data do not allow for accurate assessment (eg, missing dosing
and sampling time information; concentration data are not sufficient for pharmacokinetic

the analysis will be clearly documented in the study report.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma concentration-time data of erdafitinib may be
performed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. Previously developed pharmacokinetic models
may be used and updated as considered appropriate. Relationships between plasma concentrations
or metrics of systemic exposure and CYP2C9 polymorphism, markers of pharmacological
activities (serum phosphate) , efficacy, or treatment-emergent adverse events may also be explored
as data allow using population approaches. Results of the analyses will be provided in a separate
report.
8.7. Pharmacodynamics
Predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarker analyses are described in Section 9.4.6.1 .
8.8. Genetics
Germline DNA will be collected for subjects receiving erdafitinib (see Section 1.3)  from a blood
sample for CYP2C9 genotyping. This will be used to explore the effect of CYP2C9 polymorphism
on the pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib.
8.9. Biomarkers
Biomarker investigations in this study include, but are not limited to, assessment ofthe following:
 Assessment of

scientific question to be addressed in the context of this study.
A voided urine sample for biomarker research will be obtained from the urine cytology sample.
Circulating Biomarkers
Blood samples for circulating biomarkers should be collected predose at timepoints specified in
the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) .
Serum phosphate levels will be monitored in subjects treated with erdafitinib locally as a marker
of target engagement. The Phase 1 (42756493EDI1001)  and Phase 2 (42756493BLC2001)  studies
of erdafitinib demonstrated that phosphate levels are a robust PD biomarker of erdafitinib target
engagement, and that achieving target increases in serum phosphate may be associated with
clinical response to erdafitinib.
Circulating Tumor DNA
Blood for analysis of ctDNA will be collected at multiple time points to assess feasibility of

s: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023Circulating tumor DNA are fragments of DNA shed in the bloodstream during cell turnover. In
cancer, a fraction of the circulating DNA is from DNA shed by tumor cells. This ctDNA often
harbors somatic alterations which are reflective of the original tumor.
Circulating tumor DNA may be used to identify patients for targeted therapies, track response to
treatment and the emergence of resistance by monitoring changes in target ctDNA levels over time.
Samples collected prior to and during treatment will be screened for changes in the levels or types
of  observed over time, and to monitor for the

Urine for Assay Development
The ability to detect FGFR mutations or fusions in pretreatment urine samples and concordance of
urine FGFR status with archival tissue-based testing will be performed. The sensitivity and utility
of urine-based FGFR testing compared with tumor-based and blood-based (ctDNA, see above)
analyses will be assessed.
Two voided urine samples will be collected; one sample will be collected before the subject is
selected for this study (after disease recurrence and before the TURBT, except for patients being
considered for study after TURBT) and another sample will be collected at the time of high-risk
disease recurrence (before the TURBT procedure at the End of Treatment Visit) . As noted in the
Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) , the collection at the time of high-risk recurrence is no longer
required.
Sample Collection and Analysis
Additional biomarkers (DNA, RNA, and protein)  relevant to cancer may also be assessed in blood,
urine, and tumortissue samples collected during the study to better understand the disease and the

Adjustments in the timing of biomarker collections may be made during the study based on
emerging data, and some biomarker collections may be ceased if emerging data show lack of utility
for the associated sample collections.
Biomarker analyses are dependent upon the availability of appropriate biomarker assays and
emerging data. Biomarker analyses may be ceased or deferred if, during or at the end of the study,
it becomes clear that the analysis will have no scientific value, that there are not enough samples,
or that there are not enough responders to allow for adequate biomarker evaluation. In the event
the study is stopped early or shows poor clinical efficacy, completion of biomarker assessments is
based on justification and intended utility of the data.
If it is determined at any time before study completion that additional material is needed from a
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sample for the successful completion of the protocol-
specified analyses, the sponsor may request that additional material be retrieved from existing
samples. Also, based on emerging scientific evidence, the sponsor may request additional material
from previously collected tumor samples during or after study completion for a retrospective

MRU and health economics data collection is no longer required for all subjects in all phases.
Medical Resource Utilization data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected in the
eCRF by the investigator and study-site personnel for subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 as
specified in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.3) . Protocol-mandated procedures, tests, and
encounters are excluded. The data collected may be used to conduct exploratory economic
analyses and will include:

procedures (inpatient and outpatient)
 Duration of hospitalization (total days length of stay, including duration by wards;
eg, intensive care unit)
 Number and character of diagnostic and therapeutic tests and procedures
 Outpatient medical encounters and treatments (including physician or emergency room visits,
tests and procedures, and medications)
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statistical analysis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined
below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
9.1. Statistical Hypothesis
For Cohort 1, the hypothesis is that erdafitinib treatment will delay the onset of tumor recurrence
for subjects with papillary disease only, who recurred after BCG treatment, with FGFR mutations
or fusions, and with all lesions removed.
Due to early enrollment termination and change in study’s regulatory intent from registrational to
non-registrational, formal hypothesis testing will no longer be performed for Cohort 1. No
hypothesis testing will be performed for Cohort 2 or Cohort 3.
9.2. Sample Size Determination
Cohort 1 was originally planned to enroll approximately 240 subjects in a 2:1 randomization ratio
(approximately 160 subjects assigned to the erdafitinib treatment arm; 80 subjects assigned to the
control arm, Investigator’s Choice of treatment) . The termination of Cohort 1 enrollment resulted
in a sample size of 73 subjects for the purpose of summarizing the data descriptively. With a total
number of 73 subjects under the 2:1 randomization ratio, the 95% CIs for the possible hazard ratios
assumed to be observed at the end of the study are presented as follows (Table 12) :

t 2 was planned to enroll approximately 20 subjects. As suggested by the International
Bladder Cancer Group,27 a 40% CR rate at 6 months would be clinically meaningful. With
20 subjects, the cohort will produce a 2-sided 95% CI of (16%, 64%)  when the observed CR rate
is 40%. The termination of enrollment resulted in a Cohort 2 sample size of 16.
Cohort 3 was planned to enroll approximately 20 subjects. A CR rate of 30% to 50% has been
reported in most previous marker lesion studies.22 With 20 subjects, the lower bound of the 95%
CIs will exclude 0 if the observed CR rate is at least 30%. The 95% CIs for different observed CR
rates based on 20 subjects are as follows:

9.3. Populations for Analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:
Population Description
Int
ent-to-treat All randomized (Cohort 1)  or treated (Cohort 2 and Cohort 3)  subjects. Subjects in this
population will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they are assigned.
PK-e
valuable Subjects in the intent-to-treat (ITT) who received at least 1 dose of erdafitinib and had at least
1 pharmacokinetic sample obtained post-treatment.
Bioma
rker Subjects in the ITT whose biomaterial is available and who have consented to participate in
the study’s biomarker evaluations.
Safe
ty Subjects in the ITT who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety data will be analyzed
according to the actual treatment received.
The
 ITT population will be used to summarize the study population and characteristics, and
efficacy data; the Safety Population will be used to summarize the safety data, unless otherwise
specified.
9.4. Statistical Analyses
The Statistical Analysis Plan will be finalized prior to database lock and it will include a more
technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section
is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary
and key secondary endpoints.

us: Approved, Date: 13 July 20239.4.1. General Considerations
The cohorts will be analyzed separately. Descriptive statistics and subject listings will be used to
summarize the data. For continuous variables, number of observations, means, standard deviations,
medians, interquartiles (IQs) , and ranges will be used. For discrete variables, frequency will be
summarized. The comparisons between the 2 treatment groups in Cohort 1 will be performed using
descriptive statistics.
9.4.2. Primary Endpoint (Cohort 1)
For Cohort 1, the primary endpoint is RFS. Recurrence-free survival is defined as the time from
the date of randomization until the date of the reappearance of high-risk disease (high-grade Ta,
T1 or CIS) , or death, whichever is reported first. Subjects who are recurrence-free and alive or
have unknown status will be censored at the last tumor assessment.
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT population. The Kaplan-Meier method will
be used to estimate the distribution of overall RFS for each treatment group.
The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study, is defined
by the following 4 components:
 Population: all randomized subjects, with high-risk NMIBC who harbor FGFR mutations or
fusions, and who recurred after BCG therapy.
 Variable: time to event, RFS.
 Intercurrent event:
 Treatment discontinuation. Treatment policy approach is used, where the occurrence of
the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value of the event is used regardless of treatment
discontinuation occurring.
 Subsequent anticancer therapy. While on treatment strategy will be used, that is, RFS will
be censored at the start date of anticancer therapy. Note that for subjects randomized to
Investigator’s Choice in Cohort 1, the treatment of erdafitinib after cross over is
considered as use of subsequent therapy and the while on treatment strategy will be used.
 Population-level summary: descriptive statistics.
9.4.3. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Cohort 1)
Secondary endpoints for Cohort 1 include the following:
 Time to progression: the time from the date of randomizationuntilthe date of first documented
evidence of any of the following:
 Development of or increase in stage to lamina propria invasion (eg, increase from Ta to
T1)
 Development of or increase in stage to muscle-invasive disease (stage ≥T2)
 Development of or increase in stage to lymph node (N+)  or distant metastasis (M1)
disease (subject must have previously been diagnosed with N0 and/or M0 disease)

 Death
Subjects who are progression-free and alive or have unknown status will be censored at the
date of the last tumor assessment.
 Overall survival: the time from the date of randomization to the date of the subject’s death
resulting from any cause. Subjects who are alive or have unknown vital status will be censored
at the date the subject was last known to be alive.
 RFS rate at 6 months and 12 months.
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the secondary efficacy endpoints of time to
progression, OS, and RFS rate at 6 months and 12 months for the ITT population in Cohort 1.
Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate the distribution of these endpoints for each
treatment group.
9.4.4. Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoints
For Cohort 2, the exploratory endpoints are CR rate at 8 weeks, CR rate at 32 weeks, and DOR.
Complete response is defined as at least one of the following: 1)  negative cystoscopy and negative
(including atypical)  urine cytology; or 2)  positive cystoscopy with biopsy-proven benign or
low-grade NMIBC and negative cytology. The CR rate at 8 weeks and the CR rate at 32 weeks
will be calculated with their associated 2-sided 95% CIs. Duration of response will be analyzed
for subjects in Cohort 2 with a BOR of CR only and is defined as the interval between the date of
initial documentation of a response and the first documented evidence of PD, recurrence, or death
due to any cause. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median DOR with 95%
CI.
For Cohort 3, the exploratory endpoints are CR rate, BOR, and DOR. Complete response is defined
as the disappearance of the marker lesion without any new lesions; and if any remnant of the
marker lesion, no viable tumor seen on histopathological examination. The CR rate will be
calculated with its associated 2-sided 95% CI. For Cohort 3, the best overall response (BOR)  is
defined as the best response documented after start of study treatment. CR for Cohort 3 is defined
above. A partial response (PR)  for Cohort 3 is defined as marker lesion reduction by 50%. Stable
disease (SD)  for Cohort 3 is defined as marker lesion reduction by less than 50%. Progressive
disease (PD)  for Cohort 3 is defined as any marker lesion growth beyond baseline. Duration of
response will be analyzed for subjects in Cohort 3 with a BOR of CR or PR and is defined as the
interval between the date of initial documentation of a response and the first documented evidence
of PD, recurrence, or death due to any cause. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate
the median DOR with 95% CI.

events are adverse events with onset during the Treatment Phase or that are a consequence of a
pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline. All reported treatment-emergent adverse
events will be included in the analysis. For each adverse event, the percentage of subjects who
experience at least 1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by treatment group. In
addition, comparisons between treatment groups will be provided if appropriate.
Summaries, listings, datasets, or subject narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those
subjects who die, who discontinue treatment due to an adverse event, or who experience a severe
or a serious adverse event.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Laboratory data will be summarized by type of laboratory test. Reference ranges and markedly
abnormal results (specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan)  will be used in the summary of
laboratory data. Frequency tabulations of the abnormalities will be made. A listingof subjects with
any markedly abnormal laboratory results will also be provided. Parameters with predefined
NCI-CTCAE toxicity grades will be summarized.
Electrocardiograms
All clinically relevant abnormalities in ECG waveform that are changes from the baseline readings
will be reported (eg, changes in T wave morphology or the occurrence of U waves) . Clinically
relevant ECG abnormalities are defined in the SAP.
ECOG Performance Status
Screening ECOG performance status scores will be summarized for each cohort.
9.4.6. Other Analyses
9.4.6.1. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The pharmacokinetic analysis of erdafitinib will be performed on data from the PK-evaluable
Population (see Section 9.3) . All concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or
missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration database.
Erdafitinib pharmacokinetic data in different metrices (plasma, urine, and tissue)  will be listed for
all subjects with available erdafitinib concentrations. Concentrations values below the lower limit
of quantitation will be displayed in listings as zero with a flag and handled as zero in the
calculations for mean, coefficient of variation (CV) for mean, standard deviation, minimum,
median, maximum, but handled as missing for the calculation of the geometric means and their
CV. Subjects will be excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis if their data do not allow for

 over time will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between baseline
levels and changes from baseline in select markers and  will be explored.
Results of exploratory biomarker analyses may be presented in a separate report. Planned
biomarker analyses may be deferred if emerging study data show no likelihood of providing useful
scientific information.
9.5. Interim Analysis
Two interim analyses were originally planned for Cohort 1. Due to the change in the conduct of
the study, they will no longer be conducted.
9.6. Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An IDMC  will be commissioned for reviewing safety data at various intervals outlined in the
IDMC Charter (Section 10.2) . Due to the company decision to terminate study enrollment and
considering the recent IDMC review (6 July 2022)  found the safety of erdafitinib in this study to
be consistent with the known safety profile of erdafitinib, no further monitoring by the IDMC will
be conducted.

REGULATORY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Investigator Responsibilities
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the
protocol, current ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , and applicable regulatory and
country/territory-specific requirements.
Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing,
conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects.
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of
study subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of
Helsinki, and that the study data are credible.
Protocol Clarification Communications
If text within a final approved protocol requires clarification (eg, current wording is unclear or
ambiguous)  that does not change any aspect of the current study conduct, a protocol clarification
communication (PCC)  may be prepared. The PCC Document will be communicated to the
Investigational Site, Site Monitors, Local Trial Managers, Clinical Trial Managers, and/or Contract
Research Organizations who will ensure that the PCC explanations are followed by the
investigators.
The
 PCC Document may be shared by the sites with IECs/IRBs per local regulations.
The PCC Documents must NOT be used in place of protocol amendments, but the content of the
PCC
 Document must be included in any future protocol amendments.
Protocol Amendments
Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment by
the sponsor. All protocol amendments must be issued by the sponsor and signed and dated by the
investigator. Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IEC/IRB approval, or
when the relevant competent authority has raised any grounds for non-acceptance, except when
necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects, in which case the amendment must be
promptly submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant competent authority. Documentation of
amendment approval by the investigator and IEC/IRB must be provided to the sponsor. When the
change(s)  involve only logistic or administrative aspects of the study, the IEC/IRB (where
required)  only needs to be notified.
During the study, in situations where a departure from the protocol is unavoidable, the investigator
or other physician in attendance will contact the appropriate sponsor representative listed in the
Contact Information page(s) , which will be provided as a separate document. Except in emergency
situations, this contact should be made before implementing any departure from the protocol. In
all cases, contact with the sponsor must be made as soon as possible to discuss the situation and
agree on an appropriate course of action. The data recorded in the CRF and source documents will

regulations. Also, subjects being considered for the study before the TURBT, will provide a voided
urine sample after disease recurrence and before TURBT. These subjects must sign the ICF for
Assay Development prior to collection of this urine sample.
Before enrollment in the study, the investigator or an authorized member of the study-site
personnel must explain to potential subjects or their legally acceptable representatives the aims,
methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any discomfort
participation in the study may entail. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary
and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing
not to participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his or her
disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available if they refuse to take part and
that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally, they will be told that the investigator
will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long-term follow up if needed
and that their records may be accessed by health authorities and authorized sponsor personnel
without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s)
or regulations. By signing the ICF the subject or legally acceptable representative is authorizing
such access, which includes permission to obtain information about his or her survival status. It
also denotes that the subject agrees to allow his or her study physician to recontact the subject for
the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safety evaluations, and subsequent disease-related
treatments, if needed.
The subject or legally acceptable representative will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and
the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent
should be appropriately recorded by means of either the subject's or his or her legally acceptable
representative's personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the ICF
must be given to the subject.
A subject who is rescreened is not required to sign another Main-study ICF if the rescreening
occurs within 35 days from the previous Main-study ICF signature date. Subjects who fall outside
of the 35 days from the previous Main-study ICF date, will need to sign a new Main-study ICF
and have all eligibility criteria re-assessed. Subjects undergoing molecular screening do not need
to re-sign a new Molecular Eligibility ICF to submit historical samples to the central laboratory.
If the subject or legally acceptable representative is unable to read or write, an impartial witness
should be present for the entire informed consent process (which includes reading and explaining
all written information)  and should personally date and sign the ICF after the oral consent of the
subject or legally acceptable representative is obtained.

The informed consent obtained from the subject or his or her legally acceptable representative
includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator/institution to
allow direct access to his or her original medical records (source data/documents)  for study-related
monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, and regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses the
transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries/territories.
The subject has the right to request through the investigator access to his or her personal data and
the right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps will
be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the
conditions of the study, and the applicable laws and regulations.
Exploratory biomarker and pharmacokineticresearch is not conducted under standards appropriate
for the return of data to subjects. In addition, the sponsor cannot make decisions as to the
significance of any findings resulting from exploratory research. Therefore, exploratory research
data will not be returned to subjects or investigators, unless required by law or local regulations.
Privacy and confidentiality of data generated in the future on stored samples will be protected by
the same standards applicable to all other clinical data.
LONG-TERM RETENTION OF SAMPLES FOR ADDITIONAL FUTURE RESEARCH
Samples collected in this study may be stored for up to 15 years (or according to local regulations)
for additional research. Samples will only be used to understand erdafitinib, to understand NMIBC,

PUBLICATION POLICY/DISSEMINATION OF CLINICAL STUDY DATA
All information, including but not limited to information regarding erdafitinib or the sponsor's
operations (eg, patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior
clinical data, formulation information)  supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not
previously published, and any data, including exploratorypharmacokinetic and biomarker research
data, generated as a result of this study, are considered confidential and remain the sole property
of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this
information only to accomplish this study and will not use it for other purposes without the
sponsor's prior written consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by the
sponsor in connection with the continued development oferdafitinib, and thus may be disclosed
as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the information derived
from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor with all
data obtained in the study.
The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and
will contain data from all study sites that participated in the study as per protocol. Recruitment
performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the
study will be used to determine a coordinating investigator for the study. Results of exploratory
pharmacokinetic or biomarker analyses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued
will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report.
Study subject identifiers will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in connection
with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection
(except any publication by the investigator as provided for below)  shall be the property of the
sponsor as author and owner of copyright in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal
Editors (ICMJE)  guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multicenter)
data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to
publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to
publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for
review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will
be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in
writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days to allow for
filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or
regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor will
not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information.

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023For multicenter study designs and substudy approaches, secondary results generally should not be
published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly, investigators
will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived
from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been
submitted for publication, within 18 months after the study end date, or the sponsor confirms there
will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will
be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the ICMJE Recommendations
for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which
state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the conception or design
of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the
work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; and given final approval of the
version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that
questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated
and resolved.
Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results
The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as required
by law. The disclosure of the final study results will be performed after the end of study in order
to ensure the statistical analyses are relevant.
DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified
investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and
study-site personnel before the study, periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor, and direct
transmission of clinical laboratory data from a central laboratory into the sponsor's data base.
Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study-site personnel before
the start of the study.
The sponsor will review CRF for accuracy and completeness during on-site monitoring visits and
after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or
designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for
accuracy and consistency with the data sources.
CASE REPORT FORM COMPLETION
Case report forms (CRF)  are prepared and provided by the sponsor for each subject in electronic
format. All data relating to the study must be recorded in CRF. All CRF entries, corrections, and
alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study-site personnel. The investigator
must verify that all data entries in the CRF are accurate and correct.

electronic CRF, if applicable. Study-specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the
sponsor.
Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the CRF. Any such
worksheets will become part of the subject's source documents. Data must be entered into CRF in
English. Data should be entered within 3 to 5 working days of the subject visit; evaluation or
assessment and queries should be answered within 5 working days of query generation, unless
othe
rwise communicated by the team.
All participative measurements (eg, pain scale information or other questionnaires)  will be
completed by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations whenever possible.
If necessary, queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to a CRF are needed after the
initial entry into the CRF, this can be done in either of the following ways:
 Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own
initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool) .
 Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and study-
site personnel.
SOURCE DOCUMENTS
At a minimum, source documents consistent in the type and level of detail with that commonly
recorded at the study site as a basis for standard medical care must be available for the following:
subject identification, eligibility, and study identification; study discussion and date of signed
informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety and ef ficacy parameters as required by the
protocol; record of all adverse events and follow-up of adverse events; concomitant medication;
study drug receipt/dispensing/return records; study drug administration information; and date of
study completion and reason for early discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from the study,
if applicable.
The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable.
Specific details required as source data for the study and source data collection methods will be
reviewed with the investigator before the study and will be described in the monitoring guidelines
(or other equivalent document) .

Inclusion and exclusion criteria not requiring documented medical history must be verified at a
minimum by subject interview or other protocol-required assessment (eg, physical examination,
laboratory assessment)  and documented in the source documents.
An eSource system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospital or
clinic record to document medical care (eg, electronic source documents)  as well as the clinical
study-specific data fields as determined by the protocol. These data are electronically extracted for
use by the sponsor. If eSource is utilized, references made to the CRF in the protocol include the
eSource system but information collected through eSource may not be limited to that found in the
CRF.
MONITORING
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site
monitoring)to monitor this study.
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will
record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first
post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits,
the monitor will compare the data entered into the CRF with the source documents
(eg, hospital/clinic/physician’s of fice medical records) . The nature and location of all source
documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the
CRF are known to the sponsor and study-site personnel and are accessible for verification by the
sponsor study-site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of
verification must be discussed with the study-site personnel.
Direct access to source documents (medical records)  must be allowed for the purpose of verifying
that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will
be discussed with the study-site personnel. The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the
relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source documents will be accessible, and a
suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will
meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study
conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these
remote contacts, study-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the
study at the site.
Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the sponsor as requiring central review.

Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at
any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance
with regulatory guidelines and company policy. These audits will require access to all study
records, including source documents, for inspection. Subject privacy must, however, be respected.
The investigator and study-site personnel are responsible for being present and available for
consultation during routinely scheduled study-site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its
designees.
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part
of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a
regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has
been contacted by a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection.
RECORD RETENTION
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRF and
all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical
Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s) . The
investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these
documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications
in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical
development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period
if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no
longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept
the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new
custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents
before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any
documentation relating to this study, the investigator/institution must permit access to such reports.

The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or close the study at any time for any reason
at the sole discretion of the sponsor, e.g. in case of unacceptable risk, intolerable toxicity, or change
in the risk/benefit profile; this might include recurrence of adverse events of which character,
severity, or frequency is new in comparison to the existing risk profile. Also, data derived from
other clinical trials or toxicology studies which negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment
might cause discontinuation or termination of the study. Study sites will be closed upon study
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have
been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not
limited to:
 Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
 Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator
 Discontinuation of further study drug development
The sponsor may close individual study cohorts if there is inadequate recruitment of subjects
within individual cohorts or within the overall study.

Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational)  product. An adverse event does not necessarily
have a causal relationship with the study drug. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding) , symptom, or disease temporally associated
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational)  product, whether or not related
to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational)  product. (Definition per International
Conference on Harmonisation [ICH])
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to All Adverse
Events under Section 8.4.1, Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Events and Serious
Adverse Events Information, for time of last adverse event recording) .
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life-threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product
 Is Medically Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately
life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should
usually be considered serious.

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable
product reference safety information. For erdafitinib, the expectedness of an adverse event will be
determined by whether or not it is listed in the IB. For gemcitabine or MMC/hyperthermic MMC,
the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the
applicable package insert or summary of product characteristics.
Assessment of Causality
The causal relationship to study treatment is determined by the investigator. The following
selection should be used to assess all adverse events.
Related
There is a reasonable causal relationship between study treatment administration and the adverse
event.
Not related
There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study treatment administration and the
adverse event.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to support a causal relationship.
SEVERITY CRITERIA
Adverse event severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an adverse event. The severity
assessment for an adverse event or serious adverse event should be completed using the NCI-
CTCAE, Version 5.0. Any adverse event or serious adverse event not listed in the NCI-CTCAE,
Version 5.0 will be graded according to the investigator clinical judgment by using the standard
grades as follows:

Safety events of interest on a sponsor study drug in an interventional study that may require
expedited reporting or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:
 Overdose of a sponsor study drug
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study drug
 Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study drug
 Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the
sponsor study drug, eg, name confusion)
 Exposure to a sponsor study drug from breastfeeding
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page
of the CRF.
Any Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent retinal abnormality should be reported as a serious
adverse event. Instructions for assessing vision abnormalities during the study are provided in
Section 6.6.2.1.5 .
PROCEDURES
All Adverse Events
All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug,
must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the CRF. Whenever
possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology
(eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper
respiratory infection") . Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the
relationship of the adverse event to study therapy. All measures required for adverse event
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor
instructions.
For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open-label studies, the subject must be provided
with a "wallet (study)  card" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study
indicating the following:
 Study number
 Statement, in the local language(s) , that the subject is participating in a clinical study
 Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number
 Local sponsor's name and 24-hour contact telephone number (for medical personnel only)
 Site number
 Subject number

All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved
upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the
following occurs:
 The event resolves
 The event stabilizes
 The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to study
conduct
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of
due diligence with follow-up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a serious
adverse event. Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization)  that occurs
during a subject 's participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except
hospitalizations for the following:
 Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (eg, social reasons such
as pending placement in long-term care facility) .
 Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF) .
 A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration will not be reported as a serious
adverse event. (Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of therapy
administration will be reported as a serious adverse event) .
 Administration of blood or platelet transfusion. (Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization
for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable serious adverse event.)
 Procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy,
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling)  (Hospitalization or prolonged
hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable serious adverse
event) .
 Prolonged hospitalization for technical, practical, or social reasons, in absence of an adverse
event.
 Planned procedures (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study; must be documented
in the eCRF) . (Prolonged hospitalization for a complication considered to be at least possibly
related to the study drug remains a reportable serious adverse event.)
Expected progression of disease should not be considered an adverse event (or serious adverse
event) . However, if determined by the investigator to be more likely related to the study treatment
than the underlying disease, the treatment-invoked progression (ie the treatment-invoked
signs/symptoms of such progression)  , should be reported per the usual reporting requirements.

Progression of disease and death due to disease progression should be documented on the
appropriate eCRF forms (eg, the Disease Progression form and the Death form) .
Signs or symptoms of disease progression that are of clinical significance, such as spinal cord
compression, vena cava superior syndrome, major vessel rupture, efflux obstruction or organ

PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINT HANDLING
A product quality complaint (PQC)  is defined as any suspicion of a product defect related to
manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, quality,
durability, or reliability of a product, including its labeling or package integrity. A PQC may have
an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and
analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators,
and
 the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established
procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting
of PQC information; all studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in
accordance with those procedures.
Procedures
All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours after
being made aware of the event.
If the defect is combined with a serious adverse event, the study-site personnel must report the
PQC to the sponsor according to the serious adverse event reporting timelines (refer to
Section 8.4.1, Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse
Event Information) . A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for further
investigation if requested by the sponsor.

Definitions
W oman of  Childbearing Potential (W OCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless
permanently sterile (see below) .
W oman Not of  Childbearing Potential
 premenarchal
A premenarchal state is one in which menarche has not yet occurred.
 postmenopausal
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical
cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)  level (>40 IU/L or mIU/mL)  in the
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) , however in the absence of
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.
If there is a question about menopausal status in women on HRT, the woman will be required
to use one of the non-estrogen-containing hormonal highly effective contraceptive methods if
she wishes to continue HRT during the study.
 permanently sterile
Permanent sterilization methods for the purpose of this study include hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (eg, a premenarchal woman
experiences menarche)  or the risk of pregnancy changes (eg, a woman who is not heterosexually
active becomes active) , a woman must begin a highly effective method of contraception, as
described throughout the inclusion criteria.
If reproductive status is questionable, additional evaluation should be considered.
Contraceptive (birth control)  use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations
regarding the acceptable methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should
be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects in
clinical studies.

c) Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction) .
Pre
gnancy During the Study
All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported to
the sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the
appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  are considered serious
adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. If a subject becomes
pregnant during the study, the investigator should discuss discontinuation of study drug for the
subject with the sponsor’s medical monitor.
Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects
included in the study will be reported as noted above.
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the
infant will be requested. Follow-up information may continue to be collected up to 12 months after
the birth of a baby, if a congenital anomaly or significant medical condition is diagnosed at birth.

Note: no additional crossover from Investigator’s Choice to erdafitinib will be permitted.
Subjects who have already crossed over to erdafitinib may continue to receive study
treatment and transition to the LTE Phase (please refer to Section 10.14, Appendix 14).
This appendix is intended as a supplement to the main study protocol to describe the eligibility
criteria, treatment schedule, and assessments to be conducted during the Erdafitinib Crossover for
subjects in Cohort 1 who have locally confirmed high-risk recurrence and who were randomized
to Investigator’s Choice with either intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical MMC/hyperthermic
MMC. The appendix is not intended to be a stand-alone document, and rather than repeating key
sections of the main protocol, cross-references back to the main protocol have been included, as
applicable.
Subjects who were randomized in Cohort 1 to either gemcitabine or MMC/hyperthermic MMC,
who have locally confirmedhigh-riskrecurrence, recommendationby the investigator, and review
by the sponsor’s medical monitor, will be offered the option to cross over to erdafitinib, beginning
with C1D1 and a more limited Schedule of Activities.
Overall Design of the Erdafitinib Crossover
Each cycle is 28 days, and administration of erdafitinib is to occur daily for up to a maximum of
2 years or until high risk disease recurrence or progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of
consent, there is a decision by the investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is closed,
whichever occurs first. Scheduled assessments to be performed for eligibility and treatment during
the Erdafitinib Crossover are outlined in the Schedule of Activities in CO Table 1 .
The amount of blood drawn from each subject during the Erdafitinib Crossover will be
approximately 24 mL during screening; 241 mL through Cycle 6; 288 mL from Cycle 6 through
Cycle 24; 37 mL at the EoT Visit, 12 mL during the safety follow-up, and 80 mL for subjects who
have disease assessments after recurrence/progression during the Follow-up Phase for a total
volume of 682 mL.
Erdafitinib Up-titration Guidelines for Crossover Subjects
The erdafitinib dose is modified to the 6-mg daily regimen (without up-titration) . After review of
safety and tolerability data from approximately 5 to 10 additional subjects who received the 6-mg
daily regimen, the IDMC may recommend that the erdafitinib dose be modified to allow
up-titration to the 8-mg daily regimen. Details of any such recommendation will be communicated
separately. Should the dosing regimen be modified to include up-titration, please follow the
instruction in Section 10.12, Appendix 12.

DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDANCE UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED TO DO SO
BY THE SPONSOR. After review of safety and tolerability data from approximately 5 to 10
additional subjects who received the 6 mg daily dosing regimen, the IDMC may recommend a
dose modification to up-titrate from 6 mg to 8 mg daily based on phosphate levels at Cycle 2
Day 1. The details of the IDMC recommendation will be communicated in writing to the
investigative sites and, per local regulation, to health authorities. The pharmacodynamicbiomarker
(serum phosphate)  data considered in selection of the 6-mg daily starting dose (with up-titration
to 8-mg daily)  are summarized below.
Data supporting Up-titration to the 8-mg Daily Dosing Regimen
Data from Phase 1 Study 42756493EDI1001 indicate that an increase in the serum phosphate level
of at least 35% over the baseline level may be associated with antitumor response. Therefore, a
pharmacodynamic (PD)  objective of a 50% increase in the serum phosphate level over baseline is
considered clinically meaningful. Given the median serum phosphate level of 3.6 mg/dL at
baseline in the Phase 1 study, and the phosphate level of 3.3 mg/dL at baseline in the Phase 2 Study
BLC2001 (BLC2001 Interim Analysis 1 data) , an increase of at least 50% for the majority of
subjects would correspond to an absolute serum phosphate level of approximately 5.5 mg/dL
(which is also 35% over the upper limit of normal [ULN] for serum phosphate) . Overall, 6 mg is
the lowest sustained dose that achieves, in 77.8% of subjects in the Phase 1 study,
hyperphosphatemia consistent with a biologically significant inhibition of FGFR. Emerging
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling suggests that 
and would potentially benefit from dose up-titration.
Guidelines for Dose Titration of Erdafitinib from 6-mg Daily to 8-mg Daily Regimen
Erdafitinib treatment may be up-titrated or maintained based on the phosphate level measured on
Cycle 2 Day 1 taking into account any toxicity to that day, as described in in the figure below. The
dose reduction schedule is provided in the table on the following page.

Enrolled Subjects
It is recognized that a national disaster, eg, pandemic, may have an impact on the conduct of this
clinical study. In alignment with the recent health authority guidances, the Sponsor is providing
guidance for study-related patient management in the event of disruption to the per-protocol
conduct of the study as outlined throughout the protocol. These measures are to be followed on a
temporary basis. Once the national situation allows, the usual study conduct methods will resume.
This guidance does not supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgement
of the Investigator to protect the health and well-being of patients and site staff. If at any time a
subject’s safety is considered to be at risk, study drug will be discontinued, and study follow-up
will be conducted, as outlined in the protocol. (Note: These measures do not apply to subjects who
have not initiated study treatment.)
Scheduled visits for safety monitoring and other protocol-required assessments that cannot be
conducted in-person will be performed remotely/virtually (eg, telephone contact, telemedicine,
remote nursing, remote administration of study drug) , where feasible, or delayed until the time at
which access is determined to be appropriate by the Investigator and Sponsor. Study assessments
requiring investigator judgement, should be conducted by the investigator. At each contact,
subjects will be interviewed to collect adverse events data and any changes to concomitant
medications. Subjects will also be questioned regarding general health status to fulfill the physical
examination requirement.
Flexibility for all protocol-required assessments will be provided on a case by case basis, and with
agreement between the Sponsor and Investigator. However, every effort should be made to adhere
to protocol-specified assessments, including follow-up, if it is in the best interest of the subject.
The Sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study and any
changes (eg, delay or discontinuation in recruitment)  will be communicated to the sites and health
authorities.
Guidance specific to this protocol:
 Missed assessments or change to protocol assessments will be documented in the source
documentation and in the case report form. All study conduct performed outside of the
protocol should be documented in the source documentation.
 If a site visit is not feasible, the Investigator may discuss with the Sponsor other mechanisms
for the subject to receive study drug (eg, direct to patient shipment, obtain from another
Investigative Site participating in the study) .  Any change in dispensing study drug must be
documented in the source documentation and eCRF.
 Safety assessments may be conducted at a local facility after discussion with the Sponsor.
 Critical laboratory tests, imaging or other diagnostic tests may be done at an
authorized/certified (as legally required nationally)  local laboratory or clinical facility. A copy
of the laboratory report must be reviewed by the Investigator and retained, along with the
reference ranges, for the source documentation and provided with the eCRF.

The purpose of the Long-term Extension (LTE)  Phase is to provide continued access to study drug,
while minimizing data collection burden. Subjects who are continuing to derive benefit from
erdafitinib or Investigator’s Choice of either intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical
MMC/hyperthermic MMC, as determined by their investigator, may have continued access to their
assigned study drug in the LTE Phase of this study (see Section 6.7) . Note:
 Subjects must be actively receiving study treatment to be able to transition to the LTE Phase.
Subjects who have already permanently discontinued treatment will not be permitted to enter
the LTE Phase.
 Subjects eligible to enter the LTE Phase will continue to receive the study drug that they were
receiving at the time of Amendment 6 implementation; no additional crossover from
Investigator’s Choice to erdafitinib will be permitted (including in the LTE Phase) .
 Subjects who elect not to continue in the LTE Phase will be discontinued from the study.
As an alternative to entering the LTE Phase, subjects receiving erdafitinib may continue to receive
treatment on any other post-trial access program, when permitted by local regulations, or by
receiving commercially available drug.
Subjects may enter the LTE Phase following implementationof Amendment 6, provided they meet
the criteria for entry. LTE Figure 1 is a decision tree which depicts transition to the LTE Phase at
the individual subject level, according to the following factors: whether the subject has
experienced high-risk disease recurrence or progression at any point since the start of protocol
therapy, whether 18 or more months have elapsed since the subject received their first dose of
study drug (ie, Cycle 1 Day 1) , and whether the subject is actively receiving study drug.
No data will be collected in the eCRF during the LTE Phase, and only SAEs will be reported to
the company safety repository. No analyses other than routine periodic safety review
encompassing reported SAEs are planned for the LTE Phase.

instruction regarding collection of 2 voided urine
samples was added: one sample will be collected
after disease recurrence and before the TURBT
(except for patients being considered for study after
TURBT)  and another sample will be collected at the
time of high-risk disease recurrence before the
TURBT procedure at the End of Treatment Visit. In
the Schedule of Activities added in the notes that the
pre-study urine samples for subjects who are found
to have low or intermediate risk disease recurrence
(except for eligible Cohort 3 subjects)  must be
discarded as these patients would not be eligible for
the study. Also, an additional row for the “Urine
Sample for Assay Development ICF” was added to
the Schedule of Activities.
In section 4.1, added that subjects being considered
for the study before the TURBT, will provide a
voided urine sample after disease recurrence and
before TURBT. These subjects must sign the
Informed Consent Form (ICF)  for Urine Sample for
Assay Development. Subjects being considered for
study after TURBT will not provide this urine
sample Also, mentioned at the end of the overview
that additional urine samples will be collected for
assay development.
The consent for the urine sample before screening is
added to Section 8.1.1 and Section 10.2 (Informed

Statu
s: Approved, Date: 13 July 2023Amendment 4 (08 February 2021)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The erdafitinib dose is modified to 6 mg daily to improve
tolerability while maintaining activity to prevent disease recurrence in the non-muscle invasive
bladder cancer (NMIBC)  population. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  for
this study reviewed safety data for the first 4 subjects treated with erdafitinib and recommended
that the change in dosing to 6 mg daily be implemented effective immediately to prevent any new
or ongoing subjects from discontinuing study treatment prematurely due to intolerance to therapy.
Further, the IDMC plans to review safety and tolerability data from approximately 5 to 10
additional subjects treated with the erdafitinib 6-mg daily regimen (without up-titration)  and with
at least 2 months of data after initiation of study drug to determine whether up-titration is feasible
in this population . The erdafitinib dose of 6 mg daily (with and without up-titration)  has
demonstrated clinical activity with lower rates of Grades 3 and 4 drug-related treatment-emergent
adverse events (TEAEs) , drug-related TEAEs leading to dose interruptions, and drug-related
TEAEs leading to discontinuation in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in
Study 42756493BLC2001 (hereafter referred to as Study BLC2001) . Therefore, the lower dosing
regimen of 6 mg daily (without up-titration)  may be better suited, with respect to the 
 for this patient population without advanced, life-threatening disease. Due to
the modification to the dose of erdafitinib, the drug-drug interaction (DDI)  substudy was removed,
as it was designed specifically for the 8-mg dosing regimen.

Selection) , Section 6.1.1 (Erdafitinib) , Section 6.6.1
(Erdafitinib Up-titration Guidelines)  and Appendix 10
(the Crossover Schedule of Activities) , the dosing
regimen was modified to 6 mg daily. These sections
also state that after review of safety and tolerability data
from approximately 5 to 10 additional subjects dosed
with the 6-mg daily regimen (without up-titration) , the
IDMC may recommend a modification of the dosing
regimen to allow up-titration to the 8-mg daily regimen.
Sections 6.1.1 and 6.6.1 refer to information regarding
up-titration to the 8-mg daily dosing regimen in Section
10.12 (Appendix 12)  and in Section 6.6.1 the former
up-titration information was removed. The Synopsis

provide the sequence of reduction for the new dosing
regimen.

In addition to the dose modification, Section 4.3.1 also
highlights that based on efficacy and safety data from
patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial
carcinoma (BLC2001) , the 6-mg dosing regimen may
be better suited with respect to
for the early bladder cancer population of NMIBC. Data
in Section 2.2.2 that support this position are

Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  The time point of the tissue collection for molecular eligibility
testing has been expanded to time before treatment with BCG (ie, previously required at the time of
recurrence after BCG therapy)  to provide more opportunity for collection of a sufficient tumor sample.
Clarifications for histopathology sampling, bladder mapping for cross over study and acquisition of good
quality Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scan were added. Instructions on combination with
moderate CYP2C9 and strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers was added. Other minor clarifications and
alignment with updated oncology protocol template text were also included.

Molecular
EligibilityInclusion Criterion 3 (now numbered 3.2) was
revised to allow testing of molecular eligibility to
occur any time prior to enrollment by removing the
text, “at the time of recurrence after BCG therapy.”
This change was also reflected in the Schedule of
Activities (Notes for “Tumor tissue for molecular
eligibility...”)  and in the sections regarding
molecular eligibility (8.1.1.1 and 8.1.1.2) . In
Section 8.1.1.1, added that tissue obtained before
BCG treatment must also be submitted for central
confirmation of fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR)  status. A figure to depict the tissue testing
paradigm for this study (Figure 2)  was also added to
Section 8.1.1.1.To allow tissue testing for
molecular eligibility any time prior
to enrollment to provide more
opportunity for collection of a
sufficient tumor sample. The

histopathological assessment reveals T2 or higher
disease, the results will be communicated by the
medical monitor to the principal investigator.Tissue samples for central

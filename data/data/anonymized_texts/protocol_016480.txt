Version 5  08/12/2019  6 1. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND  
Asthma affects more than 235 million people worldwide, including approximately 8.6% of U.S 
children (6.3 million children).1,2  Asthma treatment is a substantial burden to the healthcare 
system and is responsible for more than 10 million medical office visits (close to 6% of all US 
medical office visits) and 1.8 million  ED visits each year.3 Regular use of controller medication 
is essential to prevent symptoms and relieve asthma exacerbations and thus decrease healthcare 
utilization and expenditure.4 
 
Non-adherence to asthma medication is a common problem in patients wit h asthma, and young 
people are known to have particularly low medication adherence.5,6 Non-adherence leads to 
overuse of reliever medication and more frequent severe asthma exacerbations including ED 
visits and hospital admissions.4,7 Self-report consisten tly overestimates medication adherence 
making accurate assessment and intervention difficult for clinicians.5  However, two recent 
reviews found mean controller adherence ranging from 20% to 34% and 38% to 71% as 
measured by medication possession ratio (MP R) and electronic monitoring respectively.8,9 Thus, 
even the commonly cited statistic of 50% average medication adherence may underestimate the 
true scope of the problem.10-12 Non-adherence is multifactorial, with contributing factors 
including lack of pat ient knowledge about asthma, poor understanding of the benefits of 
medication, forgetfulness, and negative attitude toward asthma.9 
 
Telemanagement of chronic diseases is increasingly being employed to improve medication 
adherence and health outcomes, and has been shown to be cost -effective.13 A recently developed 
process model for optimal asthma care demonstrates the need for improved understanding of 
patient medication use behavior and how adherence interventions can impact clinical outcomes.14 
A number o f studies have improved medication adherence through incorporation of electronic 
reminders such as text messages across the spectrum of chronic diseases.15 Recently a number of 
studies have looked specifically at the use of such messages along with medicat ion-use tracking 
in asthma have been able to show mean improvement in adherence from 10 -52 percentage 
points.16-23 While promising, these interventions have focused on the use of audiovisual reminder 
systems16, 21 -23 that rely on having access to the inhal er itself or are simply based on SMS 
messages.17,18 Such interventions are limited in their ability to engage participant s for improved 
disease self -management and self -monitoring compared to more comprehensive approaches, 
known to be key for sustained ast hma telemanagement and mHealth approaches.13  
 
Importantly, mobile applications allow for better sustained patient engagement and have been 
successfully implemented in other disease spaces to improve medication adherence and 
outcomes.13 Mobile applications  offer the opportunity to be scaled to the U.S. population -at-large 
and can be sustained due to the front -end cost of development and low staff resources required 
for maintenance once the product is built.  Additionally, the ability to relay adherence data  
directly to clinicians either via a patient portal or into the EMR provides opportunity to direct 
care coordination efforts and resources towards those participant s who are most in need, and 
provides information that can be used for point -of-care treatmen t decision making.  
 
Version 5  08/12/2019  7 2. STUDY TITLE  
A prospective, randomized, controlled study to assess medication adherence in children with 
asthma managed on BreatheSmart and feedback.  
 
3. JUSTIFICATION  
Non-adherence to controller medication is a common problem in children  with Asthma, resulting 
in overuse of reliever medication, increased asthma symptoms, more frequent Asthma attacks, 
and increased emergency room visits and hospital admissions.4 Additionally, current absence of 
a gold standard to measure adherence forces c linicians and researchers to rely on patient -self 
report, which is notoriously inaccurate, to support clinical decision making. Many young patients 
suffer from both intentional and non -intentional non -adherence, thus an appropriate intervention 
must addres s both types. Current studies using electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) primarily 
focus on non -intentional non -adherence through reminder systems and thus are limited in their 
ability to engage patients for long -term behavior change.  
 
This trial addresse s an important knowledge gap by evaluating whether EMDs with a 
combination of reminder system and patient education can prove to be effective in increasing 
adherence rates and can be used in clinical practice to achieve better asthma control and 
outcomes t hrough improved patient and clinician engagement.  
 
4. OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are to determine if the addition of the BreatheSmart platform 
improves medication adherence and health outcomes in children  with persistent asthma who are 
managed wi th inhaled corticosteroids . 
5. BREATH ESMART

available as actionable information for clinicians and caregivers managing children  on 
BreatheSmart . 
 
 
6. STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study  of children  with persistent asthma who are 
managed on daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). 75 children  will be randomized 2:1 into one of 
two arms:  
● 50 children  will be randomized to BreatheSmart , comprised of:  
○ BreatheSmart mobile application that tracks medication usage and sends real time 
reminders  
○ HeroTracker  sensor that counts dosage and monitors real -time medication 
adherence  
○ CoheroConnect provider portal that allow s the Investigator to monitor real -time 
adherence and to provide  targeted outrea ch to children  with low adherence 
(intervention arm)   
● 25 children  will be randomized to “standard of care”  (control arm) . These patients are 
reminded to adhere to the prescribed standard of care therapy provided by their clinician  
during their clinical en counters and when the family calls to report an illness . 

Version 5  08/12/2019  9 6.1. Endpoints  
6.1.1 Primary:   
The study's primary objective is to estimate the relative improvement in medication 
adherence among children  using BreatheSmart  with feedback compared to control at 6 
months.  
6.1.2 Secondary:   
Important secondary objectives include the extent to which BreatheSmart system 
improves the following when compared to control from baseline to 6 -months:  
 asthma control as measured by the Ch ildhood Asthma Control Test (ACT)  
  lung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio compared to standard 
of care  
 the correlation between changes in medication adherence and changes in FEV1 
and FEV1/FVC ratio.  
 the overall number of provider visits for a sthma related adverse events (number of 
exacerbations leading to acute Provider intervention, ER visits, hospitalizations, 
or requiring oral systemic corticosteroid therapy)  
 number of missed school days  
7. STUDY  POPULATION  
This study will enroll children  who have been diagnosed with persistent asthma for at least 6 
months’  duration  and who are showing evidence of poorly controlled disease.  75 children  will 
be recruited from CT Children’s Medical Center Pulmonary Clinic  and East and West Primary 
Care.  
 
7.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
 Age 8 to 17  
 Diagnosis of persistent asthma  
 Prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for at least one month prior to enrollment  
 Use of a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) compatible with the Cohero mHealth 
Herotracker (See Appendix)  
 Parent/child p ossess a compatible smartphone (iOS 8.0 or higher)  
 English or Spanish speaking   
 
Exclusion criteria:  
Version 5  08/12/2019  10  Presence of another chronic lung disease or condition such as c ystic fibrosis, interstitial 
lung disease, chronic lung disease of prematurity, recurrent aspiration, or presence of 
tracheostomy  
 Presence of other chronic medical condition such as congenital heart disease or 
immunodeficiency  
 Presence of other comorbiditi es that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with 
collection of study procedures, or limits life expectancy to < 1 year  
 Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the trial period  
   
7.2.  Sample Size Estimates  
There is no pilot dat a available to inform a sample size analysis. In addition, our sample size 
is limited by our supply of HeroTracker devices (50). As this is an exploratory study, we 
hope our findings will inform future sample size analyses for studies of similar focus with  a 
larger cohort.  
 
7.3.  Recruitment  
Due to the shortage of space and high patient volume at the CCMC pulmonary office, based on 
the scheduled patients for the day, research personnel will identify potentially eligible patients 
based on information will be gathered from the “Pulmonary Snapshot” feature in EPIC.   These 
data include patient age, asthma diagnosis and prescribed medicines.  Research personnel will 
also be identifying potentially eligible patients at the East and West Primary care  through the 
“Primary Care Sanpshot” features in EPIC.  Potential participants will only be approached if 
he/she meets the following inclusion criteria: age between 8 -17 years, documented diagnosis of 
persistent asthma and/or prescription of an inhaled corticosteroid.  Once  this is confirmed , the 
research personnel will approach the patient to administer the screening questionnaire to confirm 
that the child meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Children  could also  be referred to this 
study by their healthcare provi der if he/she feels that the patient qualifies for entry into the study 
based upon the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. If eligible, the parent  will be  asked to participate in 
the study and  presented with the informed consent document which will include the parent’s  
consent to utilize the relevant screening and baseline data for the purposes of this study.  
7.4. Informed Consent  
The primary investigator (or designee) will discuss the study  in detail with the child  and parent  
and describe the potential risks and  benefits. If the parent agrees for their child to participate, a 
legally effective informed consent will be obtained.  The consent process will be documented in 
the study  chart and the parent  will receive a copy of the fully executed informed consent form for 
their records.  All children participating in this study will complete assent.  
Version 5  08/12/2019  11 7.5. Participant  Numbering  
To maintain confidentiality, the participant ’s name will not be recorded on any study documents 
other than the informed consent form.  All participants  that provide informed consent will be 
assigned a unique alphanumeric code that will identify them throughout the course of the study . 
8. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
All participants  will be seen at s creening/baseline, 90 and 180 days’ post randomization where 
the following assessments will be performed.  
8.1. Screening Assessments  
The study staff will interview the parent and child  and document the following:  
 Type of mobile device and version number of the operating system in use  
 Email address  
 Age/gender/ethnicity  
 Parent Income level/education level/medical insurance type  
 Date of asthma diagnosis  
 Other comorbidities  
 Use of inhaled corticosteroids and other inhaled therapies for asthma  
 Use and timing of oral systemic corticosteroids  
 Use of other concomitant medications  
 Medication refill information  (obtained through pharmacy records)  
 ACT  
8.2. Randomization  
If the child  is eligible and they wish to participate they will be randomized in a 2:1  allocation to 
BreatheSm art or to standard of care. As we have a limited supply of HeroTracker devices and 
the CoHero platform does not provide a feasible way to execute any degree of blinding, this will 
be conducted as an open trial where both groups (control and intervention gr oups) will be treated 
as equally as possible.  Randomization will be stratified by age at the time of enrollment (8 -13 
years, 14 -17 years) and blocked in randomly permuted sequences of 4.  
8.3. Baseline Assessments   
8.3.1.  Control  Participants  
Control participants  will be reminded to adhere to the standard of care therapy, as prescribed.   
The following assessments will be recorded:  
 Concomitant medications  
Version 5  08/12/2019  12  Measurement of lung function including FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio , FeNO (standard clinic 
measurement  only assessed i n the Pulmonary clinics ) 
 Child Asthma control test (ACT) questionnaire  
 Exacerbation of asthma episodes (obtained through self -report and chart review) 
requiring:  
○ Courses  of oral steroids      
○ Doctor  visits outside of standard of care  
○ ER visits  
○ Hospi talizations  
 Missed school days  
 PedsQL asthma module (patient and parent report)   
 Test of Adherence to Inhalers  
 Pharmacy refill data for asthma prescriptions during the previous 6 months  
 
8.3.2.  Active Participants  
Active participants  will be reminded to adhere to the standard of care therapy, as prescribed. 
They will be trained to and provided with the BreatheSmart application and Herotrackers.  
The following assessments will be recorded:  
 Concomitant medications  
 Measurement of lung function including FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio , FEF25 -75, FeNO 
(standard clinic measurement, completed  by participants recruited for the pulmonary 
clinic ) 
 Child Asthma control test (ACT) questionnaire  
 Exacerbation of asthma episodes (obtained through self -report  and chart review) 
requiring:  
○ Courses  of oral steroids      
○ Doctor visits outside of standard of care  
○ ER visits  
○ Hospitalizations  
 Missed  school days  
 PedsQL asthma module (patient and parent report)   
 Test of Adherence to Inhalers  
 Pharmacy refill data  for asthma prescriptions during the previous 6 months  
8.4.  Follow -up 
All participants  in both groups will be seen at 90 and 180 days’ post randomization (+/-20 days 
correlating with routine pulmonary clinic follow up  and East and West Primary Care Follow up ) 
where the following assessments will be recorded:  
 Medication changes/refills  (obtained through pharmacy record)  
Version 5  08/12/2019  13  FEV1, FEV1/FVC , FEF25 -75 and FeNO per clinical standard of care (only assessed in 
the Pulmonary clinic)  
 Child Asthma control test (ACT) question naire  
 Serious Adverse Events will be recorded at each visit  
 Missed school days  
 PedsQL asthma module (patient and parent report)  
 Test of Adherence to Inhalers  
 Exacerbation of asthma episodes (obtained through self -report and chart review) 
requiring:  
○      Doctor visits outside of standard of care  
○      ER visits  
○      Hospitalizations  
 
In addition, active participants  (test group) will be continuously monitored via the 
CoheroConnect dashboard which allows the Investigator to monitor the child’s  medic ation 
adherence in real time.  If a period of participant  inactivity of 3 days is registered in the system, 
the Investigator (or designee) will be notified and he/she will be prompted to contact the 
participant  to remind them to take their medication as pr escribed. The Investigator or designee 
will review patient specific data  (% adherence since last visit and graph of adherence patterns 
over time since enrollment)  through the CoheroConn ect dashboard within two days before  a 
follow up visit.  At the follow -up visit, these data will be reviewed with the patient and 
parent/care giver . The adherence rate and barriers identified will be discussed and, if necessary, 
personali zed strategies for improvement will be devised . These data will also be shared with the 
clinician during these follow up visits.   Medication adherence data for control participants will 
be obtained by measure of pharmacy record refill information and self -report ( Test of Adherence 
to Inhalers ) throughout the duration of the study.  
 
We unders tand that the self -report of missed school days due to asthma may be unreliable and 
subject to recall bias , however, this is the method we currently use clinically to assess this 
measure . 
 
If a participant is unable to complete the follow -up visit at their  routine pulmonary appointment, 
the coordinator will either mail, text a link, or email a link of the follow -up surveys to the 
participants. They will be reminded 3 times via text, email or phone  to complete  the follow -up 
questionnaires.   
 
8.5. End of Study  Visit 
 Participants  who finish the 180-day visit will be considered “complete ”. They will then be 
provided with a $35 gift card for completing the study and returning their devices (HeroTracker).  
8.6.  Participant Withdrawal  
If premature withdrawal from the study  occurs for any reason  (including death) the  investigator 
must determine the primary reason for withdrawal and record this information on the study  
Version 5  08/12/2019  14 Withdrawal CRF. For participants  who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those participants  whose status 
is unclear  because they fail to appear for study  visits without stating an intention to withdraw), 
the investigator will show "due diligence" by documenting in the source documents the steps 
taken to contact the participant , e.g., dates of telephone calls, letters, emails, etc. If the 
participant  fails to respond after 3 attempts they may be withdrawn from the study . 
 
     8.7 Accrual and Study Duration  
We anticipate enrolling 4 -5 subjects/week through the pulmonary clinic at the Hartford and 
Farmington location s. The Pulmonary Clinic at CCMC sees 15 -30 patients/day at the Hartford 
location with 75% of the children having a diagnosis of asthma (~10 -20/day), half of whom will 
be in the desired age range (~5 -10) and will be screened.  We will focus recruitment efforts on  2 
days per week when the greatest number of patients are scheduled. To minimize selection bias, 
we will vary the time of day and day of the week in which we recruit. Therefore, enrollment 
should take approximately 16 weeks to complete and the study will conclude 6 months after that 
last subject is enrolled.  
 
9. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
This is a non -significant risk study  exploring the use of the BreatheSmart  System in the 
management of children who present with poorly controlled asthma symptoms despite being 
managed on inhaled corticosteroids.  
For the purposes of this study, the following anticipated adverse events and those meeting the 
definition of serious  must be reported .  
9.1. Recurrent Exacerbation of Asthma  
An exacerbation of asthma requiring an intervention by the investigator must be recorded. The 
occurrence of these events will be obtained through both self-report and chart review. These 
events include:  
● change in/or addition of prescribed medications for the treatment of asthma, or  
● doctor visits outside of standard of care, or  
● ER visits, or  
● Hospitalization  
9.2. Adverse Drug Reactions  
Adverse reactions to medications prescribed for the treatment of asthma are  well described in the 
literature. If an event related to a prescribed asthma drug meets the definition  of serious it must 
be reported.  
9.3. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A serious adverse event or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
● Results in  death  
● Is life -threatening  
Version 5  08/12/2019  15 ● Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
● Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. The investigator will be 
responsible for a ssigning causality to all serious adverse events.  
 
In the event that a S AE leads to hospitalization, every effort should be made by the 
investigational site to obtain the medical records/disc harge summaries and complete a  
Hospitalization CRF.  
9.4. Death  
In the event that the SAE leads to death, the Investigator should provide a narrative summary of 
circumstances, the events related to the death, and the primary cause of death, if known.  
Information regarding a participant’s  death must be reporte d within 24 hour s of the knowledge of 
the death, and recorde d on a Mortality form .  
10.  DATA MANAGEMENT  
Prior to study  enrollment, all research staff will be trained in principles of human subjects 
protection and maintenance of confidentiality o f participant data .  
10.1. Data Confidentiality  
Participants  limited PHI and the investigator's personal data, which may be included in the 
sponsor database, will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The 
sponsor will take all appropriate measures to safeguar d and prevent access to these data by any 
unauthorized third party.  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the protection of data for 
each study participant  is maintained. The investigator, and all site staff involved in this st udy, 
may not disclose (or use for any purpose other than performance of the study), any data, record, 
or other unpublished confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of 
the study. Prior written agreement from Cohero Health must  be obtained for the disclosure of 
any said confidential information to other parties.  All information recorded on CRFs must be 
traceable to source documents in the participant’s  research file and/or medical chart with the 
exception of participant  questionnaires that are completed directly in BreatheSmart  or 
Qualitrics . 
Study data will be directly captured into BreatheSmart. Participants  and study personnel 
requiring access to research systems will be trained and must use their own login and passwo rd. 
Access to clinical study information in these systems will be based on individuals' roles and 
responsibilities and the minimum rule.   These applications provide hierarchical user permissions 
for data entry, viewing, and reporting options.  For optimum  security, all communications 
between the users and the applications operate on a secured socket layer (SSL) using 128 and 
Version 5  08/12/2019  16 256-bit encryption. The web servers are protected by a managed firewall from potential web and 
network attacks, and the networks are guarded by an intrusion detection and protection 
surveillance system against malicious threats.  These applications are designed to be in full 
compliance with International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practices (ICH -
GCP), the FDA’s Code o f Federal Regulations (CFR) Number 21 Part 11 Electronic Record and 
Electronic Signatures, the FDA's "Guidance: Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials, the 
Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and 
Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) 
Act, 2009  
10.2. Data Monitoring  
All questionnaires will be administered using the Qualtrics  HIPAA -compliant web -based data 
collection software and  app presented on  encrypted  and password protected  iPads. All surveys  
administered at each visit (including the TAI, PedsQL, baseline data collection form, and follow 
up data collection form) are built into the Qualtrics platform. Qualtrics is a HIPPA -compliant 
electronic survey de velopment and analytic tool. All data collected through Qualtrics will be 
stored into a pass -word protected Qualtrics account. PHI will not be entered into the database.  
Upon enrollment, subjects will be designated a study number. Once data is entered in t he 
database, they will only be identified by study number.  All communications with enrolled 
participants will be documented in  a password protected ACCESS database  on password -
protected and encrypted computers in the Asthma Center . No PHI will be entered i nto this 
database.   
Original source documents  including the original signed consent form, HIPPA form, and any 
other relevant documents  will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in a locked office until data 
analysis is complete.  The PI will be responsible f or monitoring the quality of the CRF 
completion and source documents.   
10.3. Data quality  
10% of the records will be spot checked on three separate occurrences: after completion of all 
data entry for baseline visits, 90 day follow -up visits and end of study vis its (180 days post 
randomization). The rate of error and location of errors will be recorded as de -identified data in 
an excel document.  
10.4. Data analysis  
All data will be analyzed in accordance with the statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be developed 
at the b eginning of this study.  Both primary and secondary analyses will be based on an 
intention -to-treat (ITT).  
The study's primary objective is to estimate the relative improvement in medication adherence 
among children  using the BreatheSmart compared to contr ol participants  using “standard of 
care”.  
Important secondary objectives include the extent to which the Cohero system improves:  
●      asthma control as measured by ACT  
Version 5  08/12/2019  17 ●      FEV1 ,  FEV1/FVC ratio , FEF25 -75 and FeNO  compared to standard of care, and the 
correlation between changes in medication adherence from baseline and changes in FEV1 and 
FEV1/FVC ratio.  
●      the overall number of provider visits for asthma -related adverse outcomes (number of 
exacerbations leadi ng to Provider intervention, ER visits, hospitalizations, or requiring oral 
systemic corticosteroid therapy)  
 Missed school  days 
Data results may be used to inform a study of a larger cohort with similar focus with regard to 
sample size estimates, efficacy of the BreatheSmart platform, feasibility in a low -income 
pediatric population and study design.  
10.5. Statistical Analysis  
Between g roup differences in the change in mean adherence from baseline over will be based 
on a 0.05 level t -test. The corresponding 95% confidence interval for the between group mean 
difference will provide an interval estimate of benefit obtained using the Cohero  
system.  [NR1]  
In addition to the frequentist analysis of adherence, a Bayesian approach that focuses on 
estimating the probability distribution of differences in mean adherence using the Cohero 
system compared to standard of care.  The Bayesian approach  begins with the premise that the 
Cohero system yields no improvement in adherence. This is an exact correspondence to a “null 
hypothesis”. This assumption is incorporated through a prior distribution for improvement in 
mean adherence; for example, by assu ming that the mean improvement is characterized by a 
normal distribution with mean 0, the expected difference  should the Cohero system offer no 
benefit, and some small variance (e.g. 0.01). This is also a statement that the probability that 
the Cohero syst em improves response compared to standard of care is 50% (i.e., the prior odds 
that active therapy is effective is 1:1, consistent with the notion of equipoise).  
The essence of the Bayesian approach is to use the data collected during the study to update 
the prior probability density based on the observed data (this updated density is the posterior 
probability distribution) using Bayes Theorem.  This posterior distribution provides estimates 
of the probability that the Cohero system improves adherence relat ive to standard of care by 
any amount greater than δ.  For example, choosing δ=0 corresponds to the frequentist test of 
the null hypothesis.  
The analysis of lung function  will be performed in a corresponding manner to that described for 
adherence. Addition ally, the correlation between change in FEV 1, FEV1/FVC ratio  and FEF25 -
75 and change in adherence will be computed. Graphical analysis will be used to visually inspect 
the relationship between improvement in adherence and improvement in lung function . Base d on 
the general form of the relationship, additional exploratory analyses will be performed. For 
example, if the relationship is approximately linear, standard regression methods will be used to 
estimate the relationship; if, however, a clear discontinuit y is seen, splines might be us ed to 
estimate the relationship.

Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 50) and the Office for Protection from Research 
Risk Reports:  Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR Part 46).  
They must be followed to comply with IRB regulations for the conduct and monitoring of 
clinical investigations. Freely given written informed consent must be obtained from every 
participant  prior to clinical study  participation.  
11.5. Participant  Confidentiality  
In order to maintain participant  privacy, all CRFs, study  reports, and communications will 
identify the participant  by the assigned alpha -numeric study  number.  Only study personn el will 
have  access to the participant’s  original medical records for verification of data gathered on the 
CRFs and to audit the data collection process.  The participant’s  confidentiality will be 
Version 5  08/12/2019  19 maintained and will not be made publicly available to the e xtent permitted by the applicable laws 
and regulations.  
11.6. Protocol Compliance  
The investigator will conduct the study  in compliance with this protocol and supporting 
documents.  Any changes to the protocol will require approval from the IRB prior to 
implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
participants . Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source 
documents and the EDC.  
11.7. On-site Audits  
The IRB may request access to all source documents, data capture records, and other study  
documentation for on -site audit or inspection.  Direct access to these documents must be 
guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
11.8. Record Keeping and Retention

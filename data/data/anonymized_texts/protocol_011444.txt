The following new text was added 
to the Pregnancy section: 
‘Nonsterilized male study 
participants should be advised to 
use a condom for all sexual 
intercourse with a female partner 
of childbearing poten tial from 
Day 1 through the end of the study 
follow -up period. All male 
participants should refrain from 
fathering a child or donating sperm 
during the study and for 190 days 
following the last dose. If the 
partner becomes pregnant, the 
partner will be asked (under a 
separate consent) to provide 
information about the pregnancy 
and newborn baby.’
In addition, the order of 
paragraphs in the section was 
re-arranged to match the template.AstraZeneca has reassessed the 
theoretical risk to women of 
childbearing potential of exposure 
to semen from male participants 
receiving MEDI6570. The 
reassessment confirms that semen 
from male participants exposed to 
MEDI6570 poses low to no risk to 
the fetus of pregnant sexual 
partners o r the potential fetus of 
sexual partner s who may become 
pregnant. However, as a 
conservative and cautionary 
approach, following the 
AstraZeneca and Clinical Trial 
Facilitation Group guidelines, 
AstraZeneca has decided to update 
the clinical study protocol 
accordingly.Section 8.3.8 Pregnancy;

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22of 131Overall Design :
This is a rando mized, double -blind ed, placebo -controlled, parallel -group , multicenter 
(approximately 70 to 100 ), internat ional study  in parti cipants who have recent ly (within the 
previous 30 to 365days) had a nMI (either ST segment elevat ion MIor non -ST segment 
elevation MI),with persistent inflammat ion (high sensi tivity C-react ive protein [ hs-CRP] 
≥ 1mg/L).Participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive in an inject ion 
volume of 1.5 mL)or  (in an inject ion volume of 4.0 mL) MEDI6570, or an
inject ion/volume-matched pl acebo, subcutaneously (SC), every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 32 weeks 
(9doses in total). Participants who were randomized to a study  intervent ion under Protocol 
Versi on1.0 or Am endment 1 (when there was also a  dose group) and were allocated a 
dosing vo lume of 0.5 mL will cont inue on their randomized study intervent ion (  
MEDI6570, or its inject ion/volume-matched placebo) to the end of the study , and the study  
blind will be maintained wit h regard to active versus placebo.
The rando mizat ion will be stratified by  geographic region (Asia, North America and Rest of 
World) and by  statin therapy intensityat screening ( no,low-or moderate -intensit y statin 
therapy  vs high -intensity statin therapy). 
Parti cipants will undergo an echocardiogram and computed tom ography an giography ( CTA )
scan before randomizat ionand administration of study  intervent ion. During the fo llow-up 
period, parti cipants will also undergo an echocardiogram and CTA scan.
Disclosure Statement : Thi s is a parallel- group, treatm ent study  with 6intervent ion group s 
(including the legacy  mg dose group and matched placebo) that is parti cipant -and 
investigator -blinded.
Number of Participants: Approximately 400participants will be randomly  assigned to a 
study  interventi on,withan antici pated 369participants being rando mized toreceive active
study  interventi on (1 23participants in each of the 2 MEDI6570 group s),and 123participants 
being rando mized across the 3 placebo groups (ie, including participants already rando mized 
to the l egacy dose/v olume-matched placebo group for the  m g dose ). It is estimated that 
approximately 360evaluable participants (111evaluable participants in each of the 2 
MEDI6570 group s [  and mg],plus 27 evaluable participants in the legacy  mg 
MEDI6570 group, plus 111participants across the 3placebo groups )willcomplete the study .
Evaluable par ticipants are defined as those wi th an evaluable CTA at baseline and fo llow-up 
(Day  253; Visit 13).
Intervention Groups and Duration :The stud y intervent ion is MEDI 6570, a human
Immunoglobulin G1 l ambda (IgG1λ )triple m utation antibody that binds to  
 Going forward from Amendment 2, the
study  will include 4 intervent ion groups: and mg MEDI6570, and 2

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24of 131Statistical methods for primary endpoint :The primary endpo int is change from baseline in 
NCPV MD. An analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA) model on change fro m baseline adjusted for 
treatm ent group, baseline, and rando mizat ion strata will be used for the primary  analysis.
Statistical methods for secondary efficacy endpoints: Secondary endpo int of relative 
change from baseline in NT -proBNP will be analyzed with a mixed model wit h repeated 
measures analysis on change fro m baseline for the log -transform ed value of NT -proBNP. The 
resul ts will  be back -transformed to the original scale. The model will include fix ed effects of 
treatm ent group, visit, treatm ent group -by-visit int eracti on,and rando mization strata ,with 
baseline NT -proBNP as a covariate . Repeated measures for the model will be visit wit hin 
subjects ;an unstructured covariance structure will be used f or the repeated m easures. In case 
the model does not converge, back- up covari ance structures and other analysis solut ions will 
be detailed in the statistical analysis plan .
Secondary  endpoints that are measured by echocardiogram or CTA will be analyzed based on 
the Echocardiogram or CTA Analysis Populat ion, respectively . ANCOVA analyses similar to 
the primary  endpoint will be performed; the model will adjust for treatm ent group, respective 
baseline value , and rando mization strata .
Statis tical methods for safety variables: Type, inci dence, severit y, and rel ationship of 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events to study  intervent ion will be summarized by 
MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term and by study  intervent ion. Specific AEs 
will be counted once for each participant for calculating percentages. If the same AE occurs 
multiple times wit hin a participant , the highest severit y and level o f relationship to study  
intervent ion observed will be reported. Vital signs and safet y laboratory  data will be 
summarized descript ively at each time point by study  intervent ion.
Interim analysis: No formal interim analysis is planned. 
Ananalysis restricted to PK (serum MEDI6570 concentration)  
 
 Non -study  personnel who have no other 
involvement in the study  will perf orm this evaluat ion. These PKand PD data will be reviewed 
in conjuncti on wi th the safet y data by the independent DMC .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 36of 1312 INTRODUCTION
MEDI6570 is a nIgG1λ tri ple m utationantibody  that i s being developed as an adjunct therapy  
to standard of care to reduce the rate of CV outcomes in patients with a history of MI.
2.1 Study Rationale
This Phase IIB, proof -of-concept , dose -range finding clinical study  will eval uate the 
anti-inflammatory  potenti al of MEDI6570 and its effect on surrogates for atherosclerotic and 
HF events in patients with a history of MI . The results of the Phase IIB study  will inform th e 
future clinical development options and precisio n medicine strategy  for future clinical studies.
2.2 Background
Despite marked improved adherence to medical and lifestyle changes for secondary  
prevent ion, CHD rem ains the l eading cause of mortalit y worldwide with a reco rded 
8930369deaths attributed to it in 2018. Of those deaths 2 110562 occurred in Europe (87 019 
in the U nited Kingdom  and 18317 in Sweden), 581 645 occurred in North Am erica (533 166 in 
the United States and 48381 in Canada), 4929141 in Asia, 7285 11 in Africa, 33667 in 
Australia and 477308 in Lat in America and the Caribbean (BHF -CVD -Statistics 2019) . The 
economic burden is also substant ial with an est imated cost of $218.7 billio n for the y ear 201 4
to 2015 in the United States alone .
CHD is a product of CAD ,the latter being defined as the presence of atherosclerosis in the 
coronary  arteri es. CAD can l ead to CHD in the form of stable angina, ACS, a syndrome of 
unstable angina , NSTEMI, and STEMI. 
Atherosclerosi s develops as a result of 2 interrelated primary mechanisms :lipid depos ition
and c oronary  inflamm ation (Ross 1999, Linton et al 2000 ). Pati ents wi th a pri or MI are at 
increased risk of MACE fro m atheroscl erosis, including CV death, MI, and stroke . Treatment 
with statins, which decrease low -densit y lipoprotein concentration, forms part of the current 
standard of care for patients with a prior MI. While statins decrease the residual lipid risk and 
partially decrease the inflammatory  risk in pat ients with a prior MI, a clinically significant risk 
of MACE rem ains, indicat ing a possible need to reconsider whether background statin use 
shoul d be mandated . CANTOS demonstrated that targeting the inflammatory  risk wi th 
canakinumab, a monoclonal ant ibody  against interleukin -1 β, reduces MACE compared with 
placebo (Ridker et al 2017 ).Natriuretic pept ides were not evaluated in this study; therefore, it 
is not known whether canakinumab affected natriuretic peptide levels. To the sponsor’ s
knowl edge, there are no plans to develop canakinumab for the CHD indicat ion.
Furtherm ore, i schemic CHD i s the m ost comm on cause of HF ( Crespo -Leiro et al 2016 ), a 
global epidemic affect ing >37.7 millio n peopl e worl dwide ( Ziaeian and Fonarow 2016 ), with 
a proj ected 46% increase in the prevalence by the year 2030 (Savarese and Lund 2017 ). In

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 37of 131addition to i ts considerable impact on mortalit y and m orbidi ty (Crespo -Leiro et al 2016 ),HF 
accounts for 1% to 2% of the total healt hcare expendi ture in Europe and North America
(Cowi e et al 2014 ). Despi te the increasing availabilit y of therapi es for HF, there is a need for 
additional therapies as the prevalence and costs of HF increase.
 
 
 
 
 
MEDI6570 i s 
anticipated to reduce the fo llowing in pat ients with a pri or MI, resi dual inflammat ion, and 
elevated NT -proBNP :
Reduce the lipid and inflammatory  risks that cause atherosclerosis, and thus reduce the 
incidence of MACE 
Reduce the inflammatory  risk and endothelial dysfunct ion that contribute to HF, and thus 
reduce the incidence of HF hospitalizat ion

CTA scan Potential clinical consequences of 
undergoing a CTA scan include, as 
follows:
• Radiation exposure
• Reactions to iodinated 
contrast
• Renal impairment due to 
contrast administration
• Detection of incidental 
findings that may require 
assessment• R adiation reduction 
technologies, including 
prospective ECG -triggerin g 
and iterative reconstruct ion, 
allow CTA scan s tobe 
performed at low radiatio n 
doses ( Chen et al 2013 ,Hou 
et al 2014 , Meyersohn et al
2017 ,Schmermund et al
2017). Radiation reducing 
image acquisition techniques 
will be used (Section 8.1.1 )
and the ant icipated median 
(range) radiation exposure 
per CTA imaging time point
is 6 (3 -10) mSv .
• Risks of renal impairment 
will be minimized by 
excluding participants with 
clinically significant renal 
disease from CTA scan ning
(Section 8.1.1).
• For each CTA scan, critical 
alert findings of clinical 
importance will be 
interpreted locally at the site 
to permit appropriate 
assessment and treatment 
(Section 8.1.1 ).

This study  is being conducted during the COVID -19 gl obal pandemic. As a result, a risk 
assessment evaluat ion for COVID -19 has been prepared to protect study participants and site 
staff, including COVID -19 vaccinat ion gui dance and recommendations (Appendix G).
2.3.2 Benefit Assess ment
Despite improvements made over the last decades in the prevent ion of secondary MIs,a 
clinically significant ri sk of m ortali ty and morbidi ty remains for up to 5 years post -MI, with 
the highest riskin the first months post-MI(Fox et al 2010 ). Plaque progressi on has also been 
shown to predict ACS independent ly(Ridker et al 2017 ,Tardif et al 2019 ). Furthermore, 
CCI
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41of 131treating the inflammatory  pathways associ ated wi th MIs results in improved outcomes (Ridker
et al 2017 ,Tardif et al 2019 ). In preclinical models of atherosclerosis and HF, deletion of the 
 has demonstrated decreased atherosclerosis, reductions in my ocardi al 
fibrosis, improvements in left ventricular funct ion, and improvements in adverse remodeling
of the heart fo llowing MI (Lu et al 2012 ,Hu et al 2008 , Mehta et al 2007 ,Yokoyama et al
2016 ).  
 
More extrem e inflammatory  
phenoty pes, such as pat ients with psoriasis, who have an increased risk of CHD also have 
elevated  levels. A recent study  dem onstrated that treatment with anti- inflammatory 
therapi es in psori asis decreased levels and non -calcified plaque burden . Moreover ,
levels during treatment predicted regression of non -calcified plaque burden (Dey et al
2020 ).  Given 
the preclinical and clinical data, MEDI6570 maydecrease the severi ty of atherosclerosis and 
HFand is a potential  future therapy  for the secondary  prevent ion of CV death, MI, stroke, HF, 
and revascu larizat ion. 
However, as the efficacy o f MEDI6570 in patients with a prior MI is y et to be determined, 
participants might receive limited or no efficacy benefits fro m participat ing in this study . 
Parti cipants might also benefit from receiving close monitoring and follow-up of their disease 
status post -MI.
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Given the measures taken to minimize risk to participants enrolledin this study , the potenti al 
risks ident ified in associat ion with MEDI6570 are just ified by the potenti al benefits of reduced 
severit y of atherosclerosi s and HFthat are anti cipated forparticipants with a prior MI .

4.0mL), subcutaneously (SC), every 4weeks (Q4W) for 32weeks ( 9doses in total). 
Approximately  400 participants will be randomly  assigned to a study  intervent ion,with an 
anticipated 369 participants being rando mized to receive active study  interventi on 
(123 participants in each of the 2 MEDI6570 groups), and 123 participants being ran domized 
across the 3 placebo groups (ie, including participants already rando mized to the legacy 
dose/volume -matched placebo group for the  mg dose). It is est imated that approximately 
360evaluable participants (111 evaluable participants in each of the 2 MEDI6570 groups 
[ and mg], plus 27 evaluable participants in the legacy mg MEDI6570 group, plus 
111 participants across the 3 placebo groups) will complete the study .The rando mizat ion will 
be stratified by geographi c regi on(Asia, North Ameri ca and Rest of World )and by statin 
therapy status (no,low-or moderate -intensity statin therapy vs high-intensitystatin therapy ; 
refer to Appendix F) at baseline.
Parti cipants who were randomized to a study  intervent ion under Protocol Versio n1.0 or 
Amendment 1 (when there was also a mg dose group) and were allocated a dosing volume 
of0.5mL will continue on their rando mized study intervent ion (  mg MEDI6570, or its 
inject ion/volume-matched pl acebo) to the end of the study , and the study  blind will be 
maintained with regard to active versus placebo.
In accordance with the ESC/EAS and ACC/ AHA gui delines regarding lipid modificat ion and 
the reduction o f residual CV risk, the use of high -dose stati ns in secondary  prevent ion is a 
Class I recommendat ion with Level  A evidence to support it ( Mach et al 2020 ,Grundy  et al
2019 ). As such ,and in keeping with the expected standard of care, the implementation and 
maintenance of the highest tolerated dose of statins (although not mandated) is strongly 
encouraged in this study  popul ation.
The study  will be conducted at approximately 70 to 100 study sites globally. The COVID -19 
pandemic may  continue to affect different geographic regions different ly, having an 
unpredictable impact on study  enrol lment; therefore, a more accurate estimation of the number 
of countri es and study  sites that ma y be included globally is challenging.
Parti cipants will be enr olled in the study  for up to approximately  12months, com prising a n 
optional, pre-screening period of up to 42 days (6 weeks), a screening and baseline imaging
period of  up to 42 day s (6weeks ), an intervent ion peri od of  225 days (31 to 32 weeks ), and a 
follow-up period of 100days (approximately 14weeks ; Figure 1). Following screening and 
confirmat ion of eligibilit y, parti cipants will underg o anechocardiogram and CTA sc an before 
rando mizat ion. The fi rst dose of study  intervent ionwill be administered on Day  1(Visit 3),

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
4.2.1 Rationale for Study Population
A study  popul ation comprising participants wi th a prior MI andpersistent inflammat ion was 
chosen because i t reflects the population proposed for subsequent clinical development. A 
majorit y of parti cipants will also have elevated NT -proBNP .
Patients surviving a nMIremain at hi gh risk of m ortali ty and m orbidi ty with the greatest ri sk 
occurring within the first 30 day s post event (Abu-Assi et al 2016 ,Jernberg et al 2015 ,
Johansson et al 2017 ). This increased ris k is partially  driven by  the presence of significant 
atherosclerosis in the non -infarct related vessels (Momiyama et al 2012 ,Park 2014 ,Kato et al 
2012 ),which may beco me more suscept ible to rupture due to the intense inflammatory  
response, a prerequisite for healing and scar formation triggered by the MI(Frangogiannis et 
al2002 ). Thi s post -infarct ion inflammatory process peaks within the first and second weeks 
post-ischemic event and resolves by  the thi rd or f ourth week ( Sun et al 2009 ). Moreover, 
evidence from clinical studies suggest sthat patients with persistent elevat ion of serum 
inflammatory  biomarkers 4 weeks after an ACS have worse outcomes (d e Lem os et al 2007 ).
NCPV and total plaque vol ume have been shown to be significant predictors of cardiac events 
in ACS, wi th NCPV being a better predictor of a MACE than total plaque volume or calcium 
score (Kristensen et al 2011 ). These different components of coronary  atheroscl erosi s during 
CTA have been shown to be of incremental value for prognosticat ion (Radosavljevic -
Radovanovic et al 2016 ). 
In addit ion, NT -proBNP has been shown to be a strong predictor of future AEs in the post -MI 
popul ation(Lindahl et al 2005 ), being more reliable when measured in the relat ively stable 
phase (Kurtul et al 2016 ). Furthermore, the l evels of NT -proBNP were associated with the 
severit y and com plexi ty of the underlying CAD (Kurtul et al 2016 ). 
The l ower limit of 30 days post -MI was selected both to refrain fro m suppressing the 
necessary  inflammatory  response and because the expected elevated levels in hs -CRP ,
cytokines and NT -proBNP during this window may not persist long -term. In addi tion, thi s 
period woul d allow pati ents’ stand ard of care medical therapy  to be optimized and stabilized 
before being enrolled in the study . An upper limit of 365 days after the MIwas selected to 
include patients who have a high residual risk of MACE and may  derive benefit from

Left Ventricular Funct ion: Eject ion Fract ionand Glo bal Longi tudinal  Strain
Com pliment ing NT -proBNP for the evaluat ion of MEDI6570 in HF, LVEF and GLS will be 
secondary  endpoints in the study . Change in LVEF and change in GLS by  echocardi ography 
imaging fro m baseline to Day  253 will be measured and compared with placebo. 
LVEF is a well -established measurement of the systolic function of the left ventricle that 
predi cts prognosi s in post -MI patients ( Multicente r Postinfarct ion Research Group 1983 ). In 
addition, changes in LVEF fo llowing MI are predictive of sudden cardiac arrest and death 
(Chew et al 2018 ). Furtherm ore, pharm acologic improvem ents in LVEF have been linked to 
decreases in mortalit y and HFhospi talizati ons ( Breathett et al 2016 ,Kramer et al 2010 ). 
Improvem ents in LVEF can o ccur with ant i-inflammatory  therapi es. The CANTOS study  
demonstrated an improvement in the exercise capacit y (measured by peak oxygen 
consumption ) and LVEF in a subgroup analysis ( Trankle et al 2018 ).LVEF will be calculated 
as the ratio of stroke volume divided by  end-diastolic vo lume. 
Although LVEF isthe most extensively  used and investi gated assessment of l eft ventri cular 
funct ion, GLS is a new ,emerging technique that may  have a m ore si gnificant predi ctive value 
pertaining to outcomes in the HF populat ion when compared with LVEF (Kalam et al 2014 ). 
In a study  of 4172 pati ents wi th acute HF and varying degrees of LVEF, 1% improvement in 
GLS was associated with a 5% reduction in mortalit y risk irrespect ive of the ejection fraction
(Park et al 2018 ). Furtherm ore, i t has been shown that the reproducibilit y of GLS as a 
measurement of left ventri cular function surpasses that of LVEF,regardless of the level o f 
echocardiographic training (Karlsen et al2019 ).
Global Non -calcified Plaque Volume and Low Attenuat ion Plaque Volume
Two further measurements of plaque burden will be used in this study  as a secondary  
endpo int. NCPV i s the total  volume of  plaque in the coronary  arteri es that l acks calcificat ion. 
A subset of NCPV is LAPV.
Previous studies have shown increased NCPV and LAPV in patients with ACS when 
compared with patients with stable angina (Motoyama et al 2015 ,Dey et al  2014 ).This 
CCI
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 48of 131finding is consistent with lowattenuation plaque being a lipid -rich plaque , laden wit h 
lipid-rich foam cells, at the c ore of an athero ma.These lipid -rich foam cells are the target of 
MEDI6570. Due to the spatial reso lution of CTA, it is important to measure NCPV and LAPV 
to evaluate the effect of MEDI6570 on modifiable plaque vo lume in the coronary  arteri es
comprehensively . Computed tomography angiography measurements of NCPV and LAPV are 
highly  reproducible (Andelius et al 2018 ).Change in NCPV and LAPV in the coronary 
arteri es will be measured fro m baseline to Day  253 and compared wi th placebo. NCPV and 
LAPV were selected as secondary  endpoints ove r calcified and total  plaque vo lume for several 
reasons. First, when studied in ACS, specifically non -STEMI, NCPV is a better predictor of 
MACE when co mpared withAgatston calcium score and total plaque vo lume (Kristensen et al
2011 ).  
 
 In studi es evaluat ing plaque regressio n with statin use, regressio n of both 
NCPV and LAPV have been observed. LAPV reducti on has been associated wi th decrease in 
CVevents (Andelius et al 2018 ). NCPV and LAPV will be measured in all vess els≥2 mm  in 
diameter and expressed in mm3. Coronary  segments wi th stents or otherwi se deemed 
uninterpretable on the baseline or follow -up scan will  be excluded from  analysis .

decide whether screening laboratory  evaluat ions should be repeated . If the screening 
assessments are not considered to be representative of the usual statu s of the healt h of the 
participant by  the invest igator, or if ≥1 exclusio n criteria are considered temporary  (eg, 
diagnosti c angi ogram ) or from a reversible condit ion, repeat screening assessments to 
establish eligibilit y will generally  be permitted once, at the discretion o f the invest igator. 
Eligible participants who have a diagnosti c angi ogram  performedafter screening Vi sit 1 
in the absence of undergo ing a new PCI may continue screening after the diagnost ic 
angiogram has been performed (Exclusio n Cri terion 2).If they  exceed the 42-day 
pre-randomizat ion window, t he Medi cal Monitor will decide whether the participan t is 
requi red to be rescreened and whether screening laboratory  evaluat ions should be 
repeated. Participants who have a PCI performed between Screening Visit 1 and 
Randomization Visit 3 may not be rescreened.
Parti cipants who are excl uded based on elevated BP m ay be rescreened fo llowing 
adequate treatment (Exclusio n Cri terion 9(c)).
For eligible participants who are rescreened, the rescreen date must also be wi thin the MI

6.2.1 Study Intervention Insp ection
MEDI6570 is supplied in 6R vials as a sterile white to off -white lyophilized product. Placebo 
is supplied in 6R vials as a sterile liquid. 
If there are any defects noted with the study  intervent ion, the invest igator and site monitor 
shoul d be notified immediately.
6.2.2 Storage
The study  intervent ion should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). The invest igator or 
designee must confirm thatappropriate temperature condit ions have been maintained during 
transi t for all study  intervent ion received and that any discrepancies are reported and resolved 
before the study  intervent ionis used . 
All study  intervent ion must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored 
(manual  or autom ated) area i n accordance with the labeled storage condit ionsandwith access 
limited to authorized, unblinded site staff.
6.2.3 Dose Preparation Steps
The MEDI6570 and p lacebo doses must be prepared by the site’s designated unblinded study  
intervent ionmanager using asept ic technique.
The total time fro m needle puncture of the MEDI6570 vial or placebo vial to SC 
administration should not exceed:
24 hou rs at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)
4 hours at room temperature
If the preparati on time exceeds the time limits, a new dose m ust be prepared fro mnew vials. 
MEDI6570 and placebo do not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be 
discarded.
Reconstitution Procedure
Each vial o f MEDI6570 must be reconstituted with 1.3 mL of sterile water for injection to 
achieve  mg/mL MEDI6570. Slowly  add 1.3 mL of sterile water for inject ion by tilting the 
vial to one side such that the liquid stream is directed along the vial wall and not direct ly onto 
the lyophilized product . Gently swirl the so lution unt il all so lids are disso lved. Do not shake 
or vigorously  agitate the vial . Visually inspect the solut ion to ensure that the ent ire content of 
the lyophilized product is completely reconst ituted. The reconstituted solut ion shoul d appear 
clear to opal escent. A thin layer of bubbles on the surface of the li quid is norm al.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 58of 131Study  intervent ion will be dispensed at the study  visits as summarized in the SoA 
(Secti on1.3). The first day  of dosing i s consi dered Day 1.
The study  intervent ion administrator should be experienced in performing SC inject ions. The 
skin surface of the anterolateral thigh, upper outer tricep area, upper buttocks, o r abdomen 
(avoid a 2 -inch [5 cm]) radius around the umbilicus) should be prepared with an alcoho l wipe 
and allowed to air dry . The skin will be pinched to iso late SC ti ssue from  the m uscle. The 
needle will be inserted at a 90 -degree angle to the skin surfa ce approximately halfway  into the 
SC ti ssue. The study  intervent ion will be injected slowly (at an appropriate speed in 
accordance with local procedures ) into the SC tissue using gentle pressure. The area should 
not be m assaged after inject ion.
Study  intervention shoul d NOT be administered if it is not fully  reconsti tuted, if it has been at 
room  temperature for m ore than 4 hours, or if it has been at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for 
more than 24 hours.
6.2.5 Accountability
The site’s designated unblinded study  interventi on manager is required to maintain accurate 
study  interventi on accountabilit y records. Upon complet ion of the study , copies of 
investigat ional product accoun tabilit y records will be returned to the sponsor . All unused 
study  interventi on will be destroy ed locally , in accordance wi th local standard operating 
procedures, after full accountabilit y by the site has been performed. Destruction can be 
outsourced to a third party . Certificates of destruction must be collected.
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Randomization Procedure
Parti cipants will be randomized to an intervent ion group to minimize bias. 
Randomization will be performed after the blood and urine samples are collected on Day  1
(Visit 3).
A 3-stage randomizat ion procedure will be impl emented :
1 P articipants will first be grouped into strata according to geographic region (Asia, North 
Ame ricaand Rest of Worl d). 
2Then, wi thin each geographic region, participants will be grouped into strata according to 
thestatus o f their statin therapy intensity at baseline ( no,low-or moderate -intensity statin 
therapy ,vs high-intensity statin therapy ; refer to Appendix F).
3Then, wi thin each stratum, participants willbeassigned randomly to anintervention 
group according to randomizat ion schedules using a nRTSM system . 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59of 131Before the study  starts , the instructions for the RTSM will be provided to each site.
Re-allocation of participants to a dosing volume (Protocol Amendment 1): As a result of 
removing the  mg dose and introducing the mg dose in Amendment 1, a ll participants 
enrolled under Protocol Versi on 1.0were re-allocated to the appropriate dosing vo lume for 
their randomized intervent ion group under Amendment 1. Participants originally rando mized 
to the mg MEDI6570 group under Protocol Version 1.0 who ha d not completed treatment 
were switchedto the  m g MEDI6570 group under Amendment 1 . Parti cipants originally  
rando mized to the placebo group and who had not completed study  treatm ent were
re-randomized to one of the 3inject ion/volume-matched placebo group s under Amendment 1.
6.3.2 Blinding Proc edure
The parti cipant, the invest igator, and the site staff performing study- related procedures will all 
be blinded to the participant’s intervent ion group , with respect to active treatment versus 
placebo, to minimize bias.
The RTSM will provide to the invest igators or pharmacists the kit ident ification number to be 
allocated to the participant at the dispensing visit. Routines for this will be described in the 
RTSM user manual provided to each study  site.
The sponsor retains the rig ht to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected 
to be causally  related to the study  intervent ionand that potentially require expedited reporting 
to regulatory  authori ties. Rando mizat ion codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of 
data until all decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each individual participant have 
been made and documented.
The RTSM will be program med wi th blind- breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, in 
which the knowledge of the specific blind ed study treatm ent will affect the immediate 
management of the participant’s condit ion, the investigator has the sole responsibilit y for 
determining whether unblinding of a participant’s intervent ion assignment is warranted. 
Parti cipant safety  must al ways be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion. If a 
participant’s intervent ion assignment is unblinded, the spo nsor must be notified within 
24 hours after breaking the blind. The investigator must document and report the action to the 
sponsor, without revealing the participant’s treatment to the sponsor’s staff.
Parti cipants enrolled under Protocol  Amendment 2 will be rando mly assigned to one of 4 
possible intervent ion groups in a 2:2:1:1 ratio:  mg (with an inject ion volume of 1.5 mL) 
or mg (with an inject ion volume of 4.0 mL) MEDI6570, or aninject ion/volume-matched 
placebo (1.5 or 4.0 mL). Invest igators will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study 
intervent ion, with respect to active treatment versus placebo, throughout the course of the 
study .

Amendment 1 and were allocated a dosing vo lume of 0.5mL will cont inue on their 
rando mized study intervent ion (  mg MEDI6570, or its injection/vo lume-matched placebo) 
to the end of the study , and the study  blind will  be maintained with regard to active versus 
placebo.
To maintain the study blind, an otherwise uninvo lved third party  will be responsible for the 
reconstitution and dispensa tion of  all study  intervent ion and will endeavor to ensure that there 
are no differences in the times taken to dispense the study  intervent ions fo llowing 
rando mizat ion.
Areas of the pharmacy where the study  intervent ion is being stored and prepared must be
accessed only by  unblinded team  members. 
In the event of a Qualit y Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded 
study  interventi on records at the si te(s) to verify that randomization and/or dispensing has 
been done accurately.
Laboratory results
The parti cipant, investigator and study  site staff will remain blinded to the following 
post-randomizat ion laboratory  resul ts:
  
NT-proBNP


Concentrations of MEDI6570 in serum
ADAs
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Parti cipants will receive study  intervent ion directly fro m the invest igator or designee, under 
medical supervisio n, at the clinic . The date ,and time if applicable, of dose administ rationwill 
be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF .The dose of study  intervent ion

The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any  questi ons regarding conco mitant or 
prior therapy . 
6.5.1 Perm itted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed n ecessary to provide 
adequate supportive care. Specifically, participants should receive standard of care during the 
study  in accordance with their institutional guidelines. Participants should be considered for a 
high-intensity statin and for anti-platel et therapi es based on existing guidelines for long -term 
management of patients after a myocardial infarction .Participants with a need for chronic 
therapeutic anticoagulation therapy are excluded from study participati on;however ,short -term 
treatmen t with prophylactic doses of heparin/low molecular weight heparin are allowed
(Section 6.5.2 and Section 7.1).
In view of the use of ant i-platel et therapy  in this popul ation, the use of PPIs is encouraged, to 
confer gastric protection in the event that the concomitant use of NSAIDs is required. This is 
of special considerat ion in this study  popul ation because of a theoretical risk of bleeding 
highlighted in Table 6.
If the participant requires concomitant NSAID therapy , Invest igators are encouraged to 
prescribe PPIs in order to minimize the theoretical risk of bleeding events.
Guidance for parti cipants undergoing COVID -19 vaccination during the study  is provi ded in 
Appendix G 4.
6.5.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
The need for chronic therapeutic anticoagulation therapy is an exclusion criterion. If the 
participant develops a condition that requires the use of chronic therapeutic anticoagulation 
therapy during dosing, temporary or permanent discontinuation of study intervention should be 
considered by  the investigator, based on assessment of bleeding risk.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
It may be ne cessary  for a parti cipant to discont inue study  intervent iontemporarily  or 
perm anent ly. An individual parti cipant will  discontinue study  intervent ion (either tem porarily  
or perm anent ly)if any o f the following occur sin the participant in quest ion:
1An AE that in the opinio n of the investigator or the sponsor contraindicates dosing.
2Clinical symptoms of spontaneous bleeding so that the PI judges further administration of 
study  interventi onshoul d be paused or stopped.
(a)Provi ders shoul d consi der tem porary  or permanent discont inuat ion of study  
intervent ion in participants who : 
(i) D evelop a condi tionthat requi res the use of chronic therapeutic anticoagulati on 
therapy .
(ii)Experi ence s evere bleeding that is not readily  explained by a reversible al ternate 
etiology. All bleeding events should be treated and fo llowed up according to 
local clinical pract ice. Study  intervent ionmay be resumed when the risk of 
bleeding is deemed low in the judgment of the investigator.
(b)Study  intervent ion must be stopped in the event of seve re thrombocy topeni a (platelet 
count < 50000 platelets/ µL) which does not resolve, or if after resolution the 
investigator thinks it is not appropriate to restart study  intervent ion because it may 
put the participant at undue risk.
3A generalized hypersensit ivity reacti on occurring which ,in the o pinion of the PI and/or 
the Medical Monitor,would warrant discont inuat ion.
4After init ial dosing, there exists a clinically significant safet y issue based on informat ion 
not known or not disclosed before rando mizat ion.
5Parti cipant non -compliance that, i n the opinio n of the invest igator or sponsor, warrants 
withdrawal  (eg, ref usal or inabilit y to adhere to scheduled visits).
6Withdrawal o f consent.
If study  intervent ion is perm anently discont inued, the participant will remain in the study  to be 
evaluated for protocol -specified assessments including fo llow-up of  any AEs unless consent is 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion (Secti on7.2) or the parti cipant i s lost to f ollow-up
(Secti on7.3).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 63of 1317.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study
A participant may withdraw fro m the study  at any  timeat his/her own request
(withdrawal  of consent) .
A participant who considers wit hdrawing consent from  the study  must be inform ed by  the 
investigator about modified fo llow-up opti ons (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a 
relative or treating physician, o r information fro m medical records). If the participant 
agrees to any  of these methods of fo llow-up, then he/she will not be considered to have 
withdrawn consent.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may  
retain and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent.
If a participant withdraws fro m the study , it shoul d be confirmed whether he/she st ill 
agrees that exist ing samples may be used in line with the original consent. If he/she 
requests withdrawal of consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested should be carried in line wit h what was stated in the informed consent and local 
regul ations. The invest igator must document the decisio n on use of exist ing samples in 
the site study  records and inform the Global Study  Team .
7.3 Lost to Follow -up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by  the study  siteby the en d of the study . 
The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance o f maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to fo llow-up, the invest igator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with th e participant (where possible, 3telephone calls and, 
if necessary , a certified l etter to the parti cipant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.
If the participant’s final healt h status can be determined by contact with a relat ive or 
personal doctor, then the participant will not be deemed to be lost to follow -up.
Site personnel will attempt to collect the vital status of the participant within legal and 
ethical boundaries for all participants randomized, including those who did not receive 
study  interventi on. Public sources m ay be searched for vital status informat ion. If vital 
status is determined as deceased, this will be do cumented and the participant will not be 
considered lost to fo llow-up. Sponsor personnel will not be invo lved in any attempts to 
collect vital status information.

8.1 Efficacy Assessments
8.1.1 CTA Im aging
8.1.1.1 Timing of CTA Imaging Relative to Echocardiogram
If echocardiogram (Section 8.1.2 ) and CTA imaging are performed on the same day, 
echocardiogram imaging must always occur before CTA imaging, and before any addit ional 
beta-blocker administration above the daily dose used by the participant , to avoid large doses 
of a beta-blocker affect ing echocardiogram measurements. This only  applies to abeta-blocker 
given for the purposes of heart r ate control for coronary  CTA. Parti cipants shoul d cont inue 
taking th eir clinically  prescribed dose of beta -blocker as scheduled.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 65of 1318.1.1.2 Criteria for CTA Imaging
For the pre -randomizat ion peri od, CTA imaging requirements are included in the inclusion 
criteria (Secti on 5.1). 
For the fo llow
-up peri od, parti cipants must meet the following criteria before CTA imaging:
1Using creat inine samples for the calculat ions, eGFR must be ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m2(within 
30 day s beforethe CTA scan ).Sites are permitted to test for an addit ional creat inine 
(local or central ), if needed for the purposes of CTA imaging.
2No known allergy to iodinated con trast or known history  of contrast -induced 
nephropathy .
3No history  of coronary  bypa ss surgery .
4No active arr hythmia including atrial fibrillat ionoratrial flutter on the day  of CTA 
imaging that would likely interfere with qualit y of CTA imaging. Parti cipants can return 
for CTA imaging on another day , if necessary.
5No c ontraindication to nitroglycerin.
6Not have r apid heart rate that i s uncontrolled by  medi cal therapy .
7Parti cipants who have any condit ion that, in the opinio n of the investigator, would 
increase the risk associated with having CTA imaging (eg, clinically significant renal 
disease) will not undergo CTA imaging.
8.1.1.3 Radiation Exposure from CTA Imaging, Including Rules for Repeating CTA 
Scans 
The overarching principle for CTA imaging will be to maximize high -qualit y CTA imaging 
for endpo int ascertainment while minimizing radia tion exposure to participants. 
The ant icipated m edian (range) radiat ion exposure per CTA imaging time point is 
6(3-10)mSv. A maximum cumulat ive radiat ion exposure of 30 mSv is anticipated in this 
study  and will be m onitored by  the CTA core laboratory  thro ugh a radiat ion monitoring 
escalat ion plan. Radiat ion dose will be est imated based on dose length product using a 
K(conversio n) factor of 0.014. Dose -saving image acquisit ion techniques will be used where 
applicable. 
The baseline and fo llow-up CTA scans may be repeated under certain circumstances . 
In order to ensure that the overall radiation exposure remains wit hin the specified limit, rules 
for CTA scans are detailed by time point below :
1Baseline CTA (Day  -30 to -1; Visit 2 ):
(a)If the baseline CTA scan is obtained but randomization does not occur within the 
prespecified screening window, there is a 30-day window to repeat screening and 
proceed wi th rando mizat ion using the init ial baseline CTA. If repeat screening

the CTA imaging protocol, which will accommo date differences in imaging platforms across 
sites.
8.1.2 Echocardiogra phy
Parti cipants m ust m eet the study  eligibilit y criteria (Secti ons5.1and 5.2) before undergoing 
echocardiogram imaging. If echocardiogram and CTA imaging are performed on the same 
day, echocardi ogram imaging must always occur beforeCTA imaging, and before any 
additional beta-blocker is administered above the daily  dose used by  the partici pant.
Imaging personnel and equipment will undergo certification by  a separate, blinded, 
independent core laboratory . Echocardiography will be perform ed at time points specified in 
the SoA (Secti on 1.3).
Planned measurements include , as f ollows:
Left Ventricular Ejection Fract ion
Left Ven tricular GLS

Any addit ional measurements asdescribed in the echo imaging manual/protocol
Theechocardi ogram  images will be analyzed in the core l aboratory . The echocardiography 
imaging manual describe stheimaging protocol ,which willaccommo datedifferences in 
imaging plat forms across sites.
If for any  reason an echocardi ogram image is deemed uninterpretable for any planned 
measurements by the core laboratory, then echocardiogra phymay be repeated atthe discret ion 
of the invest igator, participant , and Medical Monit or. The repeat echocardiogram must be 
obtained within the time specif ied for the visit window in the SoA (Secti on
 1.3).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 70of 1318.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and S erious 
Adverse Event Information
Non-serious AEs will be collected fro m the time of rando mizat ionthroughout the treatment 
period and including the follow-up peri od.
Serious adverse events will be recorded from the time of signing of the first ICF(either the 
brief, pre -screening ICF or the full, screening ICF) throughout the treatment period and 
including the follow -up peri od.
If the invest igator becomes aware of a nSAEwith a suspected causal relat ionship to the 
investigat ional product that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by  
him or her, the invest igator shall, wit hout undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor.
8.3.2 Follow- up of Adverse Events and S erious A dverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant ’s last AE assessment in the study are followed 
up by  the invest igator for as l ong as medically  indicated, but wi thout further recording in the 
eCRF . The sponsor retains the right to request additional information for any participant with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
Adverse event variables
The fo llowing variable s will be collected for each AE:
AE (verbat im)
The date wh en the AE started and stopped
Maximum intensit y
Whether the AE is serious or not
Whether the AE is an inject ion site reaction
Invest igator causalit y rating against the invest igational product (yes or no)
Action taken with regard to invest igational product
AE caused participant ’s discontinuat ionofIP administrati on (yes or no )
Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
Date AE m et cri teria for seri ous AE
Date invest igator became aware of serious AE
AE is seri ous due to

Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion
8.3.3 Causality Collection
The invest igator should assess causal re lationship between investigational product and each 
AE, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable 
possibilit y that the event may  have been caused by the investigational product ?’
For SAEs, causal relat ionship shoul dalso be assessed for other medicat ion and study  
procedures . Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure ,the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix B .
8.3.4 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the participant or care provider ,reported in response to an 
open question fro m the study  site staff (ie, Have you had any healt h probl ems since the 
previous visit/y ou were previ ously  asked ?), or reveal ed by  observati on,will be co llected and 
recorded in the eCRF . When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is prefe rred (when 
possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms . However, if a diagnosis is known and 
there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis 
and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
In addi tion,the recording of CV events (in this study to include CV death, MI, stroke, 
coronary  revascularizat ion, and heart failure hospitalizat ion) are important efficacy  measures 
in CV clinical trials. All CV events will be recorded as AEs to allow for furthe r 
characteri zation. Alt hough this study  will not be powered for these endpoints, the study  will 
explore the effect of MEDI6570 on these important parameters .
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be summarized in the 
CSR .
Deteri oration from baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values orvital signs shoul d 
therefore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfillany of the SAE cri teria, are the reason for 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent wi th the investigational product or are considered to be clinically 
relevant as j udged by the invest igator (which may include but not limited to consideration as 
to whether treatment or non -planned visits were required or other action was taken with the 
study  treatm ent[eg,dose adjustment or drug interruption ]).
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72of 131If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated labor atory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible ,the reporting invest igator
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg,anemia versus low hemoglobin value) . In 
the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, c linically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease under study .
8.3.6 Hy’s Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry  may requi re further 
evaluat ion and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥2xULN m ay need 
to be reported as SAEs . Further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and 
evaluat ion of Hy’s Law is given in Appendix E .
8.3.7 Reporting of Serious A dverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the invest igational 
product , or to the study  procedure(s) . All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then investigator s or other site pe rsonnel inform 
the sponsor’s appropriate representatives within 1 day,ie,immediately but no later th an 
24hours afterhe or she beco mes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the sponsor’s Patient Safet y data entry  site within 1
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For f atal or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately . invest igator s or other site personnel inform the 
sponsor’s representatives of any  follow-up inform ation on a previ ously reported SA E within 
1calendar day ,ie,immediately but no later than 24 hours afterhe or she beco mes aware of 
it.
Once the invest igator s or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the electronic data 
capture system, an automated email alert is sent to the sponsor’s designated representative.
If the electroni c data capture system  is not available, then the invest igator or other study  site 
staff reports a nSAE to the appropriate sponsor representative by teleph one.

8.3.8.1 Maternal Exposure
Women of childbearing potential are not allowed to be included in this study . Shoul d a 
pregnancy st ill occur, the invest igational produ ct should be discontinued immediately, and the 
pregnancy reported to the sponsor.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE. Congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects and 
spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions wit hout 
complicat ions should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarri age, el ective terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormalit y) 
shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the participant was disc ontinued fro m the 
study .
If any pregnancy  occurs during the study , then the investigator or other site personnel informs 
the appropriate sponsor representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24hours after he or she becom es aware of it .
The sponsor’s designated representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is provided to the sponsor’s Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 5 cal endar 
days for SAEs (Section 8.3.7 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.

The definit ion of a study  interventi on error can be found in Appendix B.
8.4 Overdose
For thi s study , any dose of MEDI 6570 greater than the intended maximum invest igated dose 
per parti cipant will be considered an overdose.
In cases of known or suspected overdose :
Symptom atic treatm ent and m onitoring of vi tal functi ons shoul d be performed according 
to routine clinical pract ice.An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE 
diagnosis/symptom s on the rel evant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose of a stu dy intervent ionoccurs during the study , the invest igator or other si te

9.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The primary efficacy  variable is NCPV MD,which is defined asthe coronary  segment wi th the 
largest NCPV on the baseline scan. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in change 
from baseline in NCPV MDbetween a MEDI6570 dose group and the placebo group. The 
alternat ive hypothesis is that the change fro m baseline inNCPV MDreducti on is larger in the 
MEDI6570 mg group compared with thepooled placebo group .

This sect ion summarizes the planned stati stical analyses of the endpo ints,including primary 
and secondary  endpoints.
A co mprehensive SAP will be finalized within one m onth of the first participant being dosed.
The SAP will include a more technical and detailed descript ion of the statistical analyses 
described in this sect ion. Any subsequent amendments to the SAP will be documented, with 
final amendments completed before unblinding of the data for the analysis. Details of all 
analyses will be documented fully in the SAP. 
9.4.1 General Considerations
All primary , secondary , and expl oratory  efficacy  endpoints will be summarized descript ively. 
Categorical data will be summarized by the number and percentage of participants in each 
category . Continuous variables will be summarized by  descri ptive statistic s, eg, n, mean,
geom etric mean, SD, coefficient of variat ion, median, interquartile range , minimum, and 
maximum. Baseline values will be defined as the last assessment before the first 
administration of study  intervent ion. 
P-values will be presented as 1-sided wi thout m ultiplicit y adjust ments. Confidence intervals 
will be presented as 90%, 2-sided, wi thout m ultiplicity adjust ments.
9.4.2 Efficacy
9.4.2.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint is change from baseline in NCPV MD. AnANCOVA model on change 
from baseline adjusted for treatm ent group , baseline, and rando mizat ion strata will be used for 
the primary analysis. The CTA analysis popul ation will be used for the primary analysis.
Per-protocol analysis for the primary endpo int will be performed on the per -protocol CTA
analysis population. Addit ional sensit ivity analysis may  also be done for the primary endpoint , 
andbaseline-by- treatm ent interacti on effect will be evaluated ;further details will be provided 
in the SAP. 
9.4.2.2 Secondary Endpoints
NT-proBNP
Secondary  endpoint of relative change fro m baseline in NT -proBNP will be analyzed based on 
the ITT populat ion. Rel ative change fro m baseline is define das the ratio of the post-baseline 
visit value over the baseline value ,expressed as apercentage . AMMRM analysis will be 
perform ed. The dependent variable is change fro m baseline for the log -transformed value of 
NT-proBNP , ie log(post -baseline visit value) minus log(baseline value) . The results will be 
back-transformed to the original scale. The m odel will include fixed effects of treatm ent 
group, vi sit, treatm ent group -by-visit interaction, andrando mizat ion strat a, with baseline

Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
B 1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AEis the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical 
study  participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relat ionship with this treatm ent.An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign ( eg, an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom ( eg,nausea, chest pain), or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a medi cinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product . 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence . An AE m ay occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study intervent ion has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Event
AnSAEis an AE occurring during any study phase ( ie,run-in, treatment, washout, follow -up) 
that fulfi lls one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -partici pant hospitali zation or prol ongation of exist ing hospitali zation 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
Is an Important Medical Event that may jeopardi ze the participant or may  requi re medical 
treatm ent to prevent o ne of the outcom es listed above
AEs for malignant tumo rsreported during a study  should generally be assessed as serious 
AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medi cal Event’ cri terion shoul d be 
used. In certain situations, however, medi cal judgment on an individual event basis should be 
applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assessed and reported as a 
non-serious AE. For example, if the tumo r is included as medical history  and progressi on 
occurs duri ng the study , but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may  not fulfillthe attributes for being assessed as serious, al though 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumoras an AE is valid and should occur. Also, 
some ty pes of  malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospitalizat ion, may be assessed as non-serious; examples in adult s include 
Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cancer remove d via cone biopsy .
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88of 131Life-threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant ’s death . ‘Life -threateni ng’ does not m ean that ,had an AE occurred in a more 
severe form ,it might have caused death ( eg,hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalization
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reason s 
for it may be ( eg,bronchospa sm, laryngeal  edema) . Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the participant was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i tdid not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where Important Medi cal Events may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death, hospitaliz ation, disabili ty or incapacit y but may jeopard izethe participant or may 
requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous. 
These should usually be cons idered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an Important Medi cal Event ; 
medical judg ment must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetam ol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias ( eg,neutropenia or an emia requiring blood transfusio n, etc) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitali zation
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Intensity Rating Scale
mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs . Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious . For example, nausea that persists for 
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89of 131several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a nSAE unless i t meets the cri teria 
shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a nSAE when i t satisfies the cri teria 
shown in Appendix B 2.
B 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y,consider the fo llowing factors when deciding 
whether there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by  the study  
intervent ion.
Time Course . Exposure to study  intervent ion. Has the participant actually received the 
study  interventi on? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the study  interventi on?
Consistency wit h known drug profile . Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the study  intervent ion(pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or intervent ions of 
the sam e pharmacol ogical class? Or coul d the AE be ant icipated fro m its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience . Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause . The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etio logy such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Did the AE re -occur if the study  intervent ionwas reintroduced
after having been stopped? The sponsor would not normally reco mmend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests . A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogn ized feature of overdose of the study intervent ion?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case . The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the availabl e data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment . Wit h no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’ .
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to lack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 90of 131B 4 Study Intervention Error
For the purposes of this clinical study ,a study  intervent ion error i s an unintended failure or 
mistake in the process for administering astudy interven tionthat either causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant . 
A study  intervent ion error i s not l ack of  efficacy of the study  interventi on, but rather a human 
or process related failure while the study  intervent ion is in the control  of the study  site staff or 
participant.
Study  intervent ion error includes situat ions where an error :
occurred
was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
did not occur, but circumstances wer e recogni zedthat coul d have l ed to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as study  intervent ion errors:
Study  intervent ion name confusio n
Dispensing error ,eg, study intervent ion prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  
given to the participant
Study  intervent ion not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site 
of administrati on
Study  intervent ion not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be 
taken as a solid tablet 
Study  intervent ion not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
Wrong participant received the study  interventi on (excluding RTSM errors)
Wrong study  intervent ion administered to participant (excluding RTSM errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as study  interventi on errors in clinical 
studi es:
Errors related to or resulting fro m RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
events listed above that woul d otherwi se have been a study  intervent ion error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed study  intervent ion dose(s) eg, forgot to take study 
intervent ion
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused study  intervent ion or em pty packaging
Study  intervent ion error s are not regarded as AEs, but AEs m ay occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

Handling of Human Biological Samples
C 1 Chain of Custody
A full chain o f custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The invest igator at each cent erkeeps full traceability of co llected bio logical sam ples f rom the 
participants while in storage at the cent eruntil shipment or di sposal  (where appropri ate) and 
records relevant processing informat ion related to the samples while at site.
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal.
The sponsor or delegated representatives will keep oversig ht of the ent ire lifecycle through 
internal  procedures, m onitoring of study  sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requi rements of external laboratory  provi ders
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the sponsor’s assigned bio banks or other 
sample archive facilit ies and will be tracked by  theappropriate staff during for t he remainder 
of the sam ple life cycle.
If requi red, the sponsor will ensure that remaining bio logical  samples are returned to the si te 
according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner.
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a parti cipant wi thdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical  samples, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroy ed/repatriated, and the action documented. If samples have already been 
analy zed,the sponsor is not obliged to destroy the results of th e research.
Following wi thdrawal  of consent for bi ological samples, further study  partici pation shoul d be 
considered in relat ion to the wi thdrawal  processes outlined in the informed consent.
The invest igator:
Ensures participant’s withdrawal of informed conse nt to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to the sponsor or del egate
Ensures that relevant human bio logical samples from  that parti cipant, if stored at the 
study  site, are i dentified immediately , disposed of appropriate ly, and that the action is 
docum ented
Ensures that the participant and the sponsor are informed about the sample disposal

Guidance Document
LABELING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES
IATA ( https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/ca rgo/dgr/Pages/download.aspx ) classifies 
infect ious substances into 3 categories: Category  A, Category  B or Exem pt
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. 
Category A pathogens are, e g, Ebola, Lassa fever virus. Infect ious substances meet ing these 
criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 
2814. Infectious substances which cause disease only  in animals must be assigned to UN 
2900.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category  B pathogens are , eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses. They 
are assigned the fo llowing UN number and proper shipping name.
UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -Substances which do not contain infect ious substances or substances which are 
unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they  
meet the criteria for inc lusio n in another class.
Clinical study samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulat ions
Clinical study  samples will routinely  be packed and transported at ambient temperature in 
IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo /cargo/dgr/Documents/DGR -60-EN-PI650.pdf).
Biological samples transported in dry  ice requi re addi tional dangerous goods specificat ion

Optional Genomics Initiative Sample
D 1 Use/Analysis of DNA
The sponsor intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response 
to medicati ons. This g enetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, bet ter 
diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt hcare and to the di scovery  of new 
diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicat ions. Therefore, where local regulat ions and IRB/IEC 
allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis fro m consent ing participants .
This optional genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the 
participant´s DNA, ie,the entire geno me. 
The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary.
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a s ecure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confident iality.
The samples will be retained for up to 15 years after the end of the study .
D 2 Genetic Research Plan and Procedures
Selection of Genetic Research Population
All participant s will be asked to parti cipate in this genet ic research . Parti cipat ion is vo luntary 
and if a participant declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefi t. The 
participant will not be excluded fro m any aspect of the main study .
Inclusion Criteria
For in clusion in this genet ic research, participant s must fulfil l all of the inclusio n criteria 
described in Secti on 5.1andprovide informed consent for the Geno mics Init iative sampling 
and analyses.
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
Previ ous all ogeneic bone m arrow transpl ant
Non-leukocyte de pleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collection
Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research
Parti cipants may  withdraw from  this genet ic research at any t ime, independent of any 
decisio n concerning participation in other aspects of t he main study . Vol untary  
withdrawal  will not prej udice further treatment . Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in 
Section 7.2.

MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94of 131Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
The blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained fro m the participant s at Day 1 , 
Visit 3 (before dosing) . Although DNA is stable, early  sample collecti on is preferred to avoid 
introducing bias through excluding participant s who may wit hdraw due to an AE . If for any  
reason the sample is not drawn at Day 1, Visit 3 ,it may  be taken at any  visit until the l ast 
study  visit. Only one sample should be co llected per participant for genet ics during the study.
Coding and Storage of DNA Samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain participant confident iality. Sam ples will  be stored for a m aximum  
of 15years fro m the date of l ast participant last visit, af ter whi ch they  will be destroy ed. 
DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses . Sam ples will  be stored and used 
until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to t he sample eit her before or at the time of 
DNA extraction replacing the informat ion on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will 
be ident ifiable only by the second, unique number . Thi s number i s used to i dentify  the 
sample and corresponding data at the sponsor’s genet ics laboratori es, or at the designated 
organi zation. No personal details ident ifying the individual will be available to any  person 
(sponsor employee or designated organi zations working with the DNA).
The link between the participant enrol lment/randomi zation code and the second number 
will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at sponsor or 
designated organi zations. The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regulatory  
audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the stu dy, including this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in Appendix A.
Informed Consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal and the participant may part icipate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in this genet ic co mponent . To participate 
in the genet ic co mponent of the study ,the participant must sign and date both the consent 
form for the m ain study  and the add endum for the Geno mics Init iative component of the 
study . Copi es of both si gned and dated consent forms must be given to the participant and the 
original  filed at the study  cent er. The Principal investigator (s) is responsible for ensuring that 
consent is given freely and that the participant understands that they  may freely wi thdraw
from the genetic aspect of the study  at any  time.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95of 131Participant Data Protection
The sponsor will not provide individual genotype r esults to participant s, any  insurance 
company, any emplo yer, thei r family members, or general physician unless required to do 
so by  law.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being 
linked to the ident ity of the participant . In except ional circumstances, however, certain 
individuals might see both the genet ic data and the personal ident ifiers of a participant . 
For example, in the case of a medical emergency , a sponsor physician or an invest igator 
might know a partic ipant ’s ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data . 
Regulatory  authori ties may requi re access to the relevant files, though the participant ’s 
medical informat ion and the genet ic files would remain physically separate.
Data Management
Any gen etic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system by the sponsor
and/or designated organizations to analyze the sampl es.
The sponsor and its designated organi zations may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of in dividuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with 
other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organi zations or health insurance 
companies . This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can 
be co mbined with the resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even more about health and 
disease . The researchers can only  use thi s inform ation for health -related research 
purposes . Researchers may see summary result s but they  will not be able to see individual 
participant data or any personal ident ifiers . 
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic 
data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemi stry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potenti al Hy’s Law cases and Hy’s Law cases . It is not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of e levated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion 8.3.6 .
During the study  the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry . The 
investi gator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential Potenti al 
Hy’s Law criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of Potenti al Hy’s Law and 
Hy’s Law events; thi s includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other visi ts 
including central and all local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  
visits; for example, Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated ALT from a 
central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL fro m a local laboratory . 
The invest igator will also review AEdata (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible Potenti al Hy’s Law events.
The invest igator participates, together with the sponsor’s clinical  proj ect representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria to agree whether Hy ’s 
Law criteria are m et. HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry  other than DILI caused by the invest igational product.
The invest igator is responsible for recording data pertaining to Potential H y’s Law /Hy’s Law 
cases and for reporting SAEs and AEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment 
in line wit h standard safety  reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥3x ULN together with TBL ≥2xULN at any  point during the study  following 
the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in ALP.
Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥3x ULN together with TBL ≥2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
investi gational product , can be found to explain t he combinat ion of increases, eg,elevated 
ALP indicat ing cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug .

MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 97of 131For Potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be 
coincident with ( ie,on the same day ) the el evation in TBL, but the re is no specified t imeframe 
within which the elevat ions in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of Potenti al Hy’s Law, it is important to perform a comprehensive 
review of laboratory  data for any  participant who meets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion 
criteria in iso lation or in co mbinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3x ULN
AST ≥ 3x ULN
TBL ≥ 2x ULN
Central Laboratories Being Used :
When a participant meets any of the Potenti al Hy’s Law ident ification criteria, in iso lation or 
in combinat ion, the central laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the invest igator (also 
sent to the sponsor’s representative). 
The invest igator will also rema in vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the Potential 
Hy’s Law ident ificat ion criteria are met ;where this is the case ,the invest igator will:
Notify  the sponsor’s representative .
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory without delay .
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  eCRF module(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t.
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts,the 
investigator will wit hout delay:
Determine whether the participant meets Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria ( refer to
Appendix E 2for definit ion) by reviewing laborator y reports fro m all previous visit s 
(including both central and local laboratory  resul ts).
Local Laboratories Being Used :
The invest igator will wit hout delay  review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the sponsor’s representative .
Determine whether the participant meets Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria ( refer to
Appendix E 2for definit ion) by reviewing lab oratory  reports fro m all previous visit s.
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98of 131E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the participant does not meet Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria the invest igator will:
Inform  the sponsor’s representative that the participant has not m et Potential Hy’s Law 
criteria.
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP.
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the participant does m eet Potential Hy’s Law criteri a the invest igator will:
Determine whether Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria were m et at any  study  visit beforestarting 
study  treatm ent (refer to Section 8.3.6 ).
Notify  the sponsor’s representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
Within 1 day of Potential  Hy’s Law criteria being met, the invest igator will report the 
case as an SAE of Pot ential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important Medical Event’ and 
causalit y assessment ‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For participant s that met Potential Hy’s Law criteria before starting the study  
intervent ion, the investigator is not requi red to submit a Potenti al Hy’s Law SAE unless 
there is a significant change1in the participant ’s condit ion.
The Study  Physician contacts the investigator to provi de gui dance, di scuss ,and agree on 
an approach for the study  participant s’ follow-up (including any  further l aboratory  
testing) and the continuous review of data
After this contact ,the invest igator will:
Moni tor the participant until liver bio chemistry  param eters and appropri ate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Complete fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic i nvesti gations as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which ofthe tests 
available in the Hy’s Law lab ki t shoul d be used.
Com plete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules a s informat ion beco mes available.
                                               
1A ‘significant’ change in the participant’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically 
relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whe ther there has been a significant change will 
be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any 
uncertainty .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 99of 131E 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this section shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where Potenti al Hy’s Law 
criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the invest igator to review available data and agree on whether there is an 
alternat ive explanat ion for meeting Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria other than DILI caused by the 
investigat ional product , to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorit ies wit hin 
15calendar days from  date Potential Hy’s Law criteria was met . The sponsor’s Global 
Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review 
together with other subject matter experts as appropriate . 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the invest igator will follow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subseq uently whether the AE meets the criteria for a nSAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the sponsor’s standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the invest igational product :
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to the sponsor’s standard 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
 As there is no al ternat ive explanation for the Hy’s Law case, a causalit y 
assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 15 calendar day s in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria fo r Hy’s Law , then i t is assumed 
that there is no alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causa lity assessment i s related to 
investigat ional product and seriousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP 
process for SAE reporting.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 100of 131Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan . Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtai ned, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether Hy’s Law criteria are still met . Update the previously submitted Poten tial Hy’s 
Law SAE report fo llowing CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of 
the review and amending the repor ted term  if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemistry  elevat ions is determined.

Risk Assessment for COVID -19 Pandemic
G 1 Background to COVID -19
There i s currently an outbreak of respiratory  disease (COVID -19) caused by a novel severe 
acute respiratory  syndrom e coronavi rus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) that was first detected in Wuhan 
City, Hubei Province, China in 2019. This new virus spread across the globe rapidly, and 
caused the WHO to declare a pandemic situat ion on 12 March 2020. The countermeasures 
initiated by  national and l ocal governments worl dwide and the recommendat ions issued by the 
healt h authori ties have affected current and new clinical studies. As the threat of the pandemic 
burden, including new outbreaks, locally or globally, will affect the conduct of clinical
studi es, appropri ate ri sk assessments and mit igation measures need to be considered in all 
clinical studies to protect participants, site staff, and societ y as a whole.
Both EMA and FDA, as well as nat ional health authori ties in Europe, have i ssued new 
guidelines that aim to provide recommendations for actions for conduct of clinical studies o f 
medical products during the COVID -19 pandemic. Since the pandemic situat ion is evo lving, 
guidelines, recommendations, nat ional laws, and local  restricti ons m ay chan ge at a hi gh pace. 
Given the circumstances o f a potenti ally relapsing pandemic or epi demic si tuation with regard 
to the spread of COVID- 19 in the future, special attention will be paid to protect study  
participants and site staff against infection wit h COV ID-19 as requested by  the EMA 
guideline.
G 2 Risk Assessment for COVID -19 Pandemic
G2.1 Risk versus Benefit Assessment for MEDI6570
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, in a recent study  conducted in severe and crit ical COVID- 19-infected patients, 
researchers reported that the expressio n of  by immature neutrophils posi tively 
correl ated wi th clinical  severi ty and wi th the cy tokine storm  (IL-1b, IL -6, IL -8, TNFα), 
(Combadiere et al 2020 ). Moreover, i t was associ ated wi th intravascular coagulat ion and 
higher ri sks of severe thrombosis ( Combadiere et al 2020). Thes e data suggest that treatment 
with MEDI6570, , may o ffer benefit for those infected with COVID -19.

participants and staff as a result of increased travel (to and from study  sites) and interacti on 
between participants and study  site staff to conduct protocol -specified procedures.
Measures to mit igate the addit ional risks caused by COVID -19 are as fo llows:
Enrollment to the study  will only start when the sponsor and CRO in collaboration deem 
it is safe to start the study . In addi tion, the study  will not start until the local confinement 
measures or other safet y restricti ons linked to the COVID -19 pand emic imposed by the 
local authori ties are com patible with safe conduct of the study.
The sponsor and CRO will perform continual risk assessments throughout the study , 
paying attention to evolving local infect ion rates and adapt ing as required, for example,
by temporarily  pausing screening at a site if required. Current national laws and local 
recommendat ions for prevention o f pandemic will be adhered to strict ly.
Parti cipants will be m onitored cl osely throughout the study  during the pandemic for any  
of the signs and symptom s current ly recognized by the WHO and local guidelines to 
indicate possible COVID -19 infect ion. If clinical signs of COVID -19 infect ion are 
reported by  parti cipants, the invest igator will determine whether protocol- specified study  
samples can be collected, and whether safet y data can be recorded on site. If not, adverse 
events and conco mitant medicat ions will be obtained via phone calls. If a participant 
shows symptoms of COVID -19 infect ion, the investigator will have discret ion (wi th 
suppo rt and guidance from the Medical Monitor if requi red) to determine whether the 
participant shoul d continue wit h dosing. 
The probabilit y of virus transmission will be controlled as much as possible by:
Advising the participant to adhere to local requiremen ts for reducing the public 
exposure while ambulatory .
Study  site staff will m onitor themselves for COVID -19 symptoms, and in the event 
of devel oping symptom s or having a posi tive COVID -19 test result, should not attend 
the site or com e into person -to-person contact with any part icipants; this may  also 
extend to other scenarios o f potenti al infect ion risk as defined by local guidance and 
laws.
Parti cipants may  be contacted by  telephone before a visit to enquire whether 
COVID -19 symptom s and si gns are present, and they  shoul d be asked not to attend 
the site if they  are suspected to be infected with COVID -19. In addit ion, participants 
may be asked whether they  have been in contact wit h a person who has tested 
positive for COVID -19. If applicable, participants will be referred to the local health 
care system  for further fo llow-up and treatm ent.
Physical distancing and person- to-person contact restrict ions will apply during site 
visits and in -house confinement.

MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 105of 131Where physical distancing is not possi ble, personal protective equipment will be used 
by study  parti cipants (face masks, gloves) and staff (for example but not limited to: 
face masks, gloves, protectors, medical suit s) if deemed appropriate by  the 
investigators and site staff and guided by loc al requi rements.
Logist ical improvements of the site and structural measures of the study  site building 
will be implemented to improve physical distancing further.
G2.3 Restrictions Related to COVID -19
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, participants are advised to adhere to local requirements for 
reducti on of  the public COVID -19 exposure while ambulatory . If applicable, before Screening 
Visit 1, potenti al parti cipants shoul d be called to confirm they  are not experi encing any  
COVID -19 symptom s and signs and are asked not to attend the site in case of suspected 
infect ion. If appropriate, participants will be referred to the local health care system. Physical 
distancing and person -to-person contact restrictions will be applied and explained to 
participants while staying at the study  site. Where physical distancing is not possible, study  
participants will be asked to use face masks and/or gloves if deemed appropriate by  the 
investigator and site staff and guided by  local requirements.
G 3 Data Quality Assurance Related to COV ID-19
Moni toring visit s at si te will  be limi ted to the minimum  required as deemed appropriate 
during the COVID -19 pandemic in accordance with local regulat ions.
In addit ion, where possible, other measures for carrying out protocol -related activit ies, such as 
but not limited to home -nursing, may be emplo yed as required.
G 4 COVID- 19 Vaccination Guidance and Recommendations
The COVID -19 pandemic continues to have a profound impact on societ y as a whole, and 
global mass vaccinat ion to prevent infection, disease, a nd transmissio n is underway and 
expected to persist bey ond 2021. For AstraZeneca, the safety  and well -being o f study  
participants i s of primary  importance and this includ esvaccinat ion in the current pandemic 
situation.
Current ly, inact ive/non -replicat ing COVID -19 vaccines are being approved across the globe 
as em ergency use products. AstraZeneca has no data on the co -administration of MEDI6570 
and respect ive COVID -19 vaccines. Potential MEDI6570/vaccine interact ions affect ing 
patient safet y or IP and vacci ne efficacy are therefore unclear. In addition, vaccine- related 
AEs may confound the AE profile of the MEDI6570 invest igational drug.
Clinical Study Protocol - 2 AstraZeneca
MEDI6570 -D4920C00002 09 November 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 106of 131Current local guidelines, vaccine availabilit y, and a benefit -risk assessment should all be 
considered when determining wh ether a parti cipant shoul d be vaccinated. Ultimately, the 
decisio n to vaccinate will be based on the judgment of the treating physician taking into 
account the participant’s best interest.
Patients enrolled in studies wit h MEDI6570 can be vaccinated agains t Covi d-19 parti cularly  
since m any pat ients are likely to belong to one of the risk groups targeted for va ccination).
G4.1 Considerations to Facilitate COVID-19 Vaccination 
Covi d-19 vaccinat ion may be administered before , during or afterenrol lment in the stud y. If 
administered during the study  it shoul d be recorded as a concomitant medicat ion. .
G 4.1.1 COVID -19 Vaccination before Entering Clinical Study/Randomization
For study  partici pants wi th flexibilit y as to when to start in the study  and if COVID -19 
vaccination is planned, complete vaccinat ion (both doses of vaccine, where applicable ) before 
the first dose may be advisable. If possible, the first dose of MEDI6570 should be given at 
least 14 day s after the l ast dose of vaccine.
G 4.1.2 COVID -19 Vaccination during the Ongo ing Study (Dosing Period)
For study  partici pants al ready  receiving treatm ent wi th MEDI6570 ,Covid-19 vaccinat ion is 
acceptable if the benefi t/risk assessment does not indicate otherwise. 
In order to understand whether a poten tial react ion is caused by  administrati on of  a vaccine or 
by MEDI6570 consider administering IP and vaccine 7 days apart. 
G 4.1.3 End of Study
For parti cipants approaching the end of study ,Covid -19 vaccination could be delay ed, if  
possible, unt il after the last dose of study drug is given. 
G4.2 CRF
To better assess the overall impact of COVID -19 vaccination on a particular study  and study  
popul ation, COVID -19 vaccines should be recorded in the CRF as conco mitant m edicati ons 
(including date and ty pe of  vaccine). 
G4.3 AE Monitoring
Vaccinated study  parti cipants shoul d be m onitored according to l ocal guidelines and the 
guidance wi thin this study  protocol .

Protocol Amendment History
The Protocol  Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Table of Contents.
Amendment 1 (10Mar2021)
This amendment is considered to be substant ial based on the cri teria set forth in Art icle 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council o f the European Unio n.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment: 
to change the dose strength in the high dose group fro m  to m g MEDI6570 to 
achieve full  suppressi on in a majority of parti cipants
to modify  the participant popul ation to wi den eligibilit y to the study  by increasing the 
post-infarction eligibilit y window, reducing the thresho ld for hs-CRP, and not requiring 
all parti cipants to have elevated NT -proBNP at baseline
In addi tion, the fo llowing other substantial changes were made: to minimize the theoretical 
risk of bleeding events; to minimize the number of injections required; to introduce an 
optional pre-screening visit ; to provi de guidance on conduct ing the study during the 
COVID- 19 pandemic; to clarify permitted and prohibited conco mitant m edicat ions; to clarify  
that parti cipants who di scont inue invest igational product because of an AE may remain in the 
study; and to remo ve the requirement that a participant who develops ADAs should be 
followed up until the value returns to baseline. All of the changes and their rationale are 
summarized below.

hs-CRP ≥ 1 mg/LThe study  has witnessed a high screen 
fail rate secondary, in part, to the 
hs-CRP requirement.  Furthermore, 
emerging data have demonstrated that 
an hs -CRP of ≥2mg/L is not required 
for anti -inflammatory studies ( Tardif 
et al 2019 and Nido rfet al 2020 ),

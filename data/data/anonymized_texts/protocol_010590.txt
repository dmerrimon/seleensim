8.1.1 Inclusion Criteria 
(Cole  2000 , 
Kriström  2009 , 
Sotos  2014 ) Added language to Inclusion 
Criteria #2 to alig n with 
international regulatory 
authority recommendations.  A 
number of peer -reviewed GH 
publications include delta from 
MPH (1.0 SD or 1.5 SD) as an 
optimal criteria for short stature 
in the diagnosis of GHD, 
acknowledging the fact that 
one's genetics pla ys a far more 
pivotal role in one's stature than 
does the average height of a 
population as heterogeneous as 
that of the US.  Using a 
criterion of height SDS more 
than 2.0 SD below the mean of 
the CDC database favors 
potential enrollment of subjects 
with s horter -than-average 
parents who may not not have 
GHD [as the peak GH level 
<10.0  ng/ml] clearly does not 
discriminate between GHD and 
normal, and by definition 16 -
17% of the normal population 
has an IGF -1 SD of < -1.0, and 
2.5% of the normal population 
has a >6 month delay in BA vs 
CA0,and penalizes subjects 
with true GHD whose parents 
are taller than average 
compared to the US population 
(eg, of Scandinavaian or 
German descent).   See

Criteria #3.  GHD kids are often 
very petite.  A 10 year -old kid 
with a Bone Age of 7 years 
would not be expected to have 
the BMI of an average 10 -year-
old.  It is not uncommon for a

screen for IUGR (intrauterine 
growth restriction).  An infant 
with IUGR has a GA -based 
birth weight >2.0 SDS below 
the mean, but may or may not 
have a reduced birth length 
(BL).  In contrast, a 
congenitally GHD infant may 
have reduced birth length, but 
less reduced birth weight (BW), 
if uterine nutrition is adequate.   
This decreased BW + decreased 
BL = SGA, and decreased BW 
alone = SGA, but normal BW

growth hormone deficiency (GHD)  
INDICATION  Growth failure in prepubertal children due to growth hormone 
deficiency  
OBJECTIVES  Primary:  
To evaluate and compare the annualized height velocity (HV) of 
prepubertal children with growth failure due to GHD treated with 
weekly TransCon hGH to that of a commercially available daily 
human growth hormone (hGH ) formulation at 52 weeks.  
Secondary:   
• To evaluate the safety of weekly TransCon hGH administered 
over 52 weeks compared to daily hGH  
• To evaluate and compare the annualized HV over 52  weeks of 
weekly TransCon hGH to daily hGH  
• To evaluate and compare the change in height (HT) standard 
deviation score (SDS) over 52  weeks of weekly TransCon hGH 
to daily hGH  
• To evaluate serum insulin -like growth factor 1  (IGF-1) and 
insulin -like growth factor binding protein 3  (IGFBP -3) and 
IGF-1 SDS and IGFBP -3 SDS; and the normalization of 
IGF-1 SDS over 52  weeks  of weekly TransCon hGH or daily 
hGH

12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 21 of 117 • To describe the pharmacoki netic /pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD ) 
profile of TransCon hGH, hGH, IGF -1, IGF -1 SDS, IGFBP -3, 
IGFBP -3 SDS and polyethylene glycol (PEG ) administered as a 
weekly injection (PK/PD subset; TransCon hGH cohort only)  
• To compare the maximum value of concentration (Cmax) for hGH 
of TransCon hGH to the anticipated  Cmax of daily hGH  
• To determine the incidence of anti -hGH antibodies for both 
treatments, and treatment emergent anti -PEG antibodies for 
TransCon hGH over 52 weeks  
TRIAL DESIGN  This is a phase 3, randomized, open -label, active -controlled trial of 
TransCon hGH compared to standard daily growth hormone, over 
52 weeks  (heiGHt trial) .  
The trial consists of:  
• Screening period - up to  approximately  6 weeks (plus a 
recommended period  of up to 2 weeks until V1)  
• Treatment period - 52 weeks of dosing  
• PK/PD profiling and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) screening 
bracketing presumed C max of TransCon hGH, hGH , IGF-1 and 
PEG will be establ ished in a subset of at least 8  TransCon hGH 
treated subjects (PK/PD subset)  
Screening P eriod  
The Screening period will last up to  approximately  6 weeks during 
which clinical data will be collected and investigations will be 
performed to establish the subject’s eligibility for the trial.   Prior to 
any trial specific procedure, a written and s igned informed consent 
will be obtained from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and a signed 
assent from the subject (whenever possible).   At sites where the 
diagnosis of GHD is confirmed prior to consideration for a trial, 
many of the Screening procedures (which reflect standard of care in 
the diagnosis of GHD) may be completed prior to signing of 
informed consent or assent form.  These may enable enrollment, 
based on approval by the Medical Expert . 
The following assessments will be performed and appropriat e data 
collected:  
• Data on current anthropometric measurements (auxology), 
(auxology to be performed at each visit by the same, trained, 
blinded  (if possible)  auxologist as far as possible):  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 22 of 117 • Absolute HT, measured on a calibrated wall -mounted 
stadiometer  
• Body weight  
• Data on parental height, if available:  
• Mother’s  height  
• Father’s  height  
• Complete medical history, including a description of pituitary 
deficiencies, currently and previously taken relevant medications  
and, when available, pre -screening height measu rements to assess 
growth history  
• Overall health status assessment with complete physical 
examination and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, 
respiratory rate and body temperature) (subjects should rest for at 
least 5 minutes before vital sign assessme nt) 
• Pubertal status assessment (according to Tanner stages)  (scant 
pubic hair is compatible with Tanner Stage 1, absent breast or 
testicular enlargement)  
• 12-lead ECG, local reading (subjects should rest for at least 
2 minutes before ECG assessment)  
• Collect ion of blood for the following laboratory assessments:  
• Insulin -like Growth Factor -1 (IGF -1) serum levels  
• Anti-transglutaminase antibodies (results within  
approximately  6 months prior to Screening may be accepted, 
the final decision rests with the Medical Expert ) 
• Anti-hGH and anti -PEG binding antibodies (the analysis of 
the anti -hGH and anti -PEG antibodies may only be conducted 
after randomization and are not require d for eligibility 
verification.  These data will be use d to support evaluation of 
postdose antibody detection)  
• Routine safety biochemistry and hematology parameters  
• Other hormone levels: thyroid status (TSH, fT4, and 
fT3 levels) and morning cortisol  
• Glucose metabolism: fasting in sulin, glucose, HbA1c. In case 
of suspected glucose intolerance, an  oral glucose tolerance 
test (OGTT) should be performed (glucose metabolism 
parameters can be assessed locally at any time if there is 
suspicion of impaired glucose tolerance, which may include 
an OGTT)  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 23 of 117 • Lipid  status: Total  cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL ) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL ) 
• Stimulation tests:  
• Two different growth hormone ( GH) stimulation tests, chosen 
from  the following: a) insulin tolerance test (with cortisol 
response to hypoglycemia), b) arginine test, c) clo nidine test, 
d) glucagon test (with or without propranolol, with cortisol 
response , unless cortisol measured during an intent -to-treat 
(ITT)), or e) L -dopa test (with  or without  propranolol)  
• Sex hormone priming is suggested (but not required) to be 
perform ed prior to GH stimulation tests for girls over the age 
of 10 and boys over the age of 11  
• If 1 or both of the stimulation tests have been performed 
within approximately  6 months prior to Screening and have 
been well documented (with a proper recording of sample 
timing and results as well as euthyroid status of the subject) it 
may be accepted.  In accordance with recent Guidelines, in 
subjects with known panhypopituitarism (eg, subjects who are 
deficient in TSH and/or ACTH post cranial radiation), GH 
stimula tion tests may not be required in subjects who meet all 
other inclusion criteria and whose history  is consistent with 
GHD including low growth velocity, low IGF -1 and 
IGFBP -3 levels, and delayed bone age. Also in children who 
are born panhypopituitary with  deficiency of ≥2 pituitary 
hormones in addition to GH, do not require stimulation tests. 
The final decision rests with the Medical Expert   
• In case the subject was not previously assessed for 
deficiencies of the hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal axis 
(HPA), c ompetence should be demonstrated by an 8:00 AM 
cortisol > 190 nmol/L (7 μg/dL) in subjects with idiopathic 
GHD only, or by a peak cortisol level > 500 nmol/L 
(18 μg/dL) in the context of an insulin tolerance test  or 
glucagon stimulation test.   At the discretion of the 
investigator, or in case Screening results are bor derline or not 
interpretable (eg , from insulin tolerance test ) or raising 
concerns, a Standard Dose or Low Dose Short 
adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH ) test should be 
conducted  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 24 of 117 • Karyotype testing to rule out Turner Syndrome will be performed 
in all female subjects (results obtained prior to Screening may be 
accepted if well documented; the final decision rests with the 
Medical Expert )  
• Sellar magnetic resonance  imaging ( MRI ): contrast dye i s 
recommended (if not conducted within  approximately  6 months 
prior to Screening), performed and read locally  
• Fundoscopy  (to rule out papilledema or signs of intracranial 
hypertension or mass effect)  
• Bone age determination – X-ray of the left hand and wris t for 
determination of bone age (if not performed within approximately 
6 months prior to Screening), us ing a central bone age reader.  If 
conducted within approximately 6 months, the digital or copy of 
hard film should be sent to the central bone age reader  
The investigator is recommended to perform the following Screening 
procedures in a stepwise approach in the order listed:  
1) Trial participation should only be offered to subjects and 
parents/legal guardians thereof with already present suspicion of 
GHD  (based on height measurement and medical history or 
previously performed diagnostic tests) . 
2) Non-invasive procedures (demographics, auxology 
measurements, physical examination, vital sign measurement and 
pubertal status assessment, review of medical histor y) are to be 
performed first. Further procedures should only be undertaken if 
all results thus far indicate eligibility . 
3) Further investigations to be performed: laboratory assessments, 
GH stimulation tests followed by bone age, MRI, fundoscopy 
will be performed, also in a stepwise manner.  If any Screening 
procedure during this process demonstrates ineligibility of the 
subject (see eligibility criteria), the Screening will terminate , and 
the subject will be classified as a Screening failure . 
This sequence of events at Screening is suggested to avoid exposure 
of the subject to unnecessary needle insertions, as well as to enable 
termination of Screening at any point in case any of the eligibil ity 
criteria are not met (such cases will be classified as Screening 
failures).  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 25 of 117 All results will be reviewed by the Medical Expert  to verify 
eligibility of each subject prior to randomization.  Eligible subjects 
will be centrally randomized to 1 of the 2 cohorts.  Following 
randomization, it is recommended to start the treatment period (Visit 
1) within 2 weeks from the time of randomization.  
Prior to randomization subjects will be allocated to strata using the 
minimization rule according to their age ( ˃3 to ≤6 and ˃6 years), 
peak GH levels in stimulation tests (≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL), and 
gender.  
Re-screening is permitted.  Re-screening of subjects with an out of 
range cortisol and/or thyroid hormone level (inadequate replacement 
therapy for the insufficien cy of other hypothalamo -pituitary axes) 
may be allowed ≥3 months after re placement treatment adjustment.  
Individual blood draws may be repeated for the following reasons, 
but not limited to: eg , ruling out an analytical error, sample handling 
or shipment i ssues, conflicting or inconsistent subject data, etc.   The 
decision on re -screening will be made on a case by cas e basis by the 
Medical Expert .  Re-screened subjects will receive a new Screening 
number.  
Treatment Period  
Randomized subjects will receive wee kly doses of TransCon hGH or 
daily doses of Genotropin.  
The 2 cohorts will be:  
Cohort  Product  Dose Administration  
1 TransCon hGH  Once weekly in a dose equivalent to 
0.24 mg hGH/kg/week  
2 Genotropin  Once daily in a dose equivalent to 
0.24 mg hGH/kg/week  
Following randomization, it is recommended to start the treatment 
period (Visit 1) within 2 weeks from the time of randomization. 
During some clinic visits TransCon hGH (Visits 1 and 2) or 
Genotropin (Visit 1) may be administered in the morning hours by 
the trial staff or by subject/parents/legal guardians, although 
Genotropin will generally be administered daily in the evening hours 
and TransCon hGH will generally be administered weekly in the 
morning or evening by subjects/parents/legal guardians (or 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 26 of 117 occasionally by the trial staff).  Once weekly healthcare services may 
be offered for the first 4 weeks of treatment to accommodate home 
administration of TransCon hGH and Genotropin.   Extended support 
might be offered until subjects/parents/legal guardian s are 
comfortable to take over administration of the study drug.   Both 
drugs will be administered subcutaneously ( SC) in the left and right 
buttock, left and right thi gh, and left and right abdomen.   It is 
recommended that injection sites are used successi vely, being rotated 
by using a different injection site at each subsequent injection.  
In addition to the Screening visit(s), enrolled TransCon hGH and 
Genotropin subjects will attend a total of 6 trial visits, all in the 
morning: V1 (Week 1; Day 1; predose , fasting), V2 (Week 5; 
predose for TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 5 for 
Genotropin subjects) , V3 (Week 13; 48 -72 hours post dose for 
TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 13 for Genotropin 
subjects), V4 (Week 26; 48 -72 hours post dose for T ransCon hGH 
subjects, fasting; any day during Week 26 for Genotropin subjects, 
fasting), V5 (Week  39; 48 -72 hours post dose for TransCon hGH 
subjects; any day during Week 39 for Genotropin subjects) and V6 
(Day 365 for Tra nsCon hGH subjects [7 days post dose] and  
Genotropin subjects, fasting).   
For the PK/PD subset of TransCon hGH subjects (at least 8 subjects), 
Visit 3 will span approximately 168 hours following their 13th 
weekly injection.   The 13th and 14th doses will be given at the site.  
All trial visits  will be in the morning hours since the subject is asked 
to be fasted for Visits 1, 4 and 6, and so that auxology parameters are 
measured at approximately the same time of day and by the same 
individual (blinded auxologist), if possible.  All attempts will  be 
made to blind the auxologist to treatment assignment.  The auxologist 
will be trained in the trial procedures to gain uniformity o f 
measurement across all sites.   Visits 1 and 2 will be scheduled on the 
day of TransCon hGH administration for Cohort  1, while Visits 3, 4, 
and 5 will be performed within a window of 48 -72h after the weekly 
administration, to assess the E max for IGF -1.  The Genotropin cohort 
will have Visit 1 on the day of the first Genotropin administration, 
and Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 any day  during the respective week.   
Visit  6 will be performed seven days after the last TransCon hGH 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 27 of 117 administration for Cohort 1 and the day after the last Genotropin 
administration in Cohort  2. 
It is suggest ed that the site staff follow s up with the subject between 
the visits by eg,  phone calls.  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed throu ghout the 
trial. All samples obtained after Informed Consent will be shipped to 
a selected central laboratory for analysis.  Safety samples may be 
analyzed local ly in case of emergency or if logistics or other 
unforeseen events do not permit a central analysis.  During visits 
where study drug administration is planned at the site, these 
assessments will be performed pr ior to such administration (pre dose).  
While fa sting is recommended for all visits, fasting is required at 
Visits 1, 4, and 6.   The following procedures will be performed 
during V1 through V6 unless otherwise indicated:  
1) Physical examination and vital sign measurement (blood 
pressure, heart rate, body t emperature, respiratory rate) (subjects 
should rest for at least 5 minutes before vital sign assessment)  
2) Review of concomitant medication  
3) Review of Subject Diary by investigator (V2 -V6) 
4) Evaluation of Adverse Events (AEs) and local tolerability  
5) Safety asses sments:  
• Hormone levels {TSH, fT4, fT3, and morning cortisol; 
V1 (fasting) , V3, V4  (fasting)  and V6  (fasting)}  
• Routine safety biochemistry parameters (sodium, potassium, 
calcium, phosphate, chloride, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, lactate dehydroge nase (LDH), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), albumin, total protein, 
creatinine, urea -nitrogen, uric acid, serum iron and 
transferrin)  
• Hematology parameters (hemoglobin, leukocytes, differential 
blood count of leukocytes, platelet count; blood smears will 
be performed locally for back -up analysis, if needed)  
• Parameters of glucose metabolism: fasting glucose (when 
required), insulin, and HbA1c (glucose metabolism 
parameters can be asse ssed locally at any time if there is 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 28 of 117 suspicion of impaired glucose tolerance, which may include 
an OGTT)  
• Parameters of lipid metabolism (cholesterol, LDL and HDL, 
and triglycerides)  
6) Immunogenicity assessment: anti -hGH and anti -PEG antibodies 
(Cohort 2: ant i-PEG antibodi es only at Screening and 
V1 predose, in support of trial specific assay cut -point 
determination); a subject with observed anti -hGH binding 
antibodies post dosing (V3 -V5) at or close to the C max for 
TransCon hGH may be brought back for a repea t sample to assess 
for neutralizing antibodies at a time point deemed appropriate to 
exclude assay interference. Anti -PEG antibodies will only be 
analyzed at the end of the individual treatment period once all 
samples from an individual subject are availab le. 
Serum samples collected for immunogenicity assessments will be 
retained for up to 5 years following trial finalization for possible 
further characterization of a potential anti -drug antibody response 
at a specialized laboratory  
7) Bioanalytical samples f or TransCon hGH (Cohort 1), hGH, PEG, 
IGF-1 and IGFBP -3 serum levels (for Cohort 2, PEG samples 
taken only at Screening and V1  predose  to assist interpretation of 
anti-PEG antibody data)  
8) Auxology measurements (actual height and body weight), to be 
performe d by the same, trained, blinded  (if possible)  auxologist at 
approximately the same time of day (morning) at each visit if 
possible  
9) Fundoscopy (at V4 and V6, and at other visits if clinically 
indicated)  
10) Pubertal status assessment (at V4 and V6)  
11) Training on study drug preparation and administration 
(V1 - during first administration and further as needed)  
12) Study drug administration at site at Visit 1 (both cohorts) and 
Visit 2 (TransCon hGH cohort only) (dose should be adjusted at 
V3, V4 and V5 according to the  subject’s weight) - by the trial 
staff or subject/parent/legal guardian  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 29 of 117 13) Vital signs will be assessed over 2 hours at Visit 1, at every clinic 
visit for all subject s, including over 24 hours post dose at V3 for 
the Cohort 1 PK/PD subset (subjects should res t for at least 
5 minutes before vital sign assessment)  
14) ECG at V1 and V4 for all subjects; additionally at  V3 only in 
PK/PD subset at pre dose and 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 
and 168h post dose for TransCon hGH subjects (subjects should 
rest for at least 2 minutes before ECG assessment)  
15) Bone age at V6  
At least 8 subjects from selected sites and countries in Cohort 1 will 
be asses sed in a PK/PD subset analysis.   Subjects may be housed, if 
needed, for the 13th injec tion and subsequent procedures.   Subjects 
will stay at the hospital or come back for the scheduled procedures to 
assess safety and PK/PD profile over 1 week and ECGs intended to 
bracket presumed C max of hGH, IGF -1, and TransCon hGH prodrug.  
• Blood sampling for PK (TransCon hGH, hGH, and  PEG l evels): 
predose (at -0.5 h) and at 8, 12, 16, 24,  36, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 
168 hours ( h) relative to the 13th TransCon hGH dosing  
• Blood sampling for PD (IGF -1 and IGFBP -3 levels): pre dose 
(at -0.5 h) and 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h relative  
to the 13th TransCon hGH dosing  
• ECG measurements will be done pre dose and  8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 
48, 72, 96, 120 and 168  h post dose 
• Vital signs and injection site evaluation will be done at 15 min, 
1h, 2h and 24h postdose  
• The 14th dose will be given in clinic  
For subjects in the PK/PD subset, all other procedures planned for 
Visit 3 are also to be performed on the Day 1 of the respective week, 
prior to dosing.  The subject and parents/legal guardians may be 
offered accommodation until all assessments are compl eted and the 
14th dose given, depending on the agreement of the investigator with 
the parents/legal guardians, to ensure comfort for the child and 
reduce unnecessary travel.  
For all subjects, the absolute (total) dose of TransCon hGH or 
Genotropin initial ly administered will be calculated using the weight 
measu rement obtained at Visit 1 (pre dose).  The total dose of 
TransCon hGH or Genotropin will be adjusted according to the 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 30 of 117 subject’s weight measurement at Visit 3 (prior to dosing for the 
PK/PD subset), V isit 4 and Visit 5.  Treatment can be discontinued or 
dose modified  at any time during the trial.   The following symptoms 
and laboratory abnormalities are considered to be the main guide for 
decision making concerning treatment discontinuation or dose 
modification s: 
• IGF-1 levels  
• IGF-1 >+2.0 SD at any visit should be confirmed by a second 
measurement measured as soon as possible  if deemed 
clinically significant by the investigator .  Blood samples 
should be collected 5 -7 days post dose (TransCon hGH cohort ) 
or at any day (Genotropin cohort). If the IGF -1 SDS is still 
elevated above +2.0, and of clinical concern, the hGH dose 
may be decreased to the next lowe r dose bracket for TransCon 
hGH  or a 20% decrease in dose (initially to 0.19 mg 
hGH/kg/week) for subj ects on Genotropin. Any re -
establish ment of the original dose (0.24  mg hGH/kg/week) 
due to a subsequent sub -optimal IGF-1 response needs to be 
discussed with the Medical Expert . 
• Glucose parameters:  
• HbA1c >6.2%  
• Fasting glucose level > 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)  
• 2 hour post dose glucose level during OGTT ≥7.8 mmol/L 
(140 mg/dL)  
For a subject who had evidence of borderline glucose intolerance or 
diabetes prior to starting hGH therapy ( eg, fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG) level of 98 mg/dL and HbA1c of 5.9%), it might be  
appropriate to treat for hyperglycemia as needed, without initial study 
drug treatment adjustment.  However, if a subject with no evidence of 
glucose intolerance reaches the above glucose parameter levels, the 
FPG and HbA1c should be repeated within 2 -4 weeks.  If the repeat 
values are the same or worse, the TransCon hGH dose may be 
decreased to the next lower dose bracket (̴ 20%; see Pharmacy 
Manual), and the dose may be reduced by ̴ 20% for a subject on 
Genotropin ( eg, to 0.19 mg hGH/kg/week or 0.027 mg hGH/kg/day) , 
or appropriate anti -glycemic therapy(ies) may be started.  If 
appropriate follow -up monitoring shows progressively worsening 
glucose intolerance, additional hGH dose adjustments may be 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 31 of 117 appropriate.   If in any case treatment should be discontin ued, all 
subsequent visits and assessments should continue as planned.  
The Medical Expert  will review all AEs on an ongoing basis and all 
Serious Adverse E vent (SAE) reports as received.   The key safety 
data will also be reviewed by an Independent Safety C ommittee 
(ISC).

INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  Name:  TransCon hGH  
TransCon hGH is a  hGH (human Growth Hormone) prodrug that 
liberates somatropin as the active ingredient through controlled 
autohydrolysis resulting in sustained release of unmodified 
somatropin.  TransCon hGH consists of recombinant hGH which is 
transiently conjugated to a  PEG molecule through a (TransCon) 
linker.  This conjugation inactivates hGH, thereby creating the 
TransCon hGH prodrug.  After injection of TransCon hGH, 
autohydrolysis of the linker occurs in a controlled pH - and 
temperature -dependent manner whereby unmo dified, fully active 
somatropin is released.  
TransCon hGH will be provided in glass vials and requires 
reconstitution with 1 mL sterile water for injection, and will be 
administered by syringe and needle.  
REFERENCE 
PRODUCT (S) Name:  Genotropin (somatropin [rDNA origin] for injection)  
TREATMENT 
REGIMENS  TransCon hGH  
TransCon hGH will be administered as once weekly SC injections of  
0.24 mg hGH/kg/week.  
The administration will preferably be in the morning hours, by the 
trial staff or by the subjects/parents/l egal guardians (under 
supervision by the trial staff at visits where drug administration is 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 35 of 117 foreseen).  Only if preferred by a parent/guardian/subject, TransCon 
hGH administration at home may be once weekly in the evening.  
Genotropin  
Genotropin (somatropin  [rDNA origin] for injection) will be 
admin istered as daily SC  injections in a standard dose of 0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week.  
The total weekly dose will be equally split into 7 daily  doses of 
0.034  mg hGH/kg/day.  A commercially approved injection device 
will be use d for administration of the drug.  
With the exception of Visit 1 where the injection will be performed 
in the morning by the trial staff or by the subjects/parents/legal 
guardians (under supervision by the trial staff), daily administration 
of Genotropin will preferably be in the evening ho urs by the 
parents/legal guardians or subjects.  Only if preferred by a 
parent/guardian/subject, Genotropin administration at home may be 
once daily in the morning.  At some trial visits, trial staff will 
supervise injections.

STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Analysis Populations  
The following data subsets will be analyzed:  
Safety Analysis Subset  – The safety analysis set will include all 
randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of active 
treatment.  
Intent -to-treat Subset  – The ITT subset will include all randomized 
subjects  who have received at least 1 dose of active treatment and 
have follow -up efficacy data.  
Per-protocol Subset  – The basis of Per -protocol (PP) subset is the 
ITT set. Subjects with major protocol deviations will be excluded 
from the Per-protocol ( PP) analysis.  Major protocol deviations 
excluding subjects from the PP analysis set will be defined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 37 of 117 PK/PD Population  – The PK/PD population includes a subset of 
subjects from the TransCon hGH cohort who attended Visit 3 as 
planned and from whom blood sampling was perfor med at time 
points pre dose, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 hours 
postdose.  
Efficacy Analysis  
The primary endpoint, annualized height velocity at Week 52, will be 
compared between TransCon hGH treatment and daily hGH 
treatment, by a non -inferiority comparison with a non -inferiority 
margin of 2.0 cm/year , followed by a test of superiority if 
non-inferiority is established.   
A mixed model repeated measurement (MMRM) will be the primary 
analysis to evaluate annualized HV  at week 52.  The model will 
include  baselin e age, peak GH level of the stimulation test, and 
gender as fixed effects.   Least square means will be derived and 
presented together with 95% -confidence intervals by treatment 
group.  
For the primary efficacy analysis, a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval 
will be calculated for the difference in least square means between 
the 2 treatment groups [TransCon hGH treatme nt minus daily hGH] 
at Week 52.   If the lower confidence bound is > -2.0 cm, 
non-inferiority is demonstrated in terms of effectiveness.   If the low er 
confide nce bound is > 0, superiority  is established.  
All observed data including post -discontinuation data will be  used for 
the primary analysis.   Missing values will be imputed as follows for 
subject s who prematurely discontinued: From all subjects  in the same 
treatment group who also prematurely discontinued treatment but had 
a height measurement at Week 52, annualized height change from the 
last measurement before discontinuation to Week 52 will be 
calculated.  Missing height values at Week 52 wil l then be imputed 
by adding the mean change (standardized to the corresponding period 
between last height measurement and Week 52) to the la st height 
measurement obtained.   Based on the imputed height value at Week 
52 the corresponding imputed annualized h eight velocity will be 
calculated.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed in the  Intent -to-treat 
set.  A sensitivity analys is will be provided for the Per -protocol set. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 38 of 117 For the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (height velocity at 
further v isits, change in height SDS, serum IGF -1 levels and 
IGFBP -3 levels, IGF -1 SDS, IGFBP -3 SDS),  similar MMRM  models 
will be used. Two sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
for the difference in least square means between the 2 treatment 
groups.  
The rate of subjects achieving normalization of serum IGF -1 SDS 
will be calculate d by treatment group and visit.   A test of superiority 
in proportion of patients within 0 -2.0 IGF -1 SDS will be conducted .  
A procedure to control for familywise type -1 error of  multiple 
hypothesis testing will be specified in the SAP.   
In general, for secondary endpoints, missing values will be imputed 
by a method fully described in the SAP.  Moreover, sensitivity 
analyses concerning missing values for the primary endpoint will be 
described in the SAP. 
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
group.  Additional descriptive summaries may be added by treatment 
group and randomization stratum, separately for all 3 randomization 
strata.  
Figures will be cr eated to display the time course of continuous 
efficacy endpoints by treatment group.  
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  This is a pivotal clinical trial intended to support market approval.  
Based on the phase 2 trial (Protocol ACP -001_CT -004) and similar 
growth hormone studies published in the literature, and assuming a 
SD of 3.5 cm/year with a non -inferiority margin of 2.0  cm, a sample 
size of 147 subjects in the ITT population will be neede d to show 
non-inferiority of TransCon hGH treatment compared to daily hGH 
with a power of 90%.  This sample size calculation is based on a 
2:1 randomization and a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025.  
A sample size of 150 subjects randomized has been chosen to 
account for slight imbalances in the randomization due to 
stratification of randomization.  For 150  enrolled subjects, 
approximately 450 subjects may need to be screened in the trial.

TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 39 of 117 TRIAL  AND 
TREATMENT  
DURATION  The total duration of the trial for a subject is expect ed to be 
60 weeks, with up to approximately 6 weeks of Screening and a 
52-week active treatment period (plus approximately  2 weeks 
between randomization and V1).  
Subjects will be invi ted to participate in an extension trial after the 
completion of the in itial 52 week treatment period.   The intended 
purpose of the extension period is to assess long -term safety  and 
efficacy .  Subjects on Genotropin treatment (Cohort 2) will be 
switched t o TransCon hGH treatment for this extension trial.

5.1. B ackground and Rationale 
GH; somatropin) is a product of endocrine secretion of the pituitary gland which targets many 
tissues to promote growth in children and control metabolism in children and adults.  It is 
se
creted by somatotroph cells located in the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.  The 
se
cretion of GH is pulsatile in nature; the major secretory pulses (up to 70% of daily secretion) 
occur with the first episode of slow-wave sleep.  During childhood GH levels are relatively 
stable
 until puberty, when the GH pulse amplitude is elevated with no change in the frequency of 
pulses; afterwards GH pulse levels gradually decline through adulthood.  GH production and 
se
cretion are regulated by multiple factors; growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and 
g
hrelin are the most significant stimulators, while somatostatin has the strongest inhibitory 
action. 
The human GH gene cluster is located on human chromosome 17q22-24, encoding a 
191 amino-acid protein of 22 kDa and a less abundant 20 kDa GH molecule, as well as related 
prote
ins.  GH stimulates the hepatic production and release of IGF-1 which in turn acts on target 
ti
ssues and is likely responsible for most, but not all, activities of GH.  IGF ‐1 is also produced by 
the growth cartilage in response to GH, where it acts locally as a paracrine ‐autocrine growth 
factor.  IGF-1 is found in association with specific IGF-binding proteins, whose main functions 
a
re to extend the IGF-1 ha lf-life in the circulation, to transport IGF-1 to the target cells, and to 
modulate its biological actions.  
The most important and obvious function of GH is the promotion of growth in children.  
Through its IGF-1 mediated, as well as less obvious direct effects, it stimulates cartilage and 
bone growth by enhancing the activity of chondroblasts and osteoblasts and promoting collagen 
synthesis.  In addition, GH has important metabolic functions: it exerts potent anti-insulin effects 
resulting in decreased glucose utilization (increased plasma glucose levels) and increased 
lipolysis, in contrast to the opposing actions of IGF-1 to lower plasma glucose and increase 
lipogenesis; these functions underlie its continued secretion into adulthood.  New research 
c
ontinues to reveal other potential roles of hGH, including regulation of cardiac and immune 
function, mental agility and aging. 
GHD is the result of impaired production or secretion of GH which can appear at any time point 
in life and is due to various known and unknown factors.  Childhood GHD can be: 
• C ongenital (organic causes such as pituitary aplasia, primary empty sella syndrome etc. or 
genetic causes including various mutations); 
• Acquired (tumors of the hypothalamic-pituitary region, most commonly craniopharyngioma, 
head trauma, infection etc.); or 
• Idiopathic (no clear etiology). 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 48 of 117 The
 etiology of childhood GHD is most commonly of hypothalamic origin with impaired GHRH 
secretion, the most common diagnosis being isolated idiopathic GHD. 
Isolated GHD in children is characterized by short stature, low height velocity, and a propensity 
to hypoglycemia because of the relatively unopposed insulin action.  Average adult height for 
untreated patients wi
th severe isolated growth hormone deficiency is 143 cm in men and 130 cm 
in women ( Kemp 2014).   GHD children have normal body proportions, but small hands and feet 
a
nd a small mid-face; they have excess of subcutaneous truncal fat, decreased muscle mass, thin 
hair and nails, a high-pitched voice, delayed puberty as well as an overall delay in bone and 
dental maturation.  Hypoglycemic episodes are found in approximately 5% of GHD pediatric 
subjects and reso
lve with growth hormone therapy ( Kemp 2014).   GHD can also influence 
c
ognitive functions and the overall sense of well-being.  When accompanied by other pituitary 
deficiencies ot
her clinical manifestations may also be present. 
GHD is a well-recognized clinical entity in the adult as well.  It causes abnormalities in body 
composition, lipid meta
bolism, and physical and psychosocial function, all of which improv e 
with GH replacement therapy.  Body composition changes are common and include reduced lean 
body mass, increas
ed fat mass with selective deposition of intraabdominal visceral fat, and 
increased waist- to-hip ratio.  Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, left ventricular dysfunction, 
hypertension
, and increased plasma fibrinogen levels may also be present, causing a risk for 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in these patients.  Patients may experience a lack of 
energy, poor
 concentration, as well as social isolation and depression.  GHD is also associated 
with relative insulin insensit
ivity and an increased prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and 
diabetes mellitus. 
It is now over 50 years since the human pituitary GH extract was purified and the first GHD 
patient was successfully treated.  Contamination with infectious agents (Creutzfeld-Jakob prions) 
led to discontinua
tion of its use.  A recombinant human GH (hGH; somatropin) was then 
produced by int
roducing the human DNA sequence into Escherichia coli  (E  coli ) tha t became 
commercially available in 1985.  The product is identical to the natural human growth hormone 
with 191 amino acids.  Since then, sev
eral hundred thousand children have received hGH for 
growth impairme
nt.  In addition, hGH has been successfully used to treat growth impairment 
associated with a numbe
r of conditions such as Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 
chronic renal insufficiency, SHOX deficiency, Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature, and 
children born SGA
.  The safety and efficacy profile of daily hGH preparations in pediatric and 
adult populations is well e
stablished and has invariably been deemed satisfactory.  However, the 
requirement of dail
y subcutaneous administrations for pediatric GH therapy causes a significant 
burden and interruption of normal daily life to children and their legal guardians as well as 
compliance issue
s.  Therefore, a product with less frequent dosing, comparable efficacy and an 
adequate safe
ty profile may provide considerable improvement over currently available 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 50 of 117 The
 linker that forms the bridge between the protein and mPEG moieties is stable at pH 5.0.  
How
ever, after introduction into a physiological pH and temperature (ie, after injection of 
Tr
ansCon hGH), autohydrolysis of the linker occurs in a controlled manner that follows 1st order 
kinetics, whereby unmodified, fully active hGH is released.  As the released hGH is completely 
unmodi
fied, it has the same mode of action and volume of distribution as endogenous growth 
hormone
.  This is important for optimal efficacy, as a substantial portion of hGH activity is 
mediated by loca
l hGH effects in target tissue.  The release of hGH also liberates N1, N1, 
N3-
trimethyl-1,3-propane diamine, a small molecular weight compound associated with the 
linker.  The remainder of the inactive mPEG-linker component of TransCon hGH remains intact 
following
 release of hGH and is cleared from the body through renal clearance as known for 
other high molecular weight molecules. 
The hGH contained in TransCon hGH is synthesized by recombinant technology, using a strain 
of E. coli modified by the introduction of the human gene for growth hormone, the amino acid 
sequence is therefore identical to that of human origin. 
The Sponsor initiated the TransCon hGH development program with TransCon PEG80 hGH 
(ACP-001), in which the carrier was 80 kDa mPEG, for which 4 clinical trials were conducted: 
2 phase 1 trials in healthy adults, 1 phase 2 trial in adult growth hormone deficiency, and 
1 phase 2 trial in pediatric growth hormone deficiency.  Acceptable safety, PK, and PD were 
shown in t
hese trials.  Importantly, safety and efficacy comparable to Genotropin were shown in 
the 
phase 2 pediatric growth hormone deficiency trial.  
Upon c
ompletion of the TransCon hGH (ACP-001) clinical program, the Sponsor modified the 
TransCon hGH product by replacing the 80 kDa mPEG with a 40 kDa mPEG, with the 
understanding that this difference in mPEG would not significantly affect the autohydrolytic 
re
lease of somatropin or the inactive nature of the parent TransCon hGH product.  The linker 
c
omponent and somatropin are identical between TransCon hGH (ACP-001) and TransCon hGH 
(ACP-011); the only change is to reduce the size of the mPEG carrier.  This change resulted in 
Tr
ansCon hGH (ACP-011), a drug product with lower viscosity and higher product 
concentration that enables smaller injection volumes and use of a small-gauge needle.  
Additionally, the PEG exposure is reduced by ≥50%. 
5.2. Re levant Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
TransCon PEG40 hGH  
Nonclinical PK and PD models have supported the suitability of TransCon hGH (ACP-011) for 
onc
e-weekly treatment of patients.  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 51 of 117 Ove
rall, the toxicity studies with TransCon PEG40 hGH did not identify any unexpected 
findings or significant concerns, following either weekly repeat dosing in cynomolgus monkey 
for
 up to 26 weeks, for up to 5 weeks in the rat, or following in utero exposure in rat or rabbit, or 
during
 critical phases of pre- and post-natal development in rat.  TransCon hGH (ACP-011) and 
de
rived hydrolysis products were not genotoxic when assessed in a standard battery of 
genotoxicity tests, and no adverse effects were observed in stand-alone safety pharmacology 
studi
es in the rat or on standard pharmacology end points assessed following repeat dosing in 
c
ynomolgus monkeys.  Expected pharmacological effects included a minimal increased body 
we
ight gain at dose levels 20-fold above the expected therapeutic dose following weekly repeat 
dosi
ng of up to 26 weeks in the cynomolgus monkey at doses up to and including 4.8 mg 
hGH/kg.  Test article-related microscopic findings, interpreted as exaggerated pharmacology and 
non-adverse, were limited to the mammary glands in both male and female animals.  The 
finding
s included small amounts of exudate, ductal dilation (galactocele), mononuclear cell 
infiltrate, and vacuolation primarily seen at the top dose of 4.8 mg hGH/kg.  These are 
re
cognized effects of high growth hormone doses in monkeys, presumably reflecting 
cross-reactivity with the prolactin receptor.  Systemic exposure to TransCon hGH (ACP-011), 
with the associated hGH mediated increases in the PD biomarker, IGF-1, was observed in all of 
these studies.  The nonclinical data are provided in further detail in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.3. Clin ical Experience 
A first phase 1 clinical trial of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) in healthy male volunteers has been 
c
onducted as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation trial versus placebo and daily hGH 
(Omnitrope) investigating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD response in 44 healthy male 
subjects.  No negative effects of the test drug were detected when compared to placebo and the 
a
ctive comparator (Omnitrope).  The test product was well tolerated at up to 0.24 mg hGH/kg 
whe
n injected once subcutaneously to 28 healthy male subjects.  
A second phase 1 single-dose trial investigated the safety and tolerability of TransCon hGH 
(ACP-001) at 2 different dose-levels, 0.30 mg hGH/kg and 0.36 mg hGH/kg, respectively, in 
24 ma le a nd female healthy subjects.  ACP-001 was well tolerated with no safety concerns.  
Detailed information is given in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
One phase 2 clinical trial in adult subjects with GHD was a randomized, open-label, 
a
ctive-
controlled trial of 3 dose levels of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg 
hGH
/kg/week) compared to daily hGH (Omnitrop e 0.04 mg hGH/kg/week divided into 7 equal 
doses) over 4 weeks.  A total of 37 subjects were randomized.  The pharmacokinetic results 
showe
d that dose-linearity was observed for area under the curve ( AUC ) and C max of hGH in 
29 subjects given increasing doses of ACP-001.   Reversible PEGylation of hGH (ACP-001) 
slowly released hGH in a sustained, controlled manner and thereby increased the overall 
exposure of hGH, making it suitable for once-a-week dosing.  The pharmacodynamic results 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 52 of 117 showe
d that ACP-001 demonstrated a consistent elevation of IGF-1 over the period of 1 week, 
indicating it
 is as potent as daily hGH with regards to IGF-1 elevation based on hGH equivalents.  
One phase 2 clinical trial in pediatric subjects with GHD has been conducted as a multicenter, 
ra
ndomized, open labe
l, active-controlled, parallel-group trial of 3 doses of TransCon hGH 
(ACP-001; 0.14, 0.21 and 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week) compared to daily hGH (Genotropin 0.21 mg 
hGH/kg/week divided into 7 equal doses) over 26 weeks.  There were 55 subjects who were 
randomized, of 
whom 53 received study drug (12 subjects in the 0.14 mg hGH/kg/week, 
14 subjects in the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week and 14 subjects in the 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week TransCon 
hGH
 cohorts and 13 subjec
ts in the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week Genotropin cohort).  Mean annualized 
height velocit
ies among the 3 dose levels administered weekly ranged from 11.9 cm for the 
0.14 mg/hGH/kg/week dose to 12.9 cm for the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week dose to 13.9 cm for the 
0.30 mg
 hGH/kg/week dose, which were all comparable to 11.6 cm for the active comparator, 
daily injections of Genotropin at a 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week dose.  No reports of drug-related 
serious or unexpec
ted AEs were observed.  Adverse events were generally mild and observed at 
the same level and na
ture compared between the 3 TransCon hGH cohorts and the Genotropin 
cohort.  Injection site reactions were generally mild and transient and were observed at a rate that 
was similar to the
 daily hGH control arm.  There were no observations of injection site nodule 
formation or lipoatrophy.
  Low immunogenicity (a single subject) was consistent with published 
data for daily
 growth hormone.  No neutralizing antibodies were detected.  Maximum hGH blood 
concentra
tion was comparable between equivalent weekly doses of TransCon Growth Hormone 
and daily hGH.  
A dose-proportional increase in IGF-1 levels into the normal range was observed following 
dosing of the 3 TransCon hGH dose levels.  Consistent with expectations, transient point values 
of IGF-1 standard de
viation score >+2 have been observed in a small number of subjects and 
primarily in the high-dose treatment arm. 
The clinical safety profile of ACP-001 was overall comparable to daily hGH.  Headache and 
fatigue we
re the most frequent drug-related AEs during the phase 2 adult growth hormone 
deficiency (
AGHD) trial and were reported in all treatment groups.  No AEs were judged to be 
definitely dru
g-related.  The single probably related AE was a subject with iron deficiency 
anemia. Injection site reactions, mainly mild erythema (phase 2 AGHD) and pain 
(phase 2 pediatric GHD), occurred across all treatment groups.  
L
iter
ature data indicate that the PEG associated with a biological molecule should provide no 
extra concern because the exposure-toxicity relationship of PEG in animals and humans has been 
well investigated and metabolism/excretion of PEG is well understood, indicating that the PEG 
associated with a biological molecule does not represent an unacceptable additional risk to 
humans ( Webster 2007).  Detailed information is given in the Investigator’s Brochure.

TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 53 of 117 5.3.1 P harmacokinetics of hGH Following Administration of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) 
and TransCon hGH (ACP-011) 
This was a phase 1 single center, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, a
nd pharmacodynamics of ACP-011 at doses of 0.24, 0.30, and 0.42 mg 
hGH/kg administered subcutaneously to healthy subjects.  There was a crossover portion to the 
trial to compare
 the PD parameters of ACP-011 and ACP-001 at the 0.24 mg hGH/kg dose level. 
TransCon hGH (ACP-011) was found to be bioequivalent to TransCon hGH (ACP-001), with the 
ratios of the means for C max and AUC for both released hGH and IGF-1 falling within the 
bioequivalence limits  of 80 % – 125%.  Following a single subcutaneous administration of 
Tr
ansCon hGH (ACP-011), free hGH showed a dose dependent increase in mean serum C max and 
AU
C within the dose range 0.24 to 0.42 mg  hGH/kg.  Serum concentrations increased rapidly 
with a me
dian time to maximum concentration is attained (T max) of 16.0 to 36.0 hours, indicative 
of release of hGH from TransCon hGH in both the subcutaneous tissue and the systemic 
circulation.  Elimination appea
red in a mono-phasic manner and the mean terminal half-life 
ranged from 21.8 to 25.4 hours 
independent of dose.  TransCon hGH (ACP-001) dosed at 
0.24 mg hGH/kg exhibited comparable T max, Cmax and AUC 0-168h for hGH and IGF-1 to the 
equivalent dose of TransCon hGH (ACP-011).  
5.4. Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits 
Currently somatropin is available only in daily injection formulations, causing a significant 
burden and interruption of normal daily life to children and their parents as well as compliance 
issues.  Decr
eased compliance with somatropin is known to result in sub-optimal efficacy (height 
velocity).  
Therefore, a product with less frequent dosing, comparable efficacy and safety may 
provide considera
ble improvement over currently available conventional GH replacement 
therapy regimens.  TransCon hGH (ACP-011) is a new hGH prodrug product with a proposed 
once weekly
 dosing regimen designed to overcome the inconvenience of daily hGH injections 
and is anticipated to have a comparable safety profile to currently approved daily hGH products.  
Due to their depot formulations, other long-acting growth hormone products have been 
associated with lipoatrophy, resulting from prolonged local tissue exposure to growth hormone 
activity.  Because of the fast absorption of the inactive prodrug into the blood stream, followed 
by sustained release of hGH in the peripheral circulation, it is expected that lipoatrophy at the 
injection site, which has been observed with permanently PEGylated growth hormones and 
polymer encapsulated hGH depots, will be avoided with TransCon hGH.  Obviating the need for 
daily injec
tions should increase compliance and therefore efficacy, which would be of great 
benefit to both pediatric 
and adult patients with GHD and other disorders with associated growth 
impairment and need for hGH supplementation ( European Union 2008).

7. TRIAL DESIGN 
7.1. Over all Trial Design and Plan 
7.1.1 T rial Design 
This is a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial of TransCon hGH as compared 
to standard dail
y growth hormone, over 52 weeks (Figure 2 ).  The trial will be conducted at 
a
pproximately 100 sites in approximately 20 countries in North America, Europe, Middle East 
and North Africa, and Oceania.  All centers will be specialized treatment centers in the 
management of pe
diatric GHD. 
The trial consists of: 
• Screening period - up to approximately 6 weeks (plus a recommende d period of up to 
2 weeks until V1) 
• Treatment period - 52 weeks of dosing  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 55 of 117 • P K/PD profiling and ECG screening bracketing presumed C max of TransCon hGH, hGH, 
IGF-1, and PEG will be established in a subset of at least 8 TransCon hGH treated subjects 
(PK/P
D subset) 
The total duration of participation for each subject in the trial will therefore be up to about 
60 weeks. 
All
 subjects who successfully complete the 52-week randomized trial will be invited to 
pa
rticipate in an extension trial after the treatment period of this 52-week trial has ended.  This 
e
xtension period is to assess long-term safety and efficacy.  Subjects on Genotropin treatment 
(Cohor
t 2) will be switched over to TransCon hGH treatment for this extension trial.

7.1.2 M easures Taken To Minimize Bias 
Once all results determining the eligibility of the subject are available and reviewed by the 
Medical Expert, th e  subject will be centrally randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts: ei ther TransCon hGH 
or Genotropin, in a 2:1 ratio, and allocated to strata using the  minimization rule according to 
their age (˃3 to ≤6 and ˃6 years), peak GH levels in stimulation tests (≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL), 
and gender.  For the stratum peak GH levels in stimulation tests (≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL), the 
stratum will be allocated based on the highest GH value of the 2 stimulation tests.  The subject 
will be assigned a unique randomization number along wi th the  cohort allocation.

TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 56 of 117 The
 trial auxologists will be trained and kept blinded to treatment allocation as far as possible at 
each site. 
All efforts will be made to keep missing data to a minimum, including the following: 
1) Investigators will be trained about the importance of retention 
2) Investigators will be instructed to encourage complete follow-up for all subjects, including 
any subjects who might discontinue either weekly TransCon hGH or daily Genotropin 
therapy 
3) The Informed Consent Form (ICF) and Assent Form will include a statement educating 
subjects and parents/legal guardians about the scientific importance of their data even if the 
subject discontinues study treatment early 
4) Special efforts will be made to provide assistance to subjects/families who might discontinue 
due to travel or cost barriers, such as offers of transportation to the clinic 
5) Most visits have visit windows to a
llow flexibility of clinic attendance (see  Sections 10.1.2.1 
a
nd 10.1.2.2) . 
6) Eve
ry effort will be made to contact subjects/legal guardians or other family members in 
order to maintain contac
t with the clinic 
This is an open-label trial.  Due to different dose frequencies and dosing techniques, it is not 
deemed suitable to empl
oy blinding me thods between TransCon hGH and Genotropin treatment 
assignment.  However, attempts will be made to keep selected Sponsor staff (Medical Experts 
and Statisticians) blinde
d to treatment. 
Subjects will be identified by a Subject Number (allocated at Screening), consisting of 3 digits to 
indicate the site
 and 2 digits specific for the subject. 
7.2. T rial Sites 
The trial will be conducted at approximately 100 sites in approximately 20 countries in North 
America, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Oceania.  All centers will be specialized 
treatment cent
ers in the management of pediatric GHD. 
7.3. S topping Rules 
7.3.1 E arly Termination of Subjects 
Valid reasons for which a subject’s participation in the clinical trial may be discontinued are 
considered to constitute one of the following: 
• Withdrawal of consent by the subject or parent/legal guardian; 
• AE: 
• Occurrence of a malignancy during the course of trial 
• Development of benign intracranial hypertension 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 57 of 117 • Oc currence of AEs that result in the investigator’s or parent’s/legal guardian’s wish to 
discontinue treatment (such as, but not limited to, serious intercurrent critical illness, 
slipped capital femoral epiphysis, scoliosis, avascular necrosis, development of 
lipoatrophy, etc.) 
• Abnormal laboratory values that affect the subject’s safety, if discontinuation is 
considered necessary by the investigator or the Medical Expert 
• A se vere adverse drug reaction, if discontinuation of study drug is desired by the 
subject/parent/legal guardian or considered necessary by the investigator or the 
Medical Expert 
• E vidence of development of neutralizing antibodies (eg, a blunted IGF-1 response in 
addition to a positi
ve result in the neutralizing antibody assay) 
• Use  of prohibited concomitant medication (refer to Section 9.9.2.2 ) 
• I f the investigator and/or Sponsor considers that withdrawal from the trial is necessary (lack 
of subject compliance, serious protocol deviation) 
• S ubject is lost- to-follow-up 
• Note : In the event of premature discontinuation of study drug treatment for any of the above 
reasons, every effort should be made to encourage and enable the subject to attend all

12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 58 of 117 8. S UBJECT POPULATION 
Approximately 150 prepubertal, hGH-treatment naïve children (males and females) with GHD 
will be included.  Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio:  
• Tw o thirds of the 150 subjects (approximately 100 subjects) will receive TransCon hGH 
treatment to obtain an expected 90 evaluable subjects in this cohort 
• One  third of the 150 subjects (approximately 50 subjects) will receive Genotropin treatment 
to obtain an expected 45 evaluable subjects in this cohort 
See Section 8.1 for eligibility criteria.

22) Any other reason that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject from 
completing pa
rticipation or following the trial schedule 
8.2. P remature Subject Withdrawal 
Early withdrawal (discontinuation of treatment) occurs when an enrolled subject ceases 
participation in the trial, regardless of the circumstances, prior to the expected completion of the 
trial.  Additionally
, the investigator may discontinue the treatment of a subject at any time if 
he/she considers it to be in the subject's best interest.  If significant safety issues arise, dosing 
may be discontinue
d but unless informed consent is withdrawn any subject who discontinues 
treatment with either TransCon hGH or Genotropin should be encouraged to remain in the tria l 
and attend all clinic visits.  The final decision for treatment discontinuation will be made by th e 
Medical Expert and investigator.  See S ection 7.3 for a list of stopping rules governing early 
ter
mination of subjects from trial. 
In the case of premature discontinuation of a subject’s participation in the trial (eg, withdrawal of 
infor
med consent), the investi
gator should schedule a trial discontinuation visit to collect data, 
particularly AE follow-up data (if applicable) and to collect sampl es for laboratory evaluations.  
This vi
sit should contain a
ssessments from the End of Trial Visit (Visit 6, Day 365), and should 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 61 of 117 be
 documented in the eCRF together with the reason for trial discontinuation.  In case of 
treatment discontinuation for other causes than withdrawal of the informed consent, subjects 
should be asked to remain in the trial and attend all subsequent trial visits. 
Every effort should be made to observe subjects who have been randomized and received at least 
1 dose of study drug until the scheduled end of their observation, even if they discontinued the 
trial treatment.  The investigator should make every attempt to contact the subject/parent/legal 
g
uardian via phone to arrange the appropriate follow-up assessment for such subjects and 
document the course of the subject’s condition. 
8.3. S ubject Replacement Criteria 
Subjects withdrawn from the trial may be replaced if the number of evaluable subjects drops 
below 90 in Cohort 1 or 45 in Cohort 2. 
9. T REATMENTS 
9.1. Id entification of Investigational Product(s) 
TransCon hGH will be provided as single-use glass vials and supplied to the sites in cartons.  
Most materials needed for study drug reconstitution and administration will be provided to the 
investigational sites and distributed by the investigator to the subject, including: prefilled 
syringes with 1 mL water for injection and/or vials containing water for injection; 1 mL syringes 
for administration; and needles for reconstitution and administration.  
Ge
notropin will be provided as a 2-chamber cartridge with a commercially approved device.  In 
some c
ountries Genotropin may be provided by prescription from a local pharmacy with 
reimbursement by the Sponsor.  Most additional materials needed for study drug administration 
will
 be provided to the investigational sites and distributed by the investigational site to the 
subject, including: injection device and needles for administration with the injection device 
(other than in countries were Genotropin along with injection device and needles are provided by 
prescription from a local pharmacy with reimbursement by the Sponsor).  
Both TransCon hGH and Genotropin will be dispensed to parents/legal guardians in sufficient 
amounts to provide the subject with enough supply of study drug until the next visit. 
9.2. Labeli ng 
All study drug will be labeled according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local 
re
quirements.  Parents/legal guardians will be provided with dosing and storage instructions.  
S
tudy drug labels will comply with the regulatory requirements of each country and will be 
printed in local language; the storage conditions will be contained on the carton label.

TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 62 of 117 9.3. T reatments Administered 
9.3.1 T ransCon hGH 
TransCon hGH will be provided as a lyophilized powder, in single-use glass vials, to be 
reconstituted with 1 mL sterile water for injection.  For the composition and characteristics of 
TransCon hGH, re
fer to the Investigator’s Brochure. 
TransCon hGH will be injected SC into the left and right buttock, left and right thigh, and left 
a
nd right abdomen in the morning hours by the trial staff or by the subject/parent/legal guardian.  
To minimize local side effects it is recommended to rotate the 6 injection sites in a subsequent 
manner (eg, ri
ght buttock, right abdomen, right thigh, left thigh, left abdomen, left buttock). 
During the ex
tension trial planned at the conclusion of this 52-week randomized trial, the plan is 
to switch from TransCon hGH (ACP-011) in vials to TransCon hGH (ACP-011) in dual chamber 
cartridge
s (DCC’s), in which TransCon hGH will be supplied as a single dose in a DCC for 
administration by an Auto-Injector.  The DCC presentations will use the 2 compounded solution 
concentra
tions also used for the vials in the randomized portion of this trial, 12.1 mg hGH/vial 
(11.0 mg hGH/mL
 when reconstituted) and 24.2 mg hGH/vial (22.0 mg hGH/mL when 
reconstituted), a
nd will be filled with different volumes of the 2 solutions to provide nine 
presentations with dose i
ncrements of approximately 20%.  Doses from 3.0 mg hGH to 13.3 mg 
hGH will be avail
able.  When the subjects are dosed with 0.24 ± 0.02 mg hGH/kg/week the 
associated volumes for injecti
on for each weight range are shown in the table below ( Table 1).  
F
or the trial to support the use of the Auto-Injector during the extension phase, the aim is to 
mimic the dose increments and the associated weight ranges both with respect to injection 
volume and mg hGH.  Therefore, 2 vial presentations will be manufactured; a 12.1 mg hGH/vial 
(11.0 mg hGH/m
L when reconstituted) and 24.2 mg hGH/vial (22.0 mg hGH/mL when 
reconstituted).
  Only the drug product at 12.1 mg hGH/vial will be available at start of phase 3.  
The consequence is that subjects ≥24 kg will initially be dosed with a somewhat higher volume, 
a
nd subjects ≥42 kg will initially need 2 injections on the same day using 2 different injection 
site locations unt
il the 24.2 mg hGH/vial is available during resupply of study drug.  
Table 1 shows the dose v
olumes to be used for each weight range, both when only the 12.1 mg 
hGH/vial (11.0 mg
 hGH/mL when reconstituted) is available early in the phase 3 trial, and the 
dose volumes that will be use
d when both the 12.1 and 24.2 mg hGH/vials (11.0 and 22.0 mg 
hGH/mL when
 reconstituted) are available.  All of these dose volumes provide an average dose 
of 0.24 ± 0.02 mg hGH/kg/we
ek within each weight range.  As a result, all subjects in the 
TransCon hGH g
roup will be treated over the course of the trial at an average dose of 0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week.

Once the 24.2 mg hGH/vial is available, all subjects will be treated with a single injection per 
week. 
9.3.2 G enotropin 
Genotropin is a lyophilized powder dispensed in a 2-chamber cartridge. For the composition and 
characteristics of Genotropin, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Genotropin will be administered as daily SC injections in a standard dose equivalent to 0.24 mg 
hGH
/kg/week.  The total weekly dose will be equally split into 7 daily doses of 0.034 mg 
hGH/kg/day.
  Genotropin will be administered with an injection device for SC use into the left 
a
nd right buttock, left and right thigh, and left and right abdomen, recommended in the evening 
hours (at bedtime), by the subject/parent/legal guardian.  Administration will be done at the trial 
site during the fi
rst visit in the morning hours.  To minimize local side effects it is recommended 
to rotate the injection sites in the
 same manner as TransCon hGH (see Section 9.3.1 ) .  
F
or specific dosing instructions for both treatment cohorts, please refer to the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.4. Disp ensing and Storage 
While at the site, TransCon hGH and Genotropin must be kept in a locked area with access 
limited to designated trial staff and must be stored at +2°C to +8°C.  Water for injection should 
be stored at 2 to 30°C
.  All products will be temperature monitored, as appropriate.  Genotropin 
will be dispensed by
 the trial staff or sent home to the parents/legal guardians in cool boxes in a 
transportation bag (eg, trolley case and/or backpack) and should be stored in a refrigerator at 
+2°C to +8°C as soon as possible, out of
 reach of children.  TransCon hGH will be dispensed by 
trial staff or sent hom
e to the parents/legal guardians in cool boxes in a transportation bag and 
should be stored below 30°C at home, and only moved to cold storage (+2°C to +8°C) if the 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 64 of 117 a
mbient temperature is above 30°C.  The storage conditions will be carefully described to the 
subject/pa
rent/legal guardian. 
Further details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual and Instructions for Use. 
9.5. S election of Doses in the Trial 
TransCon hGH (ACP-011) is an inactive prodrug.  The phase 2 pediatric GHD trial with 
TransCon hGH (
ACP-001) demonstrated that a dose of 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week provided 
comparable PK, PD (I
GF-1 SDS), efficacy (annualized height velocity) and safety/tolerability 
compared to the equivalent weekly dose of Genotropin divided into 7 daily doses.  The Bridging 
Trial demonstrated that 
ACP-011 has comparable PK (hGH) and PD (IGF-1) to ACP-001, 
meeting
 the formal de
finition of bioequivalence.  The smaller PEG in ACP-011 result ed in less 
than ha
lf the PEG exposure compared to ACP-001.  As somatropin is recommended at a dose of 
0.025-0.05 mg hGH/kg/day (0.175-0.35 mg hGH/kg/week) and Genotropin is approved up to a 
dose
 of 0.245 mg hGH/kg/week for pediatric GHD, a dose of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week for both 
TransCon hGH and G
enotropin appears to be justified and appropriate.  The nonclinical and 
clinical data supports onc
e weekly dosing with TransCon hGH.  The randomized treatment 
period of 52 weeks is c
onsistent with current regulatory recommendations, and the extension trial 
will provide longer-term safety and efficacy data.  
9.6. Dose  Adjustment Criteria 
Treatment can be discontinued or dose modified at any time during the trial.  The following 
symptoms and laborato
ry abnormalities are considered to be the main guide for decision making 
concerning treatment discontinuation or dose modification: 
• I GF-1 levels 
• IGF-1 >+2.0 SD at any visit should be confirmed by a second measurement measured as 
soon as possible if deemed to be clinically significant by the investigator.  Blood samples 
shoul
d be colle
cted 5-7 days postdose (TransCon hGH cohort) or at any day (Genotropin 
cohort).  If the IGF-1 SDS is still elevated above +2.0, and of clinical concern, the hGH 
dose
 may be decreased to the next lower dose bracket for TransCon hGH (see Pharmacy 
Ma
nual and Section 9.3) or a 20% decrease in dose (initially to 0.19 mg hGH/kg/week) 
for subjects on 
Genotropin.  Any re-establishment of the original dose (0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week) du
e to a subsequent sub-optimal IGF-1 response needs to be discussed 
with the Medical Expert. 
• Glucose parameters 
• HbA1c > 6.2% 
• F asting glucose level > 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) 
• 2 hour postdose glucose level during OGTT ≥ 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 65 of 117 F
or a subject who had evidence of borderline glucose intolerance or diabetes prior to starting 
hGH therapy (eg, FPG 98 mg/dL and HbA1c 5.9%), it might be appropriate to treat for 
hyperglycemia as needed, without initial study drug treatment adjustment.  However, if a subject 
with no evide
nce of glucose intolerance reaches the above glucose parameter levels, the FPG and 
HbA
1c should be repeated within 2-4 weeks.  If the repeat values are the same or worse, the 
Tr
ansCon hGH dose may be decreased to the next lower dose bracket (~20%; see Pharmacy 
Ma
nual), and the dose may be reduced by ~20% for a subject on Genotropin (eg, to 0.19 mg 
hGH
/kg/week or 0.027 mg hGH/kg/day), or appropriate anti-glycemic therapy(ies) may be 
star
ted.   If appropriate follow-up monitoring shows progressively worsening glucose 
int
olerance, additional hGH dose adjustments may be appropriate.  If in any case treatment 
shoul
d be discontinued, all subsequent visits and assessments should continue as planned. 
If a subject develops any of the above listed criteria or develops a severe GH-related AE at any 
ti
me during the course of the trial (eg, peripheral edema, severe headache, intracranial 
h
ypertension or other adverse drug reaction and/or abnormal laboratory values), the investigator 
or Medical Expert/Sponsor (and ISC if needed) may propose a dose modification.  
9.7. Dr ug Accountability 
Sites will be supplied with the study drug to distribute as required to subjects.  Dedicated site 
staf
f will be responsible for all procedures concerning the study drug.  
The investigational medicinal products will be delivered to trial sites and dispensed to the 
subjects/subjects’ parents/legal guardians according to the relevant storage conditions for each 
product.  In some countries the Genotropin comparator and injection device may be provided by 
prescription, with reimbursement by the Sponsor.  Centrally supplied study drug must be kept in 
a
n appropriate, secure area at the trial site and stored according to the conditions specified on the 
study drug labels at the trial site (refrigerator) and subject’s home.  
S
tudy drug inventory accounting should be completed to record the receipt and distribution.  Any 
stud
y drug delivery must be confirmed including date, quantity, batch number, and subject 
identific
ation number.  An accurate record of the date and amount of study drug dispensed to 
e
ach subject must be recorded and be available for inspection at any time.  
An appointed trial monitor will review the accountability and inventory forms on a regular basis.  
Clinical trial supplies include, but are not limited to, lab supplies and study drugs.  The Sponsor 
will
 be responsible for the supply, administration, inventory, and applicable accountability of 
clinical trial supplies, exercising accepted medical and pharmaceutical practices, except in the 
case of pharmacy-provided Genotropin in some countries.  An accurate and timely record of the 
dispo
sition of all clinical supplies must be maintained.  The supplies and inventory record must 
be
 made available for inspection upon request.  Upon completion or termination of the trial, the 
investigator w
ill keep the remaining clinical supplies along with a copy of the inventory record 
and a record of the clinical supplies returned until further notice.

PORTANT: Under no circumstances will the investigator allow the study drugs to be used 
other than as direc
ted by this protocol. 
9.8. T reatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assessed during the treatment period and will be based on drug 
accountability and review of the Subject Diary and Instructions for Use.  Parents/legal guardians 
will be instructed to return to the site all used study drug at each visit.  The completed Subject 
Diary where the date, time and the dose of study drug administration will be recorded along with 
any noted local injection site reactions or other adverse events and concomitant medications 
should be returned at each visit.  All study drug, used and unused, shall be returned at the end of 
the tr
ial. 
All drug accountability records will be kept secure by the trial staff and will be verified by the 
trial monitor.  
9.9. Prior and Concomitant Therapies 
9.9.1 P rior Therapy 
Prior therapy is considered any therapy given within 4 weeks prior to the Screening visit and will 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
9.9.2 Permitted and Prohibited Therapies 
Concomitant therapy is considered any medication other than the investigational or reference 
product that is administered from the first day of study drug administration up until the end of 
the tr
ial.  Any change in documented, permitted concomitant medication being taken at the 
beginni
ng of the clinical trial must be recorded in the eCRF, noting the type of medication, the 
dose, duration, and indication.  If the administration of a prohibited concomitant medication 
be
comes necessary, participation in the trial may be discontinued prematurely for that subject, 
based on a decision made in collaboration with the Medical Expert and Sponsor. 
9.9.2.1 
Permitted Therapies 
• R eplacement therapy for pituitary deficiencies of other axes.  As growth hormone may 
e
nhance the transformation of hydrocortisone to cortisone, the investigator may increase the 
dose of hydrocortisone replacement therapy if needed (eg, for anticipated stress).  
• Gluc ocorticoid therapy for indications other than adrenal replacement (eg, asthma) may be 
administered in a dose equivalent to inhaled budesonide of not more than 400 µg/d for a 
maximum of approximately 1 month during 1 calendar year (approximate equivalent doses: 
fluticasone: 264 µg/d; beclomethasone: 504 µg/d; flunisolide 1,000 µg/d; triamcinolone: 
1,000 µg/d; mometasone: 211 µg/d; ciclesonide 264 µg/d). 
• Treatment for diabetes 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 67 of 117 • Ove r-the-counter vitamins, minerals or other dietary supplements only if their use is agreed 
to by the investigator.

10. T RIAL PROCEDURES 
Prior to any protoc
ol related activities or Screening evaluations (see the Schedule of Events), 
informed consent will be obtained from each potential subject in accordance with GCP and 
regional regulatory requirements.  The format and content of the ICF must be approved by the 
appropriate instituti
onal review board/independent ethics committee/human research ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC/HREC) prior to implementation.  Release of medical information 
authorization shoul
d also be obtained at the time of informed consent.  
10.1. Trial Periods and Visits 
In addition to the Screening visit(s), enrolled TransCon hGH and Genotropin subjects will attend 
a total of 6 trial visits, all in the morning: V1 (Week 1; Day 1; predose, fasting), V2 (Week 5; 
predose  for TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 5 for Genotropin subjects), V3 (Week 
13; 48-72 hours postdose for TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 13 for Genotropin 
subjects), V4 (Week 26; 48-72 hours postdose for TransCon hGH subjects, fasting; any day 
during Week 26 for Genotropin subjects, fasting), V5 (Week 39; 48-72 hours postdose for 
TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 39 for Genotropin subjects) and V6 (Day 365 for 
TransCon hGH subjects [7 days postdose] and Genotropin subjects, fasting).  
For the PK/PD subset of 
TransCon hGH subjects (at least 8 subjects), Visit 3 will span 
approximately 168 hours following their 13th weekly injection.  The 13th and 14th injections 
will be given at t
he site. 
An overview of all visits is provided in the Schedules of Events (Attachments 17.2  and 17.3).  
10.1.1
 Screening (Day –42 to –1) 
The Screening period will last up to approximately 6 weeks during which clinical data will be 
collected and investigations will be performed to establish the subject’s eligibility for the trial.  
The following assessments will be performed and appropriate data collected. 
1) Data on current anthropometric measurements (auxology), (auxology to be performed at each 
visit by the same, trained, blinded auxologist as far as possible): 
• Absolut e HT, measured on a calibrated wall-mounted stadiometer 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 68 of 117 • B ody weight 
2) Data on parental height, if available: 
• Moth er’s height 
• Father’s height 
3) Complete medical history, including a description of pituitary deficiencies, currently and 
previously taken relevant medications and, when available, pre-screening height 
measurements to assess grow
th history 
4) Overall health status assessment with complete physical examination and vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature) (subjects should rest for at least 
5 minutes before vital sign assessment)  
5) P
ubertal status assessment (according to Tanner stages) ( Tanner 1976) (scant pubic hair is 
c
ompatible with Tanner Stage 1, absent breast or testicular enlargement) 
6) 12-lead ECG, local reading (subjects should rest for at least 2 minutes before ECG 
assessment) 
7) Collec
tion of blood for the following laboratory assessments: 
• I GF-1 serum levels 
• Anti-transglutaminase antibodies (results within approximately 6 months prior to 
Screening may be accepted, the final decision rests with the Medical Expert) 
• Anti -hGH and anti-PEG binding antibodies (the analysis of the anti-hGH and anti-PEG 
antibodies may only be conducted after randomization and are not required for eligibility 
verification.  These data will be used to support evaluation of postdose antibody 
detection) 
• R outine safety biochemistry and hematology parameters 
• Other hormone levels: thyroid status (TSH, fT4, and fT3 levels) and morning cortisol 
• Glucose metabolism: fasting insulin, glucose, HbA1c.  In case of suspected glucose 
intolerance, an OGTT should be performed (glucose metabolism parameters can be 
assessed locally at any time if there is suspicion of impaired glucose tolerance, which 
may include an OGTT) 
• Lipid status: Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL 
8) Stimulation tests: 
• Tw o different GH stimulation tests, chosen from the following: a) insulin tolerance test 
(with cortisol response to hypoglycemia), b) arginine test, c) clonidine test, d) glucagon 
test (with or without propra
nolol, with cortisol response unless cortisol measured during 
an ITT), or 
e) L-dopa test (with or without propranolol) 
• S ex hormone priming is suggested (but not required) to be performed prior to GH 
stimulation tests for girls over the age of 10 and boys over the age of 11  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 69 of 117 • I f 1 or both of the stimulation tests have been performed within approximately 
6 months prior to Screening and have been well documented (with a proper recording 
of sa
mple timing and results as well as euthyroid status of the subject) it may be 
accepted.  In accordance with recent Guidelines, in subjects with known 
pa
nhypopituitarism (eg, subjects who are deficient in TSH and/or ACTH post cranial 
radiation), GH stimulation tests may not be required in subjects who meet all other 
inclusion criteria and whose history is consistent with GHD including low growth 
velocity, low IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels, and delayed bone age ( Grimberg 2016).  
Also in children who ar
e born panhypopituitary with deficiency of ≥2 pituitary 
hormones in addition to GH, do not require
 stimulation tests.  The final decision rests 
with the Medical 
Expert 
• In case the subject was not previously assessed for deficiencies of the HPA, 
competence should be demonstrated by an 8:00 AM cortisol > 190 nmol/L (7 μg/dL) 
in subjects with idiopathic GHD only, or by a peak cortisol level > 500 nmol/L 
(18 μg/dL) in the context of an insulin tolerance test or glucagon stimulation test.  At 
the discretion of the inve
stigator, or in case Screening results are borderline or not 
interpretable (eg, from insulin tolerance test) or raising concerns, a Standard Dose or 
Low Dose Short AC
TH test should be conducted 
9) Karyotype testing to rule out Turner Syndrome will be performed in all female subjects 
(results obtained prior to Screening may be accepted if well documented; the final decision 
rests with the Medical Expert)  
10) Sellar MRI: contrast dye is recommended (if not conducted within approximately 6 months 
prior to Screenin
g); performed and read locally 
11) Fundoscopy (to rule out papilledema or signs of intracranial hypertension or mass effect) 
12) Bone age determination –  X-ray of the left hand and wrist for determination of bone age (if 
not performed within approximately 6 months prior to Screening), using a central bone age 
reader.  If conducted within approximately 6 months, the digital or copy of hard film should 
be sent to the
 central bone age reader.  
The investigator is recom
mended to follow a stepwise approach in the order listed:  
• Tr ial participation should only be offered to subjects and parents/legal guardians thereof with 
already present suspicion of GHD (based on height measurement and medical history or 
previously performed diagnostic tests). 
• Non -invasive procedures (demographics, auxology measurements, physical examination, 
vital sign measurement and pubertal status assessment, review of medical history) are to be 
performed first.  Further procedures should only be undertaken if all results thus far indicate 
eligibilit
y. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 70 of 117 • F urther investigations to be performed: laboratory assessments, GH stimulation tests 
followed by bone age, MRI, fundoscopy will be performed, also in a stepwise manner. If any 
Screening procedure during this process demonstrates ineligibility of the subject (see 
eligibility criteria), the Screening will terminate and the subject will be classified as a 
Screening failure. 
This s
equence of events at Screening is suggested to avoid exposure of the subject to 
unnecessary needle insertions, as well as to enable termination of Screening at any point in case 
any of the eligibility criteria are not met (such cases will be classified as Screening failures).  
All re
sults will be reviewed by the Medical Expert to verify eligibility of each subject prior to 
ra
ndomization.  Eligible subjects will be centrally randomized to 1 of the 2 cohorts.  Following 
ra
ndomization, it is recommended to start the treatment period (Visit 1) within 2 weeks from the 
time of randomization. 
10.1.2 Treatment Period (Days 1 to 365) 
For all cohorts, the following procedures will be performed during Visit 1 through Visit 6, unless 
other
wise indicated: 
1) Physical examination and vital sign measurement (blood pressure, heart rate, body 
temperature, respiratory rate) (subjects should rest for at least 5 minutes before vital sign 
assessment) 
2) Review of concomitant medication 
3) Review of Subject Diary by investigator (V2 –  V6) 
4) Evaluation of Adverse Events (AEs) and local tolerability 
5) Safety assessments:  
• Hor mone levels { TSH, fT4, fT3, and morning cortisol; V1 (fasting), V3, V4 (fasting), 
a
nd V6 (fasting)} 
• Routine safety biochemistry parameters (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, 
chloride, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, AST, ALT, GGT, albumin, total 
protein, creatinine, urea-nitrogen, uric acid, serum iron and transferrin)  
• He matology parameters (hemoglobin, leukocytes, differential blood count of leukocytes, 
platelet count; blood smears will be performed locally for back-up analysis, if needed)  
• P arameters of glucose metabolism: fasting glucose (when required), insulin, and HbA1c 
(g
lucose metabolism parameters can be assessed locally at any time if there is suspicion 
of impaired glucose tolerance, which may include OGTT) 
• P arameters of lipid metabolism (cholesterol, LDL and HDL, and triglycerides)

mmunogenicity assessment: anti-hGH and anti-PEG antibodies (for Cohort 2, anti-PEG 
antibodies only at Screening and V1 predose in support of trial specific assay cut-point 
determination); a subject with observed anti-hGH binding antibodies post dosing (V3-V5) at 
or close to the C max for TransCon hGH may be brought back for a repeat sample to assess for 
ne
utralizing antibodies at a time point deemed appropriate to exclude assay interference.  
Anti-PEG antibodies will only be analyzed at the end of the individual treatment period once 
all samples from an individual subject are available. 
Serum samples collected for immunogenicity assessments will be retained for up to 5 years 
following trial finalization for possible further characterization of a potential anti-drug 
antibody re
sponse at a specialized laboratory 
7) Bioanalytical samples for TransCon hGH (Cohort 1), hGH, PEG, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum 
levels; (for Cohort 2, PEG samples taken only at Screening and V1 predose to assist 
interpretation of a
nti-PEG antibody data) (see  Table 2)  
8) Auxology measure
ments (actual height and body weight), to be performed by the same, 
trained, blinded (if possible) auxologist at approximately the same time of day (morning) at 
each visit if possibl
e 
9) Fundoscopy (at V4 and V6, and at other visits if clinically indicated) 
10) Pubertal status assessment (at V4 and V6) 
11) Training on study drug preparation and administration (V1 - during first administration and 
further as nee
ded) 
12) Study drug administration at site at Visit 1 (both cohorts) and Visit 2 (TransCon hGH cohort 
only) (dose should be adjusted at V3, V4 and V5 according to the subject’s weight) – by the 
tria
l staff or subject/parent/legal guardian 
13) Vital signs will be assessed over 2 hours at Visit 1, at every clinic visit for all subjects, 
including over 24 hours postdose at V3 for the Cohort 1 PK/PD subset (subjects should rest 
for at least 5 minutes before vital sign assessment) 
14) ECG at V1 and V4 for all subjects; additionally at V3 only in PK/PD subset at predose and 8, 
12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 a
nd 168h postdose for TransCon hGH subjects (subjects 
should rest for at le
ast 2 minutes before ECG assessment) 
15) Bone age at V6 
The dose of TransCon hGH or Genotropin initially administered will be calculated using the 
weight measure
ment obtained at Visit 1 (predose).  The dose of TransCon hGH or Genotropin 
will be adjuste
d according to the subject’s weight measurement at Visit 3 (prior to dosing for the 
PK/PD subset), Visit 4, and Visit 5.   
At each visit the
 parents/legal guardians will be given enough study drug for treatment until the 
next visit.  Subject Diary availability will be ensured to record the date and time of injection, any 
local reacti
ons or other Adverse Events and concomitant medication.

e with the Schedule of Events ( Attachment 17.3).  
10.1.2.3 Pharm
acokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Subset 
At least 8 subjects from selected sites and countries in Cohort 1 will be assessed in a PK/PD 
subset analysis.  Subjects will attend Visit 3 on Day 1 of Week 13 (Day 85).  Visit 3 may be 
performed within a
 window of + 2 weeks, starting on Day 1 of either Week 13, 14 or 15.  
Subjects will stay at the hospital or come back for the scheduled procedures to assess safety and 
PK/PD profile over 1 week and ECGs intended to bracket presumed C max of hGH, IGF-1, and 
Tr
ansCon hGH prodrug: 
• B lood sampling for PK (TransCon hGH, hGH, and PEG levels): predose (at -0.5h) and at 8, 
12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 hours (h) relative to the 13th TransCon hGH dosing 
• B lood sampling for PD (IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels): predose (at -0.5h) and 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 
48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 h relative to the 13th TransCon hGH dosing 
• ECG mea surements will be done predose and at 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h 
postdose 
• Vital si gns and injection site evaluations will be done at 15 min, 1h, 2h, and 24h postdose 
• The 14th dose injection will be given at the clinic 
For subjects in the PK/PD subset, all other procedures planned for Visit 3 are also to be 
performed on the Day 1 of the respective week, prior to dosing.  The subject and parents/legal 
guardians ma
y be offered accommodation until all assessments are completed and the 14th dose 
given, depending on the agreement of the investigator with the parents/legal guardians, to ensure 
comfort for the child and reduce unnecessary travel.   
Each PK/PD blood sampl
e will require 2 mL of blood (details in Appendix 5).  
The
 collection, processing, storage, and shipment of samples are described in the Laboratory 
Manual.

 Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits are those visits that occur between regularly scheduled visits and are 
performed to assess a previously noted Adverse Event, abnormal/alarming laboratory values, 
and/or clinical findings.  In such cases, the subject’s parent/legal guardian will be contacted via 
telephone to arrange an unscheduled visit to assess the noticed abnormalities.  Only focused 
a
ssessments (guided by the reason for the visit) are foreseen for these visits. 
10.1.4 Early Termination Visits 
Early termination visits are performed for any early termination/withdrawal of a subject from 
this clinical trial.  This does not apply to subjects who have discontinued study drug but agreed 
to continue tr
ial visits.  The structure and assessments of the early termination visit should be as 
much a
s possible similar to the last visit (V6). 
10.1.5 Follow-up and Extension Phase 
All subjects who successfully complete this 52 week trial are invited to participate in an 
extension trial, for whom Visit 6 represents the first visit for the extension trial and data collected 
will
 become the baseline data for the extension trial.  This extension trial is to assess long-term 
sa
fety and efficacy.  Subjects on Genotropin treatment (Cohort 2) will switch over to TransCon 
hGH
 treatmen t. 
There is no follow up visit for subjects who do not enter the extension trial for whom Visit 6 is 
the final trial visit. 
10.2. T rial Duration 
Each subject’s participation is expected to last about 60 weeks, as follows: 
• Screening period: up to approximately 6 weeks (plus a re commended period of up to 2 weeks 
unti
l V1) 
• Tr eatment period: 52 weeks of repeated dosing   
10.2.1 Overall Trial Schedule 
10.2.2 Screening Period 
The Screening period will last up to approximately 6 weeks during which clinical data will be 
collected and investigations will be performed to establish the subject’s eligibility for the trial.  
P
rior to any trial specific procedure, a written and signed informed consent will be obtained from 
the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and a signed assent from the subject (whenever possible).  At sites 
whe
re the diagnosis of GHD is confirmed prior to consideration for a trial, many of the 
Screening procedures (which reflect standard of care in the diagnosis of GHD) may be 
completed prior to signing of informed consent or assent form.  These may enable enrollment, 
ba
sed on approval by the Medical Expert .  For the assessments that will be performed during the 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential

creening period refer to Section 10.1.1 and the Schedules of Events ( Attachments 17.2  a nd 
17.3) . 
All results determining the eligibility of the subject will be reviewed by the Medical Expert prior 
to randomiza
tion of each subject.  Eligible subjects will be centrally randomized to 1 of 
2 cohorts: TransCon hGH or Genotropin, in a 2:1 ratio.  Prior to randomization subjects will be 
a
llocated to stra
ta using the minimization rule according to their age (˃3 to ≤6 and ˃6 years), 
peak GH levels in stimulation tests (≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL), and gender. 
Re-screening is permitted.  Re -screening of subjects with an out of range cortisol and/or thyroid 
hormone level (inade
quate replacement therapy for the insufficiency of other 
hypothalamo-pituitary axes) may be allowed ≥3 months after replacement treatment adjustment.  
Individual blood draws may be repeated for the following reasons, but not limited to: eg, ruling 
out an analyti
cal error, sample handling or shipment issues, conflicting or inconsistent subject 
data, etc.  The decision on re-screening will be made on a case by case basis by the Medical 
Expert.  Re -scre
ened subjects will receive a new Screening number. 
10.2.3 Tre
atment Period 
Randomized subjects will receive weekly doses of TransCon hGH or daily doses of Genotropin. 
The 2 cohorts will be as s
hown in Table 3.   
T
able 3   
Dose
 Cohorts 
Cohort  Product  Dose Administration  
1 TransCon hGH  Once weekly in a dose equivalent to 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week  
2 Genotropin  Once daily in a dose equivalent to 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week  
hGH  = human growth hormone ; kg = kilogram; mg = milligram  
Following randomization, it is recommended to start the treatment period (Visit 1) within 
2 weeks from the time of randomization.  During some clinic visits TransCon hGH (Visits 1 and 
2) or
 Genotropin (Visit 1) 
may be administered in the morning hours by the trial staff or by 
subject/pare
nts/legal guardians, although Genotropin will generally be administered daily in the 
evening hours and TransCon hGH will generally be administered weekly in the morning or 
evening by subjects/parents/legal guardians (or occasionally by the trial staff).  Once weekly 
healthcar
e services may be offered for the first 4 weeks of treatment to accommodate home 
administration of TransCon hGH and Genotropin.  Extended support may be offered until 
subjects/pa
rents/legal guardians are comfortable to take over administration of the study drug.  
Both drugs will be administered SC in the left and right buttock, left and right thigh, and left and 
rig
ht abdomen.  It is recommended that injection sites are used successively, being rotated by 
using a differe
nt injection site at each subsequent injection.

n addition to the Screening visit(s), enrolled TransCon hGH and Genotropin subjects will attend 
a total of 6 trial visits, all in the morning: V1 (Week 1; Day 1; predose, fasting), V2 (Week 5; 
predose for TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 5 for Genotropin subjects), V3 (Week 
13; 48-72 hours postdose for TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 13 for Genotropin 
subj
ects), V4 (Week 26; 48-72 hours postdose for TransCon hGH subjects, fasting; any day 
during Week 26 for Genotropin subjects, fasting), V5 (Week 39; 48-72 ho urs post dose  for 
TransCon hGH subjects; any day during Week 39 for Genotropin subjects ) and V6 (Day 365 for 
TransCon hGH subjects [7 days post dose] and Genotropin subjects, fasting).  
For the PK/PD subset of TransCon hGH subjects (at least 8 subjects), Visit 3 will span 
approximately168 hours following their 13th weekly injection as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 
8 days after the dose of that week.  The 13th and 14th doses will be given in the clinic. 
Tr
ansCon hGH and G
enotropin will be administered at the site at the first trial visit.  The 
administration a
t the trial site will be done by the trial staff or by the subject/parent/legal 
guardian.  Bioanalytical samples for the assessment of TransCon hGH and PEG (TransCon hGH 
treated subjects; for Cohort 2, PEG samples taken only at Visit 1 to assist interpretation of 
anti-PEG antibody data), and hGH and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 levels (all subjects) will be performed at 
all visits at selected time points.  For a detailed visit schedule refer to Sectio n 10.1.2  and the 
Schedule of Events in Attachment s 17.2 and 17.3.  
The
 dose of TransCon hGH or Genotropin will be calculated using the weight measurement 
obtained at Visit 1 (predose).  The dose of TransCon hGH or Genotropin will be adjusted 
a
ccording to t
he subject’s weight measurement at Visit 3 (prior to dosing for the PK/PD subset), 
Visit 4 and Visit 5.  The dose may be decreased for safety reasons at any time during the trial 
course, ac
cording to the predefined dose-adjustment criteria ( Section 9.6). 
I
t is suggested that the site staff follows up with the subject between the visits by eg, phone calls.  
10.3. Assessments 
10.3.1 Safety and Efficacy 
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed throughout the trial.  All samples obtained 
after Infor
med Consent will be shipped to a selected central laboratory for analysis.  Safety 
samples may b
e analyzed locally in case of emergency or if logistics or other unforeseen events 
do not permit a central analysis.  During visits where study drug administration is planned at the 
site, these assessments w
ill be performed prior to such administration (predose).  While fasting is 
recommended 
for all visits, fasting is required at Visits 1, 4, and 6.  The following procedures 
will be pe
rformed during V1 through V6 unless otherwise indicated: 
1) Physical examination and vital sign measurement (blood pressure, heart rate, body 
temperature, respiratory rate) (subjects should rest for at least 5 minutes before vital sign 
assessment)

eview of concomitant medication 
3) R
eview of Subject Diary by investigator (V2-V6) 
4) Evaluation of AEs and local tolerability 
5) Safety assessments:  
• Hor mone levels { TSH, fT4, fT3, and morning cortisol; V1 (fasting), V3, V4 (fasting) and 
V6 (fasting)} 
• R outine safety biochemistry parameters (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, 
chloride, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, AST, ALT, GGT, albumin, total 
protein, creatinine, urea-nitrogen, uric acid, serum iron and transferrin) 
• He matology parameters (hemoglobin, leukocytes, differential blood count of leukocytes, 
platelet count; blood smears will be performed locally for back-up analysis, if needed) 
• P arameters of glucose metabolism: fasting glucose (when required), insulin, and HbA1c 
(glucose metabolism parameters can be assessed locally at any time if there is suspicion 
of impa
ired glucose tolerance, which may include an OGTT) 
• P arameters of lipid metabolism (cholesterol, LDL and HDL, and triglycerides) 
6) Immunogenicity assessment: anti-hGH and anti-PEG antibodies (Cohort 2: anti-PEG 
antibodies only at Screening and V1 predose, in support of trial specific assay cut-point 
determination); a subject with observed anti-hGH binding antibodies post dosing (V3-V5) at 
or close to the C max for TransCon hGH may be brought back for a repeat sample to assess for 
ne
utralizing antibodies at a time point deemed appropriate to exclude assay interference.  
Anti-PEG antibodies will only be analyzed at the end of the individual treatment period once 
all samples from an individual subject are available. 
7) Serum samples collected for immunogenicity assessments will be retained for up to 5 years 
following trial finalization for possible further characterization of a potential anti-drug 
antibody response at a specialized laboratory  
8) Bioanalytical samples for TransCon hGH (Cohort 1), hGH, PEG, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum 
levels (for Cohort 2, PEG samples taken only at Screening and V1 predose to assist 
interpretation of anti-PEG antibody data) 
9) Auxology measurements (actual height and body weight), to be performed by the same, 
trained, blinded (if possible) auxologist at approximately the same time of day (morning) at 
e
ach visit if possible 
10) Fundoscopy (at V4 and V6, and at other visits if clinically indicated) 
11) Pubertal status assessment (at V4 and V6) 
12) Training on study drug preparation and administration (V1 - during first administration and 
fur
ther as needed)

14) Vital signs will be assessed over 2 hours at Visit 1, at every clinic visit for all subjects, 
including over 24 hours postdose at V3 for the Cohort 1 PK/PD subset (subjects should rest 
for at least 5 minutes before vital sign assessment) 
15) ECG at V1 and V4 for all subjects; additionally at V3 only in PK/PD subset at predose and 8,

11.1. Adver se Events 
11.1.1 Definition 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to that product.  An AE can arise with 
any use (eg, use in combination with another drug), route of administration, formulation, or dose, 
including an overdose (ICH E6, 21 CFR Part 312.32). 
Risks to trial subjects MAY include rare events of the types listed below.  Some of these risks 
a
re due to taking the investigational drug TransCon hGH, but most are known or thought to be 
associated with approved hGH therapies such as Genotropin.  In view of the investigational 
na
ture of TransCon hGH, possible risks are not necessarily limited to those listed: 
• He adaches 
• Muscle pain 
• Joint stiffness 
• High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) 
• Sugar in the urine (glycosuria) 
• I ntracranial hypertension with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or 
vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products 
• Ede ma, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel 
syndrome/paraesthesias 
• H ypothyroidism - In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first 
become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. 
• S lipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis –  these may occur more frequently in patients with 
endocrine disorders (including GHD or in patients undergoing rapid growth).  Any pediatric 
patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy 
should be carefully evaluated. 
• Progression of Pre-existing Scoliosis - progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who 
e
xperience rapid growth.  Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history 
of sc
oliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of 
scoliosis.  However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis.  
• S kin atrophy  
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 80 of 117 • W hen somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, 
tissue atrophy may result.  This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and 
Admi
nistration]. 
• Aller gic reaction - As with any protein, local (skin reactions, such as rash or swelling) or 
systemic allergic reactions (including rare generalized hypersensitivity reactions) may occur.  
Parents/legal guardians/subjects should be informed that such reactions are possible and that 
prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 
• Pancreatitis - Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving 
somatropin tre
atment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared 
with adults
.  Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated subject, especially a 
c
hild, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain. 
Clinically significant treatment-emergent physical examination or laboratory abnormalities and 
worsening pretreatment conditions should be recorded as AEs. 
The Medical Expert  will review all AEs on an ongoing basis and all Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) reports as received.  The key safety data will also be reviewed periodically by an ISC.  
S
afety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording of all AEs, including SAEs, regular 
monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry parameters, regular physical examination, vital 
sign assessment, fundoscopy, and ECGs. 
11.1.2
 Severity, Causality and Outcome Assessment 
11.1.2.1 
Severity Rating 
The following guideline must be used by the investigator to grade the intensity of an adverse 
event: 
Mild  – The subject is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  The event is of 
li
ttle conc
ern to the subject and/or of little-or-no clinical significance.  The event is not expected 
to have
 any effect on the subject’s health or well-being.  The event may or may not require 
medic
al intervention.  
Moderate  – The subject has enough discomfort to cause interference with or change in some of 
their
 usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the subject’s health or well-being.  The 
e
vent may require medical intervention. 
Severe  – The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in many or all usual 
a
ctivities.  The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the 
s
ubject’s health or well-being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or close 
follow
-up. 
L
ife-threatening  – The subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 81 of 117 11.1.2.2 
Causality Rating 
The principal investigator will assess the causal relationship of the study drug to the event, using 
the following guideline: 
Definite  – This category applies to those adverse experiences which the investigator feels are 
c
learly related to the study medication.  An adverse experience may be assigned as definitely 
re
lated when the event meets the first 4 or more of the following criteria: 
• I t follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the trial product 
• It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject 
• I t disappears or decreases on cessation of the study drug.  [There are important exceptions 
when an adverse event does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists (eg, [1] bone marrow suppression, [2] tardive dyskinesias) 
• I t follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug 
• It reappears upon re-challenge (if applicable) 
Probable – This category applies to those adverse events that are considered, with a high degree 
of cert
ainty, to be related to the study drug.  The relationship of the adverse event to the study 
drug
 may be considered probable when the event meets the first 3 or more of the following 
c
riteria: 
• I t follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the trial product 
• It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject 
• I t disappears or decreases on cessation of the study drug.  [There are important exceptions 
when an adverse event does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists (eg, [1] bone marrow suppression, [2] tardive dyskinesias)] 
• I t follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug 
• It reappears upon re-challenge (if applicable) 
Possible – This category applies to those experiences in which the connection with the study 
drug a
dministration is reasonable, although not probable, and is not likely to be due to anything 
else.  An adverse event may be considered possible if or when the first 2  or more of the 
following criteria apply: 
 I t follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the trial product 
 It is possible but unlikely that it may have been produced by the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject 
 It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 82 of 117 Unl
ikely/Remote – In general, this category is applicable to an adverse event that meets the first 
2 or more of the following criteria: 
• I t does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the trial product 
• It may readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject 
• It doe s not follow a known pattern of response to the suspected drug 
• It does not appear to worsen when the drug is re-administered (if applicable) 
Unrelated/Not Related  – This category is applicable to those adverse events, which are judged 
to be clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) and 
do not m
eet the criteria for drug relationship listed under Probable, Possible, or Unlikely, as 
noted above. 
11.1.2.3 Adverse Event Outcome 
Subjects will be followed until adverse events either have resolved, returned to baseline status, or 
are deemed stable or commensurate with ongoing disease processes.  One of the 6 outcomes 
li
sted below must be recorded: 
Resolved  – The subject has fully recovered from the event with no residual effects observable or 
re
turned to baseline status. 
Resolved with sequelae  – The subject has recovered from the event with some residual effects 
obse
rvable. 
Ongoing  – Effects of the event are still present, regardless of whether the effect is changing or 
stable
 and persistent. 
Death Due to this Event 
Death Due to Other Event 
Lost to Follow- up 
11.1.3 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be collected in response to a general question about the subject’s 
well-being and any possible changes from the previous visit, but shall not be specifically 
solicited.  There will be no directed questioning for any specific adverse event. 
AEs, including any serious adverse events, will be collected through the end of trial (i e, the 
W
eek 52 Visit 6).  AEs ongoing at Visit 6 or the time of premature trial discontinuation must be 
followe
d until the event is resolved or deemed stable by the investigator.  All AEs must be 
recorded on the “Adverse Events” case report form.  AEs either observed by the investigator or 
re
ported by the subject must be recorded regardless of causality. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 83 of 117 The
 following attributes must be assigned to each event: 
• De scription 
• Dates of onset and resolution 
• Started or worsened prior or after first dose of study drug on Day 1 
• Severity 
• Assessment of relationship to study drug 
• Outcome 
• Action taken  
• Determination of “serious” (or not) 
Any medical history condition, signs, symptoms, and illnesses active during the Screening phase 
(ie, total of approximately 6 weeks prior to start of randomized trial treatment) will be captured 
a
s baseline (pre-existing) events, if appropriate, to assure that any change(s) in these experiences 
during the trial also are recorded as an AE and a complete safety profile is obtained.  See 
Section 11.2.2 
for additional reporting procedures for serious adverse events. 
An event tha
t occurs after signing of ICF but prior to first study drug administration will be 
documented as medical h
istory unless the event is trial procedure–related, in which case it will 
be
 reported as a non–treatment-emergent AE.  Any new or worsening pretreatment event that 
occurs from the time
 of the first study drug administration until the end of treatment (EOT) Vi sit 
will be re
corded as an AE.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they 
induce clinical si
gns or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy; these 
should be recorded on the AE eCRF page under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated 
with them.  
Whenever possible, an AE should be recorded as a specific diagnosis or syndrome rather than as 
a sign or symptom.  If no specific diagnosis or syndrome can be identified, the AE should be 
recorded as a separate and individual event.  Care should also be taken to record the most 
medically 
appropriate term (eg, hypertension for elevated blood pressure that persists and 
requires chronic
 treatment and follow-up, or increased blood pressure for elevated blood pressure 
that occurs for a li
mited time and does not persist or require ongoing treatment). 
AEs will be reported at the maximum intensity experienced.  If a previously recorded AE or 
pretreatment condition increases in severity or frequency, it will be recorded as a new AE.  All 
AEs will be consi
dered ongoing until they have completely resolved or, in the case of a 
pretreatment condition, returned to baseline status recorded prior to study drug administration.  
At the time of the final tr
ial evaluation, all AEs should have a statement regarding resolution.  
Any SAE that is determined to be related to study drug will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 84 of 117 An a
ccidental overdose is not an AE if there are no signs or symptoms.  Any undesirable medical 
oc
currence resulting from an accidental overdose is an AE, and should be recorded and reported 
on the appropriate eCRF page.  The investigator should document any case of overdose and 
moni
tor the subject.  Since accidental overdoses with the study drug could have serious clinical 
c
onsequences and/or represent a compliance issue, they should be reported immediately to the 
Medical Expert and evaluated by the Sponsor. 
11.2. S erious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs) 
11.2.1 Definitions 
11.2.1.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition 
In addition to the severity and causality ratings, each AE is to be classified by the investigator as 
“serious” or “not serious.” 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• R esults in death 
• Is life-threatening ( Note:  the term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
e
vent in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) 
• R equires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for an elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment, or 
hospitalization scheduled in advance of trial participation, is not a SAE by this criterion) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  (This serious criterion applies if a subject exposed to an 
investi
gational product gives birth to a child with a congenital anomaly or birth defect) 
Me
dical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether classification of an 
adverse event as serious is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that 
may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening or require hospitalization, but may 
jeopa
rdize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in the definition above.  These events should also usually be considered serious. 
Eve
nts not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for the following:  
• R outine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition   
• Treatment that was elective or preplanned for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under the trial and did not worsen 
• Admission to a hospital or other institution for general care not associated with any 
deterioration in condition 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 85 of 117 • Tr eatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions 
of serious given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
11.2.1.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) Definition 
A SUSAR is any AE for which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE, and which is assessed as both unexpected and serious.  A suspected adverse 
re
action is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or if it is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  Expectedness will be determined by 
the Spons
or. 
11.2.1.3 Non-serious AE Leading to Discontinuation 
If situation permits, non-serious events (including laboratory abnormalities) that may require 
permanent discontinuation of study drug should be discussed with the Medical Expert prior to 
making
 any final decision, and if discontinued, should be entered on the eCRF within 3 working 
days. 
11.2.2 Reporting 
All initial and follow-up information  regarding SAEs or SUSARs, including those related to 
proto
col-mandated procedures and regardless of suspected causality, must be reported by the 
investigator immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) to the Sponsor and Premier Research.  
R
eporting must not be delayed by waiting for additional information.  The minimum 
in
formation required for reporting an SAE are the subject ID, the AE term (diagnosis) and 
the investigator
’s initial assessment of causality.  Additional information can be reported to 
the Spons
or and Premier Research as a follow up report.  Su bjec ts will be provided investigator 
contact information for reporting SAEs. 
In addition to telephone notification (discussed above), serious adverse event data must be 
entered on the Serious Adverse Event Report form and transmitted within 48 hours. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to assess expectedness.  Premier Research’s responsibility 
is t
o report SUSARs to investigators, central IECs/IRBs/HRECs, national ethics committees if 
applicable, and appropriate Regulatory Authorities within the time frames required by applicable 
regulations.  It is the investigator’s responsibility to notify the regional ethical or institutional 
review boards of SAEs and any new and significant safety information.  At minimum, SUSARs 
must
 be brought to the attention of these review boards in accordance with regional regulations. 
11.3. E vent of Special Interest: Local Tolerability 
An abnormal injection site reaction is defined as: 
• An injec tion site reaction which is observed at the time of visit and is moderate to severe in 
intensity 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 86 of 117 • An injec tion site reaction between the previous and present visit, or remaining at the time of 
visit, which requires medical attention 
• An y other injection site reaction deemed abnormal (eg, intensity and/or duration) to the 
investigator’s jud
gment, other than those ordinarily observed in subcutaneous injections 
Assessment of local tolerability will be performed by examining the injection sites (by the 
investigator if a reaction is present at the time of a visit) and on the basis of anamnestic data and 
records in the Subject Diary.  At first study drug administration at Visit 1, local tolerability 
assessments will be done a
t 15 min, 1h and 2h postdose. 
Observations will be re
corded on appropriate eCRF pages.  If an injection site reaction meets the 
criteria defined fo
r an “abnormal result” it will be considered an AE. 
11.3.1 Injection Site Pain 
Injection site pain will be evaluated by the investigator or designated staff if the injection is 
given at the clinical site and by the parent/legal guardian if the injection is given at home.  The 
pain will be evaluated usi
ng the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (see  Appendix 2).   In 
a
ddition, each subject and parent/legal guardian will be queried during visits regarding possible 
injection site pain. 
11.3.2 Injection Site Status 
Injection site status will be evaluated by the investigator or designated staff using the Injection 
Site Assessment Scale ( Appendix 2).   In addition, each subject and parent/legal guardian will be 
g
uided to record possible reactions in the Subject Diary and will be queried during visits. 
The following information will be captured: 
• De scription of the reaction 
• Location: left thigh/right thigh/left buttock/right buttock/left part of abdomen/right part of 
abdomen 
• Dur ation: onset, end date 
• Intensity: grading according to the scales provided in appendices (the investigator should 
assess the subjects/subject’s parents/legal guardians description) 
• Action taken: action(s) taken by subjects, medical intervention or medication 
• Comments 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 87 of 117 12. S AFETY MONITORING 
The Sponsor will conduct an ongoing review of all trial data, with particular attention given to 
laboratory findings, AEs, and concomitant medication data.  Any significant trends in safety 
obse
rvations or other findings of significance that are considered related to study drug will be 
reported to the investigators and to Regulatory Authorities.  In particular, the Sponsor will notify 
investi
gators and Regulatory Authorities of AEs that: 
• Ar e serious in nature and not commonly seen in the absence of exposure to somatropin 
• Occur at a greater frequency or at greater severity than described in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure for TransCon hGH for Injection 
Any AE that occurs in the course of the clinical trial must be monitored and followed up until: 
• I t has receded 
• Pathological laboratory findings have returned to normal 
• Steady state has been achieved 
• It has been shown to be unrelated to the study drug and/or trial related procedures 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic 
measures and follow-up procedures are performed. 
13. STATISTICS 
The SAP will provide a detailed description of the planned statistical analyses.  If discrepancies 
e
xist between the text of the statistical analysis as planned in the protocol and the final SAP, the 
final SAP will define the planned analysis of record.

publi
shed in the literature, and assuming a SD of 3.5 cm/y ear w ith a non-inferiority margin of 
2.0 cm, a sample size of 147 subjects in the ITT population will be needed to show 
non-inferiority of TransCon hGH treatment compared to daily hGH with a power of 90%.  This 
sa
mple size calculation is based on a 2:1 randomization and a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025.  
A sa
mple size of 150 subjects randomized has been chosen to account for slight imbalances in 
the randomization due to stratification of randomization.  For 150 enrolled subjects, 
a
pproximately 450 subjects may need to be screened in the trial. 
13.3. Anal ysis Populations 
The following data subsets will be analyzed: 
Safety Analysis Subset  – The safety analysis set will include all randomized subjects who have 
re
ceived at least 1 dose of active treatment. 
Intent- to-treat Subset  – The ITT subset will include all randomized subjects who have received 
a
t least 1 dose of active treatment and have follow -up efficacy data. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 89 of 117 P
er-protocol Subset  – The basis of PP subset is the ITT set.  Subjects with major protocol 
de
viations will be excluded from the PP analysis.  Major protocol deviations excluding subjects 
fr
om the Per-protocol analysis set will be defined in the SAP.  
PK
/PD Population  – The PK/PD population includes a subset of subjects from the TransCon 
hGH
 cohort who attended Visit 3 as planned and from whom blood sampling was performed at 
time points predose, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 hours postdose. 
13.4. S tatistical Analyses 
Details of applicable statistical methods will be given in a SAP.  Annualized height velocity at 
W
eek 52 of TransCon hGH will be compared to that of daily hGH, by a non-inferiority 
c
omparison with a margin of 2.0 cm. Once non-inferiority in annualized HV is established, 
subsequent hypothesis testing for superiority will be conducted.  If TransCon hGH is superior 
compared to daily hGH in annualized HV, subsequent hypothesis testing for superiority will be 
c
onducted in the proportion of patients within 0-2.0 SDS in IGF-1. 
Summary statistics (including but not limited to: arithmetic mean, standard deviation, standard 
error of the mean, minimum value, median, maximum value, number of non-missing values) will 
be presente
d for continuous variables (absolute values at each time point and changes from 
ba
seline if applicable).  Frequency statistics (counts and percentages) will be presented for 
c
ategorical variables.  Where appropriate, the presentation of results will include shift tables, 
plot
s or confidence intervals. 
Data from all clinical assessments will be listed and, where appropriate, summarized by cohort 
using descriptive statistics.  
If any deviation to the planned statistical analysis occurs, it will be addressed and described in 
the clinical study report. 
13.4.1 Trial Subjects and Demographics 
13.4.1.1 Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Assessments made at Screening and baseline visits will be summarized by treatment group.  
These assessments will include demographic characteristics and other relevant parameters, as 
well as the stratification factors: age (˃3 to ≤6 and ˃6 years), peak GH levels in stimulation tests 
(≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL), and gender (male/female).  By-treatment summaries will serve to 
identify imbalances between the treatment groups at baseline.  Summary tables will be provided 
for
 the full analysis subset (FAS), the PP analysis set and for the safety analysis subset (SAS) by 
means of descriptive statistics and frequency tables, where appropriate. 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 90 of 117 13.4.2
 Exposure and Compliance 
For each subject, the individual extent of exposure will be calculated in terms of:  
• Tota l duration of treatment  
• Total dose 
• Total dose adjusted to body weight  
These variables will be listed by subject, and sorted by treatment group and subject number.  
Summary statis
tics per treatment group will be tabulated overall. 
Study drug compliance will be calculated as specified in the S AP.  It will be listed by subject and 
pre
sented for the SAS set by means of summary statistics by treatment group. 
13.4.3 Previous and Concomitant Therapy 
Previous and current medication will be summarized by counts and percentages, overall and per 
WHO-DRL category.  This table will include those medications reported on the “Previous and 
concomitant medication” eCRF page, which have a stop date prior to the date of the first 
administration of the study drug.  
Previous and current non-medicinal therapy will be handled and tabulated in the same way as 
specified above for previous and current medication. 
13.4.4 Efficacy Analyses 
The
 efficacy endpoints are listed in Sections 13.1.1 and  13.1.2.  The primary endpoint, 
a
nnualized height velocity at Week 52, will be compared between TransCon hGH treatment and 
daily hGH treatment, by a non-inferiority comparison with a non-inferiority margin of 
2.0 cm/y ear , followed by a test of superiority if non-inferiority is established. 
A MMRM
 will be the primary analysis to evaluate annualized HV at week 52.  The model will 
include base
line age, peak GH level of the stimulation test, and gender as fixed effects.  Least 
square means will be de
rived and presented together with 95%-confidence intervals by treatment 
group.  
For the primary efficacy analysis, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the 
difference
 in least square means between the 2 treatment groups [TransCon hGH treatment 
minus daily h
GH] at Week 52.  If the lower confidence bound is >-2.0 cm, non-inferiority is 
demonstrated in terms of effectiveness.  If the lower confidence bound is > 0, superiority is 
established. 
All obse
rved data inc
luding post-discontinuation data will be used for the primary analysis.  
Missing values will be imputed as follows for subjects who prematurely discontinued: From all 
subjects in the
 same treatment group who also prematurely discontinued treatment but had a 
height measurement at Week 52, annualized height change from the last measurement before 
discontinuation to Week 52 will be calculated.  Missing height values at Week 52 will then be 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 91 of 117 im
puted by adding the mean change (standardized to the corresponding period between last 
height measure
ment and Week 52) to the last height measurement obtained.  Based on the 
imputed height value a
t Week 52 the corresponding imputed annualized height velocity will be 
calculated.  
The prima
ry efficacy analysis will be performed in the Intent- to-treat set.  A sensitivity analysis 
will be provided for the Per-protocol set. 
For the continuous secon
dary efficacy endpoints (height velocity at further visits, change in 
height SDS, serum IGF-1 levels and IGFBP-3 levels, IGF-1 SDS, IGFBP-3 SDS), similar 
MMRM models will be
 used.  Two sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
differen
ce in least square means between the 2 treatment groups. 
The rate of subjec
ts achieving normalization of serum IGF-1 SDS will be calculated by treatment 
group and visit
.  A test of superiority in proportion of patients within 0-2.0 IGF-1 SDS will be 
conducted.  A procedure to control for familywise type-1 error of multiple hypothesis testing will 
be specified in the
 SAP.  
In general, for secondary endpoints, missing values will be imputed by a method fully described 
in the SAP.  Moreover, sensitivity analyses concerning missing values for the primary endpoint 
will be describe
d in the SAP. 
All efficacy e
ndpoints will be summarized descriptively by treatment group.  Additional 
descriptive summaries may be added by treatment group and randomization stratum, separately 
for all 3 randomization strata.  
Figures will
 be created to display the time course of continuous efficacy endpoints by treatment 
group. 
13.4.4.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
The PK/PD endpoints are listed in Section 13.1.4. 
P
K/PD parameters will be calculated for all subjects in the PK/PD subset, using WinNonlin 
Enterprise Float, Kinetica or SAS. 
PK parameters will be derived from a PK/PD subset of TransCon hGH subjects from TransCon 
hGH, hGH and PEG lev
els versus time profiles. 
PD parameters will be derived from a PK/PD subset of TransCon hGH subjects from IGF-1 and 
IGFBP-3 levels versus time profiles both on untransformed and baseline corrected data.  
Calculation of IGF-1 SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS parameters, will be performed as applicable 
(untransformed and baseline corrected). 
Details concerning calculations to be performed and PK/PD parameters to be estimated will be 
described in the SAP.

ssment of serum exposure of TransCon hGH (Cohort 1), hGH (both Cohorts) and PEG 
(Cohort 1, V1-V6; Cohort 2, V1), as well as IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (both Cohorts) at single time 
points during Visits 1 through to Visit 6 will be performed, and detailed in the SAP. 
13.4.5 Safety An
alyses 
The safety endpoints of the trial are listed in Section 13.1.3 .  The assessment of safety will be 
ba
sed mainly on the frequency of AEs, frequency of antibody development, serum IGF-1 levels 
and the number of laboratory values that fall outside of laboratory specified reference ranges.  
Other safety data (eg, vital signs, special tests, etc.) will be considered as appropriate. 
Safety 
endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  AEs will be listed by cohort 
and subject numbe
r.  AEs will be tabulated by cohort, body system, severity and the relationship 
to the study drug
.  Changes in laboratory variables will be displayed on shift tables and through 
the tabulation of summary
 statistics for each variable.  Other information collected (eg, severity 
or relatedness t
o the study drug) will be listed as appropriate. 
If appropriate, laboratory and/or ECG data will be summarized by presenting shift tables using 
extended normal ranges (baseline to most extreme post baseline value), by presenting summary 
statistics of raw data (means, medians, standard deviations, ranges) and change from baseline 
values and by flagging of notable values in data listings. 
Data from other tests (eg, blood pressure or vital signs) will be listed, notable values will be 
flagged, and a
ny other information collected will be listed as appropriate.  Summary statistics 
will be given whe
re appropriate.  
In addition, the number and percentage of subjects developing anti-hGH binding and neutralizing 
antibodies and developing or increasing anti-PEG antibodies (TransCon hGH cohort only) will 
be summarized by cohort.  
Local tolerability will be summarized based on the investigator’s (and subject’s/subject’s 
parents/legal guardians) assessment of pain, erythema, bruising, itching, and swelling. 
The safety analysis will be based upon the SAS subset. 
13.4.6 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned. 
14. TRIAL CONDUCT 
14.1. Site Initiation 
Prior to participation, investigational sites and investigators will be evaluated for appropriate 
qualifications and ability to execute the trial.  Each investigational site must undergo appropriate 
training on the tria

in an initiation visit or Investigator Meeting.  Training must take place before any subjects are 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential  
TransCon hGH CT- 301 
12 September 2017 Amendment 1 Page 93 of 117 e
nrolled at that site.  Initiation visits and Investigator Meetings will include but may not be 
limited to review of GCP guidelines, study drug preparation and administration procedures, data 
collection requirements, and subject eligibility requirements. 
14.2. S creen Failures 
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria at any point during the Screening period are 
defined as Screening failures.  The reasons (may be multiple) for each Screening failure will be 
re
corded in the appropriate eCRF page.  
Re-screening is permitted.  Re - screening of subjects with an out of range cortisol and/or thyroid 
hormone level (inadequate replacement therapy for the insufficiency of other 
hypothalamo-pituitary axes) may be allowed ≥3 months after replacement treatment adjustment.  
Individual blood draws may be repeated for the following reasons, but not limited to: eg, ruling 
out an a
nalytical error, sample handling or shipment issues, conflicting or inconsistent subject 
data, etc.  The decision on re-screening will be made on a case by case basis by the Medical 
Ex
pert.  All Screening procedures may be repeated.  Re -screened subjects will receive a new 
Sc
reening number. 
14.3. M aintenance of Screening Logs 
Procedures for maintenance of screening logs are discussed in the Trial Manual. 
14.4. Dat a Handling and Record Keeping 
14.4.1 Data Management

subsequent reports.  The eCRF must be used to capture all the data collected, and must be kept 
current t
o reflect the subject status during the course of the trial.  Only a subject identification 
number
 and subject initials will be used to identify the subject.  The investigator must keep a 
se
parate log of subject names and medical record numbers (or other personal identifiers). 
The trial will use an Internet-based remote data entry system to collect the clinical trial data at 
the inve
stigational sites.  The system complies with 21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 Good Clinical 
P
ractice.  The system will be used to enter, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit data.

 Auditing Procedures 
I
n addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
audit may be initiated by the Sponsor.  The investigator has to ensure that the subjects/subject’s 
pa
rents/legal guardians are aware of and consent that personal information may be reviewed 
during the data verification process as a part of monitoring/auditing by the Sponsor, properly 
authorized agents of the Sponsor or subject to inspection by competent authorities.  In addition, 
participation and personal information is treated as strictly confidential to the extent the 
applicable law permits and not publicly available.  The purpose of audits and inspections is to 
e
valuate compliance with the principles of GCP, international and local regulatory requirements 
and the trial Protocol.  The audit or inspection may include, for example, a review of all source 
doc
uments, drug records, original clinic medical notes, some or all of the facilities used in the 
trial. 
The audits may be conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s selected agent in accordance with 
Sponsor’s SOP or SOPs of the selected and properly authorized agent.  A competent authority 
ma
y also wish to conduct an inspection during the trial or after its completion.  If an inspection is 
re
quested by a competent authority, the investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately that 
this request has been made.  The investigator and his/her institution will permit all monitoring, 
a
udits, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source data. 
14.6. L aboratory Quality Standards 
Laboratory tests or evaluations described in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with 
quality laboratory standards as described in the SOPs of the local and central laboratories.  Some 
blood s
amples may be used for laboratory test validation.  
The laboratories will provide a list of the reference ranges for applicable analyses before trial 
start.  These will be held in the investigator site file and the trial master file.  The methods 
employe
d for each assay should be available on request.  Any change in the laboratory, 
proc
edures, reference values, etc. during the trial must be notified promptly to the Sponsor.  The 
l
aboratories may also be audited by the Sponsor or by competent authorities. 
14.7. T rial Termination or Completion 
The investigator should notify the IEC/IRB/HREC in writing of the completion or early 
termination of the trial.  On trial completion or termination, applicable regulatory reporting 
re
quirements will be followed.  The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trial at any time 
for
 any reason.  
14.8. Chan ges to the Protocol 
Changes in any portion of this protocol must be documented in the form of an amendment from 
the Sponsor and must be approved by the investigational site’s IEC/IRB/HREC before the 
amendment is implemented.  However, in the event of apparent immediate hazard to a subject, a 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S Confidential

1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This study will evaluate the content validity of using a survey to quantify patient 
preferences at the point -of-care for newly -diagnosed patients with hematologic 
malignancies. Our primary hypothesis is that by identifying the strength of patient 
preferences for outcomes with this survey , clinicians will be able to improve goal-
concordant care by aligning clinical recommendations with patients’ preferences.  We will conduct cognitive interviews with 20 patients  to establish the content 
validity of the survey. We will use purposive sampling based on the results of the survey to create two groups of patients (n=10 each) for the  cognitive interviews. 
We plan to recruit 50 total patients to complete the survey to ensure adequate 
recruitment in each group. Secondary outcomes will evaluate acceptability and 
feasibility of administrating the survey. The information we obtain from these participants will be used to refine the survey. Interviews with oncologists and palliative care specialists (up to 10) will inform implementation.   
1.2 Background 
 
Treatment decisions in oncology are increasingly preference sensitive. Cancer patients differ substantially in their preferences for achieving various outcomes.
1–3 
For example in AML, we  have shown that some patients prefer to maximize their 
overall chance of long -term survival and are willing to endure a high burden of side 
effects or a lengthy hospitalization for this opportunity; others prefer to minimize treatment effects in order to maintain their quality of life.
1 As more therapies are 
becoming available across oncology, this preference heterogeneity suggests that treatment decisions will increasingly become preference sensitive —ideal therapy 
choice will depend on patients’ preferences for treatment outcomes.  
Routine shared decision -making (SDM)  is currently inadequate to reliably capture 
patient preferences.
4–8 Multiple systematic reviews have demonstrated consistent 
discordance after routine SDM between physician perceptions of what matters most to patients and patients’ stated preferences.
8,9 A recent evaluation of a clearly 
preference -sensitive decision in oncology demonstrated that about half the time 
oncologists did not elicit patient preferences.10 Analyses of the quality of SDM in 
leukemia , for example,  demonstrate a high rate of patient dissatisfaction with 
communication and very poor patient -provider concordance on goals and 
prognosis.11–13 As a stark example of patient -provider discordance following 
routine SDM, 80% of leukemia patients receiving symptom -directed therapy 
believe they are likely to be cured, when less than 5% will be.14 Palliative care 
clinicians can serve to improve these outcomes, but often have limited bandwidth to see most patients.  
Preference elicitation instruments can capture patient preferences, however 
fundamental challenges remain to their implementation in complex clinical care. Numerous stakeholders including the FDA strongly advocate for patient 
LCCC 2136  CONFIDENTIAL

Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
2 preferences to be integrated into SDM and clinical care.15–18 Preference elicitation 
instruments that were originally developed in economics to understand consumer 
behavior are increasingly being applied in healthcare to identify outcomes that are most valued by stakeholders. These instruments allow researchers to u nderstand 
the relative importance of a group of items (attributes) to a population based on a series of choice tasks.
19–21 In clinical trials evaluating dichotomized decisions 
where the risks and benefits of treatment options are well -established, these 
instruments have been shown to improve patient satisfaction, increase high -
quality decisions, and align treatment choice wit h risk.2,22–25 Fundamental 
questions remain, however, about how to assess and apply preference data to complex SDM in advanced cancer patients where risks and benefits of available options vary for each patient.
26–28 Further, substantial methodological barriers 
exist in assessing individual preferences over time and pose a critical challenge to longitudinal goal -concordant care. To address these critical gaps, we will use 
treatment decisions for patients with hematologic malignancies as the context for 
developing generalizable strategies to improve the goal -concordance of complex 
treatment decisions in palliative care/oncology.   
1.3 Purpose and Rationale 
In this study, we will recruit older (> 60 ye
 ars) participants with newly -diagnosed 
hematologic malignancies to complete the BWS survey  and provide quantitative 
and qualitative feedback to validate the survey. Interviews with a sample of 
oncologists and palliative care physicians will be completed to identify barriers 
and facilitators to implementation of the survey into routine clinical care.  
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS   
2.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the content validity of using a BWS survey to quantify the 
preferences of older patients with hematologic malignancies  at the point-of- care.   
Content V alidity : Content validity will be assessed in cognitive interviews with 
participants. We will first assess the respondent's comprehension of the 
questionnaire and its items in relation to their intended meaning. We will identify 
any formatting or wording difficulties with the survey itself. Next, we will evaluate participants comprehension of the content by use of probing questions to evaluate if other important aspects of treatment decision -making were absent in 
the survey.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
1. To report the acceptability of the BWS survey to patients. This will be defined 
as participants answering agree/strongly agree to “I found the survey acceptable to clarify my preferences”.

4 - Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent  
 
Patients will become eligible for enrollment upon pathologic confirmation.   Patients will be eligible for enrollment for 28 days after confirmatory diagnosis or until the start of chemotherapy.  
 Chemotherapy will not include hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide, or cytarabine if used only for emergent cytoreduction. 
 
Health care clinicians  must be employed in hematology/oncology or palliative 
care as a nurse navigator, advanced practitioner, and/or physician. Together, these participants will be referred to as healthcare clinicians .  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 All subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at baseline will be excluded from study participation: 
3.2.1 Dementia, altered mental status, or psychiatric condition that would 
prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or participation in the discrete choice experiment .  
3.2.2 Significant medical conditions, as assessed by the investigators, that would substantially increase the burden on the patient to complete study assessments (such as multiorgan failure, respiratory failure, or other critical illness).  
4.0 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Schema  
 
4.1.1 This study will evaluate the validity of using this out(BWS) survey to quantify patient preferences at the point- of-care and the potential effectiveness of the 
survey to improve goal-concordant care. Our primary hypothesis is that by identifying the strength of patient preferences for outcomes with this survey , 
clinicians will be able to improve goal-concordant care by aligning clinical recommendations with patients’ preferences.  
Within this study we aim to evaluate the content validity, acceptability, and 
potential effectiveness of the BWS survey to improve goal- concordant care. 
Using the BWS survey, we will collect the preferences of 50 older (>60 years) newly -diagnosed hematologic  cancer patients facing treatment decisions and 
evaluate content and construct validity of the survey, patient acceptability, and 
LCCC 2136  CONFIDENTIAL

Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
5 effect of preference elicitation on patient -reported quality of treatment decisions 
(effectiveness). Qualitative interviews involving cognitive interview questions 
(n=20) w ith patients  will further explore the content validity of the survey and 
potential effect of the surveys on goal- concordant care. Interviews with palliative 
care clinicians, and oncologists will explore barriers and facilitators of implementation.  
We also aim to describe how patients’ preferences change over time and explore 
potential relationships between patients’ preferences and clinical outcomes. W e 
will collect the preferences of the patients with hematologic  cancer every other 
week for 3 months (repeat sampling up 5 times) and then every 3 months thereafter for up to 2 years . We will describe changes in preferences at each 
timepoint. An exploratory, hypothesis- generating analysis will evaluate 
correlations between preferences and standard clinical outcomes (e.g. treatment intensity and response), symptoms (collected with the PRO- CTCAE), health -
related quality of life (EQ -5D), and decisional satisfaction to provide direction for 
future studies.  
 
4.1.2 Trial Schema outline (patients)  
 
4.2 Duration of Study  
The recruitment is planned to last for up to 24 months. Patients will complete the 
survey instruments up to 6 times over 3 months  (Longitudinal Assessments)  and 
then every 3 months for up to 2 years ( 7 times) (Extended Assessments) . Patients 
will complete q ualitative i nterviews within 3 months of treatment decision . 
Clinicians  will be interviewed once over the course of the study.

6 4.3 Study Details  
4.3.1 The study will recruit 50 total participants and conduct qualitative interviews on a 
subset of 20 participants.   
4.3.2 Pilot testing: The study team will review the inpatient census and clinic schedule 
to evaluate for potentially eligible patients. The study team will confirm patient 
eligibility with the primary oncologist or principal investigator. Eligible patients will be sequentially  approached to be recruited to this study until 50 patients are 
recruited who complete BWS survey.  
Upon enrollment, the study team will record information about patients obtained 
from the patient or the medical record including gender, age, lab values including complete metabolic profile, complete and diffentiated blood counts, albumin, LDH,  a1c, cholesterol levels, hematopathology reports, clinician- determined 
performance status (Karnofsky and ECOG), and comorbidities present. Demographic information such as age, sex, and zip code will be obtained. 
Once consented, patients will complete initial study questionnaires within PRO 
Core either remotely if able or in -person with the assistance of study staff prior to 
a clinic visit. For patients who decline to participate in the study, reasons for refusal will be anonymously collected to examine the iss ue of selection bias as 
well as to assist with determination of feasibility.  
 After the clinic visit, patients will be prompted to complete the first longitudinal assessment  via PRO Core.  This will be available for 7 days. The treating 
oncologist who saw the patient will be prompted to fill out an assessment via 
email. Clinicians  may receive multiple reminder emails to complete the survey to 
improve completion rates. We will collect provider responses within 2 weeks of initial patient survey.    
 Following, every 2 weeks ( up to 5 times) participants will be prompted in PRO 
Core to complete the longitudinal assessment survey . Then, the extended 
assessment s urvey will be delivered by PRO Core every 3 months for up to 2 
years (7 times).   Retention:  
 
Multiple strategies will be utilized to retain patients on study.  
1. Provide Detailed Rationale of the Study and Study Brochure : Upon enrollment 
participants will be informed of the rationale of the study: to help understand what is most important to each patient to tailor therapy to patient preferences. Patients will be informed that their responses will help adapt the survey that they will receive to help future patients. They will be given printed information about the study if recruitment is done in person.

7 2. Training: Each patient will receive training on how to complete the 
assessments in PRO Core. This will take place during enrol lment (either in person 
or remotely).  3. Reminders to complete the initial post- visit assessments : The day after the 
treatment encounter, patients will receive an automated reminder to complete the assessments.  4. Reminders to complete the follow- up assessments: Staff will direct them to 
complete the assessment remotely via a secure link sent by email. PRO Core will send patients a reminder daily for up to 2 days in case of non -response. Study 
staff will call patients if no response.  5. Reminders in case of non -response : Study staff will call patients if no response.  
6. Support to complete assessments : Staff will assist participants to log -on to PRO 
Core and to complete assessments if needed.  
7. Compensation: Participants will be provided with a $10 gift card following completion of each longitudinal and extended assessment.   
 
4.3.3 Qualitative Interviews: Based on responses to the survey, 20 patients will be selected to complete interview s. Patients will complete an initial interview and a 
follow -up interview.  
The study team will review patients who have consented to the study and confirm eligibility with the primary oncologist or principal investigator. Study staff will call eligible patients to participate in the interviews until the number of desired participants has been reached (n=20) according to the inclusion criteria above and recruitment goals  below.  
 We will use purposive sampling to stratify participants based on the results of the BWS survey . We will stratify into two groups of 10 participants each:  
 1. Those participants who believe that “Living longer” is the most important attribute,   and   2. Those participants who believe another attribute is the most important attribute.  
Staff will setup a time to interview eligible participants. Interviews will be scheduled within 14 days of the treatment decision (+ 14 days). A reminder email and/or phone call will be sent to participants the day before and the day of the interview. If participants do not respond during the pre- scheduled time, staff will 
reschedule the interview/reminders. Participants will be provided with a $ 25 gift 
card following completion of the interview.

8 Follow-up interviews will be around 3 months after the initial interview (+  30 
days). Interviews will follow the same format as the initial interview. Participants 
will be provided with a $25  gift card following completion of the interview.    
 Interviews will also be completed with up to 5 oncology clinicians  and up to 5 
palliative care clinicians.  Clinicians will be referred to the study staff by the 
principal investigator. Interviews will take place over the course of 1 year and will not be time dependent upon patient enrollment. Participants will be provided with a $25 gift card following completion of the interview.    
4.3.4 Participant Recruitment and Stratification  
For the pilot testing, r ecru
 itment of patients will be stratified into  the following 3 
groups:  Aggres
sive lymphomas: 20 patients   
Acute leukemias: 20 patients Myeloma, Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (requiring treatment), chronic myeloid 
leukemia: 10  patients  
 We will target a population that exceeds the following diversity thresholds: 30% 
non-white race, 50% female, 25% rural.  For the qualitative interviews , recru
 itment of patients will be stratified into the 
following 2 groups:  1. Those pa
rticipants who believe that “Living longer” is the most important 
attribute (n=10),   and   2. Those participants who believe another attribute is the most important attribute (n=10).   Recruitment of clinicians  will be as follows:  
Oncology clinicians (including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurse navigators) : 2-5  
Palliative Care clinicians (including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurse navigators) : 2-5  
   
4.3.5 The BWS survey     
Priorities are how people value and rate the importance of multiple goals. In 
comparison, patient preferences reflect choices that patients make among several alternatives based on the expected benefit they get from each alternative. BWS  
surveys, a type of  conjoint analysis, are one of several methods to measure 
LCCC 2136  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Richardson, Daniel   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
9 preferences. They are emerging as potentially important tools to elicit preferences 
of patients in the clinical setting.20 BWS survey s involve asking participants a 
series of questions where they choose one attribute  that is best and one attribute  
that is worst. In this survey, we will be asking patients to choose between the 
following 7 attributes:  
a. Maintaining usual activities  
b. Living longer c. Avoiding becoming dependent upon others 
d. Avoiding short- term side effects  
e. Avoiding long- term side effects  
f. Avoiding hospitalizations 
g. Avoiding high out-of-pocket costs   We will be using a BWS survey that is adapted from a BWS survey we used to capture the preferences of patients with AML. Sampling 832 patients with the 
BWS survey, we illustrated that patients had the strongest concerns about treatment outcomes in psychosocial and physical domains.
32 Patients were most 
worried about dying from their disease, the long- term side effects of treatment, 
and becoming a burden to others.  
 
4.3.6  Longitudinal Assessments  
 
Participants will complete longitudinal assessments every 2 weeks (x 5). These assessments will include the BWS survey, CollaboRATE, WIWI, Decisional conflict scale, EQ -5D- 5L, distress thermometer, and 7 items from the PRO -
CTCAE. These assessments will begin after a treatment discussion with their oncology clinician.   The first longitudinal assessment will include a follow -up questionnaire that will 
assess patient acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the BWS to improve treatment decisions.  
 Participants will be given a $10 electronic gift card for each assessment.  
 
4.3.7 Extended Assessments  
After completing the longitudinal assessments (x 6), participants will complete 
extended assessments every 3 months for the next 2 years (up to 7 assessments). 
These extended assessments will include the same questionnaires as the longitudinal assessments.

10 At 1 year on the study (the third extended assessment), participants will complete 
the 1 year questionnaire.   Participants will be given a $10 electronic gift card for each assessment.  
4.3.8 Qualitative Interview s 
 Patients:  
The qualitative interview will establish content validity of the BWS by cognitive interviews that will explore patients understanding of the content of the BWS. 
Specific domains to be covered will include:  
• Cognitive interview to evaluate patient understanding of each of the 
questions asked within the BWS  
• subjective value of potential outcomes including attributes elicited in 
BWS  
• patient understanding of how preferences influenced treatment decisions including elicitation of important factors in the decision (if applicable),  
• expected outcomes,  
• additional attributes not included in the BWS, and 
• preferences for potential interventions to improve preference elicitation and decision-making. 
 In addition to open ended questions as part of the interview, patients  will 
complete a digit span test to test working memory and recall.  
 The follow- up qualitative interview will cover the same content as the first 
interview in addition to asking participants to reflect upon how their experience has changed over the time period between interviews.   Interviews with clinicians  will explore barriers and facilitators of implementation 
of surveys to capture patient values and preferences. There is no follow- up 
interview with clinicians . Clinicians  will not complete the Digit span test.  
 Interviews  will be recorded to allow for qualitative analysis. Transcripts of the 
interviews will be made. The interview s should take about 30 minutes to 
complete.  Following the interview a codebook will be created with emerging 
themes to allow for qualitative analysis similar to previous studies.

11 also include the PROMIS Cognitive Function 8a short form (8 items) to assess the 
perceived cognitive impairment of patients.   
4.3.9.2 Decisional conflict scale  (DCS) :  
Decisional conflict will be evaluated with the validated survey measure decisional 
conflict scale.31,33 Patients will complete the subscales of decision uncertainty (3 
items) and perceived effective decision making (4 items).    
4.3.9.3 EQ-5D- 5L:  
Health -related quality of life will be evaluated with the validated survey measure 
EQ-5D- 5L.34 This is a 5 question survey.  
4.3.9.4 PRO -CTCAE:  
Symptoms will be evaluated with the validated survey measure PRO -CTCAE.35 
Patients will complete the following 7 items: pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, appetite.    
4.3.9.5 PROMIS emotional distress short -form 8a 
The PROMIS emotional distress short -form 8a is a 8 question survey developed 
to understand current emotional distress among patients and validated in numerous settings.  
4.3.9.6 Follow- up Questionnaire  
Patient acceptability and preliminary efficacy (both defined above) will be assessed in this 2- item study- specific questionnaire.   
 
4.3.9.7 1 year Questionnaire  
Patient acceptability and preliminary efficacy (both defined above) will be assessed in this study -specific questionnaire. Additionally, patients will be given 
open ended questions reflecting on how the BWS survey influenced the treatment decisions with their providers.    
4.3.9.8 CollaboRATE:  
Preference clarity will be evaluated with the validated survey measure CollaboRATE.
30 This is a 3 question survey.  
4.3.9.9 WIWI 
The “was it worth it” (WIWI) patient questionnaire is a subjective tool to assess a patient’s decisional regret related specifically to the chemotherapy decision .

12 will use two questions to avoid overlap with other questionnaires: Was it 
worthwhile for you to undergo chemotherapy? And If you had to do it over, would you undergo chemotherapy again? 
4.3.9.10 Decision Regret Scale (DRS):  
Decisional regret will be evaluated with the validated survey measure DRS .
29 This 
is a 5 -item questionnaire that has been validated as an important outcome measure 
of preference/value clarification measures.    
 
4.3.9.11 Digit Span Test:  
The forward and backward assessments of the Digit Span test are subsets of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and when used separately, are considered validated measures of working memory.
39,40 Participants are assessed on their ability to 
repeat strings of numbers, increasing in length by one, until an error occurs on the reiteration of the string, or they reach a string length equal to 9. Participants will run through all forward strings before moving to the digit span backwards test, in which they will be asked to repeat strings of numbers in reverse order.   
4.3.9.12 Provider questionnaire  
This survey will include 3 questions to capture treatment intent (curative vs. palliative), provider’s assessment of which outcomes are most important to the patient, and outcomes most important to treatment decision making.  
  
4.4 Expected Risks  
4.4.1 Physical Risks  
No physical risks are expected with this study. 
4.4.2 Emotional Risks  
Some questions in the patient questionnaires or  interviews  could create emotional 
distress or confusion. Patients will be instructed that the questionnaires are for research purposes only and any problem or symptom should also be reported to their physician or nurse.  
4.4.3 Patient Confidentiality  
We do not anticipate any breach of confidentiality. Any information about the participants obtained from this research will be kept as confidential as possible. All data obtained will be stored on a secure server.

Any UPIRSO that occurs during the conduct of this study and that meets all three
  
criteria  listed in 6.1 must be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web -based 
rep
orting system.   The PI w ill also report any UPIRSO to the PCRC and the 
NINR. The PI will be responsible for assessing developments in the literature and results of related studies by conducting a literature review once during the grant period to identify relevant information that may impact the safety of participants or on the ethi cs for the research study.   
 
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Design 
This is a mixed methods pilot study designed to evaluate the content validity of 
the BWS survey .  
7.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Our primary objective is to establish content validity of the BWS survey. Based 
on established guidelines, 7 -10 participants are needed to establish content 
validity  of survey items  in cognitive interviews .41–43 As we will be stratifying 
patients  for cognitive interviews  into 2 groups , we will have 10 participants per 
stratification  to ensure saturation  in both.  
 
Based on our prior data, we anticipate that we will have a 3:1 split between patients who value living longer most and those who value another attribute most. Therefore, we will need to recruit at least 40 patients to have 10 patients who value another attribute most to participate in  cognitive interviews. Accounting for 
variability and drop out, we will plan to recruit 50 patients total to be able to recruit 10 patients in this group.  10 clinicians  will provide for saturation for qualitative interviews.  
 This study was not designed to be powered to evaluate secondary endpoints or exploratory endpoints.

16  
We expect to accrue up to 50 patients over the time of the study. We see over 500 new patients with hematologic malignancies per year within the division of hematology.  
7.3 Data Analysis Plans  
 
7.3.1 Primary Aim: Content Validity  
The primary  aim of this study is to evaluate the content validity  of the BWS 
survey. This will be established by mixed methods. We will conduct cognitive interviews with patients in accordance with FDA guidance on patient-reported outcomes measurement development  to evaluate patient understanding of each 
concept within the BWS and explore other areas that were important but were not included in the survey.
41 We will produce a cognitive interview summary based 
on published guidance to determine content validity from the interviews.41  
Additional interview questions from the qualitative interview will be used to establish the importance of individual attributes to patients using interpretive 
phenomenological analysis (IPA)
44 and provide additional support to BWS 
content validity. Results from the ranking exercise (embedded within  the BWS 
survey) will also be reported. To integrate data from each source, we  will follow a  
sequential  explanatory approach: we  will produce narrative summaries of each 
aspect of the critical determinants identified in interviews followed by a summary of both quantitative and qualitative data. Together, these data will provide convergent support of the content validity of the BWS survey. 
 
7.3.2 Secondary Aims  
Patient acceptability:  
We will conclude the BWS is acceptable if  > 70% o
 f patients (35/50) report that it 
is acceptable. Hypothesizing 80%, the exact binomial 95% CI will be 66.3-90.0%.  
Preliminary efficacy:  
We will 
conclude the tool is potentially efficacious  if efficacy  (defined as 
participants answering “moderately effective/very effective” to the question: 
“How effective was the survey to help you and your doctor choose a treatment 
that was consistent with your goals?”)  is reached in >50% of patients. Estimating 
5-7% missing data from enrollment to initial longitudinal  questionnaire (from 
other PRO assessments in advanced cancer patients45,46) and hypothesizing a rate 
of 75%, the exact binomial 95% CI will be 60.0-86.6%.  Preliminary completion rates:  
 
LCCC 2136  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Richardson, Daniel   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
17 Frequencies will be reported  at each time point.  Completion rate out of the 
original 50 participants will be reported at each month with exact binomial 95% 
CIs with reasonable precision, no wider than ±14.5%. Reasons for dropout will be summarized as available.  Associations of baseline patient characteristics with completion rates will be explored using Wilcoxon Rank sum and Kruskal- Wallis 
tests. 
 
 
7.3.3 Exploratory Aims   
Repeated measures analyses, using generalized linear mixed models, will be used to describe change in preferences over time and the relationship to clinical characteristics with a particular focus on evaluating the influence of response (e.g. remission) on  preferences. Performance of the BWS survey will be evaluated 
including convergent validity, within-set dominated pairs, and attribute dominance.
21,47 We will use frequency analysis to describe the strength of 
aggregate preferences for outcomes, and differences by age, race, gender, and clinical response.
19 We will perform exploratory, hypothesis-generating analyses 
to compare within -person changes in preferences across timepoints, the relative 
stability of betas for attributes over time, and explore associations between preferences, decisional outcomes
8,29–31, patient- reported symptoms ,35 health -
related quality of life34, and provider perceptions. These analyses are exploratory 
as our sample size is relatively small.  These exploratory analyses will inform 
future studies . 
 
7.4 Data Management /Audit  
Data will be stored on a shared, Oracle-Based framework which provides a highly secure IT environment, utilizing a secure authentication mechanism, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) system. This security mechanism supports encryption in both directions (to and from the website) across all devices including mobile devices such as smartphones. Backup files of all data will be included on this server. Only those trained to work with sensitive data will have access to the server. This project will have a speci fic folder on the server that will require 
password access for all users.  
 Data collection will be done by the study team. Study personnel will input data from patient interview or chart review into the database.   The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of subject safety in this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

18 The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of subject safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Data sources included in this study will include data from medical records, questionnaires, and audio recordings. Data will be extracted from medical records by trained clinical research assistants and placed in a study -
specific database per the protocol. Questionnaires will be delivered electronically. Data will be automatically transferre d to the database. Audio recordings will be 
produced during the qualitative interviews and will be transcribed by trained personnel. The transcripts will be transferred electronically into the secure database. Data will undergo periodic review by the PI and the project manager for integrity.  
 Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual.  These meetings will include the investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 
As an investigator initiated study, this trial will also be audited by the Lineberger Cancer Center audit committee every six or twelve months, depending on the participation of affiliate sites.  
 Once complete, data will be de-identified and transferred to the Palliative Care Research Consortium  (PCRC) repository for dissemination.  
8.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
   
LCCC 2136  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Richardson, Daniel   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
19 Before recruitment and enrollment into this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regula tions. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB- approved consent form.  
 Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
8.2 Required Documentation 
Before the study can be initiated, the following documentation must be provided 
to the Clinical Protocol Office (CPO) at the University of North Carolina.  
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent 
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and any 
associate investigators who will be involved in the study  
• A copy of the IRB- approved consent form  
8.3 Registration Procedures 
Patient enrollment will be tracked in a secure database as outlined above.  
8.4 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, 
and well- being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall 
be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.   
8.4.1 Emergency Modifications 
UNC investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol 
to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior UNC IRB approval.  
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB modification form must be completed by UNC Research Personnel within five (5) business days of making the change.   
8.4.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
We will not allow single patient exceptions in the study. Any request to enroll a single subject who does not meet all the eligibility criteria of this study requires the approval of the UNC Principal Investigator and the UNC IRB.

Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
20 8.4.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an 
IRB approved protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs 
• Has n
o substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan 
or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if t he variance meets 
any of the following criteria:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research part
icipants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or University policies.  
 If a deviation or violation occurs please follow the guidelines below: 
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore
®  (or 
other appropriate database set up for the study), and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by UNC personnel within one 
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to report UPIRSO.    Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSO ): 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by UNC’s IRB (see section 6.1) must be reported by the Study Coordinator using the 
IRB’s web -based reporting system. The PI will be responsible for reporting 
UPIRSO to the PCRC and the NINR.     
8.5 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and documented by the Principal Investigator at UNC.  It should also be noted that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential ris k to the patient, a revised consent form might be 
required.

Version/Date  1.0/Feb 26, 2021   Health Services Research  September 2014 Version  
 
21  
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation.   
8.6 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor- Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
 Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial must be retained by the study investigator.  In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region.  In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study. 
8.7 Obligations of Investigators 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the 
site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally oversee ing the treatment of all study patients.  The Principal Investigator must 
assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.  
 The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms. Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit verification of proper entry of data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final signature to verify the accura cy of the data. 
 
8.8 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of subject safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the UNC Lineberger Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

22 Monitoring Procedures:  
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual.  
These meetings will include the investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these 
meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).    The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the study once the protocol is finalized. Based on the “minimal risk” nature of the study (behavioral, non- therapeutic trial), it is anticipated that the DSMC will review the 
study on an annual basis. The UNC PI will be responsible for submitting the following information for review: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of subjects treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literatu re that may 
affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by memo to the UNC PI, PRC, and the UNC IRB and DSMB. Summaries  will also be made available for review 
by the PCRC and the National Institute of Nursing Research ( NINR) . The PI will 
be responsible for submitting summaries to the PCRC and the NINR. In accordance with our institutional guidelines, studies deemed “minima l risk” will not be audited.   
 Minimization of Risk:  
Some questions in the patient questionnaires, interviews or survey could create emotional distress or confusion. Patients will be instructed that the questionnaires are for research purposes only and any problem or symptom should also be reported to their physician or nurse.  We do not anticipate any breach of confidentiality although recognize that a breach in confidentiality may result in psychological, social, or economic harm to a patient if the details of the medical record become available to others. Any information about the participants obtained from this research will be kept as confidential as 
possible. All data obtained will be stored on a secure server.

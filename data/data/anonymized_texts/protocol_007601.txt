I. Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the Sponsor’s experimental eczema 
cream treatment  containing formula relative to a basic  moisturizer in condition improvement as measured by 
Page 3 of 13 
 SCORAD (scoring of atopic dermatitis ).  The secondary objective is  to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the 
Sponsor’s experimental eczema cream treatment  containing a formula relative to a basic moisturizer in condition 
improvement as measured by PGA (physician’s global assessment), EASI (eczema area and severity index), and 
individual lesion assessment by the extent and severity components of SCORAD.   The tertiary objective is  to 
demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the Sponsor’s experimental eczema cream treatment  containing formula relative 
to a basic moisturizer in condition improvement as measured by  Qualify of Life (QoL ) and self -assessment 
questionnaires .  The quaternary objective is to understand skin health profiles as measured by biomarker analysis 
from tape strip samples.   
II. Background  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by disruption of epidermal 
barrier function that results in intense pruritus, sleep disturbances, and subacute and chronic eczematous 
lesions.  AD is the most common cause of chronic inflammatory skin disease and is a major cause of 
morbidity and suffering, affecting up to 30% of children, and increasing in prevalence throughout the world. It is estimated that the direct cost of AD in the US alone may be as high as $3.8 billion every year.  
 The current therapy of AD is reactive, where the flares are treated through symptomatic management with topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Given that these medications have long- term side- effects, 
and given t he chronically relapsing immunopathogenic nature of AD, there is an imperative need for safer 
anti-inflammatory medications .  The aim of this study is to provide clinical performance data to support 
eczema indication claim on package for the PG Ventures medicated skin program . 
A. Study Design  
This is  an approximately  9-week , 7-visit, randomized, double blind, parallel comparison study consisting of 
a 7-12 day  washout phase followed by an 8- week treatment phase.  This study  has currently been enrolling 
for approximately 4 mont hs; full enrollment under  the initial IRB approved protocol dated October 26, 2017 
has not yet been achieved.  The following changes to t he initially approved protocol will be implemented as 
strategies to fully enroll the study as well as to finish the study with a more complete dataset  due to a  
higher number of early subject withdraw s than was anticipated in the statistical considerations  of sample 
size.  Changes to the study population, inclusion criteria, and enrollment strategy from the initial protocol 
are as follows:  
• Revise  inclusion criteria to the following:  
o Omit criteria of VAS, PGA and area coverage (BSA)  
o Revise SCORAD criteria t o >=18 
o All other  inclusion criteria (antihistamine use, sun exposure, absence of other clinical 
findings and negative p regnancy test , if applicable) remain the same 
 
• In keeping with the current study design of balancing blacks and non- blacks within each of the 
2 test sites, invite back the non- blacks that were previously disqualified, repeat study 
qualification procedures (Screening + washout), and grade these subjects again at Baseline against the revised inclusion criteria appearing above.  
 
Note:   Previously disqualified non- black subjects will be scheduled to visit the test 
site(s) en mass, meaning all previously disqualified subjects would be seen within the 
same 1- 2 days so that they wo uld b e screened and placed on a 7 day washout within 
the same 1- 2 days , and return for their Baseline visit within the same 1 -2 days.  After 
all “repeat” subjects have completed their Baseline visit, the Sponsor will review their 
visual assessment grades (SCORAD, PGA, EASI) and select subjects for randomization into the study using SCORAD criteria >=18 as minimum entrance 
criteria , in accordance with the above revised inclusion criteria.  Subjects will meet all 
other inclusion/exclusion criteria as stated in the Protocol. These subjects may remain on washout up t o an additional 5 days past the day of their  Baseline visit while the 
Sponsor selects subjects for randomization.   
 
• Increase the number of subjects randomized into the study from the initial protocol -specified 62 
up to 71 subjects .  
Note:   After review of  recruitment observations from this study and data from previous 
studies, these additional 9 subjects that may be enrolled are to be non- black.  
 
Page 4 of 13 
 This study will now be conducted among up to 71 male and female subjects aged 12 to 65 years old 
(inclusive ) and executed by one clinical research company ut ilizing 2 of their test sites as a strategy to ful ly 
enroll the study with subjects meeting all revised inclusion/exclusion criteria.  E nrollment of black subjects 
is now  capped at the 31 black subjects who have been enrolled.  It will be stipulated that there will only be 
1 grader of record at each of the 2 test sites who will grade all subjects at each site at every time point.   
 
At Screening and E nrollment, subjects deemed qualified for this phase of the s tudy will be provided with 
bar soap and body lotion to use for all their skin cleansing and moisturization needs during the washout 
phase.  Subjects will  be instructed to refrain from using any other products on their body (excluding the 
face) including topical corticosteroids, ointments , lotions, sunscreens, etc., must refrain from using 
shampoo or conditioning products that contain known anti -microbial or anti -inflammatory agents (e.g. anti -
dandruff shampoo) , and refrain from using any other medications indicated for atopic dermatitis  other than 
the study provided products.   Normal facial or hair care products are permitted however they must NOT 
contain anti -bacterial ingredients (e.g. antidandruff shampoo, acne products, etc.).  
 At Baseline, start of  treatment phase, after visual grading (SCORAD, PGA, EASI) has been complet ed, the 
Sponsor will review subjects’ visual grading data against the revised, minimum  inclusion appearing in this 
protocol and Protocol Amendment #001.  Subjects deemed by the Sponsor qualified (communicated via 
email from Clinical Trial Manager to Test Site Study Staff) to participate in this study will have one primary 
lesion and one sec ondary lesion identified by the Study D ermatologist following the principle that the 
lesions are from the representative affected areas of the body (preferably the primary from limbs), at the developing phase,  not resolution phase, and 2cm or greater.  All  efforts will be made to identify the primary 
lesion from limbs (for individual lesion assessment using extent and severity components of SCORAD), 
and the secondary lesion not having blisters and/or drainage present as determined by the study PI or 
designee (for both individual lesion assessment using extent and severity com ponents of SCORAD and for 
tape stripping procedures).  
  
The 4 corners of both the primary and secondary lesions will be marked with “L” brackets using a 
permanent marker.  Subjects will be given a permanent marker and instructed to remark their sites at home each time after bathing or showering for the duration of their study participation.  Dermatological l esion 
assessment s and imaging of the primary and secondary lesions will be conduct ed at Baseline, Weeks 2 4, 
and 8.  Subjects will be  randomized and balanced into one of the 3 treatment groups based on severity as 
defined by their SCORAD grade .  Treatment groups  and a caption of their application regimens are as 
follows:   
 
• Desonide will be provided in a tube.  S ubjects will be instructed to apply  this product  only to their 
lesions using the “F inger Tip M ethod.”  Subjects will also be given  a lotion (same as Vehicle) and 
instructed to apply the lotion to the remaining unaffec ted body skin (whole body including face) ; 
 
• Vehicle and  the Sponsor’s experimental cream treatment groups  will be provided as a tube and 
lotion (same treatment in both the small treatment tube and the large lotion tube)  for blinding 
purposes.  Subject instructions for product application will be the same as for the Desonide group.  
 
Note:   Five minutes after applying both the lesion treatment and lotion products, if desired, subjects 
will be allowed to apply their  own fac ial moisturizer and make up over the study treatments . 
 
To help maintain blinding, products will be concealed in an opaque bag.  Subjects will be instructed to bring 
their products with them in the opaque bag to every visit and to refrain from discuss ing their study 
participation with oth er subjects.   Subjects will also be asked to complete a daily diary to record their twice 
daily treatment applications and any medications taken and to bring their diaries with them to every visit.   
 Study measurements wi ll be conducted at the time point s indicated in the table below.  Subjects will 
acclima te with their AD lesion sites exposed to air for at least 30 minutes under office environment 
conditions prior to any study procedures being performed.  Product application and c ompliance checks as 
well as dermatologic evaluations (incl. AEs) will be co nducted at each subsequent visit  following Baseline 
to ensure the subject’s condition does not become extensively worse.   For the sake of  subject safety, 
subjects who drop from the study will have the reason(s) for their dropping documented, will be asked to 
return their  study products and diaries to the test site, and as part of their study exit visit procedures be 
evaluated for SCORAD at the ti me of their dropping.  Additionally, these subjects , will be asked to continue 
to come to the test site for the remaining study visits for SCORAD evaluations  only, if willing , and have 
AE/Medication changes for the remainder of the study  documented.

 At Screening and Enrollment, if a prospective subj ect is admitted or excluded from the study, this 
information will be recorded on DCF QUALIFY.  Enrolled subjects will be given bar soap, lotion, verbal and 
written instructions and restrictions to follow during the washout phase ( Appendix INTR WO).   At Baseline, 
if a subject is admitted or excluded from the study, this information will be recorded on DCF 
QUALIFY _ADD.  Qualified subjects at Baseline will be randomized into one of the 3 treatment groups, 
given verbal and written instructions and restri ctions  to follow , and daily diaries to complete during the 
treatment phase (Appendices  INTRTRT  and DIARY ). 
IV. Study Materials 
A. Study Product s 
The products listed in the table below w ill be tested during this study.  Test products will be stored in a 
locked room under usual and customary office building conditions.   Unit #1 test products (eczema cream 
and whole body  lotion) will be distributed to qualified subjects at Baseline.  Subjects will apply their 
assigned treatments twice daily as directed by their product labels and subject instructions ( Appendix 
INTRTRT ).   
 
Test Product  Regimen  Rationale  Observations  
Small t ube to apply to lesions  twice daily and large lotion 
tube to apply to whole body except lesion sites  – same 
product both containers  Test product  34 
Small t ube to apply to lesions  twice daily and l arge l otion

0.05% Desonide (tube)  to apply to lesions twice daily in a 
small tube and vehicle lotion in a large tube to apply to 
whole body  Rx control  11 
At Weeks 1- 6, subjects will be supplied with eczema cream tubes in sequential order (Unit #s 2- 6) enough 
to last  until their next study visit.   At Week 4, Unit #1 body lotion tube will be collected and subjects will be 
given Unit #2  body l otion to last for the remaining 4 weeks of the study.  All product containers will be 
weighed pre- distribution and after each c ollection to assess subjects’ consistency of and complianc e with 
product usage.   
Supplemental products will be assigned a #5000 series number and will di stributed as needed; 
supplemental product numbers will be  assigned using the Sponsor’s balance and assignment program.   
B. Product Safety Statement  
This study meets the ethical requirements stipulated by the International Conference of Harmonization and 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practices for Research Involving Human Subjects.  Appropriate safety testing 
has been completed; risk assessments justify the placement of the test products in this study considering 
product concentration(s) and frequency of treatment as set forth in the protocol.  
C. Packaging, Labeling, and  Shipping of Test Products  
The Sponsor will send all test products directly to the clinical facility prior to the start of the study in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices.  A sample of how the products will be labeled 
appears in Appendix Label. The quantity of all study material shipped to the clinical facility will be 
documented on a shipping and receiving form, included within the shipment (DCF SHIP_REC).     
D. Return of Study Products  
Upon completion of the study, the Investigator or his/ her designee will assure that all test products 
(completely used, partially used, or unused) will be returned to the Sponsor at the address listed below.  
Product accountability will be appropriately documented on DCF SHIP_REC.

VI. Subject Accountability  
A. Subject Identification  
Subjects will be assigned a permanent 4-digit number (consecutive, beginning with #2001) during 
the consent process .  Subjects will be assigned a permanent consecutive randomization number 
(beginning with #201)  once they have qualified to participate in the treatment phase of the study.  
B. Subject Early Withdrawal  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  If a subject 
experiences a problem that they perceive to be related to study part icipation, or if test facility 
personnel deem it necessary, the Investigator is responsible to tak e appropriate action.  The 
Investigator, or designee, will complete a Subject Drop (DCF DROP ) form for any subject  
withdrawal or discontinuation prior to the end of the study.  Subjects who withdraw after study 
initiation will not be replaced.  
C. Adverse Events 
Subjects will be evaluated at each visit for Adverse Events using the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events for Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (CTCAE) as outlined in the Appendix TOLERABILITY.  
 
The Investigator or designee will complete the DCF AE to record any Adverse Event  (AE) that 
occurs during the study, regardless of relationship to treatment .  The Investigator  must review and 
sign the completed form associated with each specific AE .   
The Investigator or designee will notify the Clinical Trial Manager within 24 hours of  any 
unexpected and/or  serious AE’s and notify the IRB within 3 days of any serious adverse events or 
any events that are related to product treatment or study procedures.   The Clinical  Trial Manager 
will notify the Study T oxicologist following the Sponsor ’s SOP for AE reporting.   In the event of 
multiple adverse events related to test product us age, the Clinical Trial Manager, Clinical Scientist 
& Study Toxicologist will work with the PI to determine the appropriate course of action up to and 
including study suspension.  
D. Illness and  Medication Reporting  
Subjects will be questioned at each visit ab out their general health and medications as well as their 
tolerability of the test products (Appendix TOLERABILITY) by a qualified medical professional such as a nurse or physician’s assistant.  Any adverse changes to their general health will be recorded 
on DCF AE.  Any changes in their medications (prescription or OTC  not previously recorded) , will 
be documented as a concomitant medication on the DCF CON_MED f orm. Responses to the 
tolerability questionnaire will be recorded on DCF TOLERABILITY.

 VIII.   Other Study Documentation  
A.        Protocol Amendments  
If it becomes necessary to modify this protocol, the modification will be documented by a protocol 
amendment .  Amendments will be initiated by the Sponsor  and signed by the Inves tigator or 
designee and by all the appropriate representatives of the Sponsor who are directly impacted by 
the change.   All amendments will be consecutively numbered, describe any changes being made 
and the rationale behind the changes .  Amendments cannot be implemented until written IRB 
approval is obtained.   
B.        Protocol Deviations  
If  a significant deviation from the final protocol occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator or 
designee to notify the Clinical Trial Manager  or de signee as so on as possible once the deviation is 
noted  and no later than 24 hours after the occurrence.  All deviations and subsequent notification 
will be documented on the Deviation Log ( DCF CONDEVERR)  for the subject affected.   If  a 
deviation affects multiple s ubjects, it will be recorded on the tab in the eCRF database titled Study 
Notes.    
C.        Study Monitoring  
The Investigator will permit a representative of the Sponsor to visit the facility during the course of 
the study to monitor study progress and to observe all study procedures.  During these visits, the 
Investigator will permit the monitor to inspect all forms and corresponding subjects’ records to verify 
adherence to the protocol.  The study monitor will also be permitted to review and verify test 
materials and any Investigator -generated or Sponsor -generated study documents.  The monitor will 
document and discuss this visit with the Investigator or his designee including any problems that 
are to be resolved.  
D.       Additional Data  
Daily outdoor relative humidity and temperature at the test facility will be recorded during the test 
period on a site provided data collection form .  Acclimation room conditions (temperature controlled 
office environment conditions) will be recorded at 9 am and 3 pm (+/ - 1 hour) each study day at 
Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, and  8.   
E. Investigator and Site Qualification   
After review of the Investigator’s CV, the Investigator is qualified to conduct this study based on education, training, and experience conducting similar studies with similar test products and/or 
methods within the past 2 years.   Further, the Investigator remains in good standing with US 
Governmental agencies regulating the conduct of clinical studies and has agreed via his/her 
signature on Page 1 of this protocol to conduct this study according to GCP/ICH guidelines.  The 
Investigator has agreed to maintain a list of any personnel to which the Investigator delegates 
his/her responsibilities and has agreed that selected delegates  will have demonstrated they are 
capable and qualified to perf orm such functions.  A list of all delegates and their responsibilities will 
be maintained and a copy of this list will be provided to the Sponsor in the Investigator’s final report.   
 
The test site has adequate facility space and work processes including current, comprehensive, 
applicable SOP’s, access to sufficient number of prospective subjects meeting the study required 
demographics,  the required equipment and i nstruments (or Sponsor has agreed to supply), and 
sufficient qualified staff possessing current and applicable training records, the correct skill sets, any required professional licensure (Study Physician and assisting health professionals as required 
by state law) to conduct this study in compliance with all Federal, State and local regulations, 
GCP/ICH guidelines, and according to the protocol.  Additionally, the test site has a history of low staff turnover which will increase the likelihood that the quality of study and method conduct will be 
sustained over the entire in- life portion of the study.

 VII. Data Management and Statistical Analysis 
A. Data Collection  
Data entered directly into the Sponsor’s eCRF system will be considered source data.  If an 
independent eCRF database is used (one that is not on the server (i.e., one that is on a dedicated 
instrument computer for direct data capture)), then data will be backed up nightly to another 
storage location (i.e., flash drive, CD, external hard drive, etc.).   This can be done either by using 
the “export all” function under the reports tab and placing the files on a location not on the computer or by copying the database to a location not on the computer (i.e., flash drive, CD, 
external hard drive, etc.).   Instrumentation that has a separate data collection system (i.e., not 
eCRF) needs data backed up daily following the directions in the corresponding instrument appendix, and this data system will be considered source data.   
 If the eCRF is not available, all study data will be written directly on the paper CRF as source data and recorded into the eCRF when it is available.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator or 
designee to ensure that all source documents and data collection forms are completed, maintained 
according to Good Clinical Practices, and retained in the study records.  This includes assuring that all study documents are filled in completely, entered into the eCRF system and 100% Quality 
Control reviewed for accuracy in transcription.       
 
All grading direct data entry errors in the eCRF system will be corrected where possible.  When the 
correction is not possible within the eCRF system the error will be documented in the eCRF 
ComDevErr form.  Included in this error documentation should be the error that occurred and the 
resolution.  Errors to be documented are improperly entered subject numbers, invalid grades or 
instrument data and failure of equipment calibration.  It is the responsibility of the Study Inv estigator 
or a designee to review the data error record to ensure errors are captured correctly and are easily 
understood.   
B. Data Transfer  
Following study completion and prior to submission of the Clinical Study Summary, the test facility 
will give sponsor -requested electronic data files, legible copies of the documents (i.e., DCF’s) not 
entered into electronic format to the Data Manager.  Original source documents reside with the study 
facility.  
C. Statistical Analysis  
The Statistical Analysis plan for this study is detailed in Appendix STATS.    
X.    Investigator’s Responsibilities 
A.         Informed Consent / Assent  
Prior to study participation, all subjects will be informed as to the type of study, the procedures to 
be followed, the general nature of the products being tested, and any known or anticipated adverse 
reactions that might result from participation.  Each subject must read, comprehend, and sign the 
informed consent (Appendix IC) before participating in thi s study.  The informed consent will 
contain all of the bas ic elements of outlined in ICH E6.  For subjects considered to be “underage” 
following each test site’s state laws, study staff will obt ain written documentation of parental 
permission and written documentation of child ’s willingness to participate through written assent  
(Appendix ASSENT) .   
B.        Final Investigator’s Report  
The Investigator or designee will submit a study report to the Sponsor within 4 weeks foll owing 
study completion or termination.  This report should include:  
• Investigator’s designee of authority statement and signature for specific tasks, e.g., designation 
by investigator to a qualified staff person to enroll subjects.  
• Personnel list of responsibilities (including any non- Test Site Facility personnel)  
• Copy of original Monitor Signature Log and Delegation Signature Log 
• Records of the study site visits by the Sponsor  
• Documentation that the Investigator has reviewed and approved all subject data f or the study  
• Documentation by Investigator that all subjects were provided a copy of the Informed Consent  
Page 11 of 13 
 • Number of subjects screened for eligibility  
• Number of subjects entering and completing the study  
• Number of subjects that withdrew from the study and reasons for withdrawal  
• Any deviations or changes/amendments to the protocol  
• Summary of adverse events  
• Clinical judgments relative to any significant adverse events and their disposition; any alterations 
in treatment due to adverse events  
• Notes to file  
• Data transfer  
• Forms disposition 
• Documentation that source documents transcribed to eCRF have been verified 
• Signed and dated quality assurance statement ensuring protocol compliance 
D. Record Retention  
  The Investigator or designees will retain all study records for a minimum of 5 years.  After a minimum 
of 5 years, the test facility will notify the S ponsor before destroying retained study records .     
E. Confidentiality  
All information (photographs, medical information and data evaluations, etc.) concerning the 
subject that is obtained in connection with this study will be kept confidential.  The sponsoring 
company, governmental regulatory agencies and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will have 
access to the study records: however, they will be coded to protect the subject’s confidentiality.  
F. IRB Review and Approval    
The study will not begin prior to the receipt of written confirmation of approval by the IRB and any 
relevant regulatory authority.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain the IRB  approval (per 
the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 56 and applicable ICH guidelines) for the 
protocol, amendments, informed consent, subject information sheet, questionnaires, and advertising 
materials used to recruit study subjects, if ap propriate.  A copy of the IRB approval letter along with 
a list of the IRB members who acted on this protocol and a statement that the IRB is in co mpliance 
with current ICH E6 and Good Clin ical Practices (GCP) guidelines  will be provided to the Clinical 
Trial Manager.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to promptly report to the IRB all changes to the research activity 
and all unanticipated problems involving the risk to human subjects.

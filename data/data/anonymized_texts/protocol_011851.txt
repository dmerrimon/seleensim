Protocol Title A Phase I/II Study of IMMU-132 (hRS7-SN38 Antibo dy Drug Conju gate) in 
Patients with Epitheli al Cancer 
Study Drug                 IMMU -132 (hRS7 -SN38 antibody -drug conjugate) is provided in glass vials as a 
sterile lyophilized powder  
 
Objectives  In Phase I, t he primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
IMMU -132 as a single agent administered in 3 -week treatment cycles, in 
previously treated patients with advanced epithelial cancer.  The secondary 
objective s are to obtain  initial da ta concerning pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity, and ef ficacy with this dosing regimen.  In Phase II, the primary 
objective is the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of IMMU -132 administered 
in 3-week treatment cycles  at a dose selected in Phase I , while the secondary 
objectives include pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.  
Scope of Stud y       This is planned as a multi -center study.  In Phase II, up to 150 patients 
(assessable) in each of 5 cancer subtypes [triple -negative and non -triple -negative 
breast cancer (TNBC, non -TNBC), non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small 
cell lung cancer (SCLC), urothelial cancer (UC)] and up to 56 patients 
(assessable) per other cancer types will be studied at the 10 mg/kg dose.  
Study Durat ion        In Phase II, a ll patients receive IMMU -132 10 mg/kg  administered once -week ly 
for the first 2 weeks of 3 -week treatment cycles , to be continued in the absence of 
unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease requiring termination of further 
treatment.   Patients who have progression of disease assessed for the first time 
during the study but derive continued clinical benefit from IMMU -132 treatment, 
may continue to be treated based on physician discretion  (with Sponsor 
approval) .  After discontinuing treatment, follow -up is then required until 
resolution or stabilization of any t reatment -related toxicity, and patients with 
stable disease or objective responses must also continue evaluations for up to 2 
years or until progression of disease  or initiation of other treatment . All patients 
will be followed for survival every month, wh ich may be by telephone , but no  
longer than 2 years from final study evaluation . 
Backgroun d      SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT -11), a highly potent 
chemotherapeutic agent that is approved as a single agent and is incorporated into 
combination regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, but  which 
has dose -limiting gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities.  hRS7 is a 
humanized monoclonal antibody which targets the Trop -2 (human trophoblast 
cell-surface antigen) antige n which is expressed on a variety of human 
carcinomas and also known as EGP -1 (epithelial glycoprotein -1), GA733 -1 
(gastric antigen 733 -1), and TACSTD2 (tumor -associated calcium signal

 transducer). Trop -2 has been associated with more aggressive disease in  some 
cancers and is a promising target for drug delivery with hRS7, since a portion of 
the antibody internalizes when bound to the antigen on the cell surface.  As such, 
Immunomedics has developed an antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) , called 
IMMU -132, in whic h SN -38 is conjugated to hRS7 in order to enhance delivery 
of SN -38 to Trop -2-expressing tumors while reducing systemic toxicity.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based upon data from the Phase I portion of this study, a starting dose of 8 or 10 
mg/kg, administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle was considered 
acceptable for further evaluation , and 10 mg/kg wa s subsequently selected for the  
ongoing Phase II portion of this study.  Severe ( Grade 3  or higher ) toxicities  have 
primarily been limited to neutropenia , diarrhea  or febrile neutropenia  (see 
Investigator’s Brochure for most recently updated safety profile).  
In Phase I & Phase II, there was evidence of efficacy. Partial responses have been 
observed currently in patients with triple -negative breast cancer, small -cell lung 
cancer, non -small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer and urinary bladder and 
colorectal cancer s. Disease stabilization has been observed in many patients.  
Many patients have continued therapy for periods of months, but with little 
evidence of evoking antibodies to the dr ug (SN -38) or antibody (hRS7) of the 
ADC.  
Study De sign              This is a Phase I/II, open -label study of IMMU -132 in previously treated patients 
with advanced epithelial cancers, including ovarian, endometrial, cervical, breast  
(TNBC and non -TNBC) , prostate (hormone refractory), lung (non -small -cell and 
small -cell), head & neck (squamous cell), esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, 
renal (clear cell) , papillary thyroid, and  urothelial  cancers , as well as 
glioblastoma multiforme .  A table of approved or  standard  or commonly used  
therapeutic regimens for each of these cancer types is included in Appendix 1 .  
Patients who have not received approved or standard treatment lines for their 
cancer must be informed  that alternatives to receiving IMMU -132 are available 
prior to their consenting to participate in this trial.

 In Phase II, up to 150 patients (assessable) in each of 5 cancer subtypes (TNBC, 
non-TNBC, NSCLC, SCLC, UC) and up to 56 patients (assessable) per  other 
cancer types will be studied at 10 mg/kg dose.  
 Baseline evaluations within 4 weeks of the scheduled start of treatment include 
patient history, physical examination with vital signs and performance 
evaluation, local histology review to confirm one of the epithelial cancers 
included, contrast -enhanced CT or MRI scans (chest, abdomen, pelvis with 
additional imaging of other involved areas), CBC (with differential and platelet 
count), routine serum chemistries, urinalysis (with microscopic, if needed),  
PT/PTT, EKG, and serum samples for human anti -human antibody (HAHA).  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 Tumor biomarkers are to be monitored at baseline and at each radiologic 
response assessment time point  whenever possible .   
 
 
 
 
 
 A single whole -blood sample (purple - or pink -topped tube, 2 mL) will be 
collected from each registered patient prior to receiving IMMU -132 for 
determina tion of UGT1A1  and related  genotype s.  This sample will be shipped to 
Sponsor who will perform this assay.  The results from this test are NOT required 
to determine eligibility but will be used retrospectively to assess its utility in 
predicting toxicity.  
  
 
 
 Core biopsies that are 
fresh -frozen and also formalin -fixed (described above) are also desired at 
baseline and intervals during therapy  whenever possible . 
 In the ongoing Phase II study, all patients receive IMMU -132 10 mg/kg 
administered in 3 -week treatment cycles with weekly dosing the first two weeks 
(days 1 and 8 of 21 -day cycles) and no dosing the third week. The cycles are to 
be continued in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease 
requiring  termination of further treatment.  The first assessment of disease 
progression per RECIST1.1 does not require discontinuation of study treatment if 
there is still the potential for patient benefit in the opinion of the investigator  and 
approved by the Spo nsor, but treatment must be discontinued if subsequent 
imaging documents disease progression from that assessment.

  All patients are closely monitored over the course of their treatment, and NCI 
CTCAE v4.0 is used to grade all adverse events and to prov ide dose reduction, 
delay or cessation guidelines in the event of treatment -related toxicity.  Based on 
irinotecan and animal testing, the major toxicity of IMMU -132 is expected to be 
gastrointestinal symptoms and hematologic suppression. Growth factors an d 
other supportive care are allowed when medically necessary any time during 
treatment with IMMU -132 but should not be given prophylactically before start 
of treatment with IMMU -132 first dose in cycle 1.  
 In the current experience in over 200 patients, th e major Grade 3 or Grade 4 
toxicity has been neutropenia, which is managed with dose delay , dose  reduction, 
or growth factors, if spontaneous remission is not experienced within 7 days .

Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to IMMU -132 treatment 
(e.g., abdominal cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate 
premedication (e.g. , atropine) for subsequent treatments.  
Because of the many clinical s ites participating in this trial, the investigators are 
requested not to consent and start screen ing a potentially eligible patient before 
consulting with the Sponsor to determine when such a patient could be accepted 
into the trial, should the patient pro ve to be eligible after screening.  
  Study procedures during treatment include physical examination and vital signs, 
CBC (with differential and platelet count), routine serum chemistries, PT/PTT, 
serum samples for PK (to be collected in all patients in Pha se II, unless exempted  
by the Sponsor) and HAHA, concomitant medications and adverse events, and 
EKG.  Starting with the initial dose of IMMU -132, CT or MRI examinations and 
biomarkers are to be obtained every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progression 
of disease requiring termination of further treatment.   At that time, the patient 
will undergo an end -of-study evaluation, with additional follow up only required 
until resolution or stabilization of any treatment -related toxicity.  For scans 
showing stable disease, but with substantial or rapid tumor shrinkage near 
threshold for a partial response, the 8 -week interval for the next scan may be 
shortened at investigator discretion and if discussed with the medical monitor.  
Confirmatory CT/MRI scans are to be obtained 4  to 6 weeks after an initial 
partial response and /or 4 to 6 weeks after an initial complete response. If a

 confirmatory scan is performed , the subsequent scans will be scheduled every 8 
weeks from the confirmatory scan.  Additional scans may be performed at the 
discretion of the physician to assess disease status as medically indicated. At the 
discretion of treating physician, patients who have biopsiable lesion(s) and 
consented to biopsy(ies) will provide during the study as many tumor metastasi s 
core biopsy samples as possible,  
 In addition, SN -38 concentrations will be 
determined only in specimens that are taken within one day after completion of 
any IMMU -132 in fusion. All specimens should be placed in  10% formalin, 
without any further processing and shipped to sponsor for analysis , as well as 
fresh -frozen specimens for determining protein or RNA levels.  
 In the event of treatment termination due to unacceptable toxicity, the patient will 
continue on study follow up until there is documentation of progression of 
disease, at which time an end -of-study evaluation will be performed, with 
additional follow -up only required until resolution or stabilization of any 
treatment -related toxicity.  
Long -term follow -up will continue in patients with stable disease or an objective 
response with evaluations performed every 3 months for up to 2 years or until 
progression of disease  or initiation of other treatment .  All patients w ill be 
followed for survival every month, which may be by telephone , but no longer 
than 2 years from final study evaluation . 
 Patients continuing to benefit from treatment at time of stud y closure may be 
eligible to enroll  in a rollover study, so they may continue to receive treatment.

 Medications  Patients enrolled in this trial will be refractory to or relapsed after one or  more 
chemotherapy regimens, including irinotecan in colorectal cancer patients, or 
hormonal agents, biologicals or targeted therapeutic agents, and may also have 
received antibody therapy. All of these treatments must be discontinued for a 
minimum of 2 weeks prior to starting IMMU -132, and these or other anti -cancer 
therapies  (i.e., drugs, biologics, procedures) are not permitted during this study.  
Palliative and/or supportive medications and procedures are permitted to be used 
during the study. Patients who receive palliative and/or supportive medications 
and procedures should have a washout period of 1 week after the last IMMU -132 
dose and 2 weeks prior to resuming the treatment with next IMMU -132 dose, 
unless otherwise a different washout period is arranged by discussion with 
medical monitor  (Sponsor) . The requirement for premedicati on with 
acetaminophen, steroids, and diphenhydramine or equivalents is not anticipate d; 
however, these will be employed as clinically indicated to decrease infusion 
reactions.  
 Antiemetics, anti -diarrheal medications, cytokines or blood transfusions may be  
administered as clinically indicated. Cytokines or blood transfusions are not 
permitted prophylactically before start of first IMMU -132 dose in cycle 1. Other 
supportive care is allowed as medically warranted.  
Phase II                 In Phase II, up to 1 50 patients (assessable) in each of 5 cancer subtypes 
(TNBC, non -TNBC, NSCLC, SCLC, UC) and up to 56 patients (assessable) 
per cancer type for all other cancers will be studied at the 10 mg/kg dose.  
Endpoints               Safety and tolerability will be e valuated from adverse events, standard  safety 
laboratories (CBC with differential and platelet count, serum chemistries, and 
urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs, and EKG. Adverse events will be 
classified according to the MedDRA system of prefer red terms and system organ 
class, and all adverse events and abnormal laboratories will be classified for 
severity using NCI CTCAEv4.0 toxicit y grade s.  Descriptive statistics will be 
used to characterize adverse events, cytopenias, and other abnormal laboratories.  
 Efficacy will be evaluated from CT scans (or if needed MRI studies), using 
RECIST 1.1 criteria to classify tumor response, time to onset of objective 
response, duration of objective response, time to progression and survival. 
Changes in biom arkers will be evaluated.  
 Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be evaluated from serum samples using an ELISA 
assay performed by the Sponsor. The results will be characterize d by standard PK 
parameters including peak and trough values, area -under - the-curve (AUC), 
maximum concentration (Cmax), and half -life (T1/2), if feasible, and 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
 Immunogenicity will be determined from serum samples using an ELISA assay 
performed by the Sponsor for the occurrence of any human antibodies aga inst 
IMMU -132 (e.g., HAHA).  The occurrences of any positive HAHA results will 
be characterized by descriptive statistic s.

L INTRODUCTION January 23. 2020 
Over the past 60 years, antibodie s have been investigated for their ability to shepherd toxic 
compounds, such as radioactivity , diugs, or toxin s to tumors in an attempt to deliver these agents in a 
more selective mann er for impro ved anti-tumor effects . While initially findin g unconjugated 
antibodie s to be largely ineffective, t oday there are several antibodie s approved for clinical use in a 
variety of cance rs, and there are many m ore under clinical evaluation. 0-6) Even though 
relatively few antibody conjugates have been approved for treatin g cancer , most antibodies are 
themselve s incapable of eliciting sufficien t responses to wanant their use as standalone agents . 
Instead, most unconjugated antibodies are combined with chemotherap eutic regimen s in some way. 
Thus, it is n ot sm-pri sing that there has been a renewed interest in antibody-mug conjugates , 
paiiicularly with the recent success of the trastuzumab emtan sine, an anti-HER2- maytans ine 
conjugate, in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, even those who were refra ctory to 
unconjugated trastuzumab. a-9> 
Most of the antibody-di11g conjugates (ADC) being explored clinically today use dmgs that cannot 
be given alone becau se th ey ai- e too toxic (i.e., ultra-toxic). Conjugating these diugs, such as 
maytansine, calic heamicin, and am-istatin to antibodies detoxifies them , usually by altering their 
natural phaimacokinetic and biodi stributi on prope1iie s. H oweve r, as the decisio n to remove 
Mylotai ·g (gemtuzumab ozoga micin; anti-CD33-calicheamicin conjugate) from marketing sugges ts, 
the therapeutic window of these agents can be limit ed. oo, 11l For t his reason , we have taken a 
closer look at the vai·ious chemothera peutic agents that ah-eady have been teste d clinically to 
dete1 mine if any migh t be suitable for conjugation to antibodie s. Since most chemotherapeu tics 
require micromolai · concentrat ions for therapy, they ai· e not suitable for use as antibody conjugates. 
Howeve r, SN-38 is promi sing because it has activity in the low nanomolai· range , which is betwee n 
the extreme of the ultratoxics that ai·e active in subnan omolar concentrations and most of the other 
commonly used chemotherapeutics. 
SN-38, a topoisome rase I inhibitor, is the active metabolite of the camptothecin CPT -11 (i1inotecan), 
which is approved as a single agent for colorectal cancer and includ ed in treatme nt regimens such as 
FOLFIRI .<12-20> SN-38 is not wate r soluble , and therefore it was derivatized to a water -soluble fonn, 
irinotecan , but it must be enzymatica lly cleaved to the SN-38 fonn for it to have maximum potency . 
Unfortunately, at best, only 5% of irinoteca n will be conve1ied to the active SN-38 fonn by 
esterase activ ity residing primaril y in the liver , albeit there ai·e esterases in the tumor that can 
cleave irinotecan to SN-38.(21-24> Its catabo lism in the liver results in its transport through the bile 
duct into the intestines , resultin g in GI toxicity.

Immunomedi cs is currently pursuing  several ADCs based on the SN-38 conjugation technology it 
developed.  In this protocol,  a humani zed anti-Trop-2 antibody (hRS7) is examined.  Trop-2 
(trophoblastic cell-surface antigen; also known as EGP-1, epithelial glycoprot ein-1), is a cell sur face, 
transmembr ane calcium  signal transdu cer glycoprot ein belonging to the TAC STD gene family that  is 
highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, particul arly metastatic  sites(27), with much  lower 
expression in norm al tissues .(28)  Trop-2 has been implicated as an important antigen in oncogenesis, 
often being found  in more  aggressive tumors(29-39).  The murine RS7 antibody was initially identifi ed 
as being specific for epithelial glycoprot ein-1 (aka, Trop-2)(40, 41), being found in  a numb er of 
different epithelial cancers and it was internalized(42-45), a highly desirable property for  an antibody-
drug conjugate.  Indeed, as ment ioned above, the initial studies with the SN-38 conjugat es used an 
anti-CEACAM5  antibody that is not readily internalized, yet it was potent  in vivo, leaving us to 
hypothesize that local release of the SN-38 from the antibody bound  to the tu mor provides  an 
important mechanism  for that conjugat e’s activity.  However, the hRS7-SN-38 conjugate  further 
benefits from the antibody’s ability to internalize.(46)

Since 8  of the 9 patients treated at 12 mg/kg required dose delays and reductions during  the first 
cycle, that starting dose  was consid ered to have exceeded the maximum acceptable  dose for fu rther 
consid eration. In contrast, the in itial dose lev el of 8 mg/kg appears acceptable with  3 additional  
patients (2 pancreatic, 1 gastric cancer). To establish a maximum acceptable dose lev el, a final 
intermediate dose level of 10 mg/kg was evaluated. 
Based upon  these  data from the Phase I portion  of this study, starting doses of 8 or 10 mg/kg, 
administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle were consid ered acceptable  for further evaluation , 
and subsequently 10 mg/kg was selected for the ongoing Phase II portion  of this study.  Severe  (Grade 
3 or higher ) toxicities have primarily included neutrop enia, diarrhea and  febrile neutrop enia.

 2. STUDY OBJEC TIVES  
This is a first-in-man clinical study with the antibody-drug conjugate, IMMU-132, which uses the 
humani zed antibody hRS7 to deliver the topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN-38, directly to Trop-2- 
expressing epithelial tumors.  
2.1. Primary Objective 
The primary objective in Phase I is to evaluate  the safety and tolerability of IMMU-132 as a single 
agent administered in 3-week treatment cycles, in previous ly treated patients with advanced 
epithelial cancer.  Dose escalation  in Phase I (completed) was  intended to determine a maximum 
acceptable  dose and select cancer types for continued expanded study in Phase II.  Phase II 
continues enrollment with dose l evels and cancers selected b ased upon Phase I results and 
preliminary efficacy results .  The primary objective in Phase II is the evaluation of the safety and 
efficacy of IMMU -132 administered in 3-week treatment cycles, at a dose selected in Phase I.  
2.2. Secondary Objectives 
 
In Phase I, t he secondary objectives are to obtain in itial data concerning ph armacokinetics, 
immuno genicity, and efficacy with this dosing  regimen. In Phase II, secondary objectives also 
include pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.

 3. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase I/II, open-label study of IMMU-132 in previous ly treated patients with the following  
metastatic  epithelial cancers: 
 Gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) 
 Esoph ageal cancer (EC) 
 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
 Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
 Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) 
 Cervical Cancer 
 Papillary thyroid cancer  
 Glioblastoma  multiforme (GBM)  
 Endomet rial Can cer 
 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
 Non-triple -negative breast cancer  (mBC)  
 Hormone -refractory prostate  cancer (HRPC) 
 Head and neck cancers- squamous cell (SCCH N) 
 Renal cell carcinoma  (clear cell) (RCC) 
 Urothelial cancers, including urinary bladder cancer.  
A table  of approved or stand ard therapeutic regimens  or regimens in documented clinical 
trials for each of these  cancer types is includ ed in Appendix 1. Patients  who have not received 
all appro ved or standa rd treatm ents for their cancer must  be informed that these al ternativ es to 
receiving  IMMU-132 are a vailable prior  to consenting to part icipate in this trial. 
In Phase II, up to 150 patients (assessable) in in each of 5 cancer subtypes (TNBC, non -TNBC, NSCLC, 
SCLC, UC) and up to 56 patients (assessable) per other cancer types will be studied at the 10 mg/kg 
dose.  
Based upon  the Phase I results, the 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose  levels were selected for further 
evaluation in Phase II, and subsequently the 10 mg/kg dose was selected for the o ngoing Phase II 
study. 
Baseline evaluations  within 4 weeks of the scheduled  start of treatment include p atient history, 
physical examination with vital signs and performance evaluation,  local histology review  to confirm 
one of the epithelial cancers listed above, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans (chest, abdomen,  
pelvis with additional  imaging of other  involved areas), CBC (with differential and plat elet count),  
routine  serum chemistries,  urinalysis, PT/PTT, EK G, and serum samples for human  anti-human  
antibody (HAHA).

A sin gle whol e-blood  sample (pu rple or pin k-topped tube, 2  mL) will  be collected from each 
registered patient prior to receiving IMMU-132 for determin ation of UGT1A1 or other UGT1  
genotype.  This s ample will be shipped to Sponsor  who will perform this assay.  The results are not  
used to establish eli gibility but will be used for retrosp ective assessment  of toxicity. 
All patients receive two doses of  IMMU-132 administered in 3-week treatment cycles with w eekly 
dosing in the first two weeks (days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles) and no dosing  the third week. In the 
ongoing Phase II portion of the study,  all p atients receive 10 mg/kg starting doses and the  
treatment cycles are to be continued in the  absence of unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease 
requiri ng termination of further treatment.  The fi rst determination of disease progression per 
RECIST1.1 does not require discontinu ation of stu dy treatment if there is still the potential  for 
patient benefit in the opinion of the investig ator, but  treatment must  be discontinued if subseq uent 
imaging documents  disease progression from that  assessment.  All patients are closely monitored 
over the course  of their treatment,  and NCI CTCAE v4.0 is used to grade all adverse events and to 
provide  dose reduction, delay or cessation guidelines in the event of treatment-related toxicity. 
Based on irinot ecan and animal testing, the major  toxicity of IMMU-132 is expected to be 
gastroin testinal symptoms and hematol ogic suppression.  G rowth  factors and other  supp ortive care 
are allowed when medi cally necessary any time during  treatment with IMMU-132, but not 
prophylactically before start of treatment wi th the first IMMU-132 dose  in cycle 1.

 Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to  IMMU-132 treatment  (e.g., abdom inal 
cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedication (e.g., Atropine) for 
subse quent treatments. 
In Phase I, dose guidelines  will be follow ed with a goal of being able to give the first cycle 
without r equiri ng dose  reduction, delay, or discontinu ation or cytokine support  at the time the second 
cycle is given.  
Study procedures during treatment include  physical examination and vital signs, CBC (with 
differential and platelet count),  routine  serum chemistries,  PT/PTT, serum s amples for PK (to be 
collected in  all patients in the ongoing Phase II study unless an exemption is approved  by the 
Sponsor)  and HAHA, concomitant medi cations and adverse events, and  EKG. 
Starting with the initial dose of IMMU-132, CT (or MRI if needed) examinations are to be obtain ed 
at 8-week intervals until the occurrence of progression of dise ase requiri ng discontinu ation of 
further treatment. For scans showing stable disease, but with substantial or rapid tumor shrinkage 
near threshold for a partial response, the 8 -week interval for the next scan may be shortened at 
investigator discretion and if discussed with the medical monitor.  Confi rmato ry CT/M RI scans are 
to be obtain ed 4 to 6 weeks after an initial partial r esponse and/or 4 to 6 weeks after an initial 
complete response . If a confirmato ry scan is performed the subsequent scans will be scheduled 
every 8 weeks from the confirmatory scan. Tumor bio markers are to be obtain ed at the time of 
radiologic evaluations.  
 
 
 
 
After discontinuing treatment, the p atient will und ergo an end-of-study evaluation, with additional  
follow -up only required until resolution or stabili zation of any treatment-related toxicity.  Addit ional 
CT or MRI may be performed at the discretion of the physician to assess dise ase status as 
medically indicated. 
Long-term follow -up will continue in  patients with stable dise ase or an objective respon se with 
evaluations  performed every 3 months for up to 2 years or until progression of disease or initiation 
of other treatment .  All p atients will  be followed every month for  survival, which m ay be by 
telephon e, for no longer than 2 years from final study evaluation . 
Patients continuing to benefit from treatment at time of study closure may be eligible to enroll in a 
rollover study, so they may continue to receive treatment.

 5. DOSE ESCALAT ION 
Dose escalation phase is now completed.  
6. STUDY PROCED URES  
Blood samples obtain ed for HAHA and antibody / conjugate serum levels and UGT1A1 levels are 
to be shipp ed to the Sponsor  who will perform these  assays.  Instructions for shipping  these blood 
samples are given in Appendix 3.  Otherwise, all procedures are to be performed locally at each 
study site. 
6.1. Informed Cons ent 
No study procedure or alteration of patient care will be undertaken until informed consent has 
been obtain ed from the patient or legal representative.  The Investigator will explain  the nature and 
scope of the stu dy, potential  risks  and benefits of particip ation, and answer questions for the p atient 
and/or l egally authorized representative.  
A table  of approved or stand ard therapeutic regimens  for each of these  cancer types is includ ed in 
Appendix 1.  Patien ts who have not received all appro ved or standard treatm ent lines for their  
cancer must  be informed that these al ternatives to receiving  IMMU-132 are available prior to 
consenting to part icipate in this trial. 
If the patient agrees to particip ate, the informed consent form will be signed, dated, and witness ed, 
with a copy given to the subject. 
6.2. Patient Registration 
Since this Phase I /II trial is being performed at multiple institutions and in different cancers, 
investi gators must  contact the Cl inical Project Mana ger (Sponsor) or designee  in advance of 
consenting and start screening a patient to determine if or when a patient may be enrolled. This is 
particularly important because a number of clinical sites are enrolling patients and the Sponsor needs 
to plan enrollment in specific tumor types relative to product supply.  
Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study by calling the  Clinical Project Mana ger or designee at 
Immunomedi cs at Mond ay through Friday, between 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM EST. The  
screening CRF pages are to be completed and faxed to Immunomedi cs at  or emailed 
to register the patient at least 48 hours p rior to the  expected treatment start date. 
6.3. Pre-Study/Baseli ne Evaluations

Complete and detailed drug preparation and storage instructions in addition to the management of 
drug accountability are provided in the Pharmacy Manual , which  should be used as the primary 
reference for these activities.  
7.2. Drug Accountabil ity 
All vials  of study drug must  be stored under refrigeration (monitored at 2-8oC) and protected from 
light in a locked room that  can be accessed only by the  pharmacist, the study Investigator, or another  
duly designated person.  The study medications must  not be used outside of the context of this 
protocol.  Under no circumstances shou ld the Investigator or other site personn el supp ly study drug 
to other Investigators, patients, or clinics, or allow supplies  to be used other  than directed by this 
protocol without  prior  authori zation from Immunomedi cs, Inc. 
Adequate records documenting  receipt, use, return, loss, or other  disposi tion of study drug vials must  
be kept.  A complete  drug accountability record, supplied by Immunom edics (or  its designee or NCI 
drug accountabil ity forms), or compu ter records used by the pharmacy at the investi gational site, can 
be used to provide d rug accountabil ity.  In all cases, information d escribing study medi cation 
supplies  and their disposition, patient-by-patient, must  be provided and signed by the  Investigator (or 
the pharmacist or other  person who dispensed the drug) and collected by the Study Monitor.  
Requis ite data include relevant dates, qu antities, bat ches or code numbe rs, and  patient identification 
for patients who received trial produ ct. 
At the end of the study, following  authori zation by study management, study medi cation may be 
destroyed at the site as dictated by the  appropriate stand ard operating procedures at the p articip ating 
institutions.  Destruction must  be document ed.  Alternatively, after notification, all unus ed products 
will be collected by the S tudy Monitor and returned to Immuno medics.

 7.4.2.  Vital Sig ns 
Vital signs will be assessed prior to first infusion every 15 ± 5 minutes for the first hour and then 
every 30 minutes until completing IV administration, at completion, and then additionally 30 
minutes later. In absence of significant changes, may be reduced with subsequent doses to prior to 
infusion, at 30 m inutes, a nd then at completion.  
7.4.3.  Intravenous Ad ministration 
Do not administer as an IV push  or bolus.  IMMU-132 is administered intravenous ly as a slow 
infusion as d escribed below. 
Intravenous  access must  be well established  prior to initiating  infusion.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.4.4.  Managing Infusional Toxici ty 
Immun omedics, Inc., should be notified within 24 hours in the event of any serious infusion 
reaction. 
NCI CTCAE  version  4.0  is  used  to  grade  all  adverse  events  and  to  provide  management 
guidelines for infusion al toxicity. 
For a serious  infusion  reaction consid ered severe or life threatening (NCI toxicity Grade 3 or 
higher) an infusion must be p ermanently termin ated. 
 Examples of such events includ e: serious  or clinically significant cardiopulmon ary 
events, severe allergic (symptomatic  bronchospasm) or anaphylactic reactions, or other  
severe reactions. 
 The  occurrence  of  Grade  3  infusio n-related  reactions  (e.g.,  Prolong ed  infusion 
related reactions-not rapid ly respons ive to symptomatic  medi cation and/or  brief 
interruption of  infusion)  also require  the infusion to be p ermanently termin ated.

Additional Medications 
Patients m ay be medicated duri ng treatment as ind icated in the judg ment of the tr eating physician to 
control  potential infusion  or hypersensitivity responses.  For anaphylactic reactions, appropriate 
medical measures (e.g., epinephrin e, antihistamin es, hydrocortisone, and i.v. fluids) should  be taken. 
Such a subject should  not receive additional  study drug and should  be discontinu ed from the study. 
Naus ea, Vomiting and Diarrhea 
Gastroin testinal toxicity may be dose limiting with this study agent.  Hospit al or institutional 
guidelines  may exist and should  be consulted  for recommended treatment of these  conditions in 
patients received cancer therapy. Several major  oncology organizations have also provided 
compr ehensive  guidelines for optimal medi cal management  of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea 
with c ancer treatment. As of this w riting, guideli nes from these organizations are not str atified by 
toxicity Grade. A partial list of the major medi cations is provided  below, but the hospital/ institution 
guidelines  or the references below should  be consu lted for more  detailed info rmation as to 
management of  these  conditions.  
Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to  IMMU-132 treatment  (e.g., abdom inal 
cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedi cation (e.g. Atropine) f or 
subsequ ent treatments.

7.4.5. Dosing Schedul e 
All patients receive IMMU -132 to be admin istered in the on going Phase II study at 10 mg/kg 
weekly for 2 consecutive weeks (2 weekly doses plus 1 week witho ut treatment repr esents a 
single 3 week cycle) . Treatment c an be continued without a r est period in the ab sence of progress ion 
of di sease or unacceptab le toxicity. Plann ed deviations in treatment schedule are a llowab le up to 7 
days due to holidays, vacations or perso nal reasons. 
7.4.6. Dose Reduction and Termin ation Guideline s 
The major toxicities of IMMU -132 are expected to be gastrnintestinal symptoms and 
hematologic suppr ession. A ll patients are closely mon itored over the course of their ti·eatment. 
NCI CTC AE v4.0 is u sed to grade all adverse events and to prov ide the following dose 
reduction, delay or cessat ion guidelines in the event of tr eatment-rel ated toxicity. 
In the ongoing Phase II study, patie nts will receive 10 m g/kg IMMU -132 once week ly for 2 
consecutive weeks followed by 1 week rest in cycles of 21 days, with ti·eatment continued in the 
absence of progression or unaccepta ble toxicity. Neutropenia, GI t oxicity, and al opec ia were the 
most common toxicities in Phase I testing. A ll patie nts will be closely mon itored over the course 
of the ir ti·eatment, with NCI CTCAE v4.0 u sed to grade all adverse events and to prov ide dose 
reduction, delay or cessa tion guidel ines in the event of toxic ity.

7.4.7.  Biopsy specimens 
At the discretion of treating p hysician, patients who have biopsiable  lesion(s)  and consented to 
biopsy(ies) will provide  before and during  the study as many tumor metastasis  core biopsy samples 
(~0.2 to 0.5 cm3) as possible .  
Procedure for Handling Core Biopsies  
Samples should be shipped to Immunomedics to perform research assays intended to detect a variety 
of biomarkers, .  The 
purpose of this testing is to develop a database that will be used to assess biomarker status versus 
anti-tumor   response to IMMU -132.  Immunomedics recommends investigators p articipating in the 
collection of core biopsy samples consult with their institutional Pathology Department for the 
processing and handling of specimens.  While some of the testing can be performed on 
conventionally preserved specimens ( i.e., fixed in 10% buffered formalin), other assays require fresh 
tissue that should be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or another suitable method typically used by 
Pathology Departments to prepare frozen tissues for RNA, protein, and microscopic examination.  
Thus, Immunomedics is requesting both formalin -fixed and fresh/frozen tissues according to the 
procedure described below:

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 79 
 If possible, obtain 4 -6 core biopsy samples  from sites of confirmed cancer .  If 4 cores are obtained, 2 
should be placed in 10% buffered for malin, the other 2 should be flash frozen (6 cores, split 3+3; 2 
cores, split 1+1; odd number cores, process more by flash freezing).  
a. 10% buffered formalin :  Place specimens in suitable leak -free container.  Add enough 
formalin to cover completely.  Ensure  specimen is completely immersed.  Sample can be 
stored at room temperature or in refrigerator prior to shipping.  Sample should remain in 
the fixative at least overnight before shipping.  When shipping, the vessel containing the 
tissue should be filled wi th formalin as much as possible so that tissue will remain in 
contact with the formalin.  
b. Flash -frozen:  Tissues processed in this manner are best handled by the 
Pathology/Histology department.  The core biopsies should be placed in a small amount 
of saline  to transport.  The tissue is then gently blotted dry, placed in a cassette containing 
a small amount of a cryoprotective embedding media (e.g., OCT compound).  The 
cassette is then partially filled with this compound to cover tissue and then snap -frozen 
using a freezing spray or liquid nitrogen.  Ship to Immunomedics frozen  on dry ice .

 8. STUDY EVALU ATIONS  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated from adverse events, stand ard safety lab oratories (CBC with  
differential and platelet count,  serum chemistries,  and urinalysis), physical examination, vi tal 
signs, and EKG.  Adverse events will be classifi ed according to the MedDRA system  of preferred 
terms and system organ class, and all adverse events and abnormal laboratories will be classifi ed for 
severity using NCI CTCAE  v4.0 toxicity grades. Descriptive  statistics will be used to ch aracterize 
adverse events, cytopenias, and other abnormal laboratories. 
Efficacy will  be evaluated from CT scans (or MRI studies), using RECIST 1.1 criteria given in 
Appendix 4 to classify tumor response,  time to onset of  objective response, du ration of objective 
response, and time to p rogression.  Ov erall surviv al will be d etermined. 
Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  will be evaluated from serum samples using  an ELISA assay performed by 
the Sponsor.  The results will be characterized by stand ard PK parameters including  peak and trou gh 
values, area-under-the-curve (AUC),  maximum concentration (Cmax), and half-life (T1/2), if feasible, 
and summ arized using  descriptive  statistics. 
Immunogenicity will be determined from s erum samples using an ELISA assay performed by the 
Sponsor  for the occurrence of HAHA, that is, the presence of any human antibodies  against IMMU-
132.  The occurrences of any posit ive HAHA results will be characterized by descriptive stati stics. 
The UGT1A1 genotype (or another UGT1  genotype)  will be determin ed at baseline and compa red 
to hematolo gical toxicity (see Appendix 5 for procedure for whole blood s ample collection and 
shippin g).

 9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All patients must  be careful ly mon itored for AEs,  including clinical laboratory tests.  AEs should be  
assess ed in terms of their seriousn ess, intensity, and relationship  to the study drug. For consisten cy, 
events are to be graded usi ng the C TCAE version 4.0.  
An AE is any unto ward medi cal occurrence; the event does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship wi th that tr eatment or us age.  AEs include the  following: 
1. An exacerbation, or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing 
condition (other than condition under investi gation), including in termittent or episodic 
conditions.  
2. Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the  condition/indication under 
investi gation. 
3. A susp ected d rug interaction. 
4. An inte rcurrent illness. 
5. Any clinically significant laborato ry abnorm ality.  
An AE does not includ e: 
1. Anticip ated day-to-day fluctu ations of any pre-existing conditions,  includ ing the disease    
under study. 
2. Signs and symptoms of  the disease under study  that do not  represent a si gnificant wo rsening 
or exacerbation. 
3. Expected p rogression of  the dis ease under investigation. 
9.1. Serious Adv erse Events 
An AE that meets one or  more  of the  following criteria/outcom es is classif ied as serious:  
1. Fatal 
2. Life threatening 
3. Disabling/incapacitating 
4. Results in hospital ization or prolongs a hospital st ay 
5. A congenital abno rmality 
6. Other important medi cal events may also be consid ered SAEs if they may require  medi cal 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcom es listed above  (e.g., allergic 
bronchosp asm requiri ng intensive  treatment in an emergency room  or at home,  blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions  not resulting in  inpatient hospital ization, development  of drug 
dependency or drug abuse). 
An SAE do es not includ e: 
1. Progression of  the und erlying disease. 
2. Hospit alization for a routine clinical procedure as stipulat ed by the p rotocol.

9_2_ Reporting AEs/SAEs January 23. 2020 
The fuvestigato r is to report all AEs directly obse rved or spontaneously repoited by patients 
using concise medica l tennin ology on the appropriate CRF. Each patie nt will be questioned about 
AEs at each clinic or evaluatio n visit, asking, for exam ple, "Since your last clinic visit have you had 
any health problems?" 
The AE repo1 i ing period begins with the first dose of study diug and en ds with the last scheduled 
study evaluation or until all diug relate d toxicities and ongoing AEs have resolved, whichever is 
later. 
All AEs/SAEs or exposure during pregnancy must be reported to hnmun omedics or its designee , 
whether or n ot considered related to study medication using the a ppropriate fo1ms/proced ure. For 
SAEs , the Spon sor designated contact is to be notified by the fuvestigator , using the designate d 
f01m , within 24 hour s of awarene ss of the event. The initial repo1 i is to be followed by 
subm ission of more detai led SAE infonnation within 5 calendar days of the event.

A seve re reaction (e.g., a severe headache) would not be class ified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE(s) listed above. 
9 .5. Pregnancy 
The Sponsor must be notified of any pa tient or partner of a male pa tient becoming pregnant durin g 
the s tudy, and any pregnancy must be followed until comple tion or te1min ation of pregnancy . In the 
case of a live biith, the "no 1mality" of the n ewbo rn can be assessed at the time of bnih. The 
"no1mality'' of an abo1 ied fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspect ion unless pre-abortion 
laboratory findings ai·e suggestive of a congenital anomal y. 
9.6. Follow-up of Unre solved AEs 
All AEs should be followed until they are r esolved, or the Investigator assesses them as chronic or 
stable or the patie nt's paiti cipat ion in the trial en ds (i.e., until a final repo1 i is completed for that 
patie nt). Instmctions for repo1 iing changes in an ongoing AE during a patient's paiti cipation in the 
trial ai·e provide d in the instructions that acco mpany the AE CRFs. 
In addition, all AEs and SAEs assesse d by the Investigator as possib ly rel ated to the investigationa l 
medica tion/product should continu e to be followed even after the patie nt's paiiicipat ion in the ti· ial 
is over. Such events sho uld be followed until they resolve or until the Investigator assesses them 
as "chronic" or "stable." Resolution of such events is to be documented on the appropr iate CRF.

 10. STATI STICAL CO NSIDER ATIONS  
10.1. Overview  and Study Design 
This is an open label, non-random ized Phase I/II study in patients with a variety of 
refractory/relapsed metastatic epithelial cancers.  Prior use of irinot ecan or other camptothecin-
derived agents (e.g., topotecan) is allowed except when there is a known  history of anaphylactic 
reaction or ≥ Grade 3 GI toxicity to prior irinot ecan.  The primary objectives of Phase I are to 
evaluate  the safety and tolerability of several dose levels of the antibody-drug conjugate  IMMU-132 
(hRS7-SN-38).  The secondary obj ectives are to obtain  preliminary information  on efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics,  and immunogenicity. The primary objective in Phase II is the evaluation of the 
safety and efficacy of IMMU -132 administered in 3 -week treatment cycles, at a dose selected in 
Phase I; secondary objectives also include pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.  
The dose escalating phase has been completed  and 12 mg/kg (on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle 
identified as the MTD. The Phase II expansion is ongoing at 10 mg/kg dose level, including 
enrollment currently focusing on 5 expansion cohorts (TNBC, non -TNBC, NSCLC, SCLC, UC).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
10.3. Safety Analysis 
In general, all patients administered any dose  of study drug will be inclu ded in the evaluation of 
safety. 
Dose  escalation  continued for determin ation of the MTD,  but for the Phase II portion  of the p rotocol,  
the Sponsor  will select 2 dose levels; one where at least 2 of 6 patients can complete the first 
cycle without ≥  Grade 3 toxicity and the  other  a lower dose  level.

 The frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs)  will be tabul ated by Med DRA Preferred Term 
and System  Organ Class  (SOC)  for each dose group.  AEs will be classifi ed using the Med DRA

consolidat ed using the  worst CTCAE  grade and relationship  category obse rved prior  to classifi cation 
into each MedDRA SOC.  
AEs  leading  to  death  or  to  discontinu ation  from  treatment,  as  well  as  all  SAEs  will  be 
summarized separately, if appropriate.  The reasons for discontinu ation will also be sum marized for  
each dose  group using frequency distributions.  
Both actual and change-from-baseline data on vital signs will be sum marized using d escriptive 
statistics by dose group for each stu dy time-point. 
Rout ine safety laboratories, based on hematol ogy and serum chemistry data, will be listed by 
patient and summarized by descriptive statistics for each dose group,  if appropriate.  Laboratory test  
results will be graded according to CTCAE  severity grade when applicable.  The frequency 
distribution  of the worst CTCAE  grade observed will be tabul ated in a shift table for each parameter 
by dose group.   
Similarly, data on human anti-hRS7 antibody respons es (HAHA) will be listed and summarized by 
descriptive  statistics, if appropriate.  In addition, PK data documenting the clearance of SN-38 in  a 
select number  of patients will be used to gain preliminary information on the conjugat e’s 
clearance properties,  focusing on  the area under the curve for total SN-38 (IgG-bound  and free) and 
free SN-38.  This va lue potential ly could help ful for  assessi ng toxicity. 
Furthermore, the UGT1A1 g enotype will  be determined at baseline and compared to hematolo gical 
toxicity. 
10.4. Efficacy Ana lysis 
In general, all patients who were treated with at least one complete cycle of study drug and have 
available response  assessment  data will consti tute the efficacy population  and be includ ed in the 
analysis of efficacy. 
The objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response, will be tabulated and summarized by 
descriptive statistics for patients in each indication.  Progression -free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) will be summarized, either by tabulation, or,  if feasible, by Kaplan -Meier 
methodology. Other efficacy analysis may be performed as appropriate.  
10.5. Other  Eval uations 
Because of the  escalation  design, the dose lev els and the number of p atients entered on each dose 
level in this study cannot be determined in advance. Pre - and post-dose serum samples for peak and 
trough drug concentrations will be collected in all patients.  Once the MTD  level is know n, 
additional  patients accrued to that level will have additional  serum taken to better define the  rate of 
clearance after each injection.  This will provide adequate data to allow for the determination of  
potential  drug accumulation with repeated dosin g. Antibo dy pharmacokinetics  will be evaluated in a  
separ ate report b ased on blood levels of IMMU-132 from a  subgroup of patients as me asured by the

 Sponsor  in order to characterize concentration levels during  treatment (See Study Calendar for 
time points). 
Descriptive  statistics will be used to summarize both peak and trou gh values at each infusion as well 
as values measured at other  time-points.  Formal pharmacokinetic  analysis based on a non-
compartmental model  will be performed on patients with  adequate serum concentration data, if 
feasible.  Addit ional analyses may also be performed to evaluate  serum levels of SN-38, if feasible, 
and to study the  correlations between IMMU-132 concentrations and various tr eatment ou tcomes.

 11. TREATMENT COM PLIANCE 
IMMU-132 will be administered at scheduled  study centers under the supervision of the Investigator 
or sub-investigator(s).  The pharmacist will maintain  records of study drug receipt, preparation, and 
dispen sing, includi ng the applicable lot numb ers, patient’s height, weight and to tal drug 
administered in milligrams.  Any discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administered 
and the reason for the discrepancy must  be recorded in the source documents and on appropriate 
CRF. 
12. QUALI TY CONTROL  AND QUALI TY ASSURANCE 
The Sponsor  has ethical, legal and scientif ic obligations to follow  this study carefully in a 
detailed  and orderly manner in accordance with established  research principles and applicable 
regulations.  Monitoring  visits to the study site will be condu cted periodi cally during the  study to 
ensure  that good clinical practice (GCP) and all aspects of the protocol  are follow ed.  The trial site 
may also be subject to review  by the IRB/IEC, to quality assurance audits performed by 
Immunomedi cs, and/or to inspe ction by appropriate regulato ry authorities.  Investigator(s) and their 
relevant personn el must  agree to be available and particip ate with visits condu cted at a reasonable 
time in a reasonable mann er, and the Investigator/Institution must  guarantee direct access to source 
documents by Immunomedi cs and its designee, and appropriate regulato ry authorities.  
Regulato ry authorities  worldwide  may also audit the Investigator during or after the study.  The 
Investigator should  contact the Sponsor  immedi ately if this occurs and mu st fully cooperate with 
regulato ry authori ty audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable m anner.

 13. DATA HA NDLING AND RECORD  KEEPING 
13.1. Case  Report Forms 
A CRF  is required and must  be completed for each enrolled patient.  The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of Immunomedi cs and should  not be made available in any form to third 
parties,  except for authori zed representativ es of appropriate regulatory authorities,  without w ritten 
permission f rom Immunomedi cs. 
It is the Investigator's respons ibility to ensure completion and to review  and approve all CRFs. 
CRFs must  be signed by the Investigator or by an authori zed staff memb er.  These signatures 
serve to  attest that the information  contain ed on the CRFs is true.  
At all times, the Investigator has final personal respons ibility for the accuracy and authentici ty of all 
clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs.   Patient source documents  are the physician's 
patient records maintain ed at the study site.  In most  cases, the source documents  will be the 
hospita l's or the p hysician's  chart.  In cases where the source documents  are the  hospital  or the 
physician's chart, the info rmation  collected on the CR Fs must  match those  charts.  In some  cases, a 
portion  of the sour ce documents  for a given study site may be the CRFs.  The Investigator must  
agree which items will be re corded in the source documents  and for which items the CRF will  stand  
as the sour ce document. 
All entries in the CRF should be made  legibly with black ballpoint  pen.  Corrections to the CRF 
must  be made  by strik ing through the incorrect entry with  a single line and entering the correct 
information  adjacent to the incorrect data.  The  correction must  be initialed and dated by the 
person m aking the correction (ICH E6  4.9.3). 
13.2. Record Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or  audits from regulatory authorities  or Immunomedi cs, the Investigator 
agrees to keep records, including  the identi ty of all particip ating patients (sufficient info rmation  to 
link records, CRFs and hospital r ecords), all original signed informed consent forms, copies  of all 
CRFs, source documents,  and detailed records of treatment  disposi tion.  The r ecords must  be 
retained by the Investigator until 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH 
region and until there are no  pending or contemplat ed marketing applications in an ICH region, or 
until at least 2 years have elapsed since the  formal discontinu ation of clinical development of the 
investigational product. However, study records m ay be retained for a longer period if required by 
local regulations.  The Sponsor  is respons ible for  informing the Investigators when the se documents 
need no lo nger be retained. 
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdr aws from the study, Immunomedi cs 
should  be prospectively not ified.  The study records must  be transferred to an acceptable d esignee, 
such as another Investigator, another in stitution, or to Immunom edics. The Investigator must  obtain  
Immunome dics written p ermission b efore disposing  of any records.

 14. ADMINISTRATIVE REQU IREMENTS  
14.1. Good Clinical Practice 
The study will  be conducted in accordance with the ICH for GCP  and the appropriate local and 
national regulato ry requirement (s).  The  Investigator will be thoro ughly familiar with the appropriate  
use  of  the  study  medications  as  described  in  the  protocol  and  Investigator’s Brochure.  
Essential clinical documents  will be maintain ed to demonstr ate the validity of the stu dy and the 
integrity of the data collected.  Master files for this study should  be established  at the b eginning of 
the stu dy, maintained for the duration of  the study, and retained according to the appropriate 
regulations.  
14.2. Ethical Consi derations 
This study is plann ed to be condu cted both in the North America and in Europe, and European 
regulato ry agencies require that the study will be condu cted in accordance with ethical principles 
founded in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The trial will be performed in accordance with ICH GCP 
guidelines,  the Declaration of Helsinki, 18th World Medi cal Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 1964 and  
later revisions ( as mand ated for European trials ),  and applicable loc al regulatory requirements  and 
laws.  In the United  States, ethical protection is provided by compliance with GC Ps as d escribed in 
ICH and 21 CRF  50 (Prot ection of  Hum an Subjects). 
The Institutional  Review  Board (IRB) and the Institutional  Ethics Committee (IEC) will review all 
appropriate study document ation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well-being of the 
patients. The study will only be condu cted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtai ned. The  
Investigator is responsible for providing their IRB/IEC with any required study documents, p rogress 
reports and safety upd ates and is respon sible for notifying the IRB/IEC promptly of all SAEs 
occurring at the site. 
All correspon dence with the IRB/IEC should  be retained in the Investigator File. Copies  of 
IRB/IEC app rovals should be forwarded to Immunomedi cs or the  designee. 
The only circumstance in which an amendm ent may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immedi ate hazards to the patients.  In that 
event, the Investigator must  notify the IRB/IEC and Immunomed ics or its designee in writing 
within 5 wo rking days after the imp lement ation. 
14.3. Patient Information and Cons ent 
It is the respons ibility of the Investigator to give each patient (or the patient’s acceptable 
representative)  full and adequate verbal and written information  regarding the  objective and 
procedures of the trial including the  possible risks and benefits involved.  Written  patient 
information,  approved by the  IRB/IEC, must  be given to each patient before any trial-related 
procedure is undertaken.  During the consent process, the patient must  be informed about their 
right to withdr aw from the trial at any time.  The patient must  also be given ample time to read the 
written info rmed consent form and have all study-related questions answered to the satisfaction  of  
the  patient  (or  the  patient’s  legally  acceptable  representative ).  It is the respons ibility of the 
Investigator to obtain  a signature  from each patient, the patient’s legally acceptable r epresentative if 
applicable, and from the p ersons  condu cting the info rmed consent discussion  prior to undertaking 
any trial-related procedure.  The patient (or the patient’s legally acceptable  representativ e) must  be

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 79 
 given a copy of the signed and dated informed consent form. The  Investigator is also respons ible for 
providing  the patient (or the patient’s legally acceptable representative)  with  any  clinical  trial  
updates  that  may  affect  the  subject’s  willingness  to continue particip ation in the study.  The 
informed consent process must  be document ed in the p atient’s medi cal or sou rce chart. 
The written patient information  must  not be changed without  prior approval by Immunomedi cs and 
the IRB/IEC. 
Per ICH E6 4.3.3,  it is recommended that the Investigator notify the  patient’s primary care physician 
of the  subject’s particip ation in  the trial if the subject agrees to the Investigator info rming the p rimary 
care physician. 
14.4. Protocol Compliance 
The Investigator will condu ct the study in compliance with the protocol provided by Immunomedi cs, 
and given approval by the IRB/IEC, and the appropriate regulato ry authorities.  
Modifi cations to the protocol should  not be made  without  agreement  of both the Investigator and the  
Immunomedi cs.  Changes to the p rotocol  will require w ritten IRB/IEC approval prior to 
implem entation,  except wh en the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate  hazard(s) to the  
patients.  The IRB/IEC may provide,  if applicable, regulato ry authorities permit,  expedited review  
and approval for minor change(s) in ongoing stud ies that have the approval of the IRB/IEC.  
Immunomed ics will submit  all protocol modifications to the regulatory authorities  in accordance 
with the governing  regulations.  
When immedi ate deviation  from the protocol  is required to eliminate an immedi ate hazard(s) to 
patients, the Investigator will contact Immunomedi cs, if circumstances permit,  to discuss the plann ed 
course of action. Any departures from the protocol  must  be fully document ed in the patient’s CRF  
and sour ce document ation. 
14.5. Site Monitoring and On-Site Audits 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed  by Immunomed ics or its designee will be follow ed, in 
order to comply with  GCP  guidelines.  On-site review of patient’s CRFs for completeness and 
clarity, cross-checking with  source documents,  and review  of regulato ry documents  will be 
performed.  All  available source documents  should  be obtain ed by the Investigator and provided to 
the Sponsor or  designee  at each mon itoring visit. 
The site monitor will ensure that the investig ation is condu cted according to protocol  design and 
regulato ry requirements  by frequent communications. 
Regulato ry authorities,  the IRB/IEC, and/or  Immuno medics clinical quality assurance group or 
designee may request access to all source documents,  patients’ CRFs, and other  study document ation 
for o n-site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents  must  be guaranteed by the 
Investigator, who must pro vide support at all times for these  activities. 
14.6. Patient Data Protection 
Privacy Act Comp liance.  Information  collected in this clinical trial is subject to the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountabil ity Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as described in 45 CFR 160 and 45 
CFR 164.  The study Investigator is respons ible for informing  patients of their rights under 
HIPAA and obtaining  any necessary HIPAA authorizations.  In compliance with the provisions of

 that policy, Immunomedics or designee will not collect any protected health information  and will  
only collect de-identified health information.  Any clinical study information referred to in this 
section is und erstood to be compliant with the provisions of the  Privacy Act. 
The information obtain ed during the conduct of this clinical study is confidential, and disclosure to  
third parties other  than those  noted below is prohibited.  Information obtain ed during the condu ct of 
this study will be used by Immunomedi cs or designee in connection with the d evelopment of the 
study drug.  The study Investigator is obliged to provide Immunomedi cs or designee with complete 
test results and  all data developed in th is study.  This information may be disclosed  to other  
physicians particip ating in the study, to the FDA, or to national and local health authorities.  To 
ensure compliance with all current Federal Regulations and the ICH/GCP guidelines,  data generated 
by this study must  be available for inspection upon  request by representatives of the  FDA, national 
and local health authorities,  Immunomedi cs, designee, and the  IRB/EC for each stu dy site. 
14.7. Financial Disclosure 
In  accordance  with  21  CFR  Part  54,  FDA  requires  that  certain  financial  interests  and 
arrangements  between sponsors  of clinical investi gations be disclosed  in marketing applications.  
Since the results of this study may eventual ly be used in a marketing application, compliance 
with this Federal statute  is essential.  In order to comply with the provisions of this regulation,  
Immunomedi cs requests that every Investigator and sub-Investigator mentioned  on FDA Form 
1572  fill out a financial disclosure  form.  Und er the provisions of 21 CFR Part 54, the term 
clinical Investigator in cludes the spouse  and each dependent child of the  Investigator. 
The provisions of 21 CFR Part 54 sp ecify disclo sure of significant equity interests in the Sponsor that  
exceed $50,000,  or significant payments of other  sorts  made by the  Sponsor  to the Investigator that 
have a monet ary value of more than $25,000,  exclusive of the costs of condu cting the clinical study 
or other  clinical studies (e.g., grants to fund ongoing research, compens ation in the form of 
equipment or retainers for ongoing consultation),  during  the time the  clinical Investigator is 
carrying out the study or for 1 year following  the completion of the stu dy.  If a change in financial 
interest occurs throughout the study, the Investigator is obligated to no tify Immunomedi cs. 
To assist Immunomedi cs in providing the FDA with the required information,  please complete the 
financial dis closure form and return t he original signed copy.  All information provid ed in the 
financial disclosure  form will be regarded as strictly confidential and will only be disclosed  to the 
FDA. 
14.8. Sponsor Disconti nuation Criteria 
Immunomedi cs reserves the right to discontin ue the trial at any time  but intends only to exercise 
this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  After such a decision, the Investigator must  
contact all particip ating patients within a time period set by the  Sponsor.  As directed by the 
Sponsor,  all study materials will be collected and all CRFs complet ed to the greatest extent pos sible.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor s (RECIST) 1.1 
New Respo nse evaluation criteria in Solid tumors: Revised RECIST criteria [EJC 4 (2): 228-2 47, 
2009] are summ arized below . 
Mea surable /Non-Mea surable Lesions. Each tumor lesion or site of disease identified at baseline 
is catego rized as either a measurable lesion or a no n-measurable lesion according to the follow ing 
definitions. 
Lesion Type Qualif ying Definition 
Measurable Tumor lesions: Must be accura tely measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded ) with a minimum size of: • 
10mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 rmn.) • 10mm caliper 
measurement by clinica l exam (lesions which canno t be accura tely measured v.iith 
calipers should be recorded as non-measurable) • 20llllll by chest X-ray. 
Malignant lymph node s: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be 15rmn in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recormnended to be no greater than 5 llllll). At baseline and in follow-up , 
only the sho1t axis will be measure d and followed . 
Non-Measurable All other lesions, including small lesions (longe st diameter < 1 0rmn or pathological 
lymph nodes v.iith 10 to < 15mm sho1t axis) as well as tmly non-measura ble lesions. 
Lesions conside red tmly non-measurable include : leptomeningeal disea se, ascites, 
pleural or pericardia! effusion , inflalllllla tory breast disease, lymphang itic involvemen t 
of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measw ·able by reproducible imaging technique s. 
Specia l considerations regarding lesio n measurability: 
Bone lesio ns, cystic lesions, and l esions previously treated with local therapy require pa1ticular 
comment: Bone l esions: • Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are n ot considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone l esions. H oweve r, these techniqu es can be used to confnm the 
prese nce or disappea rance of bone lesio ns. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-bl astic lesio ns, with 
identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectio nal imaging techniqu es 
such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component m eets th e 
definition of measurability described above . 
Blastic bone lesions are non-m easurable. Cystic lesions: • Lesions th at meet the criteria for 
radiograp hically defined simple cysts shou ld not be considered as malignant lesions (n either 
measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts . • 'Cystic lesio ns' 
thought to represe nt cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesio ns, if they meet the 
definition of measurability described above. However , if non-cystic lesio ns are pr esent in the 
same patie nt, these are p refened for selectio n as target lesio ns. 
Lesions with prior local treatment: • Tum or lesio ns situated in a previously i1Tadiated area, or in 
an area subjected to other l oco-regional therapy, are usua lly not considered measurable unless 
there h as been demonst rated prog ression in the lesion. All measurements shou ld be recorde d in

meti· ic notatio n, us ing calipers if clinically assesse d. A ll base line evaluations should be perfo1med 
as close as possible to th e ti·eatment staii and never more than 4 weeks before the beginn ing 
of the treatment. 
Targ et Lesions. Tai·get lesions ai· e selecte d from measurable lesions at base line on the basis of 
their size and suitabi lity for accurate repeate d meas urements by imaging techniques or clinical 
judgme nt. The s um of the longest diamete r (LD) for all target lesio ns provide s a quantitative 
means of chai·acterizin g object ive tumo r respo nse to ti·eatment as follows: 
Evaluation Criteria Used fo1 · Cate2orizin2 Treatment Response of Tar2 et Lesions 
Response Cate201-y Definition 
Conmle te Response (CR) Disaooearan ce of all target lesions 
Partial Response (PR) > 30% decrease in the sum of the longe st diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD 
> 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions , taking as reference the 
Progressive Disease (PD) small est sum LD recorded since the treatmen t staited or the appearance of one or 
more new lesions . 
Stabl e Disease (SD) Neither sufficien t shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficien t increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatmen t started 
Non-Target Lesions. Non-target lesions ai· e other lesions (or sites of disease) not identified as 
target lesions at baseli ne. These include both non-meas urable lesions as well as measurab le lesions 
exceed ing the maximum number allowed per organ or in total. The r espo nse of non- tai·get 
lesions to treatme nt is evaluated on the basis of their presence or absence as follows: 
Evaluation Criteria Used for Cate 2orizimz Treatment R esponse of Non-Tar2et Lesions 
Respon se Cate2ory Definition 
Complete Respons e (CR) Disapp eai·ance of all non-target lesions and normaliza tion of tumor mai·ker 
levels initially above upper limits of normal 
Progre ssive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non-target lesions 
Incomple te Response/Stable Persistence of one or more non-tai·get lesion(s) or/and main tenance of tumor 
Disease (SD) marker level above the normal limits 
New Lesions. New lesions n ot present at baseline should be recorded at time of occunence. 
Overall Response. The overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
ti·eatme nt until disease prog ression/recu n ence (taking as reference for progres sive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the ti·eatme nt staiie d). To be assigned a status of PR or 
CR, changes in tumo r measureme nts must be confnmed by repeat assessments that shou ld be 
perfonned 4 weeks after the cr iteria for response ai·e first met. In the case of SD, follow-up 
meas uremen ts must have met the SD criter ia at least once with a minimum interval of at least 6-8 
weeks from study entry

requiring discontinua tion of treatment should be classified as having "symp tomatic deteriora tion" at that time, 
with every effo1t made to document the objective progression , even after discontinua tion of treatment. 
Duration of Response. The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recmTent or 
prog ressive disease is objec tively docmnented (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measuremen ts recorded since the treatment staiied). Stable disease is measured from the

measuremen ts recorded since the tr eatment staiied .

Procedure for  Submitting Samples for Tissue  Testing for IMMU-132 
 
1.   Tissue testing can be done on p araffin embedded tumor biopsies or other p araffin 
embedd ed archival  tissue (e.g. lymph nodes).  Smears, touch p reps or other cytology 
specimens are NOT acceptabl e. 
 
2.  Send the at least 10   unstained histologic sections on posit ively charged 
immunohistoch emistry slides (preferably Vision  Biosystems  slides) OR p araffin block. 
Your  hospita l's histology lab  is familiar with these terms and should  be able to provide 
this material. If paraffin block  is sent, any unus ed sample will be sent back to you. If you 
have any questions, pl ease call the Clin ical Research Department below.  
 
3.   Label the samples with the patient’s study identification  # and initials and patient’s 
diagnosis. 
 
4.   Noti fy your CRA  that samples are being shipp ed. Tissue  Sample Shipment forms will be 
provided, and a copy of this fo rm should be in cluded with the shipm ent. 
 
5.   Ship using  Federal Express ove rnight (airbills provid ed by Immunomedi cs). 
 
6.  Shippe rs must  also comply with  all applicable local, state and federal laws governing 
packing, marking and labeling of shipments of blood  and blood  products regardless of

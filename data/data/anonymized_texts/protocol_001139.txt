CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 1  1. Introduction  
1.1. Background 
Rhinitis is a very common condition throughout the world. In th e Unites States alone, it affects 
10-30% of the adult general population.  This accounts for 30-6 0 million people in the United 
States and the prevalence has been increasing in recent decades , making it the fifth most 
common chronic disease in the US.  Rhinitis is the inflammation  of the nasal mucosa affecting 
patients with at least one of the following distressing symptom s:  nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, 
sneezing, and nasal itching.   
The current standard of care to control this disease starts wit h pharmacologic interventions, 
typically beginning with over the counter medications.  Nasal s teroids (i.e. Flonase, Nasonex) 
and oral anti-histamines (i.e. C laritin, Allegra, Zyrtec) are t he mainstays of medical 
management.  They have their challenges, however, as they requi re daily use and have limited 
effectiveness, especially against  non-allergic rhinitis. Sedati ng anti-histamines such as Benadryl 
are used intermittently but the somnolent side effects are not usually well tolerated.   
Prescription medications are use d when OTC medication managemen t fails.  Oral steroids can 
be effective in the short term but carry more severe long-term side effects including 
immunosuppression, osteoporosis, Cushing syndrome and diabetes.   Adrenergic agents such as 
Afrin are effective but quickly result in tolerance and “reboun d” (recurrence and sometimes 
worsening of symptoms when off the medication). 
When pharmacological treatments do not provide adequate respons e, surgical techniques have 
also been developed to treat rhinitis. These techniques include  electrocautery, chemocautery, 
laser cautery, microdebrider turbinoplasty, radiofrequency abla tion, subtotal turbinectomy, 
total inferior turbinectomy, and submucosal resection. These pr ocedures primarily seek to 
address the nasal obstructive component through reduction of th e inferior turbinate.  
Use of various cryosurgical tools for destruction of tissue in the nasal passageway to treat nasal 
obstruction or symptoms of rhinitis have been reported in the l iterature.(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) Target 
nasal passageway locati ons that were subjected to cryosurgery i ncluded the nasal soft tissue 
covering the turbinates, which included nasal nerves. All studi es included patient-reported 
outcomes of nasal symptoms, whic h is a commonly accepted method  for demonstrating the 
effectiveness outcomes in the na sal passageway. Physicians also  performed visual assessments 
of nasal congestion and recorded the presence of complications including resolution of any 
adverse symptoms.  Although published reports reflect improvement in symptoms and a low 
rate of complications, endoscopic cryotherapy techniques and to ols have not been fully 
optimized to achieve consistent outcomes. 
Arrinex, Inc. has developed a novel cryotherapy device designed  specifically to facilitate a 
transnasal approach to allow cryoablation of unwanted tissue in  the nasal passageway.   
 FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan 
 
 
 
CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 2  1.2. Report of Prior Investigations 
A pilot clinical study was perfo rmed to evaluate the performanc e of the ClariFix device as a 
cryosurgical tool to treat subjec ts with chronic rhinitis. This  study was a prospective, multi-
center, single-arm interventional study of the ClariFix device.  The study protocol was reviewed 
and approved as a non-significant risk study by Quorum Review I RB. Three invest igational sites 
were selected in the United Stat es. All treatments were perform ed on consented awake 
subjects in an office setting by experienced otolaryngologists.  Subjects were seen in the office 
at 7, 30, and 90 days post-treatment for follow-up assessments.  Extended follow-up to a 
maximum of one-year post-treatment was conducted to assess the durability of treatment 
outcomes.  The primary safety endpoint for the study was the fr equency of serious device or 
procedure-related adverse events (SAEs). The primary efficacy e ndpoint was the change in 
subject reported nasal symptoms at the follow-up intervals rela tive to baseline. Nasal 
symptoms were assessed using the reflective Total Nasal Symptom  Scale (rTNSS) and a Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS). 
A total of twenty-seven (27) subjects were enrolled and receive d bilateral treatments.  
Treatments were successfully com pleted bilaterally with no comp lications in 100% of subjects 
(n=27) using injected or topical anesthesia in the office.  Twe nty-seven (27) subjects completed 
1-month follow-up and twenty-four (24) subjects completed 90-da y follow up (3 subjects were 
lost-to-follow-up).  Twenty-four (24) subjects participated in extended follow-up. Nasal 
symptoms assessed by rTNSS were significantly reduced at each f ollow-up interval compared to 
baseline. The average rTNSS score was reduced by 58% from 6.2 a t baseline to 2.6 at 30 days 
and maintained at 2.7 at 90 days (56% reduction). Extended foll ow-up data showed sustained 
improvements, with an average rTNSS of 2.3 at 180 days post-tre atment. Eighty-one percent 
(22/27) of subjects had at least a one-point improvement of rTN SS scores at 30 days and 79% 
(19/24) of subjects had improved rTNSS scores at 90 days. The V AS symptom data similarly 
demonstrated significant reductions in nasal symptoms. The aver age total VAS score was 
reduced by 50% and 53% at 30 and 90 days, respectively. There w ere no device or procedure-
related serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device effects reported during the 
course of the study. 
In this pilot study of 27 subjects, office-based treatment usin g the ClariFix device was 
demonstrated to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in reduc ing nasal symptoms in subjects 
with chronic rhinitis.  This study will build on those results a nd is designed to assess the safety 
and effectiveness of the ClariFix  device when used to ablate un wanted tissue in the nasal 
passageway of subjects with chronic rhinitis.  
1.3. Device Description 
The ClariFix device is a handheld cryosurgical device which pro vides focal, controlled freezing to 
the target tissue.  In order to deliver treatment, a nitrous ox ide canister is inserted into the 
device.  The device’s cryoprobe is placed in contact with the t arget tissue, under direct 
visualization.  The low profile s emi-flexible cannula allows th e user to maintain visibility of the 
FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan 
 
CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3cryoprobe and apply pressure to target tissue with the cryoprob e to ensure contact throughout 
the treatment.  Once the cryoprobe is in the desired position, the physician manually initiates 
the flow of cryogen and ablates unwanted tissue.  The nitrous o xide gas is contained within the 
cryoprobe and allowed to exit the device at the handle away fro m the subjects.   
The sterile device is provided wi th two 10-ml non-sterile cryog en cannisters.  The cryogen 
canisters are provided separately.  The canisters contain enoug h cryogen for 60 seconds (10-ml) 
of ablation time.  
The ClariFix device consists of a Cryoprobe, Cannula, On/Off va lve, Handle, & Cap.  The device is 
provided sterile and designed for single patient use.

1.4. Regulatory Status 
The ClariFix™ device (K162608) is an FDA 510(k) cleared Class I I cryosurgical tool indicated for the 
destruction of unwanted tissue during surgical procedures, incl uding in adults with chronic 
rhinitis.   
2. Risk/Benefit Analysis 
The Sponsor has undertaken a comprehensive risk-benefit analysi s. 
2.1. Benefits 
Use of the ClariFix device as a t ool during cryosurgery may red uce the symptoms of chronic 
rhinitis.  Improvement in rhinit is symptoms may improve patient s’ quality of life and may 
improve work or school productivity.  This study may provide va luable information as to the 
underlying mechanisms of rhinitis , which may enable the develop ment of more effective 
devices in the future.

3.8. Screening Procedures (Visit 1) 
The screening evaluation will take  place up to 30 days prior to  the study procedure. Potential 
study subjects will be pre-screen ed against study eligibility c riteria, including confirmation of 
prior allergy test (if none, an allergen-specific IgE antibody blood test will be required). 
Endoscopic assessment will be performed to evaluate anatomic su itability, and photographic 
and/or video documentation w ill be obtained if possible.  
A member of the site’s Research Team will explain the study to the subject and seek the 
subject’s written informed consent.  The subject must sign the consent form prior to 
enrollment. This form must have p rior approval of the Instituti onal Review Board (IRB).  
All female subjects of childbearing potential will be asked if they are pregnant at the screening 
visit.  If the subject is pregnant, they will be excluded from participation.  
The investigator and/or designee will document the subject’s me dical information and 
endoscopic observations on the Screening Case Report Form (CRF) , as well as subjective 
assessment of nasal symptoms usin g the rTNSS (reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score) 
described in Section 3.11.3.  
At the time of the screening visit, subjects will report any pr ior and/or ongoing use of any nasal 
sprays. Subjects will also be instructed not to take nasal anti cholinergic sprays (e.g., Atrovent) 
beginning a minimum of 3 days prior to the procedure and throug hout their study participation 
(See Section 3.12). Subjects may continue to use other nasal me dications, but will be instructed 
not to introduce any new category of nasal sprays into their me dication regimen for the duration 
of their study participation (changes in medication brand are a cceptable).  
Subjects will be instruc ted not to take anti-coagulant medicati ons for 2 weeks prior to the 
procedure, and 2 weeks after the procedure. 
3.9. Study Treatment (Visit 2) 
The study treatment is described below. Further details can be found in the instructions for use 
document.  
 Pre-Procedure Evaluation  
The baseline evaluation will take place on the day of the study  procedure. All female subjects of 
childbearing potential will be asked to take a pregnancy test ( urine).  If the subject is pregnant, 
FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan 
 
CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8they will not be considered eligib le to participate in the stud y.  If a subject becomes pregnant 
after the study treatment, during the study follow-up period, t he subject shall be withdrawn 
from the study and will not underg o any further testing. The su bject will be asked to rate their
nasal symptoms using the rTNSS. I f the subject does not meet th e minimum symptom score 
requirement ( Table 1 , Inclusion criterion b), the s ubject will not be considered el igible to 
participate in the study.  
If all the eligibility criteria are met, and the subject has si gned the IRB-approved informed 
consent document, the subject shall be considered enrolled. The  investigator and/or designee 
will document the subject’s medical information on the Baseline  CRF. Subjects will also 
complete the quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) described in Section 3.11.4. Subjects shall 
then undergo treatment with the study device. 
 Preparation for Procedure 
The subject will be positioned in an upright or partially recli ned sitting position.  The subject will 
then undergo appropriate local anesthesia procedure, per physic ian preference. Baseline 
images of the intended treatment sites will be collected endosc opically whenever possible.      
 Cryotherapy Procedure 
Video documentation including recording of intra-procedural end oscopic visualization as well as 
external video documentation of the procedure may be performed.   Subject pain/discomfort 
during each treatment will be ass essed using Wong-Baker FACES p ain scale (See Section 3.11.2).

 Clinical Evaluation  
Investigators will conduct a clin ical evaluation of study subje cts at each study visit and findings 
will be documented.   
Evaluation may be made by patient interview regarding their sym ptoms.   
At the Screening, Procedure (pre- and post- procedure), 30 Day and 90 Day Visits, the 
evaluation will include physical exam of the treatment area und er endoscope.  The treatment 
FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan 
 
CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13area will be assessed for bleeding, crusting, and swelling usin g a scale of 0 to 3 (0=None, 
1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe).  When endoscopic assessment i s performed, photographic 
and/or video documentation will be obtained, if possible. An en doscopic exam may be 
completed beyond the 90-day time point at the discretion of the  Investigator in the event of a 
study-related adverse event. 
When possible, at the 180-, 270- and 365-Day and the 18- and 24 -Month Follow-up visits, the 
clinical documentation will incl ude an investigator’s assessmen t of improvement of symptoms 
of rhinitis since time of treatment with ClariFix device using a 7-point Likert12 scale as follows: 
x Very Much Improved 
x Much Improved 
x Minimally Improved 
x No Change 
x Minimally Worse 
x Much Worse 
x Very Much Worse 
Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale 
Subject reported pain/discomfort at the time of treatment will be assessed using a 0 to 5-point 
Wong-Baker FACES pain scale13 (Figure 3 ).  
 
Figure 3.  0 to 5-Point Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale  
 
 Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) 
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be assessed based on th e four-symptom reflective Total 
Nasal Symptom Score14, 15 (rTNSS). rTNSS is a validated s ymptom severity scoring system that 
consists of the sum of four (4) individual subject-assessed sym ptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal 
congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. Each item is scored on  a scale of 0 to 3 and is based on 
the subject’s evaluation of symptom severity over the preceding  24 hours at study visits.  The 
four-symptom rTNSS has a possible score of 0-12.  
Subjects will be asked to assess their symptoms at baseline (Pr ocedure Visit) and at all follow-
up points. The subjects will be a sked to assess each symptom in dividually (runny nose, 
congestion, nasal itching, sneezing) in the following manner:

0 = None, no sign / no <symptoms> evident 1= Mild, sign/<symptom> present, but minimal awareness, easily tolerated
2= Moderate symptoms, definite awareness of sign/<symptom> that  is bothersome 
but tolerable 
3= Severe, (sign/<symptom> that is hard to tolerate, causes int erference with 
activities of daily living and/or sleeping) 
Subject may be reminded of baseline score prior to treatment, a s appropriate.  
 Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) 
At baseline (pre-procedure) and post-procedure at the of the 90- day, 18 and 24 Month 
timepoints, the Rhinoconjunctivi tis Quality of Life Questionnai re16 (RQLQ) will be administered. 
The RQLQ is a validated tool that measures the functional (phys ical, emotional, and social) 
problems associated with rhinit is.  At baseline, subjects will select 3 activities and shall use the 
same 3 activities chosen durin g baseline RQLQ assessment for al l subsequent RQLQ 
assessments.  
 Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire 
A subject satisfaction questionn aire will be administered at th e 90-day visit. 
In order to evaluate changes in the subjects’ usage of rhinitis  medications, subjects’ medication 
usage will be assessed at baseline and at each follow-up interv al.  
 Subject Treatment Questionnaire 
The Subject Treatment Questionnaire (STQ) is intended to better  understand the subject’s 
experience at the time of the treatment visit.  The results of the STQ will be reviewed by the 
Sponsor to help understand the subject’s experience.   
The STQ will be administered via phone by an independent consul tant, to ensure unbiased 
reporting of the patient experience.  
The STQ will include a verbal r eport of subject’s recall of occ urrence of pain and/or discomfort, 
pain numeric rating scale (NRS)17 , severity and duration reporti ng of pain and/or discomfort.  
The NRS utilizes an 11-point scale of zero to 10.  Subjects ver bally report pain on the scale of 0 
to 10 with zero representing “no  pain” and 10 representing “wor st pain imaginable”.  
3.12. Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medication will be doc umented for all subjects for medication usage within thirty 
(30) days prior to consent and through duration of study partic ipation.  Medication collected 
should include, but is not limited to, medications taken for: 
FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan

rhinitis, allergies, asthma, mig raines, antibiotic for sinusiti s, GERD, etc.);  
x medications due to a study-related Adverse Event; and 
x  any medication, as deemed by the investigator, to present a sa fety risk (i.e., 
anticoagulants, beta-blockers, etc.).  
Subjects will be instructed to not use nasal anticholinergic sp rays (e.g., Atrovent) beginning a 
minimum of 3 days prior to the procedure and throughout their s tudy participation. 
Additionally, subjects will be ins tructed to not take anti-coag ulant medications for 2 weeks prior 
and 2 weeks following the procedure. 
4. Adverse Events 
4.1. Adverse Events 
All adverse device effects (ADE) or procedure-related adverse e vents (AE) will be documented, 
including Unexpected Adverse Device Effects (UADE).  Additional ly, all Serious Adverse Events 
(SAE), regardless of device- and/or procedure-relatedness, and all ENT, head and neck, 
respiratory, and/or airway related AEs will be documented.  
Adverse events (AE), as defined above, will be assessed continuo usly throughout the study. An 
adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, regardless of 
whether the event is related to the device or is a known risk.  
 Each Investigator shall be responsible for determination of the  causal relationship of all adverse 
events from his/her investigational site to the device and/or p rocedure, as well as any pre-
existing conditions.  Each Investigator is responsible for moni toring the safety of the subjects 
enrolled.  The Sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety ev aluation of the product(s) across 
all sites. The Sponsor shall determine whether an adverse event  is reportable and will promptly 
notify all participating investigators and regulatory authoriti es, as appropriate, of findings that 
could affect adversely the safety of subjects, impact the condu ct of the trial or alter the IRB’s 
approval opinion to continue the trial. 
 Adverse Device Effect (ADE) 
Any sign, symptom, or disease in a study subject that occurs du ring the course of a clinical trial 
that is determined by the investigator to have a causal relatio nship or possible causal 
relationship with the device under investigation. 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health and safety or any life-thr eatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem , or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the i nvestigational plan or application, or

5.2. Statistical Considerations 
 Statistical Overview 
This trial is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multi-cent er clinical evaluation of the safety  
and effectiveness of the ClariFix™ device when used to ablate u nwanted tissue in the nose of 
subjects with chronic rhinitis.  Effectiveness will be evaluate d by analyzing the 90-day change 
from baseline in the 4-symptom rTNSS.   
 Statement of Hypothesis 
The statistical null hypothesis is that the mean 90-day within- subject change is zero; there is no 
effect of the device on rTNSS. 
 Analysis Populations 
The following subject populations will be created: 
Safety (Safety):  All subjects enrolled who underwent the devic e procedure, regardless 
of outcome. 
Efficacy:   All subjects enrolled who had at least one follow-up evaluation  under this 
protocol.  
Per Protocol (PP):  A subset of the Efficacy subjects who under went the device 
procedure and do not have major protocol deviations. 
General Analytical Considerations
Continuous data will be summarize d using descriptive statistics :  n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum. Con tinuous variables that are reco rded using approximate 
values (e.g., < or >) will be rep laced by the closest exact val ue for the calculation of summary 
statistics.  Categorical variabl es will be summarized using fre quency counts and percentages. 
For ordinal-scaled variables, a combination of the above may be  employed as appropriate:  
frequency and percentage of observations within a category and means and standard 
FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan 
 
CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18deviations of the scores of the categories.  For categorical an d ordinal variables, percentages 
will be calculated based on non-missing data. 
Endpoint Analyses 
In this single arm, open-label study, the focus of the primary efficacy endpoint analysis is on the 
magnitude and direction of change over 90 days in the 4-symptom  rTNSS.  The primary safety 
endpoint analysis is on the incidence of procedure- or device-r elated SAEs and UADEs over 90 
days post-treatment (however, all AEs will be tracked and repor ted over the entire duration of 
the study). The statistical methodology is targeted to employ t he paired sample t-test and/or its 
nonparametric equivalent, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The tw o-tailed D-level is set at 0.05. 
No imputation of data will be performed. 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population.   All efficacy analyses will be 
performed on both the Efficacy and PP cohorts, as necessary.  
 Sample Size Estimation and Assumptions 
Assuming a two-tailed D-level of 0.05, and a standard d eviation of the within-subject changes 
from baseline of 2.5, 68 evalua ble subjects will yield 90% powe r to detect a one-point change in 
the 4-symptom rTNSS.  To account for possible dropouts and prot ocol violations, the 
enrollment target will be a total sample size of N=100. 
5.3. Protocol Adherence 
The study investigators are responsible for performing the stud y in compliance with the 
protocol.  Non-adherence to the protocol will be documented as a protocol deviation. A study 
site with a large number of violations and/or deviations may be  terminated from the study at 
the Sponsor’s discretion. 
 
Protocol deviations that may res ult in significant additional r isk to the subject (e.g., enrollment 
of a subject who does not meet the study criteria), or non-adhe rence to Good Clinical Practices 
(GCP) that may impact patient safety (e.g., failure to obtain p roper consent prior to performing 
study procedures) should be reported to the study Sponsor and t he IRB, if applicable, within 5 
working days of occurrence. 
6. Study Management and Quality Control  
6.1. Study Data Collection   
Source documentation and Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be provi ded to all participating sites.  
CRFs may be completed on paper or via electronic data capture.  Data will be reviewed by study 
staff to identify inconsistent or missing data and to ensure co mpliance with the study protocol. 
Investigators will be responsible for the accurate and timely c ompletion of CRFs during the trial.  
FROST:  Clinical Investigational Plan 
 
CT-0003 V2.0, 04Dec2018     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 196.2. Confidentiality 
All information and data concerning study subjects will be cons idered confidential and handled 
in compliance with all applicable  regulations. Only authorized s ite staff, the study Sponsor or 
the Sponsor’s designee, IRB, and any relevant regulatory agency  will have access to these 
confidential files. All data used  in the analysis, reporting an d publication of this clinical trial will 
be maintained without identifiable reference to the subject. An y data that may be published in 
abstracts, scientific journals, or presented at medical meeting s will reference a unique subject 
code and will not reveal the subject’s identity.  
6.3. Safety Data Monitoring 
The sites’ principal investigato rs will be responsible for revi ewing and adjudicating all adverse 
events occurring at their sites throughout the course of the st udy. In addition, an independent 
medical monitor will assess the safety data at appropriate inte rvals during the course of the 
study. Based upon the severity and frequency of adverse events,  including any SAEs or UADEs, 
the medical monitor will determine the continuation or terminat ion of the study based on an 
evaluation of the risks and benefits of the study. 
The study will be terminated if, in the opinion of any of the i nvestigators or the medical 
monitor, the safety data indicates unacceptable risks to study participants. Unacceptable risk 
will be identified by the occurrence of adverse events that exc eed the anticipated level of 
severity or frequency. 
6.4. Investigator Responsibilities 
 General Responsibilities  
Investigators are responsible fo r ensuring the investigation is  conducted according to all signed 
agreements, the Protocol, and ap plicable regulations.  The inve stigator must protect the rights, 
safety, privacy and welfare of the subjects under the Investiga tor’s care. Investigators will 
assume overall responsibility and accountability for study site  staff and for the clinical data 
obtained during the study.   
 Investigator Records   
The investigator and study staff must maintain attributable, le gible, contemporaneous, original 
and accurate records relating to the conduct of the investigati on.  Records must be retained for 
the period of time defined in the clinical research agreement.   
These records must be available and suitable for inspection at any time by Sponsor 
representatives (monitors), the reviewing IRB, or the relevant regulatory agency. The 
Investigator will supply access to  study-related medical record s, original laboratory data, and 
other records and data as they relate to the trial.  The invest igator will ensure that both he/she

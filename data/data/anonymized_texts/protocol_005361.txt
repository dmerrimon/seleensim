3 BACKGROUND / RATIONALE 
3.1 SARS -CoV-2 Testing in the United States  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States suggests laboratory testing 
to identify the SARS- CoV-2 virus that causes COVID -19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for select Real -Time RT -PCR Diagnostic Panels that detect 
RNA  specific  to SARS- CoV-2. This study  will use the Exact  Sciences  Laboratories  (ESL) SARS- CoV-2 (N 
gene detection) Test       ,   
The ESL SARS- CoV-2 (N gene detection) Test provides a qualitative result based on detection of RNA. 
The test measures the presence of two regions of the RNA related to the SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
protein N gene (N1 and N2), which  are specific  for this virus. Both N1 and N2 RNA  must  be detected for a 
positive result and are indicative of active infection by the virus. A positive result does not rule out other infections. Detection of only one of the two viral RNAs results in an Inconclusive test. Negative results  
(Not detected) do not rule out infection and should be used in combination with clinical and epidemiological  information for patient management decisions. The  ESL SARS-CoV-2  (N gene detection) 
Test also measures RNA related to ribonuclease P, which is a human protein and acts as an internal 
reference. The absence of the viral and human RNA would lead to an invalid test result.

Table  1: Possible  ESL SARS -CoV-2 (N gene  detection)  Test  results  based  on RNA  detected.  
 
While the CDC provides guidelines for the collection of a wide range of upper and lower respiratory 
samples, the ESL SARS-CoV -2 (N gene detection) Test is for use with upper respiratory (nasal swab) 
samples  from subjects  receiving  a clinically  indicated COVID-19 Test.[1]  The use of the nasal  swab that 
meets CDC recommendations has advantages, including avoiding the supply issues for specialized sample collection devices, such as the nasopharyngeal swab. Sample collection is also easier with a nasal swab. While the supply shortages could be transient, the collection methods of washes and aspirates potentially increase the risk of exposure for healthcare workers.[2]

Protocol  2020 -06 v1.0 7  
  
Emphasis has been placed on increasing overall testing availability, and the access to at home SARS - 
CoV-2 specimen collection (without healthcare worker supervision) will significantly improve the 
effectiveness  of public  health tools  in preventing  spread  of the disease during this pandemic  in the United 
State s. 
3.2 Usability  of the SARS -CoV-2 Test Specimen Collection  Materials  
The SARS- CoV-2 Specimen Collection Materials (Section 6 ) allow for self -collection of a nasal swab 
specimen  and return to a testing  laboratory,  which  will enable at home  collection.  The Mate rials include 
Instructions for Use (IFU), which are a straightforward, step-by -step guide. The usability of the IFU is a 
critical  factor  in the success  of at-home testing  and is  the focus of  this clinical  study.  An IFU with  a high 
completion rate that provides samples with sufficient  quality and quantity of specimen for SARS- CoV-2 
testing is necessary.  
4 OBJECTIVES  AND  ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Objectives 
4.1.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary  objective is to determine the usability  of the SARS- CoV-2 Specimen Collection  Materials  for 
at-home collection and mailing of sample to the testing laboratory.  
4.1.2  Secondary Objective  
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate perceived usability of the IFU as well as 
comprehension by the subject, identify problems (e.g., use errors, delays, close calls) that occur while 
following  the IFU, evaluate root causes  of problems,  and develop strategies  to mitigate  those risks going 
forward.  
4.2 Endpoints  
4.2.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary  endpoint  is the percent  of samples  from the fully enrolled cohort  to return a valid SARS -CoV- 
2 test result (positive, not detected, or inconclusive). The target is 80% as an acceptable rate of success given the first -time task completion for minimally trained users.  
4.3 Other  Pre-Specified Analyses 
Other  pre-specified  analyses  include 
• characterization of subjects’  self-reported ease of use of the Specimen Collection Materials,  
• acceptable answers  on general  comprehension of the IFU, 
• observer -reported problems  associated  with following  the IFU, 
• j  g  g  
•        
• evaluation of root causes  of problems  associated with user tasks,  including but not limited  to 
critical tasks, to develop risk mitigation strategies.

5 STUDY  DESIGN  
This study is a prospective observational human factors usability study designed to evaluate the IFU in 
the SARS- CoV-2 Specimen  Collection  Materials  based on the successful  completion of self-collection  of 
a nasal swab sample, which includes a valid SARS -CoV-2 test result.  
Subjects with a range of education levels and ages but without medical, laboratory, or COVID -19 
specimen self -collection experience will be recruited. Subject participation is up to one day from 
enrollment to completion. The specimens collected by the subjects will be tested in the laboratory for 
SARS- CoV-2. Subjects will remain blinded to the test results. The study will be considered complete 
when  approximately  30 self-collected nasal  swab  samples  have  corresponding SARS- CoV-2 test results 
(positive, not detected, inconclusive, invalid, or unable to be processed).  
 
 
6 STUDY  MATERIALS  
6.1 SARS -CoV-2 Specimen Collection  Materials  
The SARS- CoV-2 Specimen Collection Materials is a single -use convenience kit comprised of a sterile 
individually wrapped nasal swab (polyester tip with plastic handle) and a 2 ml transport tube with 0.9% 
saline transport medium, packaged together in a single container not intended to be unwrapped or unsealed before it is used by the end user, an individual undergoing testing for COVID -19. A biohazard 
bag, absorbent pad, and UN3373- labelled shipping container  are also provided. Instructions  for Use (IFU) 
are also provided  (Appendix  2.0). The SARS- CoV-2 Specimen Collec tion Materials  is for use outside of  a 
clinical setting.  
6.2 Critical  Tasks for the SARS -CoV-2 Specimen  Collection  Materials  
A Use-Related Failure  Modes  Effect  Analysis  (FMEA)  approach was used  to determine potential  hazards 
and their associated risks during use of the SARS -CoV-2 Specimen Collection Materials. For each 
activity, the following high -level questions were asked:  
 Do users  correctly collect  nasal  swab  samples?  
 Do users  correctly prepare  samples  for shipment?  
 Do other  aspects  of use of the SARS-CoV-2 Specimen Collection  Materials  impact  the receipt  of 
usable nasal swab samples at ESL? 
 How easy  or difficult  is it to understand and use the IFU  in the SARS- CoV-2 Specimen  Collection 
Materials to perform tasks?  
 
The activities in the workflow described in the IFU were used to determine tasks to be evaluated in this usability  study.  Each  task was then assigned a rating of “critical”  or “essential,”  based on a human factors 
risk assessment done at Exact Sciences. Critical and essential tasks are defined as follows.  
 Critical  tasks  are those  in which  use errors  or failure  to complete would have  a negative clinical 
impact, such as inaccurate or delayed test results.  
o Failure  to successfully complete a critical  task results in  a use error  or performance 
failure. 
 Essential  tasks  represent  behaviors  that are important  to the overall  use of the SARS- CoV-2 
Specimen Collection Materials but do not pose an immediate risk to the user.

8 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
8.1 Overview  
Subjects who provide informed consent will be observed while following the IFU for the SARS -CoV-2 
Specimen Collection Materials in a setting that simulates a large surface area, such as a kitchen or 
bathroom counter or a tabletop. The room will include common items such as hand sanitizer, pens, 
pencils,  paper  towels,  and a wastebasket.  In the event  a sink is not available,  a large bowl labeled “SINK” 
will be provided next to the hand sanitizer. Subjects will also provide feedback on the usability of the IFU  
by completing a survey, answer comprehension questions, provide written feedback on the experience, and address questions from the observer about problems during use. The observer will be an employee of Exact Sciences.  
 
 
 
8.2 Enrollment  Figure 1: Overview  of study  procedures.  
Inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  will be reviewed.  After  subjects  have  provided  written  informed consent, 
demographic information will be obtained, and subject eligibility will be confirmed.  
Enrollment  and the use of the device  may occur  on the same  day. 
 
 
8.3 Observation for Problems  Using  SARS -CoV-2 Test Specimen Collection  Materials  
The subject  will be provided  with the SARS- CoV-2 Specimen  Collection  Materials that  include the IFU. An 
observer will watch the subject perform the tasks in the IFU without providing input or assistance. The observer will record the following information by IFU task:  
• Completed

• Free form observational  notes  
 
 
8.4 Subject Experience with SARS -CoV-2 Specimen  Collection  Materials  
Subjects  will take a survey  called  the After -Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ)  to evaluate perceived ease  of 
use.[3 -5] 
 
Figure 2: After -Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) 
Subjects  will have the opportunity  to provide  written  feedback  on their experience.  
Subjects  will be asked  questions  about  their experience  by the observer,  including their comprehension of 
the IFU (e.g.,  shipping instructions).  Follow  up questions to the subject  by the observer may be needed to 
clarify areas of misunderstanding about the IFU.  
Finally,  the observer  will ask questions  to help identify  the root causes  of tasks observed  as not 
completed or completed with use errors or close calls during the simulation of the IFU.  
 
 
8.5 SARS -CoV-2 Testing of Subject Samples  
For the IFU to be successful  for at home testing,  valid test results  must result  from self-collected  sample . 
Valid SARS- CoV-2 test results are positive, not detected, and inconclusive ( Table 1). In addition, the 
following will be determined.

potential  interview  with the observer or  at the point  of early  termination as described in Section  7.3. 
8.8 Sample  Retention  
Samples may not be used in their entirety. Samples may be retained for purposes such as additional 
testing  in this or alternative SARS- CoV-2 tests.  Information from this additional  testing  may be used  to 
inform study questions around laboratory QA processes or test improvement. Unused sample will be 
destroyed after 1 year or earlier.  
9 DATA  ANALYSIS  AND  STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Sample  Size Determination  
Based on feedback  from the US FDA on the Exact  Sciences  submission Pre-EUA PEUA200414 as well 
as the recent Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) accelerated EUA for Test Number 139900, 
which included a self -collection validation, 30 patients will be targeted for enrollment in this study. Per 
FDA recommendation,  an attempt  will be made to enroll  subjects  of varying  age and educational  status.

Protocol  2020 -06 v1.0 15  
  
9.2 Analysis of Primary  Endpoint  
The primary  endpoint  is the percent  of samples  from the fully enrolled cohort  to return a valid SARS -CoV- 
2 test result (positive, not detected, or inconclusive). The target is 80% as an acceptable rate of success 
given the first -time task completion for minimally trained users.  
9.3 Other  Pre-Specified Analyses 
Other pre -specified analyses include a characterization of subjects’ self -reported ease of use with the 
Specimen Collection  Materials  Instructions for Use  (IFU),  acceptable answers  on general  comprehension 
of the IFU, observer- reported problems associated with following the IFU,    
 and evaluation of root causes of problems associated with user tasks, including but not 
limited to critical tasks. All analyses will be descriptive in nature. Frequency and percentage will be 
calculated for categorical  measures  and mean,  standard deviation,  median,  and interquartile  range will be 
calculated for continuous measures.  
The subject’s self -reported satisfaction and ease of using the IFU will be assessed using the After - 
Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ).[3, 4] The ASQ is a valid and reliable 3- item survey on user satisfaction 
associated with completing  a task.  Item response  options  are on a 7- point  Likert  scale  where 1 = strongly 
agree and 7 = strongly disagree. An overall satisfaction score is calculated as the average of the non- 
missing responses to the items (theoretical range 1 -7 with a lower score indicating higher satisfaction).  
The frequency and percentage of  each response  to all questions will  be presented, along with the mean, 
standard deviation, median,  and interquartile range of the overall score. In addition, the frequency and 
percentage of subjects with an overall score of 1 to 3 (indicating that the subject agrees to strongly agrees  that they are satisfied)  will be presented.  An average of 3.5 or lower on the overall  ASQ  score  will 
be considered acceptable self -reported user satisfaction.  
The frequency  and percentage of correct  vs. incorrect  responses  from the subject  on questions around 
shipping and invalid tests consequences will be presented.  
The frequency  and percentage of individual  problems  observed  (by an external  observer)  with the 
Specimen Collection  Materials  IFU will be presented,  along with the distribution of total number of 
problems overall and total number of problems on critical tasks ( Section 6.2 ). 
              
                
A qualitative evaluation of results from the user reported data, external observer feedback on user 
interactions,  and laboratory  testing  will be conducted  to assess the root cause  of problems  and evaluate 
mitigating solutions, e.g., whether specific parts of the IFU should be modified.  
9.4 Analytic Cohort  
All subjects  enrolled  in the study  will be included in the analytic  cohort.  
Demographic  and subject  disposition  characteristics will be described using  frequency  and percentage for 
categorical measures and mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range for continuous measures.  
9.5 Stopping  Rule  
CONFIDENTIAL  
May not be reproduced nor disseminated outside  of Exact Sciences without  permission  
Protocol  2020 -06 v1.0 16  
  
This study  is expected  to run through its conclusion without  premature termination.  
9.6 Bias  Considerations  
Subjects  who participate in this  study  may not be wholly  representative of those who would use a home 
collection kit for SARS- Cov-2 testing. Subjects with a range of education levels and ages but without 
medical, laboratory, or self-collection experience will be recruited. There are no other known bias 
considerations in this study design.  
9.7 Handling  of Missing  Data 
Missing  data will not be imputed.  
Per the published scoring  guidelines  for the ASQ,  the overall  score  is calculated by taking  the average of 
the non- missing items.  
All analyses  will be described in the study  Statistical  Analysis  Plan,  which  will supersede the methodology 
presented in the Study  Protocol.  Any deviations  in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan will be recorded along with 
their rationale in the final study report, as appropriate.  
10 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
10.1 Definition  of Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended sign,  symptom,  or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of an investigational product or protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. All 
observed or volunteered adverse events  regardless  of suspected  causal  relationship to the investigational 
product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.  
Potential side effects from routine nasal swabbing, including, but not limited to, acute epistaxis 
(nosebleed),  sneezing,  nasal  redness,  are not required to be reported  to the Sponsor  as adverse  events.  
10.2 Reporting  Period  
Adverse events collection begins at enrollment and ends after completion of the sample collection. 
Adverse events will only be recorded for events that occur during or are believed to be associated with 
the nasal  swab  sample  collection procedures.  All AEs will be reported on the adverse event  page(s)  of the 
CRF.  
10.3 Serious  Adverse Events 
Serious  adverse events  are not expected  for this study. In  the event  of an SAE,  the event  will be reported 
to the IRB per IRB standard operating procedure.  
 
 
11 QUALITY  CONTROL AND  QUALITY  ASSURANCE 
The study  site may be subject  to review  by the (IRB)/Ethics  Committee  (EC),  and/or  to quality  assurance 
audits performed by Exact Sciences.

12 DATA  HANDLING AND  RECORD  KEEPING  
All references  to the Sponsor  in this section  include  all designees  e.g., Contract  Research  Organizations 
or Consultants acting on behalf of the Sponsor.  
12.1 Protocol  Deviations 
The site should make  all efforts  not to deviate from any of the study  procedures  or requirements  as 
described in this protocol, except where necessary to eliminate immediate risks to the subject(s).  
Any deviations  from this protocol  must  be notified to the Sponsor  and documented properly.  Protocol 
deviations must also be reported to the IRB per IRB policy.  
12.2 Case Repor t Forms (CRFs) 
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to either a 
paper  form or an electronic  data record  or both,  depending on the data collection  method used  in this 
study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each enrolled subject. The completed original CRFs are 
the sole property  of Exact Sciences and should not be made available in any form to third parties,  except 
for authorized representatives of Exact Sciences or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written 
permission from Exact Sciences.  
12.3 Records Retention  
The ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance defines source documents as, "Original 
documents, data, and records (e.g., hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda,  subjects' diaries  or evaluation checklists,  pharmacy  dispensing records,  recorded  data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches,  photographic  negatives,  microfilm or  magnetic  media,  x-rays,  subject  files, and records  kept 
at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial)."  
The Sponsor  agrees  to keep  records,  including the identity  of all participating subjects,  all original  signed 
informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The Sponsor shall maintain study  records for a 
period of 2 years after the latter of the following three dates: the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed, the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a 
premarket approval application or a notice of completion of a product development protocol, or date 
provided in applicable national law.  
13 ETHICS  
13.1 Risk  Analysis 
13.1.1  Risk  to the subject  
CONFIDENTIAL  
May not be reproduced nor disseminated outside  of Exact Sciences without  permission  
Protocol  2020 -06 v1.0 18  
  
The risk to study subjects is minimal and are related to the use of the nasal swab collection materials.  
The nasal  swab  could cause  mild discomfort  or a short -term impact  such  as a nosebleed.  While  the saline 
in the collection tube could spill, the liquid is safe and of small volume.  
13.1.2  Benefit  to Subject  
There are no benefits  to the subjects  enrolled in this study.  
13.2 Institutional  Review Board  (IRB)  / Ethics  Committee  (EC) 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol 
amendments,  informed consent  forms,  and other  relevant  documents,  e.g., recruitment  advertisements,  if 
applicable, from the IRB. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB approvals should be forwarded to Exact Sciences or des ignee.  
13.3 Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The study  will be conducted  in accordance with legal  and regulatory  requirements,  as well as the general 
principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human 
Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), the Declaration of Helsinki 
(World Medical Association), and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  
13.4 Subject Information  and Consent  
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names on any 
Sponsor  forms,  reports,  publications,  or in any other  disclosures,  except  where required  by laws.  In case 
of data transfer, Exact Sciences will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subject 
personal data. Subject name, contact information, and informed consent will be retained by Exact Sciences  Clinical Affairs  in a secure,  limited  access  location,  for the purpose of conducting and oversight 
of the clinical study. Subject protected health information, including name and date of birth, may be shared on a limited basis with Exact Sciences staff responsible for conducting data collection and 
analysis activities.  
The informed consent  form must  be in compli ance  with ICH GCP,  local regulatory  requirements,  and legal 
requirements. The informed consent form used in this study, and any changes made during the study, must be prospectively approved by both the IRB/EC and Exact Sciences before use.  
The Investigator  must  ensure  that each study  subject,  or his/her  legally  acceptable representative,  is fully 
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  
The Investigator,  or a person designated  by the Investigator,  will obtain written  informed  consent  from 
each subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative before any study -specific activity is 
performed. The Investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent form.  
14 DEFINI TION  OF END STUDY  
End of Study  is defined when  the enrollment  target  of approximately  30 subjects  has been achieved  and

4 Introduction  
Low vitamin D status is common in individuals who regularly perform extreme physical exertion, 
particularly in combination with periods of psychological stress, inadequate nutrition, and sleep disruption.
1 This places military personnel in a high risk category with significant negative consequences 
to musculoskeletal, immune, and mental health, and thus, resilience. The large scope  of this problem 
demands a multi -phased approach beginning with a self -care, easy access, safe biomedical device 
intended to stimulate cutaneous production of vitamin D. The pilot , or demonstration phase, involve d 
installment of a standing phototherapy  kiosk in an outpatient setting where we enroll ed Active Duty 
(AD) and retired Service Members (SM), adult beneficiaries, and DA civilians to test the acceptability and feasibility of this health promotion concept. We anticipate d that th e phototherapy kiosk would  be an 
inexpensive, convenient, and effective way to maintain or raise 25(OH)D levels to sustain Warfighter and beneficiary resilience.   
 Endogenous  production of vitamin D comes from sun exposure, however concerns  of skin cancer and 
heat injuries limits recommendations for even a safe level of exposure. The only alternative has been consumption of vitamin D supplements, yet there is a paucity of evid ence for how often, how much, and 
for how long one should consume supplements. Unlike endogenous vitamin D, research shows that supplements do not bind completely to vitamin D binding protein and are not regulated in the body to 
prevent overdose.
32-35 Fat malabsorption conditions (cystic fibrosis, Crohn’s disease, celiac, liver disease, 
etc.) can reduce the ability to absorb fat soluble vitamin D supplements yet endogenous vitamin D 
production from UVB light is uninhibited.2,36- 40 UVB radiation with a wavelength of 290 -320 nm 
penetrates the exposed skin and converts cutaneous 7 -dehydrocholesterol to pre -vitamin D3, which in 
turn becomes vitamin D3. Maximal immune system response occurs at a peak of 300 nm and vitamin D3 
production at a peak of 298 nm .3 Sunlight exposure provides 80 -100% of the body’s vitamin D 
requirements. Factors that influence UVB exposure and vitamin D synthesis include season, time of day, length of day, cloud cover, smog, skin melanin content, and sunscreen.  However, a  simple “prescription” 
for midday sun exposure under a cloudless sky with 90% skin exposure and no sunscreen in a non -urban, 
minimally polluted environment is a challenge for almost every American, and even more so for Service 
Members. 
 
 
The current standard of care is 600 IUs oral vitamin D daily, which is the RDA established by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) who identified clinically significant levels of circulating 25(OH)D to be 20 ng/mL. The RDA for vitamin D represents a daily intake sufficient to maintain bone health and normal calcium 
 
                                                                                                                                                         Page 5 of 15 
metabolism in 97.5% of the population.20  While debate  surrounds a sufficient  range for 25(OH)D, there 
does seem to be a general acceptance that the optimum range is between 30 – 60 ng/mL.5-7  The human 
body uses sunlight as the primary source of vitamin D and produces large quantities efficiently with 
limited UVB exposure.12-15 Therefore, a rational way to determine the optimum vitamin D range is by  
studying natural cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. It has been demonstrated that a single session of full body exposure to solar radiation can produce a time -released equivalent of approximately 10,000 IU of 
oral vitamin D.
16 A safe upper limit for vitamin D  is related to oral intake only. Cutaneous vitamin D 
production is automatically regulated by a photochemical reaction and pigmentation, preventing toxicity.
17-19 Consequently, hypervitaminosis D is not possible  when the only vitamin D source is skin 
production following  exposure to UVB light. For all these reasons, an innovative alternative  to address 
low vitamin D status in adults, Warfighters included, is needed.  
5 Study Objectives  
The specific aims for this project were:  
1. Determine acceptability and feasibility of a standing phototherapy kiosk designed as a self-care intervention for AD and r etired service members, beneficiaries, and DA civilians;  
2. Demonstrate that narrow spectrum UVB delivered by the SPK is at least equivalent to D3 oral intake to raise or maintain serum 25(OH)D levels over a 10-week  intervention period;  
3. Examine the relationship of demographic variables, including gender, age, body mass index, body fat, ethnicity, and sun exposure to serum 25(OH)D levels in both groups.  
6 Investigational Plan  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This non-inferiority  study use d a prospective, longitudinal, randomized design with repeated 
measures to address vitamin D sufficiency in AD, retiree, beneficiary, and DA civilian populations.  
It is important and necessary to conduct this study with adult humans, military personnel in 
particular, to determine acceptability and feasibility of this phototherapy kiosk as an addition to existing Warfighter resources to promote health and resilience. Following Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC)  Institutional Review Board Human Subjects and Ethics approval, the SPK will be  
installed in a location approved by the Radiation Safety Officer, the study team will be  hired, and 
recruitment will begin for an anticipated 12-month project period. Approximately 1 20 volunteers 
will be  approached  from MAMC and Joint Base Lewis -McChord (JBLM), a large joint base in the 
Pacific Northwest, where over 25,000 Soldiers and Airmen train every day and regional beneficiarie s’ number ~98,000. Recruiting efforts will attempt  to capture a representative sample 
of the population including both genders, diverse ethnicities, and a range of age (18 -70 years) and 
body mass index ( BMI), who have no contraindication for UVB exposure o r oral vitamin D 
supplementation. In addition to walk -in volunteers, the research team will attend  the JBLM 
Newcomer’s  Orientation . Using a computer -generated  block design , volunteers will be  
randomized to one of two groups  by the research pharmacist ; 1) oral vitamin D supplementation, 
or 2) standing phototherapy kiosk with UVB exposure, for a 10 -week  period.  
 
Comparison Group  (CG) – Supplement  
A MAMC research p harmacist will dispense  a 70-day supply of the vitamin D3 600 I U oral 
supplement to subjects assigned to this group . The Project Direc tor will work with the pharmacist 
to coordinate pick -up of supplement bottles for subjects or optimal in -person dispensing times.  
 
 
                                                                                                                                                         Page 6 of 15 
Treatment Group ( TG) – Phototherapy  
The Project Director provid es overs ight for the phototherapy treatment. The kiosk will deliver the 
UVB dose under supervised conditions over a 1 – 10 minute interval based on the Fitzpatrick skin 
type with the subject wearing minimal or no clothing, prefer ably no more than a bathing suit , and 
protective eye- wear. The experience in the SPK was designed to be comfortable and user -friendly.  
 
All eligible adult volunteers will be enrolled regardless of their baseline 25(OH)D level as it is  
important in this non -inferiority study to show there is  no potential for harm from phototherapy, 
even if the baseline 25(OH)D level is  above 30 ng/mL. If the goal is to develop a self- care kiosk, 
individ uals will not have the ability to check their serum vitamin D status prior to use. We also 
want to  learn the trajectory of vitamin D absorption and availability over a 3-4- month  period in 
order to make evidence-based therapeutic recommendations. It is  not possible to blind the 
subjects or research team to the group assignment given the two comparators .  
 
Serum levels of 25(OH)D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone are  drawn at baseline (T0), 
immediately following the intervention at 1 0 weeks (T6) ; at 14 weeks (T8), 25(OH)D is drawn to  
document sustainment of treatment effect. Remuneration in the form of $20 Amazon gift cards is provided to all volunteers after the baseline and final scheduled blood draw (as allowed by DoD Instruction 3216.02 Dated  November 8, 2011).  
 A survey shall be completed at T1 and reviewed with participants again at the 10-week  visit to 
capture relevant demographic, medical history, sun exposure, travel, daily activities, and dietary data. Active duty SMs  shall report the n umber of days on profile  (activity restriction)  for the 
previous three months, at T1 and T 6. A Device Usability Scale  will be administered to the kiosk 
group participants upon protocol completion to address acceptability and feasibility of the treatment. With the assistance of a biostatistician, we will analyze data using repeated measures 
analysis of variance adjusting for significant covariates such as 25(OH)D level at baseline. Logistic regression analyses are used to predict outcomes and explain the int errelationships among 
variables, i.e. age, gender, BMI, body fat, ethnicity, and sun exposure relationship to 25(OH)D serum levels.  
6.2 Discussion of the Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The objective of this non -inferiority study is to demonstrate the ability of the phototherapy  kiosk 
to safely administer UVB radiation to participants with sufficient or insufficient levels of 25(OH)D and achieve comparable levels of serum 25(OH)D in a similar population of adults  randomized to 
receiv e the RDA  of 600 IU vitamin D oral supplementation once daily.  As an experimental device, it 
is important to evaluate its equivalence to standard of care in the maintenance of sufficient levels 
of vitamin D in adults with all skin types between 18 and 69 years of age. In this study the 
supplement group  (CG) was used as an active control .

interest, if they are  unable to comply with the procedures required, or if they no longer me et 
eligibility criteria.  
 
6.4 Treatments  
6.4.1 Treatments Administered  
Comparison Group  - Supplement  
Volunteers assigned to this group are  provided with a 10 -week supply (70 pills) of a vitamin D3 
supplement . Consented participants are  instructed to take one 600 IU pill by mouth each day 
for ten weeks.  They are instructed to take this with a meal.  This dose is the RDA  for adults 
between 1 8 and 69 years old according to the Institute of Medicine Committee to Review 
Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D a nd Calcium .20  
 
Treatment Group - Phototherapy  
Volunteers assigned to this group are administered phototherapy treatments once every 
other week, for 10 weeks. The treatment usually lasts no more than 10  minutes  and is  based 
on the Fitzpatrick skin type classification tool19 which is self-assessed via the computer touch 
screen in the kiosk.  
  
 
                                                                                                                                                         Page 8 of 15 
 
 
6.4.2 Identi ty Investigational Product  
The Soli us phototherapy  device  (SOLIUSOne, S erial# 00102 ) is intended for use in the 
stimulation of endogenous vitamin D. Solius is a freestanding booth designed to deliver a 
small amount of targeted UVB with an interactive user interface and cloud -based  software 
that enables patient self -care. The treatment delivery mechanism uses a metal  halide lamp 
with a series of filters and a lens to optimize full- body exposure to the narrow spectrum ( 293 – 
303nm) of UVB light most efficient at producing vitamin D3. The device uses software to 
identify patients, establish individual skin types and det ermine dosage. The system has been 
designed to manage exposure time and frequenc y and deliver 60 % of a skin -type -adjusted 
Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED). The expected result for users is a rise in  blood levels of 
25(OH)D  via the  endogenous pathway .13 
 
6.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
A computer -generated  block design will be  created  by an onsite  biostatistician and  used by 
the research pharmacist  to randomize participants . Upon meeting the inclusion criteria,  the 
pharmacist will be notif ied of the new participant and she will relay the assigned group  to the 
team . The study team will have had no knowledge of the group assignment in advance.      
 
6.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study  
Comparison Group - Oral Supplement Dosing 
For this non -inferiority study, the logical choice for a comparison arm was the Recommended 
Daily Allowance (RDA) of 600 IU  vitamin D for adults in the age range of 18 -70 years old . The 
RDA was established by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)  who  identified  clinically significant  
level s of circulating 25(OH)D  (20 ng/mL) and then estimated the amount of dietary vitamin D 
required to reach this circulating level with minimal  sunlight  exposure . The RDA  for vitamin D 
represents a daily intake sufficient to maintain bone health and normal calcium metabolism in 
97.5% the  population .20  Table 1. Study  Summary

Treatment Group - Phototherap y Dosing  
All patients shall be dosed at 0.6 MED  at a distance of 12” from the light source for all 
treatments. This is consistent with dosing demonstrated to be effective at raising serum 
25(OH)D without the risk of adverse events. 26, 27 Treatments shall occur on a 14 -day interval 
(+/- 24 hours), for a total delivery of 6 doses.   
 To obtain dose, each participant will self- assess their skin type according to the Fitzpatrick skin 
typing scale using software inside the kiosk. The kiosk will determine the dose per patient, based on their answers. Erythemal response to the previous treatment dose is se lf-assessed. 
In the event erythema is self -reported via the kiosk, the participant’s dose is reduced by the 
system for subsequent treatments.  
   
6.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
Comparison  Group  
Each p articipant assigned to the comparison  group will be  instructed to take one vitamin D3 
pill each day  with a meal for 70 days . Participants will also be instructed not to take any 
additional vitamin D supplementation during the study period.  This dosing frequency is 
consistent with the RDA  recommendation.20 
 
Treatment  Group  
Treatments shall occur on a 14 -day interval (+/ - 24 hours), for a total delivery of 6 doses.  Each 
participant is  informed of the need for consistency in the time of day for subsequent 
photothera py treatments and every attempt will be  made to ensure the participant s return 14 
days after each treatment for 10 weeks.  This dosing frequency is consistent with  the minimum 
recommended for Solius  vitamin D therapy  previously shown to be adequate in maintaining 
serum  25(OH)D  levels .26, 27   
 
6.4.6 Blinding  
Due to the nature  of the study , it is not possible to blind the subjects or research team to the 
group assignment . 
 
6.4.7 Prior Concomitant Therapy  
Other medications are  allowed except those listed in the exclusion criteria (anti -seizure 
medications, cyclosporine, and idinavir) . The research pharmacist will provide expertise for 
establishing screening criteria to eliminate any potential drug -drug or drug-nutrient 
interactions. No attempt will be made  to control for sun exposure or dietary intake of vitamin 
D, however, all participants are  instructed to refrain from taking any additional supplements 
containing vitamin D.  Volunteers will be asked about vitamin D supplementation during 
screening and anyone taking a vitamin D supplement in the previous 2 months will not qualify 
for the study. Both amount of sun exposure and  consumption of dietary vitamin D will be 
captured on  surveys. Logistic regression analyses will be used to predict outcomes and explain 
the interrelationship  among the two variables ( i.e. s un exposure relationship to 25(OH)D 
serum levels ).  
    
 
                                                                                                                                                         Page 10 of 15 
6.4.8 Adherence 
Comparison Group  
Participants agree to oral administration of 600 IU vitamin D once per day. Participants must 
agree to abstain from ingesting oral vitamin D supplements . Participants must also have blood 
drawn at baseline , day 70, and at day 100.   
 
Treatment  Group  
Participants must be exposed once every other week ( 14 days +/- 24 hours). Participants must 
agree to abstain from ingesting oral vitamin D supplements . Participants must also have blood 
drawn at baseline , day 70, and at day 100.   
 In this pilot  feasibility study, one aim is to evaluate acceptability and adherence .  
 
6.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables  
6.5.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed  
To determine that phototherapy  is at least equivalent to D3 oral intake to raise or maintain 
serum 25(OH)D levels over a 10 -week intervention period  baseline 25(OH)D level s are obtained. 
Blood draws will occur upon enrollment with two follow -up measurements, one at 10 weeks 
and a final level 4 weeks after completing the protocol to evaluate sustainment of the post-
treatment level. Serum concentration of 25(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status as it 
represents cutaneous production and consumption of food and supplements. Serum 25(OH)D  
has a circulating half- life of 15 days.28 Serum 25(OH)D levels do not indicate the amount of 
vitamin D stored in body tissues.10 All blood levels will be obtained by experienced 
phlebotomists in the hospital central laboratory. There will be no sta ndardization of time of day 
for the blood draw.  An Endocrine consultant will review all abnormal lab values [(25OH)D, PTH, 
Calcium] and recommended follow -up with the Primary Care Manager, if necessary.  
 
To d etermine acceptability and feasibility of the standing phototherapy  kiosk, a Device Usability 
Scale will be administered to the Kiosk Group upon completion of the study. This 12 -item Likert -
type scale was adapted from the Digital Equipment Corporation “System Usability Scale” ( 1986 ). 
Questions assessed cleanliness, ease of use, and comfort of the kiosk with a Likert-type scale 
where 1= Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree.  
 The research team will meticulously track the number of potential participants screened, the 
number of enrolled subjects, comple tion of all study timepoints, and attrition from each arm.  
 
To examine the relationship of demographic variables, including gender, age, body mass index, 
body fat, ethnicity, and sun exposure to serum 25(OH)D levels in both groups , several o ther 
measurements will be  obtained including the following:  
 
1. Body height (Ht) – Vertical height is measured at baseline using a Harpenden 
Stadiometer and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. The stadiometer  is composed of a rigid 
vertical backboard with an att ached rigid horizontal headboard which moves up and 
down the backboard. Final height was the average of two measurements taken by trained study staff.  
 
 
                                                                                                                                                         Page 11 of 15 
2. Body weight (Wt) , Body fat (BF)/ lean mass (Fat free mass), Basal metabolic rate  – weight 
in pounds , percent fat mass and % lean mass, and metabolic rate at rest. The study team 
will utilize  bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to obtain body composition measures.  
The InBody 230 lean and fat mass assessment device has been shown to be comparable 
to the gold  standard, Dual -energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DXA). It is maintained in the 
office suite where the project team is located ; all team members are trained in its use.  
 
3. Demographic Questionnaire – Is administered at baseline and will be updated at 10 
weeks. This tool was created specifically for the study to document relevant personal 
and family history related to diet, medical conditions, stress fracture history, alcohol and 
tobacco use,  and exposure to sunlight. It is critical to know the presence of any of the 
following habits or conditions: current medications, age, gender, ethnicity, and race. The tool also covered physical activity and environmental exposures . 
 
4. Vitamin D and Calcium Intake and Frequenc y Questionnaire
22 – This questionnaire is 
administered  in-person by study team  at baseline . It is used to record average daily and 
weekly servings of foods high in vitamin D and/or calcium. The tool has been validated for use in young adults. Permission was obtained from the author for its use.  The tool is 
designed as an Excel worksheet with built-in calculations that total the amounts of vitamin D and calcium in foods that are consumed on a daily or weekly basis. The reference for the nutrient values is the Academy of Medicine. The tool was modified 
slightly  to capture vitamin D and calcium -containing foods and quantities consumed  
from Northwest sources , such as salmon and ultraviolet irradiated mushrooms.  
 
5. Serum biomarkers - Calcium and Parathyroid Hormone – standard blood tests 
performed at the s ame time as the 25(OH)D in order to provide a clinical interpretation 
in the setting of abnormal levels.  
 
6.5.2 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The Elecsys  Vitamin D Total II assay is intended for the quantitative determination of total 25 -
hydroxyvitamin D in human serum and plasma. The electrochemiluminescence binding assay is intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers. 
 
 
Body composition  measurements, biomarkers, and demographic questionnaires all represent 
valid and reliable methods to capture data relevant to a vitamin D investigation. All measures have been previously tested and used by this research team.  
 
6.5.3 Primary Efficacy Variable(s)  
Serum 25(OH)D level  is the primary endpoint used to establish whether the treatment in the 
phototherapy kiosk  group  is equivalent to  the oral vitamin D3 supplementation currently 
prescribed as the standard of care . It is expected that the serum  25(OH)D levels in both groups 
will rise over time and that the serum 25(OH)D levels will be equal to, or not less than, that of the oral supplementation group.   
 A Device Usability Scale will be administered to the Kiosk Group to assess acceptability and  
feasibility. This 12 -item Likert -type scale was a dapted from the Digital Equipment Corporation 
 
                                                                                                                                                         Page 12 of 15 
“System Usability Scale” ( 1986 ) and it will be  administered to the Kiosk Group upon completion 
of the study.   
   
 
6.6 Statistical Methods Pla nned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample Size 
6.6.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The original analysis plan will be carried out using all available subject data points. No interim 
analysis will be performed.  Exploratory data a nalyses will be conducted on the serum vitamin D 
levels of participants assigned to either the oral vitamin D supplementation or kiosk group. The 
analysis will be restricted to participants with valid baseline serum vitamin D data and at least 
one follow -up blood draw. The Shapiro -Wilk test will be used to assess the normality of the data 
distribution. Measures of central tendency and dispersion are provided f or continuous data as 
medians (m dn) with associated interquartile ranges (IQR). Summary statistics will be provided 
for categorical variables and include the number of participants as well as the prevalence within each group.  
 
6.6.2 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a pilot study therefore  the appropriate sample size was estimated based on previous and 
current studies  that achieved significance  and involv ed this population and a similar approach to 
vitamin D supplementation .   
We requested  approval to enroll twice the number required, or 120 subjects , in order to 
overcome the potential for a higher than expected attrition (30%),  or a particularly high level of 
enthusiasm for the study from beneficiaries and civilians working in the hospital.    
Estimate Required Sample Size  60 
Estimate Participant Drop Out / Withdrawal  30%  
Total Enrollment Requirement  Minimum of 78, requesting 120

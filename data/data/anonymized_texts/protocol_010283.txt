1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Original 15 September 2016
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Update Section 3.0, Introduction, GLE and PIB
Rationale:   Updated per the AbbVie Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir Fixed-Dose 
Combination Investigator's Brochure Edition 2.  06 September 2016; including 
Addendum 1 Edition 2 November 2016.
●Update Section 5.2.3.3 , Prohibited Therapy, Table 1 , Prohibited Medications 
and Supplements
Rationale:   To allow the investigator to reintroduce the medications 
prohibited by the protocol 14 or more days following the last dose of study 
drug instead of 30 days or more, based on the half-lives of G/P
●Update Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Screening:  Liver Ultrasound, Appendix C , Study Activities – Treatment 
Period, and Appendix D , Study Activities – Post Treatment (PT) Period
Rationale:    To remove Alpha Fetoprotein from the protocol, because the 
protocol-required HCC screening incorporates the more sensitive and specific imaging exams (ultrasound, MRI, PET scan) and determination of Alpha Fetoprotein levels is not necessary.  The HCC Screening Liver Ultrasound at 
Post-Treatment Week 24 was added to ascertain the subject did not develop 
HCC during the course of the trial.
●Update Section 5.3.2.1 , Collection of Samples for Analysis
Rationale:   To correct the blood volume drawn for Pharmacokinetic Samples 
●Update Section 7.0, Protocol Deviations, alternative contact
Rationale:   To reflect current study personnel.
●Updated Section 8.1.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
3
Rationale:   Regulatory authority feedback requested that for high SVR 12rates 
less than 100% the Wilson score test be used for calculating the 95% 
confidence interval in the primary efficacy analysis, rather than using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  To comply with this 
feedback, the Wilson score method will be used to calculate the confidence 
intervals for the primary efficacy endpoints if the number of SVR
12non-
responders is less than 5, otherwise normal approximation to the binomial 
distribution will be used.
●Appendix B , List of Protocol Signatories 
Rationale:   To reflect current study personnel.
●Correct minor typographical and grammatical errors throughout the protocol

Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Glecaprevir 
(GLE)/Pibrentasvir (PIB) in Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 5 or 6 Infection
Objectives:
!The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by evaluating the percentage of 
subjects achieving SVR 12) and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in adults with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir will be assessed by genotypes across treatment durations (or cirrhosis status) and the safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir will be assessed by treatment duration (or cirrhosis status) across genotypes.
!The secondary objectives are to assess efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir by hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection across treatment duration (or cirrhosis status) by evaluating the percentages of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure and HCV virologic relapse across treatment durations (or cirrhosis status).
Additional objectives are to assess pharmacokinetics and emergence and persistence of viral variants in these treatment regimens.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 26
Study Population:   Chronic HCV GT5 or 6-infected male and female adults aged 18 years or older, 
without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve (i.e., has never received a single dose of any approved or investigational anti-HCV medication) or treatment experienced (i.e., has failed prior interferon [IFN] or pegylated interferon [pegIFN] with or without ribavirin [RBV], or sofosbuvir [SOF] plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 80 subjects
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for an 8- or 12-week treatment duration in adults with chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced with IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV (defined as P/R treatment-experienced) or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN (defined as SOF plus RBV treatment-experienced).  Approximately 80 subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled globally.  Approximately 30 GT5-infected subjects and approximately 50 GT6-infected subjects will be enrolled in the study.  The study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following enrollment criteria: 1) a minimum of 15 GT5 and 30 GT6 subjects and 2) up to approximately 16 subjects with compensated cirrhosis (regardless of GT).
Approximately 80 eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of the following treatment arms:
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
5
Methodology (Continued):
!Arm A:  HCV GT 5 or 6 non-cirrhotic subjects will be treated with GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg 
once daily (QD) for 8 weeks.
!Arm B:  HCV GT 5 or 6 subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be treated with GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.
The study will consist of two periods:
Treatment Period:  Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 300 mg/120 mg 
once daily (QD) for an 8 (Arm A) or 12 (Arm B) week treatment duration based on cirrhosis status.
Scheduled visits for subjects in the Treatment Period consist of Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 for all 
subjects and an additional Week 12 visit for subjects in Arm B.  Study procedures, including assessment of adverse events, vital signs, adherence, concomitant medications, HCV RNA, HCV resistance, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir pharmacokinetic assays, and clinical laboratory tests, will be conducted at each visit.
Post-Treatment Period:  Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the Treatment Period will be 
followed for 24 weeks to monitor HCV RNA levels to evaluate efficacy and the emergence and 
persistence of resistant viral variants.
During the Post-Treatment Period, all subjects will have visits at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 following 
completion of the Treatment Period.  Study procedures to monitor safety, HCV RNA, and the emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants will be conducted during these visits.

Investigational Products: Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir 100 mg/40 mg Film-coated tablet
Doses: Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir 300 mg/120 mg QD (3 tablets)
Mode of Administration: Oral with food.
Duration of Treatment:   Subjects without cirrhosis will receive glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks, 
while subjects with compensated cirrhosis will receive glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Plasma HCV RNA (IU/mL) will be assessed at each Treatment and Post-Treatment Visit.
Safety:Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory tests, and vital signs.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs):
The Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Status Survey (SF-36v2) will be used to assess the functional 
health and well-being of subjects.  The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire:  
Hepatitis C (WPAI:  Hepatitis C) will assess work and activity impairment due to HCV.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir will be tabulated and summarized.
Resistance:The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects with available samples, 
the variants at baseline at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference sequences; and 2) for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12, post-baseline variants 
relative to baselines in available samples.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) 
separately across treatment arms.  The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized with a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation of the binomial distribution unless the rate for SVR
12is 100%, where the Wilson's score method will be used to calculate the 
confidence interval.
The secondary efficacy endpoints within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) separately, across 
treatment arms are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure.
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse.
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment relapse, the number and percentage of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
PROs:
Change from baseline to each applicable visit in the patient reported outcome summary measures will be 
summarized.
Safety:
Safety summaries will be provided by the treatment arm (i.e., cirrhosis status/study drug duration) and 
overall.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be provided by grade and relationship to study drug.  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by treatment arm (i.e., cirrhosis status/study drug duration) and overall.  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading of laboratory values will also be summarized.
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir will be tabulated for each subject and treatment 
arm.  Summary statistics will be computed for each treatment arm.  Population pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drug, the variants at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions 
at baseline identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drug who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by NGS and comparison to the baseline sequences, 2) the amino acid variants in available post baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by NGS, and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral resistance by NGS.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 
184 million indi viduals infected worldwide.1  There are 7 identified HCV genotypes, with 
genotype 1 (GT1) being the most prevalent worldwide.  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 (GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
2-4  HCV GT4 is commonly found in parts of Africa and the 
Middle East, particularly in Egypt, GT5 is primarily found in South Africa, and GT6 is 
primarily found in south-east Asia.5  Depending on various risk factors, between 10% and 
40% of all patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis.6
Death related to the complications of cirrhosis may occur at an incidence of approximately 4% per year; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year.
6  Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular 
carcinoma have a 33% probability of  death during the first year.6  Successful treatment of 
HCV has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Prior to the approval of sofosbuvir (SOF) in 2014, the recommended treatment for GT5 and GT6 HCV infection was pegINF/RBV for 48 weeks.  The inclusion of SOF to pegIFN/RBV shortened the treatment to 12 weeks, and this was supported by a Phase 3 open-label study where a total of 7 treatment- naive GT5 (n = 1) and  GT6 (n = 6) subjects 
were treated with pegINF/RBV plus SOF regimen for 12 weeks where all subjects achieved SVR
12(100%).9
AbbVie is currently developing two "next generation" DAA drugs, glecaprevir (GLE), an HCV non-structural (NS) protein 3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) and pibrentasvir (PIB), an NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.  The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB used together for the treatment of those with chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.

Glecaprevir (GLE)
GLE is an NS3/4A PI with potent and pangenotypic activity.  Its EC 50values against 
HCV replicon stable cell lines with GT1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a and 6a NS3 are 0.85, 0.94, 2.7, 
1.6, 2.8 and 0.86 nM, respectively.  GLE EC 50data for a stable replicon cell line 
containing NS3 from GT5a is not available, but in a transient transfection assay using a replicon containing NS3 from GT5a, GLE demonstrated an EC
50of ~0.15 nM, which was 
similar to the GLE EC 50values for GT1a and GT1b replicons in the same assay.  GLE 
demonstrates a high genetic barrier to resistance and maintains activity against common variants that emerge following exposure to first generation PIs.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharm acology and toxicology, in vitro virology 
and metabolism, and clinical data can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

Pibrentasvir (PIB)
PIB is an NS5A inhibitor with potent and pangenotypic activity.  The in vitro antiviral 
activity of PIB ag ainst HCV GT1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a is similar, with EC 50
values of 1.8, 4.3, 2.3, 1.9, 2.1, 1.9, 1.4 and 2.8 pM, respectively, in stable replicon cell lines.  It demonstrates a high genetic barrier to resistance and maintains activity against common resistance-associated variants in NS5A in all GTs.  PIB is greater than 100-fold more active than the first generation NS5A inhibitors (ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir) against key resistance-associated variants.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharmac ology and toxicology, in vitro virology 
and metabolism, and clinical data can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

GLE and PIB
In general, GLE and PIB combination has been well tolerated when administered to over 
800 healthy volunteers and 2,376 subjects were randomized or enrolled in the registrational studies or supportive Phase 2 studies to receive GLE 300 mg QD and PIB 120 mg QD.  Of these, 2,369 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug.  The efficacy rates were high (> 95%) among treatment- naive or pegIFN + RBV-experienced non-

cirrhotic HCV-infected GT-1 – 6 subjects treated with 8 weeks of GLE/PIB in Phase 2 
studies.  Among cirrhotic GT1 treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced treated 
with GLE/PIB for 12 weeks, efficacy was high (> 95%).  However, longer than 12 weeks treatment may be beneficial to im prove efficacy among non-cirrhotic GT3 pegIFN + 
RBV-experienced as efficacy rate was < 95%.  Most frequently reported AEs in Phase 2 studies were mild to moderate and clinically ma nageable.  Overall, GLE and PIB regimen 
has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in Phase 1 and 2 studies.
Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated with the 
combination of GLE and PIB. 
EC
50s of PIB for GTs 1 – 6 are similar; EC 50s of GLE for GTs 1 – 6 are similar.  GLE and 
PIB exposure are similar and increased, respectively, when administered together.  
Therefore, GLE and PIB are expected to demonstrate efficacy in subjects infected with these less prevalent genotypes (GT5 and 6).
When GLE was given in combination with PI B in healthy volunteers, results showed that 
GLE exposures were not significantly changed when co-administered with PIB ( ≤ 31% 
difference); however, the exposure of PIB increased in a GLE-dose-dependent manner 
(from 1.5-fold at 100 mg GLE up to 3- to 4-fold at 400 mg GLE).
Results of clinical DDI studies conducted to date have shown that as perpetrators of DDIs, GLE/PIB combination had no clinically meaningful impact on drugs that are substrates of CYP or UGT enzymes.  The GLE/PIB combination increased exposure of substrates for P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters.  Except for some OATP inhibitors (e.g., high dose cyclosporine), ritonavir-boosted  protease inhibitors and P-gp inducers, 
GLE and PIB exposures were minimally affected by co administrations of other drugs.
Phase 2 Studies (Studies M14-867 and M14-868) assessed efficacy, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics of the combination of GLE and PIB in HCV GT1 (Study M14-867 Part 1) or GT2- or 3-infected (Study M14-868 Part 1) in treatment-naïve (TN) and PR-experienced non-cirrhotic sub jects, respectively, GT4 – 6 (Study M14-867 Part 2) or

20
GT2- or 3-infected (Study M14-868 Parts 1 and 2) treatment-naïve and PR-experienced 
subjects with and without cirrhosis.
In Part 1 of Study M14-867, 100% (40/40) of GT 1-infected subjects without cirrhosis 
treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks and 97.4% (38/39) of 
subjects treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 40 mg QD for 12 weeks achieved SVR 12.  
One subject in the GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks group experienced relapse at Post-Treatment Week 4.  In Part 2 of Study M14-867, 97% (33/34) of GT1-infected subjects without cirrhosis treated with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8 weeks achieved SVR
12(one subject discontinued due to metastatic cancer with HCV 
RNA undetectable at last visit).
In Part 1 of Study M14-868, a total of 195 subjects were enrolled and evenly distributed 
within the GT2 and GT3-infected groups.  Two subjects discontinued due to Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Subjects 5904 and 9309 in Arm F), one subject discontinued due to virologic failure (Subject 9106 in Arm F), two subjects were lost to follow-up (Subjects 2005 in Arm F and Subject 2403 in Arm G), and one subject withdrew consent (Subject 4613 in Arm A).  Two of these subjects (Subjects 5904 and 9309; both Arm F) achieved SVR
12.
The SVR 12rates for each of the treatment regimens were 96% (24/25) (including a subject 
who was lost to follow-up) of subjects treated with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks, 100% (24/24) of subjects treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks and 100% (25/25) of subjects treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD + RBV for 12 weeks, and 98.1% (53/54) of subjects treated with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8 weeks.
In Part 1 of Study M14-868, 30 subjects with HCV GT3 infecti on non ci rrhotic, treatment 
naïve and PR-experienced were treated with GLE 300 mg and PIB 120 mg without 
ribavirin for 12 weeks and 93.3% (28/30 subjects) achieved SVR
12.  One subject in this 
arm experienced relapse at Post-Treatment Week 4 and one subject had missing SVR 12
data.

M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
21
In Part 2 of Study M14-867, 100% of subjects infected with HCV GT4, GT5 or GT6 non-
cirrhotic, treatment-naïve and PR-experienced receiving treatment with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks achieved SVR
12(34/34).  GT1-infected treatment-naïve 
and PR-experienced subjects with compensated cirrhosis were also evaluated with the same.  Among the GT1 cirrhotic subjects, 96% (26/27) have achieved SVR
12, with 
one subject experiencing relapse at Post-Treatment Week 4.
In Study M14-868 Part 2, among 29 treatment-naïve non-ci rrhotic s ubjects with GT3 
infection treated for 8 weeks with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD, no subject 
experienced on-treatment virologic failure  or post-treatment relapse.  One of the 
29 subjects had missing SVR 12data.  Among 24 treatment-naïve cirrhotic subjects with 
GT3 infection treated for 12 weeks with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD, no subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse. 
To date, safety data across all arms in Part 1 of Studies M14-867 and M14-868 encompassing 276 subjects treated with GLE at doses 200 and 300 mg and PIB at doses 40 and 120 mg (with and without RBV in Study M14-868) for 12 weeks show that the most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea, and headache (occurring in > 5% of subjects).  Most of them were Grade 1 in severity.  There were no increases in the frequency or severity of any adverse event associated between the different regimens of 
GLE 200 mg plus 40 mg or 120 mg PIB, and GLE 300 mg plus 120 mg PIB.
Of the 276 subjects, there have been 4 (1.5%) treatment-emergent SAEs reported in 
Studies M14-867 and M14-868 combined (all assessed as not related to GLE or PIB):  metastatic prostate cancer, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and B-cell lymphoma and 
one SAE that was not treatment-emergent (spontaneous abortion – also assessed as not related).  Two subjects (0.7%; 2/276) had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.  Both were GT3-infected subjects in the GLE/PIB [200 mg/120 mg] QD + RBV for 12 weeks group of Study M14-868.  One subject with history of irritable bowel disease discontinued for Grade 2 AE of abdominal pain assessed as having a reasonable possibility of relatedness to both the DAAs and RBV.  Baseline ALT elevations for this subject normalized during treatment and there were no on-

22
treatment ALT elevations above baseline; s ubject had total bilirubin elevations that were 
primarily indirect.  The abdominal pain for this subject resolved after discontinuation 
from study drug.  The other subject discontinued for the aforementioned Grade 4 SAE of B-cell lymphoma for the purposes of initiating chemotherapy.
In both Studies M14-867 and M14-868, in all subjects with baseline alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) elevations, the ALT levels showed a trend toward normal or became normal with DAA treatment.  There have been no on-treatment ALT elevations above baseline.  The ALT normalization pattern was similar across all arms (i.e., all GLE and PIB dose levels) in both studies.  Other laboratory abnormalities were infrequent and primarily associated with the well-described hemolytic effect of RBV, manifesting as Grade 1 anemia in a total of 4 subjects, all occurring in Study M14 868 RBV-containing arms.  Observed total bilirubin elevations we re Grade 1 or 2 with predominantly indirect 
fraction, were mostly isolated occurrences, and normalized or stabilized with continued DAA therapy.  Total bilirubin elevations were primarily observed in the RBV-containing arms.
The safety of the combination regimen of GLE and PIB in subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis is investigated in Study M14-867 Part 2 (GLE/PIB [200 mg/120 mg] QD for 12 weeks) and Study M14-868 Part 2 (GLE/PIB [300 mg/120 mg] QD for 12 weeks with and without ribavirin or for 16 weeks without ribavirin.  Based on 82 subjects with compensated cirrhosis enrolled in these arms who have received 4 weeks or more of treatment, the GLE and PIB regimen has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in this patient population.  The majority of adverse events have been Grade 1 or 2 and there have been no treatment discontinuations.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharm acology and toxicology, in vitro virology 
and metabolism, and clinical d ata for GLE, PIB, and the combination of GLE and PIB can 
be found in the GLE and PIB Fixed-Dose Combination Investigator's Brochure.

3.1 Differences Statement
The current Study, M16-126, is a Phase 3b study in which the efficacy and safety of co-
formulated GLE/PIB will be evaluated in  treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced 
(i.e., has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy), chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infected adu lts without cirrhosis or with compensated 
cirrhosis for 8 or 12 weeks, respectively.  The ongoing Studies M14-868 (Part 4) and M13-583 are assessing the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GLE/PIB for 8 or 12 weeks in mono-infected HCV GT4 – 6 subjects without cirrhosis.  The ongoing Phase 3 Study M14-172 is assessing the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GLE/PIB in mono-infected HCV GT1, 2, 4 – 6 subjects with compensated cirrhosis for 12 weeks of treatment.
The current study, Study M16-126, evaluates GT5 and GT6 subjects in a wider 
geographic region compared with prior studies .  Importantly, this study will generate 
additional efficacy and safety data following 8 weeks of treatment with GLE/PIB.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Benefits of treatment with GLE/PIB include:  potent and pangenotypic antiviral activity 
in vitro, higher genetic barrier to devel opment of drug resistance across genotypes 
compared to first generation protease an d NS5A inhibitors, no need for RBV, 8 or 
12 weeks of treatment, and the convenience of a once daily regimen.
Adverse events that are known, and those not previously described, may occur with 
GLE/PIB as detailed in the informed consent of this study.  In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  
Additional safety data for each DAA alone and the combination of PIB/GLE are detailed in Section 3.0and in the Investigator's Brochure.
10
Risks associated with PIB/GLE, including the risks of toxicity, virologic failure, and development of resistant mutations (Section 5.3.4 ), appear to be limited and manageable 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
24
based upon the available data.  Given the potential for SVR in this population of HCV 
GT5 or 6 infected subjects, the risk-benefit assessment is favorable.
4.0 Study Objective
4.1 Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by evaluating the percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12) and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in adults 
with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir will be assessed by genotypes across treatment durations (or cirrhosis status) and the safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir will be assessed by  treatment duration (or cirrhos is status) across 
genotypes.
4.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives are to assess efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir by hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection across treatment duration (or cirrhosis status) by evaluating the following:
●The percentages of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure;
●The percentages of subjects with HCV virologic relapse across treatment 
durations (or cirrhosis status).
Additional objectives are to assess pharmacokinetics and emergence and persistence of 
viral variants in these treatment regimens.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB in HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced (i.e., has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy), chronic 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
25
HCV GT5 or 6 infected subjects, without cirrhosis (F0-F3) for an 8-week treatment 
duration or with compensated cirrhosis (F4) for a 12-week treatment duration.
This study will consist of 2 periods as follows:
Treatment Period:  Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive GLE/PIB for an 
8 or 12 week treatment duration based on cirrhotic status.
Post-Treatment Period:  Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the 
Treatment Period will be followed for 24 weeks after their last dose of study 
drug to evaluate efficacy and to monitor HCV RNA and the emergence and persistence of viral variants.
A study schematic is shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1. Study Design (Treatment Period)
* Approximately 30 GT5-infected subjects and approximately 50 GT6-infected subjects will be enrolled in the 
study.  The study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following enrollment criteria:  1) a minimum of 
15 GT5 and 30 GT6 subjects and 2) up to approximately 16 subjects with compensated cirrhosis (regardless of GT).
Approximately 80 eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of the following treatment 
arms:
●Arm A:  HCV GT 5 or 6 non-cirrhotic sub jects will be treated with GLE/PIB 
300 mg/120 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks.
●Arm B:  HCV GT 5 or 6 subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be treated 
with GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.

26
The study was designed to enroll approximately 80 subjects to meet scientific and 
regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
5.1.1 Screening
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study-specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system .  The investigator will evaluate whether 
the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2
during the period from the Screening Visit through Study Day 1 prior to dosing, and will record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent process in the subject's medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 35 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.
5.1.1.1 Rescreening
Subjects who at Screening have any of the following are not eligible to rescreen or retest:
●A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg);
●A positive HIV test;
●HCV genotype does not meet Inclusion Criterion 4, Section 5.2.1 , or meets 
Exclusion Criteria 4 and 5, Section 5.2.2 ;
●A positive serum pregnancy test (if female).
Otherwise subjects may be retested or rescreened only once.
Subjects who have exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) are allowed to retest on the 
related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary ALT requires a repeat chemistry panel) within the same screening period and must meet all eligibility laboratory criteria on any panel that is repeated.  If any of the retest result(s) are ex clusionary, the subject may not be rescreened.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
27
Subjects that are rescreened outside of th e initial 35 day screening period must be 
rescreened for all laboratory and eligibility criteria, not just those that were exclusionary.
Subjects who rescreen or subjects not meeting the study eligibility criteria must be 
identified by site personnel as a screen failure in the IRT.
5.1.2 Treatment Period
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled via IRT.  Subjects will be 
administered study drug at the site on Study Day 1, with dosing instructions.
Study visits and procedures during the Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C .  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed th roughout the study.  Laboratory testing will 
include chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis as specified in Table 2 .  Plasma samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis and HCV RNA analysis will be collected as detailed in 
Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.1.1 Blood samples for optional pharmacogenetic analysis 
will be collected as detailed in Appendix C .
All subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis as outlined in Appendix C .  Sites should ensure that subjects adhe re to all study visits.  Subjects who 
cannot complete their study visit per the visit schedule should ensure they do not run out of study drug prior to their next study visit.   Compliance is critical to ensure adequate 
drug exposure.
HCV virologic failure criteria will be evaluated and applied by the investigator as detailed 
in Section 5.4.1.1 .
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C and as described in Section 5.4.1 .

5.1.3 Post-Treatment Period
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug will be monitored in the Post-
Treatment Period for 24 weeks following the last dose of study drug for safety, HCV RNA, and the emergence and persistence of HC V resistance-associated viral variants.
The Post-Treatment Period will begin the day following the last dose of study drug.  Study visits during the Post-Treatment period are detailed in Appendix C and 
Section 5.3.1.1 .
Subjects who prematurely discontinue during the Post-Treatment Period should return to the site for a Post-Treatment discont inuation visit as outlined in Appendix C .

Rationale for Inclusion Criteria
1, 4 – 7, 8 – 11 In order to select the appropriate subject population with appropriate 
disease characteristics for evaluation
2, 3 The impact of GLE and PIB on human pregnancies has not been 
established.  However, assessment of the completed nonclinical 
reproductive toxicology studies indi cates that there is no drug-related 
effect on teratogenicity/fetotoxicity .  In addition, the compounds are 
non-genotoxic

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving from the time of signing the consent through the Treatment Period and 30 days after study drug is stopped, must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route, and frequency.  The investigator should review all concomitant medications for any potential interactions.
During the Post-Treatment Period, all medications taken will be recorded until 30 days 
following the last dose of study drug.  Only medications associated with HCV or taken for a serious adverse event (SAE) will be recorded thereafter.
The AbbVie TA MD should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant 
or prior therapies.
5.2.3.1 Prior HCV Therapy
Subjects must be HCV treatment-naïve (i.e., has never received a single dose of any 
approved or investigational anti-HCV medication) or treatment-experienced (i.e., has 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
34
failed prior interferon [IFN] or pegylated interferon [pegIFN] with or without ribavirin 
[RBV], or sofosbuvir [SOF] plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy).  Prior HCV treatment with any other approved or inves tigational medications is not allowed.
Subjects will be categorized as:
●HCV Treatment-naïve:  subject has never received any treatment for HCV 
infection.
●Subjects with an allowed prior HCV treatment will be categorized as:
○Non-responder:   HCV RNA detected at the end of a prior treatment 
course (except for breakthrough, which is captured separately).  These 
subjects are further categorized as:
●Null responder:  failed to achieve a 1 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV 
RNA by Week 4 or a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA by 
Week 12 during a prior treatment course;
●Partial responder:  achieved at least a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV 
RNA by Week 12 during a prior treatment course but failed to achieve 
HCV RNA undetectable (or unquantifiable) at the end of treatment;
●Unknown or unable to specify:  insufficient data to categorize as null or partial responder.
○Breakthrough:   confirmed ≥ 1 log
10IU/mL increase from nadir or 
achieved HCV RNA undetectable (or unquantifiable) during a prior 
treatment course but HCV RNA was quantifiable during or at the end of 
treatment.
○Relapse:   achieved HCV RNA undetectable (or unquantifiable) at the end 
of a prior treatment course but  HCV RNA was detectable following 
cessation of therapy.
○Other:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is other than above.
○Unknown:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is unknown.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
35
Subjects must have discontinued prior HCV treatment ≥ 2 months prior to the Screening 
Visit in order to be eligible for the study.  For subjects who had multiple HCV treatment 
courses, the categorization of previous response category will be based on the last prior treatment.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
Subjects should be on a stable dose of concomit ant medications for at least 2 weeks prior 
to initiation of study drug.  The investigator should confirm that a concomitant 
medication/supplement can be safely administered with study drug.  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to the potential for drug-drug interactions. 
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-st udy doses, 14 days following discontinuation 
of study drug, if applicable.
5.2.3.3 Prohibited Therapy
Subjects must be able and willing to safely discontinue any prohibited medications or 
supplements listed in Table 1 at least 2 weeks or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior 
to the first dose of any study drug and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for 14 days following discontinuation of study drug.

* Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (including atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin) must not be taken with the 
study drug.  Subjects receiving these statins must discontinue the prohibited statin at least 14 days or 10 half-lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and, based on  investigator's judgment, (a) switch to pravastatin or rosuvastatin or (b) interrupt statin therapy throughout the treatment period and until 14 days after the last dose of study drug.  If treating with pravastatin or rosuvastatin, it is recommended to reduce the pravastatin dose by 50% or limit the rosuvastatin dose to 10 mg QD when taking with the study drug.
Contraceptives and/or hormonal replacement therapies containing only progestins (such as 
those containing norethindrone, desogestrel, or levonorgestrel), or those containing progestins with non-ethinyl estradiol estrogens (e.g., esterified or conjugated) may be used with GLE/PIB at the discretion of the Investigator.
The chronic use of systemic immunosuppressants is  prohibited from 2 weeks prior to the 
first dose of study drug and until 30 days af ter the last dose of study drug including, but 
not limited to, corticosteroids (prednisone e quivalent of > 10 mg/day for > 2 weeks), 
azathioprine, or m onoclonal antibodies (e.g., infliximab).
5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing
If female, subject must be either postmenopausal defined as:

5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenetic and Safety 
Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C and Appendix D .  
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
Informed Consent
Signed study-specific informed consent will be obtained from the subject before any study 
procedures are performed.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Medical History
A complete medical history, including history of  tobacco, alcohol and drug use, will be 
taken from each subject at Screening Visit.  The subject's medical history will be updated at the Study Day 1 Visit.  This updated medical history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at visits specified in Appendix C or 
upon subject discontinuation.  A symptom-directed physical examination may be 
performed at any other visit, when necessary.
The physical examination performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline physical 
examination for clinical assessment.  Any significant physical examination findings after 
the first dose will be recorded as adverse events.
Height will be measured only at Screening.  Waist circumference will be measured at 
Screening; however, if it is not measured at Screening, it can be measured on Day 1.

M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
39
Vital Signs and Weight
Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and body weight will be measured at each study 
visit as specified in Appendix C and Appendix D .  Blood pressure and pulse rate should 
be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes.  The subject should wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.  The vital signs performed on Day 1 of the Treatment Period will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in Appendix C .  The ECG 
should be performed prior to blood collection.
The ECG will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site ("local 
reader").  The local reader from the site will sign, and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the 
following categories:
●Normal ECG
●Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
●Abnormal ECG – clin ically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source.  The automatic machine r eading (i.e., machine-generated measurements 
and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for the clinical laboratory tests outlined in Table 2
at the visits indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D .  
Blood samples for serum chemistry tests should be collected following a minimum 8-hour 
fast prior to study drug intake (with the excep tion of the Screening Visit, which may be 
non-fasting).  Subjects whose visits occur prior to the morning dose of study drug should 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
40
be instructed to fast after midnight until the blood sample is collected in the morning and 
thereafter take their study medications with food.  Subjects whose visits occur following the morning dose of study drug should be instructe d to fast after breakfast until the study 
visit occurs.  At the Study Day 1 visit, a fasting blood sample should be collected prior to 
the first dose of study drug.  Bl ood samples should still be drawn if the subject did not fast 
for at least 8 hours.  Fasting or non-fasti ng status will be recorded in the source 
documents and on the laboratory requisition.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.
A central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.
Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be 
provided by th e central laboratory chosen for this study.  The certified laboratory chosen 
for this study is Covance.  Samples will be sent to the following addresses:

Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
42
●The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out-of-range value.
●The investigator will follow the out-of- range value to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.
●A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the 
study or study drug or requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded 
as an adverse event.
The management of laboratory abnormalities that may occur during the study is described 
in Section 6.1.7 .
Pregnancy Testing
A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential at Screening.  Additional urine pregnancy tests will be performed every 4 weeks, starting at Day 1 (prior to enrollment) during the treatment period, including at the last Treatment Period visit and until 30 days of la st study drug dose, as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D .  Determination of postmenopausal status will be made during the Screening 
period, based on the subject's history.
●Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently 
surgically sterile as defined in Section 5.2.4 ) at Screening do not require 
pregnancy testing.
Concomitant Medication Assessment
Please refer to Section 5.2.3 .
Hepatitis B and C Virus and HIV Screen
HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV Ab and anti-HIV Ab will be performed at 
Screening.  The investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health 
agencies with the subject.  The site will re port these results per local regulations, if 
necessary.  The HIV results will not be re ported by the central laboratory to the clinical 
database.

M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
43
Liver Diagnostic Testing
Subjects will be considered to be non-ci rrhotic or ci rrhotic based on the definitions below:
Non-Cirrhotic
●A liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating 
the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, Ishak fibrosis score of ≤ 4; or
●A FibroScan®score of < 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period (FibroScan®must be approved by the local regulatory agency 
to qualify for entrance criteria); or
●A Screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.48 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to 
Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) < 1.
Cirrhotic
●Previous histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, 
Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of > 3, Ishak 
score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
●A FibroScan®score of ≥ 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period (FibroScan®must be approved by the local regulatory agency 
to qualify for entrance criteria); or
●A Screening FibroTest result that is ≥ 0.75 and an APRI > 2.
In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by 
Fibrotest/APRI using the above criteria (indeterminate FibroTest [0.48 < result < 0.75], or conflicting FibroTest and APRI results [e.g., FibroTest ≤ 0.48, but APRI ≥ 1]), a liver 
biopsy or FibroScan
®is required.  Liver biopsy results will supersede Fibrotest/APRI or 
FibroScan®results and be considered definitive.  At Screening, it is recommended that 
subjects should otherwise meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria before undergoing a liver biopsy.

M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
45
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Screening:  Liver Ultrasound 
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the 
Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D , for subjects with compensated cirrhosis only.  In-between those visits, HCC 
screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis will be required to undergo a liver ultrasound to screen for HCC, unless the subject has a historical liver ultrasound, CT scan or MRI performed for HCC screening within 3 months prior to those visits, in which case the result of the historical ultrasound, CT scan or MRI will be used as the result for the Study Visit assessment.  A positive 
ultrasound result suspicious of HCC will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., CT scan or MRI) at a study visit should be discussed with the study designated physician.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Instruments (Questionnaires)
Subjects will complete the self-administered PRO instruments (where allowed per local 
regulatory guidelines) on the study visits specified in Appendix C and Appendix D .  
Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with each instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  
Subjects who are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaires to them.  Site personnel should encourage completion of each instrument at all specified visits and should ensure that a response is entered for all items.
Short Form 36 – Version 2 Health Survey
The SF-36v2 is a general Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument with 
extensive use broad variety of health condi tions and is the standard in literature for 
HCV.  The SF-36v2 instrument comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
46
subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role 
physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functi oning, role emotional and 
mental health).  Domain scores are also aggregated into a Physical Component Summary score and a Mental Component Summary score.  Higher SF-36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  The SF-36v2 should require approximately 10 minutes to complete.
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)-HCV Specific Instrument –
Version 2
The WPAI-Hepatitis C questionnaire is an instrument to measure impairments in both 
paid work and unpaid work from HCV-infected people.  It measures absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work productivity loss, as well as impairments in unpaid activity because of hepatitis C.  The WPAI-Hepatitis C consists of 6 questions:  1 = currently employed; 2 = hours missed due to hepatitis C; 3 = hours missed other reasons; 4 = hours actually worked; 5 = degree hepatitis C affected productivity while working (using a 0 to 10 visual analog scale [VAS]); 6 = degree hepatitis C affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (VAS).  The WPAI-Hepatitis C should require approximately 5 minutes to complete.
PRO instruments should be consistently presented so that subjects complete the questionnaires in the following order:  the SF-36v2 and WPAI-Hepatitis C.  PRO instruments should be completed prior to drug administration on Day 1 and prior to any 
discussion of adverse events or any re view of laboratory findings, including HCV RNA 
levels.
Enrollment and Assignment of Subject Numbers
All Screening activities must be completed and reviewed prior to enrollment.  Subjects 
who meet all the Inclusion Criter ia and none of the Exclusion Criteria at Screening will 
proceed to enrollment via the IRT system on Study Day 1.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
47
Subject numbers will be unique 5-digit numbers and will begin with 10001 with the 
first three digits representing the investigative site, and the last two digits representing the subjects at that site.  Enrolled subjects will keep their subject number throughout the study.  Subjects will be enrolled on Study Day 1 as described in Section 5.5.4 .
Study Drug Compliance for Kits
Individual bottles of GLE/PIB will be provided for subject dosing to the site.  Each subject will have compliance documented by the site in the subject's source notes for GLE/PIB.  At each Study Drug Accountability Visit in Appendix C the overall number of 
tablets of GLE/PIB remaining in each bottle will be recorded and entered in the IRT system along with the date of reconciliation.
Additional information regarding treatment compliance can be found in Section 5.5.6 .
HCV Genotype and Subgenotype
Plasma samples for HCV genotype and subt ype determination will be collected at 
Screening.  Genotype and subtype will be assessed using the Versant®HCV Genotype 
Inno LiPA Assay, Version 2.0 or higher ( LiPA; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, 
Tarrytown, NY) by the central laboratory.  If the LiPA assay is unable to genotype a 
sample, its genotype and subtype will be determined by a Sanger sequencing assay of a region of the NS5B gene by the central laboratory.
HCV RNA Levels
Plasma samples for HCV RNA levels will be collected as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D .  Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by 
the central laboratory using the Roche COBAS®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan HCV 
Quantitative Test, v2.0.  The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) for th is assay (regardless of genotype) are both 15 IU/mL.

and at the study visits indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D .  Specific instructions for 
preparation and storage of HCV RNA and HCV resistance samples will be provided by the central laboratory, AbbVie, or its designee.
Archive Plasma Sample
Archive plasma samples will be collected at the study visits, indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D .  Archive plasma samples are being collected for possible additional 
analyses, including but not limited to, study drug or metabolite measurements, HCV RNA 
levels, safety/efficacy assessments, HCV gene sequencing, HCV resistance testing, and other possible predictors of response, as determined by AbbVie.
Specific instructions for preparation and storage of archive samples will be provided by 
the central laboratory, AbbVie, or its designee.
Study Drug Dosing Card
Subjects will be provided with self-adminis tration instructions and study drug dosing 
cards to record the exact date, time (record to the nearest minute) and number of tablets of 
study drug administration (GLE/PIB) for the last 2 doses of each study drug taken prior to the scheduled pharmacokinetic sample collection during the Treatment Period.
The site staff will record the information about the last 2 doses taken prior to the scheduled pharmacokinetic sample collection from the study drug dosing card into the eCRF.  In the event that the dosing card is not available, the site may obtain dosing information via patient interview and record this information in the source notes and the eCRF.
To facilitate proper dosing of study drug before pharmacokinetic evaluation blood 
samples are taken, the following procedures should be performed:

5.3.3.3 HCV Resistance Variables
For all subjects receiving study drug, the variants at signature resistance-associated amino 
acid positions at baseline identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) will be compared to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drug 
who do not achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA 
≥1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples identified by 
NGS and comparison to the baseline sequence, 2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance associated positions identified by NGS and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral resistance by NGS.
5.3.4 Safety Variables
The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  adverse events, vital 
signs, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory tests assessments.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Individual plasma concentrations of GLE and PIB will be tabulated and summarized.  
Values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of GLE and PIB, including apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) will be estimated using population pharmacokinetic modeling procedures.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 Pharmacogenetic Exploratory Research Variables
IL28B status will be determined for each subject and analyzed as a factor contributing to 
the subject's response to study  treatment.  These IL28B GT results may be analyzed as 
part of a multi-study assessment of IL28B and response to study drug or drugs of a similar class.  The results may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
53
IL28B and study treatment, or drugs of a similar class.  The results of additional 
pharmacogenetic IL28B analyses may not be reported with the clinical study report.
Optional pharmacogenetic samples may be collected to conduct exploratory investigations 
into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or metabolites.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of factors influencing the subjects' response to the study drug (or drugs of the same or similar class) or the development and progression of the subjects' disease or related conditions.  The samples may also be used to develop new diagnostic tests, therapies, re search methods, or technologies.  The results 
from these analyses are exploratory in nature, may not be included with the study report, and may be performed by a non-GLP laboratory.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator 
considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.
If, during the course of study drug administrati on, the subject prematurely discontinues, 
the procedures outlined for the applicable Premature D/C Visit should be completed as 
defined in Appendix C and Appendix D .  Ideally this should occur on the day of study 
drug discontinuation, but no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV th erapy.  However, these procedures should not 
interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the EDC (electronic data capture) system.  The subject should then begin the Post-
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
54
Treatment Period where the subject will be monitored for 24 weeks for HCV RNA and 
the emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants.
If a subject is discontinued from study drug or in the Post-Treatment Period with an 
ongoing adverse event or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory re sult or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject reports becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the administration of study drug may be continued at the Principal Investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing study drug is felt to outweigh the potential risk.  Specific instructions regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.1.6 .  If a 
subject is discontinued, subject will be monitored for SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .
5.4.1.1 HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of HCV virologic failure for the 
purposes of subject management:
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV 
RNA measurement of > 1 log
10IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
study drug treatment.
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during study drug 
treatment.
When confirmatory testing is re quired, it should be completed as soon as possible and the 
subject should remain on study drug treatment until the virologic failure criteria has been 
confirmed.  Subjects meeting the virologic fail ure criteria will be discontinued from study 
drug and will continue to be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants until 24 weeks post-treatment.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
At the Screening Visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the 
use of IRT.  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must contact the IRT system and identify the subject as a screen failure.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number, assigned at the Screening Visit, 
throughout the study.  For enrollment of eligible subjects into the study, the site will utilize the IRT system in order to receive the treatment assignment.  Enrolled subjects will be assigned to either Arm A (8 weeks of treatment) or Arm B (12 weeks of treatment) based on cirrhotic status.  The study drug kit numbers will be assigned according to schedules computer-generated before the start of the study by the AbbVie Statistics Department.
Contact information and user guidelines for IRT use will be provided to each site.  Upon 
receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.
Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled as described in Section 8.3.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.4 .  Study drug dosing will 
be initiated at the Study Day 1 Visit.All tablets of GLE/PIB will be dosed together (three tablets once daily).  All subjects 
should take all doses of study medications with food.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label study.5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
58
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
At the start of the study, each subject should receive counseling regarding the importance 
of dosing compliance with the treatment regimen with regard to HCV virologic response and potential development of resistance due to poor compliance.
At each study visit after Day 1 during the Tr eatment Period, subjects will be instructed to 
bring all bottles of study drug (full, partial, or empty) for assessment of treatment 
compliance.  At Study Drug Accountability visits denoted in Appendix C , study site 
personnel will assess subject compliance by inspecting the contents of the bottles and record the status of each one, as well as the exact number of remaining tablets of GLE/PIB in IRT.  Treatment compliance will be based on the number of tablets dispensed, as recorded in IRT, and the number of remaining tablets.  If poor compliance is noted, the subject should be counseled and this should be documented in the subject's source.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator or his/her representative will ve rify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document and via recording in the IRT system.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by the investigator and will include lot number, kit number, number of tablets dispensed, subject number, initials of person who dispensed study drug, and d ate dispensed for each subject.  An overall 
accountability of the study drug will be performed  and verified by the AbbVie monitor 
throughout the Treatment Period.  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.  Final accountability will be  verified by the monitor at the end of study 
drug treatment at the site.
During the study, should an enrolled subject  misplace or damage a study drug bottle of 
GLE/PIB the IRT system must be contacted and informed of the misplaced or damaged 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
59
study drug.  If the bottle is damaged, the sub ject will be requested to return the remaining 
study drug to the site.  Replacement study drug may only be dispensed to the subject by 
contacting the IRT system.  Study drug repl acement(s) and an explanation of the reason 
for the misplaced or damaged study drug(s) will be documented within the IRT system.  
The study drug start date and the last dose of the regimen will be documented in the subject's source documents and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  The status of each bottle, number of tablets remaining in each one returned, and the date of reconciliation will be documented in the IRT system.  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.
Upon completion of or discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all original study drug 
bottles (containing unused study drug) will be returned to AbbVie (or designee) or destroyed on site.  All destruction procedure s will be according to instructions from the 
Sponsor and according to local regulations  following completion of drug accountab ility 
procedures.  The number of tablets of each type of study drug returned in each bottle will be noted in the IRT system or on a drug accountability log (if appropriate).  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
The current study (Study M16-126) is a Phase 3b study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
(percent of patients achieving SVR
12) and safety of combination regimen of GLE 300 mg 
and PIB 120 mg QD in treatment-naïve and -experienced subjects infected with chronic HCV GT5 and GT6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis for 8 weeks or 12 weeks, respectively. 
Treatment durations were selected based on available data (all SVR
4and available SVR 12
rates) from 8-week or 12-week treatment groups receiving GLE/PIB combinations in 
Studies M14-867 and M14-868 in HCV GT1, GT2, GT3, GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected non-cirrhotic p atients with or without previous treatment experience.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
60
The 8-week treatment duration has been evaluated in 34 GT1, 54 GT2, and 29 GT3 
treatment-naïve and -experienced subjects without cirrhosis in Part 2 of Studies M14-867 
and M14-868, respectively, and demonstrated robust SVR 12rates without virologic 
failures, to date.  SVR 12rates were 97% (33/34), 98% (53/54), and 97% (28/29%) for 
GT1, GT2, and GT3, respectively.  In addition, the GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg combination regimen demonstrated 100% SVR
12in a total of 34 GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected non-
cirrhotic subjects wh en taken for a 12-week duration.  Based on the efficacy data 
presented above, the 8-week treatment duration is anticipated to achieve high SVR rates in GT5 – 6-infected treatment-naïve and -e xperienced subjects without cirrhosis.
13,14
The 12-week duration of the GLE/PIB combination regimen in adults with chronic HCV genotype (GT) 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection with compensated cirrhosis is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 (Study M14-172) study.  The number of GT5 (n = 3) and GT6 (n = 7) 
subjects enrolled were small.
With an expected SVR rate approaching 100%, as observed in the Phase 2 Studies, the 
benefit of a non-inferiority design with an active-comparator is limited.  This design is therefore believed to be an appropriate approach for demonstrating efficacy in these GTs of lower prevalence.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures w ill be u tilized 
in this study.  HCV RNA assays are standard and validated.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
This study plans to enroll HCV GT5, or 6-infected subjects, with or without compensated 
cirrhosis who are HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced in order to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of GLE/PIB.  Subjects who are treatment-naïve as well as those who have failed prior IFN or pegIFN (with or without RBV), or SOF plus RBV (with or without pegIFN) therap y for their HCV infection are included in 
the study in order to evaluate the efficacy of GLE/PIB regimen in this diverse cohort of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
61
HCV GT5 and GT6-infected subjects.  There is no expectation of cross-resistance 
between IFN, pegIFN, RBV, or SOF with either GLE or PIB because of the differences in their mechanisms of action.  Subjects who have failed treatment with a PI or NS5A inhibitor alone or in combination with interferon (with or without RBV) will not be permitted to enroll, because the results from ongoing Phase 2 study evaluating the regimen in DAA experienced patients (Study M15-410) are not available.
HCV-infected subjects with chronic HCV infection have moderate stable elevations of 
AST and ALT levels and are considered representative of the population who will receive anti-HCV therapy.  The age range selected for this study, 18 years of age or older, is also intended to be representative of the target population.  Similarly, a substantial portion of the HCV infected population has a relatively high BMI, and given the acceptable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of GLE and PIB in previous studies, this protocol will enroll subjects without a BMI restriction.
In order to be enrolled in the study, subjects who are on stable opiate replacement must be 
on a therapy with methadone or buprenorphine with or without naloxone for at least 
6 months prior to screening.  This is based on the results from Study M13-602 that evaluated the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and tolerability effects of the co-administration of methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone and GLE/PIB in adult subjects on stable opioid therapy, which showed acceptable safety and no relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
5.6.4.1 Rationale for Dose Selections
The doses of 300 mg GLE and 120 mg PIB were selected to optimize efficacy of the 
combination while maintaining an acceptable safety profile, and to be consistent with the dose selection for GLE and PIB in the currently on-going AbbVie HCV Phase 3 studies.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
62
5.6.4.1.1 GLE and PIB Dose and Treatment Duration
Based on the results from the Phase 2b studies, Studies M14-867 and M14-868, the 
300 mg dose of the GLE and 120 mg dose of PIB in combination has been selected for Phase 3 studies in HCV GT1 to 6 treatment- naïve and -experienced, cirrhotic and non-
cirrhotic populations.  This dose has been demonstrated efficacious for the proposed 
Phase 3 study populations with12-week planne d study duration and would reduce chances 
of virologic failures across genotypes and difficult-to-treat patient populations to maximize the chance for SVR.  Importantly, one thousand and six HCV-infected subjects have been dosed with the combination of GLE and PIB in ongoing Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies to date.  This combination has b een well-tolerated and safe across all studies 
including cirrhotic and prior treatment experienced subjects (Data on file).  The most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea and headache and were mostly Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  In all subjects with baseline ALT elevations, ALT levels norm alized or trended toward normal with DAA treatment, and there have been no on-
treatment ALT elevations above baseline grade.
Results from GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8-week treatment duration in HCV 
GT1 (n = 34) Study M14-867 Part 2) and HCV GT2 (n = 54) (Study M14-868 Part 2) showed 97.1% and 98.1% SVR
12respectively.  In Study M14-867 Part 2, GLE 300 mg 
QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks was evaluated in 34 DAA-naïve HCV GT4 (n = 22), GT5 (n = 1), and GT6 (n = 11)-infected non-ci rrhotic sub jects.  All 34 subjects achieved 
SVR
12.  Based on exposure-response analyses, simulations were conducted to predict 
SVR rates for GLE and PIB administered 8 weeks in HCV GT4-infected subjects and showed > 95% SVR in this population.  GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8 weeks will be used in this study for HCV genotype 5 and 6 non-cirrhotic subjects.
Efficacy results from Part 2 of Study M14-868 in GT3 treatment-naïve cirrhotic patients 
showed 100% SVR
12for GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg QD administered for 12 weeks.  
Based on simulations conducted to predict SVR rates of 300 mg/120 mg GLE/PIB for 12 and 16 weeks in HCV GT1 subjects with cirrhosis, this GLE/PIB dose could provide improved SVR rates compared to lower doses and a duration of 12 weeks could achieve 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
63
an SVR rate close to 100% in cirrhotic subjects with HCV GT1 infection.  Longer 
duration (e.g., 16 weeks) of 300 mg/120 mg GLE/PIB QD treatment is not expected to provide a significant improvement in the SVR rate (in GT1).  Similar to GT1, the 
predicted SVR rates for GT2 subjects with cirrhosis following 300 mg/120 mg GLE/PIB QD treatment for 12 weeks is 98%.  This dose is also anticipated to yield high SVR rate following 12-week treatment duration in GT4 to GT6 infected cirrhotic population.
In summary, based on clinical trial data and exposure-response analyses, it is expected 
that GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg QD will achieve high SVR rate in both non-cirrhosis (administered for 8 weeks) and compensated cirrhosis subjects (administered for 12 weeks).
5.6.4.2 Risk of Development of Resistance Mutations During 
Combination DAA Trials
In subjects treated with a DAA, variants with amino acid substitution(s) in the targeted 
protein conferring resistance to the DAA can be selected.  For example, in AbbVie HCV Phase 3 studies in which patients with GT1 infection were treated with the NS3/4A protease inhibitor paritaprevir and NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir, variants that conferred resistance to paritaprevir or ombitasvir were detected in patients experiencing virologic failure.  While resistance data from patients treated with the combination of PIB and GLE are limited, it is expected that PIB, an NS5A inhibitor, will be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing resistance-associated variants in NS3 that confer resistance to GLE, because there should not be any cross-resistance in variants resistant to DAAs targeting different proteins.  The converse is expected to be true as well – GLE should be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing NS5A variants conferring resistance to PIB.  In addition, in vitro resistant col ony selection studies in HCV replicon cells 
containing GT1 – 6 NS5A demonstrated that PIB had a high genetic barrier to resistance –very few colonies were selected, and most of those that were selected contained NS5A variants that conferred only modest levels of resistance to PIB.  It remains to be seen whether the development of resistance in subjects treated with PIB resembles that seen in vitro.  Based on accumulated clinical and in vi tro data to date, the risk of development of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
64
resistant variants during GLE and PIB combination trials is reduced when compared to 
treatment with first generation protease and NS5A inhibitors.  For example, the combination of PIB and GLE achieved high SVR rates with few virologic failures in DAA-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection in the Phase 2 SURVEYOR-I and -II studies.  These results support the prediction that the risk of development of resistance-asso ciated variants with GLE a nd PIB combination treatment is

A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associ ated with any component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1
through 6.1.7.1 .  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query , observed by site personnel, or reported 
spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.

6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in disconti nuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity management) and/or if the 
investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occu r during the study will not be considered 
an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is  being performed for a pre-existing condition 
and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-
existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
66
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurre d in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospitalization, prolonga tion of hospitalization, 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4). 
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity. 
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semi-colon  indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization ind icated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc. 
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not re ported a causality or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related nonserious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until 30 days following di scontinuation of study treatment has 
elapsed, all adverse events will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported 
by the subject.  After 30 days following completion of study treatment and throughout the 
Post-Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event data into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

Directive 2001/20/EC.  The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the EU 
countries will be the most current version of the Investigator's Brochure.
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Administration of study drug may be continued at the investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing therapy is felt to outweigh the risk (Section 5.4.1 ).  If a subject is discontinued, the subject 
will be monitored for SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in  a study subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies occurring up to 30 days after the end of treatment.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not consid ered an adverse even t. However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
For the purpose of medical management, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
that occur during the study must be evaluated by  the investigator.  All adverse events and 
laboratory abnormali ties will be managed and followed to a satisf actory clinical 
resolution.  A toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of the investigator.  The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is to be used in the grading of adverse events and laboratory  abnormalities, which is available on the Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf.

72
Specific toxicity management guidelines apply to the instances of increases in ALT 
(Section 6.1.7.1 ).
6.1.7.1 Management of Increases in ALT
If a subject experiences a post-baseline increase in ALT to > 5 × ULN which is also 
> 2 × baseline value, the subject should have a confirmatory ALT measurement performed.
If, the ALT increase is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN which is also > 2 × baseline value, the 
recommendations below should be followed:
●Complete hepatic questionnaire.
●Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), and obtain additional testing as appropriate (e.g., hepatitis B panel).
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drug if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
○Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
○At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases is permitted with approval of the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
73
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, or packaging issues.
Any information available to help in the determination of causality to the events outlined 
directly above should be captured.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a 
satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up informatio n is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor.  Product Complaints associated with adverse events w ill be reported in the study summary.  All 
other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition.  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the 
investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22

Such contact must be made as soon as possible to permit a review by AbbVie to Statist ical 
Methods and/or the study.
8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The primary analysis will occur after all subjects have completed the PT Week 12 Visit or 
prematurely discontinued treatment.  The data for the primary analysis will be locked after data cleaning.  Data after PT Week 12 will be added to a new version of the database which will be cleaned and locked at the end of the study.
SAS
®(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) for the UNI X operating system will be used for all 
analyses.  All confidence intervals will be  two-sided with an alpha level of 0.05.
Descriptive statistics will be provided, such as the number of observations (N), mean, and 
standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and counts and percentages for discrete variables.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
75
Safety, and demographic analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of study drug.
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population defined as 
all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise 
specified.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, when applicable, will be performed 
on the intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects not of GT5, 6 according to phylogenetic analyses (mITT-GT), and on the mITT-GT population further modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR
12for reasons other than virologic failure 
(mITT-GT-VF).
No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined visit windows.  A 
backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.
8.1.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics w ill be summarized for all treated subjects by 
HCV GT (GT5 and 6 separately, across arms), by Arm (A and B), and overall.  
Demographics include age, weight, height, BMI, gender, race, and ethnicity.  Baseline characteristics include HCV genotype subtype, IL28B genotype, prior HCV treatment history, baseline HCV RNA level, fibrosis stage (F0 – F1, F2, F3, F4 [if applicable]), tobacco (user, ex-user, or non-user) and alcohol use (drinker, ex-drinker, or non-drinker) status, former injection drug user, (yes, within  last 12 months; yes, more than 12 months 
ago; or no) use of stable opiate substitution, history of diabetes, baseline metabo lic 
syndrome, history of bleeding disorders, history of depression or bipolar disorder, history of cardiovascular disease, geographic region, and all other subgroup variables defined in 
Section 8.1.2.4 .
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
76
All the demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized as continuous or 
categorical variables where appropriate.  Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, and range) will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., age and BMI), and the number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., sex and race).
Treatment compliance to study drug will be calculated based on the percentage of tablets 
taken relative to the total tablets expected to be taken.  A subject is considered to be compliant if the percentage is between 80% and 120%.  Compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarized with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The percentage of compliant subjects will be summarized.
8.1.2 Efficacy
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.
Efficacy analyses will be performed within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) across 
treatment arms (representing the recommended per cirrhosis status) and in the combined treatment arms.
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by the central 
laboratory using the Roche COBAS
®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan®HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The notation "HCV RNA < LLOQ" is used to represent all HCV RNA values 
< 15 IU/mL, regardless of whether the HCV RNA is detectable or not.  HCV RNA ≥LLOQ are all quantifiable values.
IL28B will be reported as C/C, C/T, or T/T by the central laboratory.
8.1.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint is the pe rcentage of subjects in who achieve SVR
12(HCV 
RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) within each genotype 
(GT5 and GT6 subjects) across the treatment arms.  The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on ITT population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be su mmarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
77
normal approx imation to the bino mial distribution, unless the number of SVR 12non-
responders is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence 
interval instead.
A summary of reason for SVR 12non-response (e.g., on-treatment virologic failure, 
relapse, other) will be provided.
8.1.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) 
separately, across treatment arms are:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure;
●The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse.  
Subjects with reinfection based on HCV NGS will be summarized separately from relapse.
The secondary endpoints of HCV on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment HCV 
virologic relapse will be analyzed within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) separately, across the treatment arms.
For the analysis of post-treatment HCV virol ogic relapse, completion of treatment is 
defined as any subject with study drug duration of 52 days and 77 days or greater for 
subjects allocated to treatment durations of 8 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively.
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-tr eatment relapse, the number and percentage 
of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using 
Wilson's score method.
8.1.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis
As sensitivity analyses, the number and percentage of subjects in the mITT-GT and 
mITT-GT-VF populations achieving SVR
12, as applicable, will be summarized along with 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
78
a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the normal approximation and a two-sided 
95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score method.
The two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method will also be 
calculated as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint of SVR 12based on ITT 
population.
8.1.2.4 Subgroup Analysis
The subgroup analyses will be performed within each genotype separately.  The summary 
statistics of subjects with SVR 12will be provided for the following subgroups:
●Prior HCV treatment history (naïve or experienced);
●For treatment-experienced subjects, type of previous treatment (IFN- or SOF-
based);
●IL28B genotype (CC or non-CC);
●Sex (male or female);
●Age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years) and (< 75 or ≥ 75 years);
●Race (White, Black/African-American, Asian, or other) and (black or non-
black);
●BMI (< 30 or ≥ 30 kg/m2);
●Baseline HCV RNA level (< 6,000,000 or ≥ 6,000,000 IU/mL);
●Baseline fibrosis stage (F0-F1, F2, F3, or F4);
●Baseline cirrhosis Status (Yes/No)
●Baseline platelet count (< 90 or ≥ 90 × 109/L);
●Baseline albumin (< 35 or ≥ 35 g/L);
●Baseline creatinine clearance (< 60, ≥ 60 to < 90, ≥  90 mL/min)
●Baseline eGFR (< 90 or  ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2)
●History of diabetes (yes/no);
●Baseline metabolic syndrome;
●Subject on stable opiate substitution (yes/no);
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
79
Further details about subgroup analysis will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
8.1.2.5 Additional Efficacy Endpoints
The following additional efficacy endpoints will be summarized by genotype:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ at each post-baseline visit 
in the Treatment Period (using data as observed);
●The percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 4four weeks after the last actual 
dose of study drug (SVR 4);
●The percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 24twenty-four weeks after the last 
actual dose of study drug (SVR 24);
●The percentage of subjects who relapse after achieving SVR 12.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each additional efficacy endpoint will be 
summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score interval.
A descriptive summary of SVR
12endpoints will be provided for GT5 and GT6 subjects 
separately and combined for all non-ci rrhotic sub jects who received 8 weeks of treatment 
and cirrhotic subjects who received 12 weeks of treatment in any of the following studies:  
Studies M14-868 Part 4, M14-172, or M16-126, using meta analytic methods.
8.1.3 Patient Reported Outcomes
The handling of missing data for patient reported outcomes (PROs) will be as follows.  If 
a respondent answers at least 50% of the items in a multi-item scale of the SF-36v2, the missing items will be imputed with the aver age score of the answered items in the same 
scale.  In cases where the respondent did not answer at least 50% of the items, the score for that domain will be considered missing.  The Mental and Physical Component Summary measures will not be computed if any domain is missing.  For WPAI Hepatitis C scores, no imputation will be performed for missing items.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
80
The mean change from baseline to each applicable post-baseline timepoint in the SF-36v2 
Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores; WPAI activity impairment due to hepatitis C, overall work impairment, absenteeism, and presenteeism scores will be summarized descriptively at each visit and for change from baseline to each visit.  For each of these scores, mean change from Baseline to Final Treatment Visit and from Baseline to Post-Treatment Week 12 will be summarized using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) mode l with baseline score as a covariate.
The following analyses of patient reported outcomes (PROs) also will be performed:
●Cumulative number and percentage of subjects who have ever experienced an 
increase from baseline up through each applicable timepoint of greater than or 
equal to 3 points in the SF-36 MCS and PCS;
●Cumulative number and percentage of subjects who have ever experienced an increase from bas eline up through each applicable timepoint of greater than or 
equal to 5 points in the SF-36 MCS and PCS;
●Cumulative number and percentage of subjects who have ever experienced an 
increase from baseline up through each applicable timepoint of greater than or 
equal to 5 points in the SF-36 domain scores;
Additional analyses of PROs will be performed as useful and appropriate.
8.1.4 Resistance Analyses
For all subjects, full length NS3/4A or NS5A from baseline samples will be sequenced by 
NGS.  For subjects who experience virologi c failure (on-treatment virologic failure or 
post-treatment relapse), full length NS3/4A and NS5A genes from the first sample after 
virologic failure with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be sequenced by NGS.  An 
appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.  Subjects treated with study drug who do not achieve SVR
12due to reasons other than virologic failure but have a time point with HCV RNA 
≥1000 IU/mL after treatment discontinuation, will have the sample at that time point 
sequenced.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
81
Signature resistance-associated amino acid positions are 36, 43, 54, 55, 56, 80, 155, 156, 
and 168 in NS3; and 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A.
The following definitions will be used in the resistance analyses:
●Baseline variant:  a variant by NGS in a baseline sample ( ≥ 2% or ≥  15% 
prevalence within a subject's viral population depending on variant frequency 
threshold utilized) that was not present in the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
●Variant at signature amino acid position:  va riant (relative to reference) present 
in a baseline or a post-baseline sample at a signature amino acid position.
●Post-baseline variant:  an amino acid variant in a post-baseline time point 
sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is detectable in ≥ 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample.
●Enriched variant:  variant present in both the baseline and a post-baseline sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample [(post-baseline % –
baseline %) ≥ 20].
●Treatment-emergent variant by NGS:  A post-baseline variant or an enriched 
variant.
Analysis 1:   The following analyses will be provided for all subjects, separated by HCV 
subtype:
●A listing of all baseline variants (2% detection threshold) at signature 
resistance-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and 
NS5A).
●A listing of all baseline variants (15% detection threshold) at non-signature resistance-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A) for subjects who experience virologic failure.
●The number and percentage of subjects with baseline variants at signature 
amino acid positions at detection thresholds of 2% and 15%.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
82
Analysis 2:   The impact of baseline variants on treatment outcome will be assessed as 
follows:  for each variant, the SVR 12rate will be calculated for subjects with and without 
the variant and the 2 rates will be compared.  Analysis will be grouped by HCV subtype 
and DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
The following will be included in the analyses of impact of baseline variants on treatment 
outcome:
●For each signature amino acid position, presence of any variant at that position 
(vs no variant at that position), usi ng detection thresholds of both 2% and 15%.
●Each individual variant at each signature amino acid position (vs not that variant) using detection thresholds of 2% and 15%.
●Variants at each non-signature amino acid position at a detection threshold of 
15%.
Analysis 3:   The following analyses will be performed for subjects who do not achieve 
SVR
12and who have post-baseline resistance data available:
●Listings by subject of all treatment-emergent variants relative to the baseline 
amino acid sequences will be provided for each DAA target (NS3/4A and 
NS5A). 
●Listings by subject and time point of all post-baseline variant at signature amino acid position relative to the baseline amino acid sequence will be provided fo r each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A).
HCV Genotype/Subtype
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequence from 
baseline samples from all subjects in order to accurately determine genotype/subtype.  If the phylogenetic analysis is not available, then the result from Sanger sequencing of a region of NS5B by AbbVie or by the Central la boratory will be used to determine the 
subject's HCV genotype/subtype, if available.  Finally, if neither the phylogenetic analysis result nor the Sanger sequencing assay results is available, then the Inno-LIPA assay

M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
83
results from the Central laboratory will be used to categorize the subject.  This 
information will be presented in summaries of efficacy subgroup analyses.
8.1.5 Safety
Safety summaries will be provided by the treatment arm (i.e., cirrhosis status/study drug 
duration) and overall.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.
8.1.5.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through 30 days post-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by primary MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by severity grade (Grades 1 – 5) and relationship to 
each study drug will also be provided.  Subjects  reporting more than one adverse event for 
a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted only once for that term using the most severe grade for the severity grade table and the most related for the relationship to study 
drug tables.  Subjects reporting more than one type of event within a SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.
Additional analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
8.1.5.2 Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last non-missing measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be summarized descriptively.  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading of laboratory values will also be summarized.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
84
Laboratory data values will be categorized as low, normal, or high based on reference 
ranges of the laboratory used in this study.  The number and percentage of subjects who 
experience post-baseline shifts during treatment in clinical laboratory values from 
low/normal to high and high/normal to low based on the normal range will be summarized.
In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-
specified criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant laboratory values or toxicity grades during treatment will be summarized.
8.1.5.3 Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including final treatment visit, will be summarized.  The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-defined criteria for PCS (Potentially Clinically Significant) vital signs values during treatment will be summarized.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses
Plasma concentrations of GLE and PIB and possible metabolites and pharmacokinetic 
parameter values for GLE and PIB will be tabulated for each subject and group.  Summary statistics will be computed for each time and visit.
Plasma concentration data from this study may be combined with data from other studies 
and analyzed using the following general methodology:
Population phar macokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect 
modeling approach with the NONMEM software (version VII, or higher version).  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
85
major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the 
parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models.
●The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the 
alternative model(s).
●The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept 
and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
●Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error.
Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error 
structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional est imation technique using NONMEM.  The 
relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject 
age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic or renal function, etc.) will be explored using either stepwise forward selection method, or generalized additive method (GAM) or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, corresponding to an increase in objective function > 7.88 for 
one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model.
In general, all continuous covariates will be entered in the model, initially in a linear 
fashion, with continuous covariates centered around the median value.  Linear or non-linear relationships of primary pharmacokinetic parameters with various covariates may also be explored.  For example:
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
86
TVCLi = Theta(1) + Theta(2) (Comedication [1,2,…]) + Theta(3) (WTi-median value) + 
Theta(4) (AGEi – median value).
Where TVCLi = Typical value of clearance for an individual1, Theta(1) is the intercept 
and Theta(2) – (4) are regression parameters relating the fixed effects (weight and age centered on the median value) to clearance.
Relationship between exposure and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be 
explored.  Exposure-response relationships for primary and secondary efficacy variables 
and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.
The relationship between exposure (e. g., population pharmacokinetic model predicted 
concentrations over time or average concentrations or AUC or trough concentrations of 
the individual model-predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and antiviral activity will be explored.
Additionally, relationship between exposure and safety endpoints of interest may also be 
explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is anticipated that approximately a total of  80 HCV infected patients, (~30 GT5-infected 
subjects and ~50 GT6-infected subjects) will be enrolled in the study.  A minimum of 
15 GT5 and 30 GT6 subjects will be enrolled and up to approximately 16 subjects with compensated cirrhosis (regardless of GT) will be enrolled.  No formal hypothesis is being tested.  If the observed SVR
12rate in this study is 97% among 30 GT5 subjects and 
50 GT6 subjects, then the half-width of 2-sided 95% normal approximation intervals are 0.061 and 0.047 for the GT5 and GT6 subjects, respectively.  
8.3 Randomization Methods
This study is not randomized.  Eligible subjects will be allocated to a treatment arm 
according to their cirrhosis status (presence/absence).

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., a dvertisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific, and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information, and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain, and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both re sponsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory 
Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulati ons) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that 
affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles th at have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .

M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22
88
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
An informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, must be voluntarily signed and dated 
before samples are collected for optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research.  The nature of the testing should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask questions.  The informed consent must be signed before the samples are collected and any testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to provide samples for the optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research, it will not impact their participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional pharmacogenetic 
exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject 
specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional samples will be destroyed.  However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.

10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded on the appropriate source documents.
The investigator(s)/institut ion(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to AbbVie and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave
®provided by the 
technology vendor Medidata Solutions Incorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC system and the study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study-specific eCRFs will be conducted by AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will 
be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.
The investigator or an authorized member of  the investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-126 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2016-003192-22

system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the st udy in order to verify eCRF entries.  The 
principal investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
Computer logic and manual checks will be created  to identify items such as inconsistent 
study dates.  Any necessary correcti ons will be made to the eCRF.
12.0 Use of Information
Any research that may be done using optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research samples from this study will be experimental in nature and the results will not be suitable for clinical decision making or patient management.  Hence, the subject will not be informed of individual results, should analyse s be performed, nor will anyone not directly 
involved in this research.  Correspondingly, researchers will have no access to subject identifiers.  Individual results will not be repor ted to anyone not directly involved in this 
research other than for regulatory purposes.  Aggregate data from optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research may be used in scientific publications or presented at medical conventions.  Optional explorat ory research information will be published or

Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening:  Liver Ultrasound and Alpha Fetoprotein
Subjects with compensated cirrhosis who do not have a historical qualifying liver 
ultrasound, CT, or MRI will have an ultrasound performed during Screening.  A positive ultrasound result suspicious for HCC will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI during 
Screening.  Suspicious ultrasound lesions confirmed by CT or MRI are exclusionary.  Subjects with compensated cirrhosis will have alpha fetoprotein assayed at the visits indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D.

HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the 
Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D , for subjects with compensated cirrhos is only.  In-between those visits, HCC 
screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis will be required to undergo a liver ultrasound to screen for HCC, unless the subject has a historical liver ultrasound, CT scan or MRI performed for HCC screening within 3 months prior to those visits, in which case the result of the historical ultrasound, CT scan or MRI will be used as the result for the Study Visit assessment.  A positive ultrasound result suspicious of HCC will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., CT scan or MRI) at a study visit should be discussed with the study designated physician.

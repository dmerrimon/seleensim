SCGAM -03 
Name of Active Ingredient:  
Human Normal Immunoglobulin  Edition / Date of Protocol:  
05 - Canada  
Test Product, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
Octan orm, human normal immunoglobulin for subcutaneous (SC) administration. 
Octanorm is to be administered subcutaneously every week (±2 days).  
If, during the study, the patient's body weight changes by > 5%, the dose is to be adjusted to keep 
the dose constant on a ‘milligram per kilogram body weight’ basis. 
 
SCGAM -01 patients : The patients will continue receiving the same octanorm dose in milligram per 
kilogram body weight as was administered at the Week 64 infusion of the SCGAM-01-study. 
De novo patients : The same dose as with the previous SCIG product before study entry will be used.  
 
The patients' octanorm dose can be individualised, if considered necessary by the investigator, by 
titrating upward or downward. 
Batch (lot) numbers will be reported in the fina l report of the study.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Patients may remain in the trial until octanorm becomes commercially available in the USA  or 
Canada, respectively , or until the Sponsor terminates the trial.  
USA: A patient will remain in the trial for up to 2.5 years.  
Canada:  The individual treatment duration in Canada will be approximately 1 2 months . 
Reference Therapy, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
Not applicable.  
Study Outcome Parameters:  
Safety (primary assessment):  
•  Occurrence of all treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
•  Occurrence of temporally associated TEAEs  
•  TEAEs by speed of infusion 
•  Local injection -site reactions  
•  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, respiratory rate)  
•  Laboratory parameters ( haematology, clinical chemistry, basic urinalysis ) 
Efficacy:  
Measurement of trough total IgG levels; monitoring for infectious diseases.  
 Occurrence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) . 
 
Quality of life:  
USA: For QoL assessments, each patient will conti nue using the same questionnaire as before. That 
is, the parent or guardian of patients who were below  14 years of age when they entered the main 
study SCAM -01 will continue using the Child Health Questionnaire -Parent Form (CHQ -PF50), and 
patients who were ≥ 14 years of age when they entered the main study will continue using the SF -
36 Health Survey.  
Canada: T he patients will us e the SF -36 Health Survey.  
Summary of Study Procedures and Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Study Procedures:  
Patients will be enrolled only after written informed consent has been obtained by the patient or 
their legal guardian. For patients under the legal age of majority, written consent must be obtained 
from the parents or legal guardians. In addition, when required by the local regulatory authorities or  
Institutional Review Board (IRB), written assent must be obtained from children and adolescents 
based upon local requirements.

Screening  assessments, to be performed before the first octanorm  infusion, will inc lude: physical 
examination (including weight); blood sampling for haematology, clinical chemistry, viral markers 
and trough total IgG; urine sample for urinalysis and urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing 
potential only); completion of the QoL Questionnaire. 
 
SCGAM -01 patients ( United States , Canada) : 
The first study (Screening)  visit of SCGAM -03 with the first octanorm infusion will be the same 
visit as the visit in Week 65  (End -of-Study Visit) of the study SCGAM -01. 
 
Eligible patients who have completed the SCGAM-01 study and were treated with any other 
commercially available SCIG  before the start of the SCGAM -03 study (e.g. owing to a delay in 
local IRB approval for SCGAM-03) are permitted  to enter the SCGAM-03 study. 
The maximum allowed intermission of IgG treatment after completion of the SCGAM-01 study 
and before the start of treatment in the SCGAM-03 study is 5 weeks.  
 
Patients for whom the Week  65 visit of the SCGAM -01 study is not identical to the f irst visit of  
the SCGAM -03 study will undergo a separate Screening Visit with relevant screening procedures.  
 
Note that screening  examinations will, for most patients, be performed within the framework of 
the main study SCGAM-01 (End-of- Study Visit, in Week  65), in which case they need not be 
repeated  at the same visit  for SCGAM -03).  
 
De novo patients (Canada only): 
Patients will undergo a full Screening Visit, including  recording of demographic data, medical 
history and previous/ongoing therapies.  
One week later, the patients  will attend the site for Visit N. This will be the first  Treatment Visit 
with octanorm (without urine pregnancy test). 
 
Only after the patient's successful Screening and Enrolment into SCGAM- 03 study will the first 
infusion of octanorm be permitted.  
 Patients will stay at the study site during the infusion , vital signs will be measured just before the 
start of each infusion given at the study site, then within 1 hour after the end of the infusion. The Patient's Diary for the coming period of the home treatment will be issued to the patients. 
Ongoing adverse events and any PID relevant concomitant medications will be recorded.  
 
At all subsequent study visits, the patients will undergo the following examinations at the site 
before the start of infusion: physical examination (including the body weight) , blood sampling for 
haematology and trough total IgG , clinical chemistry, urine sample for urinalysis with a urine 
pregnancy test if indicated . The Patient's Diary will be collected and reviewed .  
 
One week after the last infusion , for both regular or premature termination, a Termination V isit 
will be performed at the site with the following assessments: physical examination (including vital 
signs and weight), blood sample for haematology, clinical chemistry, viral markers and trough 
total IgG; urine sample for urinalysis and urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential 
only); completion of the QoL Que stionnaire; collection and review of the Patient's Diary. 
AEs and any changes in concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study period.

Up to 45 qualifying patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
SCGAM-03 study. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will periodically review relevant 
data with emphasis on thromboembolic events (TEEs). 
 
Statistical Analysis:  
The following populations will be considered for the statistical analysis: 
The safety analysis set consisting of all patients who received at least part of one infusion of 
octanorm. 
The full analysis set (FAS) is defined according to the intention -to-treat principle and consists of all 
patients of the safety analysis set who satisfy all major eligibility criteria and for whom any post -
baseline data is available; it is the set of eligible patients with treatment effects measured.  
The per-protocol  (PP) set consists of all patients of the FAS excluding those with major protocol 
deviations which may hav e an impact on the analysis of the primary endpoint. This is the set of 
patients who participated in the study as intended and for whom the primary endpoint can be 
evaluated as planned.  
 
Only major protocol deviations  with the potential to significantly af fect the study results or to 
invalidate the interpretation of the data obtained will lead to exclusion of patients from the PP set.  
The membership of each patient in the respective analysis populations will be determined before 
statistical analysis in a da ta review meeting by a panel consisting of a medical expert from the 
Sponsor, the clinical study manager, the data manager and the study statistician. 
 
Safety Analysis Plan: 
The safety analysis will comprise descriptive statistics, tabulations and listings of all TEAEs, safety 
laboratory results, vital signs and physical examination findings. All reported AEs will be coded 
according to MedDRA.  
For this extension study, any AE is regarded as treatment -emergent if the patient migrated from the 
main to the ext ension study without being treated with another IgG product. For de novo patients 
from Canada or if  another product was used between the two studies, an AE in the extension study 
is classified as treatment -emergent if onset or worsening is after start of t he infusion of octanorm. 
Only TEAEs are accounted for in the analysis.  
 
For each TEAE, the time relative to the start of the infusion will be calculated and the TEAE will 
be class ified as temporally associated if the onset is during the infusion or within 72 hours after the 
end of the infusion. 
All reported events will be listed and tabulated in full detail, in particular the following key figures 
will be presented for each age group and for the study as a whole: 
•  Total number of TEAEs reported. 
•  Number of temporally associated TEAEs.  
• Infusion rate at the onset of temporally associated TEAEs (frequencies and percentages).  
Narratives wi ll be prepared describing each death, other SAEs, and other significant AEs that are 
judged to be of special interest because of clinical importance.  
The QoL data will be presented descriptively by visit, along with the change from screening  (defined 
as the first infusion).

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The primary therapeutic use of γ- immunoglobulins (IgG) is to provide antibodies to prevent 
viral and bacterial diseases (replacement therapy) in patients with primary immunodeficiency 
(PI) syndromes who have significant defects of antibody formation (humoral immunity). 
The PI syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders with an intrinsic defect of the tissues, 
cells, or proteins of the immune system resulting in immune deficiency. Many of these disorders are characterised by hypogammaglobulinaemia with or without defective antibody production. Children and adults with PI have an increased risk of recurrent bacterial and viral infections 
that typically attack the respiratory tract (sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) but can also affect the gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis). They can be severe and can lead to substantial morbidity. Responses to antibacterial therapy are often poor. At present, most PIs are not curable, but immunoglobulins have shown to decrease the total number of severe infections and the duration of hospitalisation. 
In the earlier years (around 1950), the IgG preparations were administered intramuscularly.  
This route of administration causes substantial discomfort, and restricts the amount of IgG that 
can be given to the patients. During the last 20 years, several IgG preparations have been developed for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration, and their use has further contributed to the successful treatment of patients with PI disorders. 
The administration via the SC route offers some advantages over IV infusion from a patient’s 
and a physician’s perspective and therefore become an alternativ e treatment option to the 
IV treatment. After the introduction of small, portable syringe drivers, this route of 
administration has gained even more popularity in Europe and the US as a practical, effective and safe treatment, because home therapy can also  be recommended with this kind of 
administration.  
There are two major differences in the pharmacokinetic ( PK) characteristics of intravenously 
administered immunoglobulins (IVIG) and subcutaneously administered immunoglobulins (SCIG): delayed absorption and reduced bioavailability. 
Following IV administration, the plasma concentration peaks immediately upon termination of the infusion, frequently reaching concentrations more than twice as high as the trough level. After SC administration, the absorption of IgG into the subcutaneous tissue is slower; the IgG must be delivered into the blood stream by the lymphatic system. Thus, with SCIG, the intravascular IgG concentration increases gradually, peaking at 48 –72 hours. Most other 
features of SCIG treatment are consequences of these fundamental differences. [1] 
Studies of the PK of SCIG have shown a lower bioavailability than IVIG. This decreased bioavailability may involve degradation in the tissues and/or local bindin g in the intercellular 
matrix. Because of this expectation, several studies were designed to directly determine the 
bioavailability of SCIG as compared to IVIG. [2] 
On converting from IVIG to SCIG replacement  therapy for PI, the equivalent monthly dose of 
IgG is usually determined in one of two ways: 
• 1:1 dosing: The single IVIG dose administered every 3 [or 4] weeks is split into 3 [or  4] 
equal weekly SCIG infusions. 
• Dosing based on the area under the curve (AUC). The SCIG dose is calculated from PK 
data to provide a monthly exposure to IgG equivalent to that with IVIG. 
 Page 14/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
The former is common in Europe, while the latter is a requirement of the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for SCIG labelling studies. [3] 
No differences have been reported in the half -life of SCIG and IVIG. With modern IgG 
preparations, half-lives have generally been reported to be about 30–35 days. Thus, there is no 
clinically significant difference in the half -life of IgG between the two administration routes. [1] 
However, SCIGs are usually given weekly, compared with IVIG regimens in which a large 
dose is given every 3rd or 4th week. The use of smaller doses at more frequent intervals results 
in stable, higher trough IgG serum concentrations which remain constant between consecutive 
SCIG infusions. [4] 
In 3 recent studies comparing IVIG and SCIG in PI patients, the mean peak serum IgG level 
immediately after IV infusions was 2303 mg/dL. [5-7] In contrast, the mean peak with SCIG 
was 1410 mg/dL and the time for the peak IgG concentration (T max) was 62.6 h (2.6 days). [8] 
With weekly SCIG administrations, only about 4.5 days elapse between the Tmax of one dose 
and the administration of the next dose. Given the half -life of 30 days this means that the IgG 
plasma concentrati on has dropped by only about 10 to 20% before the serum level starts to rise 
again. In contrast, with IVIG dosing intervals of 3–4 weeks (about one half -life), the drop in 
plasma concentration will be about 40–50% by the time the next dose is due. These di fferences 
in the dosing intervals used in most SCIG vs. IVIG regimens result in more stable serum IgG 
levels with SCIG. [1,8]  
Pooled data from 7 studies in which equivalent monthly SC IgG doses were given weekly vs. 
IVIG every 21 –28 days showed that trough serum IgG levels were 10 to 20% higher with 
weekly SC doses than with the same total monthly IVIG dose. After 6 to 12 weekly infusions, near-steady-state IgG levels were achieved with differences between minimum and peak 
concentrations of only 5 to 10% of the overall mean. [1,8]  
No clinic al data are available that would allow comparison of the long- term efficacy of SCIG 
versus IVIG administration on the development of bronchiectasis or other changes on lung 
scans, nor on deterioration of pulmonary function in patients who have PI. Similarly, no data 
are available comparing the efficacy of SCIG versus IVIG on the persistence or progression of 
chronic sinus disease in PI patients with that problem, or on other complications of PI. [9] 
Orange et al. (2012) reviewed the clinical  efficacy of SCIG and identified 13 clinical studies in 
a total of 482 patients representing more than 27,500 infusions. The rate of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) was the most common primary efficacy endpoint in these studies. Secondary endpoints included overall infections (i.e. infections not meeting SBI criteria), missed days at work or school, days in hospital and days on antibiotics. Definitions of overall infections and SBI were not standardised across studies. In 6 studies, SBIs were defined by  FDA criteria and 
included bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis or visceral abscess. In 2 studies, 
a SBI was defined as an infection requiring hospitalisation. [3] 
The rate of SBI was reported in 11 studies and varied from 0 to 0.09 events per patient and year. Infectio ns were reported in 11 studies and varied from 2 to 5.18 patient and year. These figures 
are overall at least as good as those reported for IVIG studies. 
To provide adequate protection from infection , a serum IgG concentration of >5  g/L following 
IgG therapy has been recommended. Several retrospective studies and one prospective study, 
however, have shown that higher serum IgG concentrations, resulting from higher doses of 
IVIG, are associated with a decreased incidence of infections. [3] 
 Page 15/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
A recent meta- analysis in 16 individual studies of IVIG focused on the diagnosis of pneumonia, 
the most comparable endpoint, and demonstrated a statistically significant inverse correlation 
between higher IgG dose and a lower incidence of pneumonia, with a 27% decrease in incidence 
of pneumonia for every 100 mg/kg increase in dose. [10] 
Despite its well- established safety profile, IVIG often leads to undesired symptoms, ranging 
from mild systemic adverse reactions, such as flushing, fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache 
and dizziness, to severe reactions, manifesting as chest pain, tachycardia, and changes in blood 
pressure, aseptic meningitis, thrombosis or renal failure. [4] 
The slower rate of rise towards the peak and the truncation of its height are believed to be responsible for the much lower incidence of systemic adverse events (AEs) with SCIG. This is consistent with observations that many AEs of IVIG infusions are rat e-related, and has been 
repeatedly confirmed. [9] 
On the other hand local reactions at SC injection sites are common. These reactions are rarely 
severe, and are accepted by most patients. In the meta- analysis by Orange et al. the reporting 
rate varied from 0.028 to 0.697 per infusion demonstrating that the majority of patients tolerate 
SCIG well. [3] 
Octanorm, the investigational product (IMP) in this study, is an immunoglobulin preparation from human normal plasma and is manufactured by Octapharma. It contains 16.5% (165 mg/mL) protein. The product is aimed for SC infusion by pump or syringe. 
Further information on the IMP can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.2 Rationale for Conducting the Study  
The administration of immunoglobulins via the SC route offers several advantages over IV 
infusion from a patient’s and a physician’s perspective. Replacement therapy by rapid SC infusion with a pump was introduced during the late 1980s. Several reports have shown that the 
SC method is feasible, safe, efficient, cost -effective and highly appreciated by the patients. [11-
19] 
Self-administration at home with small portable pumps or syringes can easily be learned by the 
patients, which is another advantage of SC administered immunoglobulins (S CIG). It may 
remarkably improve the patient’s quality of life and compliance as it reduces the frequency of hospitalisations and the need for home care. Administration of IgG via the SC route provides more stable and well -balanced IgG plasma levels until t he end of the treatment interval, in 
contrast with the peak IgG plasma concentrations attained with IVIG solutions which weaken at the end of dose. When effective IVIG therapy cannot be continued because of the lack of peripheral and central vein access, S CIG might also be an alternative treatment option.  
Experience has shown that replacement therapy with immunoglobulins is life saving. If replacement is started early, and if appropriate amounts are given with sufficient frequency, the cycle of recurrent infections and progressive lung damage can be arrested. Near to normal 
serum IgG levels can be easily maintained.  
Post- dose peak levels of SCIG are reached usually 3 –6 days after infusion. It has been shown 
that after infusion, exogenous IgG is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and 
extravascular fluid until approximately half is partitioned in the extravascular space. Therefore, a rapid initial drop in serum IgG is to be expected. Several factors such as the endogenous production, the actual catabolism rate, the underlying disease or inter -patient variability help to 
explain the wide range observed for terminal half -lives. PK data are required for each new 
 Page 16/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
product to ensure that it will not behave differently from existing preparations, in terms of 
appropriate dose and timing of the infusions. 
The rationale for conducting the main clinical study  (SCGAM -01) was to investigate the PK 
characteristics, efficacy, and safety of octanorm, and to provide guidance on the dosing when 
switching patients from IV to SC treatment in patients suffering from PI.  
The principal purpose of the present (extension) study is to acquire additional safety and tolerability data for patients treated in the medium- to-long term with octanorm. At the same 
time, efficacy and qu ality-of-life (QoL) data will also be acquired.  
The rationale for the new protocol version 03 - Canada is to include an estimated 10 adult 
patients  from Canada (both SCGAM -01 patients and de novo patients) , to collect further safety , 
quality-of- life and efficacy data.  
The individual treatment duration in Canada will be approximately 1 2 months.  
1.3 Benefit -Risk Statement  
Patients with PI need life -long treatment with immunoglobulins. Replacement therapy is 
expected to achieve protective trough levels of  5–6 g/L.  
Standard measures are taken to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot totally be excluded. The virus inactivation methods for octanorm are described in the Investigator's Brochure. 
The safety profile of SCIG is well characterised. For octanorm, the same type of adverse 
reactions may be expected. No new or unknown safety problems are expected to emerge for octanorm, which are not already described in the Investigator's Brochure. 
In terms of efficacy, it can reasonably be assumed that octanorm exhibits the same effectiveness 
as other SCIG brands.  
Results from the main study (SCGAM -01) have been analysed  in an interim analysis and  none 
of the results or data acquired in that study affect the above benefit–risk assessment.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
There is no single primary endpoint in this present extension study. The primary objective is to 
assess safety and tolerability  in medium -to-long- term administration, and this will be assessed 
by means of the following variables: 
• Occurrence of all treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) throughout the entire treatment 
period starting with the first infusion of IMP. 
• Occurrence of temporally associated TEAEs.  
• TEAEs by speed of infusion. 
• Local injection -site reactions.  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, respiratory rate). 
• Laboratory parameters (haematology, clinical chemistry and tests for viral safety).  
 
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary assessment criteria will be for quality of  life and  efficacy:  
• QoL assessments using the CHQ -PF50 from parent or guardian of patients <14 years of 
age and the SF -36 Health Survey in patients ≥14 years of age. 
• Occurrence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) as defined in Section 7.2. 
• The annual rate of all infections of any kind or seriousness. 
• Time to resolution of infections. 
• Use of antibiotics (number of days and annual rate). 
3.2 Overall Study Design and Pl an 
The study is a prospective, open-label, non-controlled, single- arm, multicentre phase  III safety 
study with observation of patients receiving weekly doses of octanorm over a period of up to 
two and half years.  
The study will be conducted at study sites in the United States  and in Canada  that already 
participated in the SCGAM -01 trial.  
In the United States o nly patients who have completed the main study (SCGAM 01) may be 
enrolled . In Canada adult de novo patients may also be enrolled. 
 Page 18/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
SCGAM -01 patients only: 
Most patients will migrate directly from the main study to the present extension study. 
However, some patients are expected to complete the main study before the commencement  of 
the extension study.  
Eligible patients who have completed the SCGAM -01 study and were treated with any other 
commercially available SCIG  before the start of the SCGAM -03 study (e.g. owing to a delay 
in local IRB approval for SCGAM- 03) are permitted  to enter the SCGAM -03 study 
In the intervening interval they must have received the commercially available  SCIG  at the 
approximately same  dose w hich the patient had received in study SCGAM -01. For these 
patients, the screening visit will be regarded as a fresh start and all screening  procedures are to 
be conducted. 
The maximum allowed interval without any  IgG treatment  before the start of treatment in the 
SCGAM -03 study is approximately  5 weeks .  
Each patient will be treated weekly with octanorm, either at the investigation site (on study visit 
days) or else at home. A final examination will be performed 1  week after the last infusion, for 
both regular and premature termination of the patient's study participation.  
The study will be ended when octanorm becomes commercially available i n the respective 
country (i. e. USA or Canada) or the sponsor decides to terminate the trial at an earlier date. In 
the USA, t he maximum total duration of the study for an individual patient will be 
approximately 2 .5 years.  
Study- related procedures will begin only after written informed consent has been obtained from 
the patient. For patients who are minors  (USA only) , written consent must be obtained from the 
parents or legal guardians. In addition, when required by the local regulatory authorities or Institutional Review Board (IRB), written assent must be obtained from children and 
adolescents based upon the age requirements established by those institutions. 
The numbers of patients  from the United States  to be enrolled in each age group will follow the 
numbers emerging from the main study SCGAM -01 and willing and eligible to continue 
treatment. At the time of preparation of this protocol these numbers are at most:  
• ≥2 years and <5 years of age: up to 5 patients 
• ≥5 years and <12 years of age: up to 5 patients  
• ≥12 years and <16 years of age: up to 10 patients 
• ≥16 years and ≤75 years of age: up to 30 patients 
• Total: approximately 45 (maximum 50) patients.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will periodically review relevant data with 
emphasis on thromboembolic events (TEEs). The following interventions and procedures will be performed at predefined time points (see 
Section 6.1.2): Drawing of blood samples, determination of body weight, review of the Patient's 
Diary, physical examination including vital sign assessments, QoL assessments, assessments 
of local injection -site reactions, urine sampling, and urine pregnancy tests. 
AEs and any changes in con comitant medications will be recorded throughout the study period.

3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Group(s)  
3.3.1 Study Design  
The designs of the main study SCGAM -01 and of this extension study take into account the 
FDA’s comments and requests included in the clinical hold letter (dated April 27, 2012) for 
IND 15019 for another SCIG of Octapharma ( gammanorm 16.5% ). 
The study design is also in line with similar study protocols conducted with other SCIG 
brands. [18,20]  
3.3.2 Dosing  
SCGAM -01 patients (United Sta tes, Canada) : 
The patients will continue receiving the same octanorm dose (in mg per kg body weight) as was 
administered at the Week 64 infusion of the SCGAM-01- study.  
De novo patients (Canada only) : 
The patients will continue receiving the same octanorm d ose (in mg per kg body weight) as 
with their previous SCIG product before the study entry. 
Dosing will take place on site at study visits, and otherwise at the patient's home, by self -
administration or with assistance (relative, carer etc.).  
3.3.3 Control Group(s)  
Does not apply in this study: all patients will receive active treatment with octanorm.  
3.3.4 Target Parameters  
The outcome measures in this study are consistent with previous studies of other IVIG or SCIG 
products and are also in compliance with the FD A Guidance for Industry. [22] 
The QoL Questionnaires are standardised, validated instruments that have been widely used in 
clinical studies, including PI.  
3.3.5 Statistical Considerations 
The FDA Guidance for Industry suggests that, based on historical data, a statistical 
demonstration of a serious infection rate per person- year less than 1.0 is adequate to provide 
substantial evidence of efficacy. [22] Therefore, the 99% CI for this rate will be calculated at a 
descriptive level, without formal statistical testing (statistical tests may be performed on an ad 
hoc basis if this is considered appropriate). 
Because a single patient may experience more than one SBI, the calculation of this confidence interval w ill take into account such intra -patient correlation, following a compound Poisson 
process model.

Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without the need 
to justify. The responsible Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study in case of AEs, poor compliance, or administrative reasons. 
Reas ons for premature patient withdrawal can be the following: 
• Patient’s decision: Should a patient decide to withdraw, the Investigator will make the 
best efforts to complete and report all information available at time of withdrawal. The Investigator will do cument the reason(s) for the patient's discontinuation . 
• Withdrawal for safety reason:  If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an 
AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, this specific event or test will also be recorded. If a patient is w ithdrawn from the study because of an AE, the Investigator will make 
thorough efforts to clearly document the outcome. 
 Page 23/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• Administration of other immunoglobulin preparation:  If for any reason a patient's 
therapy is changed to another IVIG or SCIG preparation within this study, the patient 
will be withdrawn from the study. 
• Pregnancy:  Pregnant patients may not be included in this extension study. A pregnancy 
test is mandatory at the Screening Visit, at the visits in Weeks 12, 36, 60, 8 4 and 108, 
and at the Termi nation Visit. All female patients of childbearing potential are 
responsible for using effective contraception during their study participation. If a 
pregnancy occurs, treatment with the IMP must be stopped immediately and Octapharma’s Central Drug Safety U nit must be informed.  
If a patient is withdrawn, the Investigator will organise a Termination Visit. At this visit, all investigations including laboratory tests should be performed to allow the patient to be included in both safety and efficacy evaluations. This Termination Visit is identical to the follow -up visit 
of the last IgG administration.  
4.3.2 Patient Replacement Policy  
Patients withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced. 
4.4 Assignment of Patients to Treatment Groups  
SCGAM -01 patients onl y: 
In the main study SCGAM -01, patients were recruited into four age strata: ≥2 years and <5 
years, ≥5 years and <12 years, ≥12 years and <16 years, and ≥16 and ≤75 years. In the present 
extension study, they will remain in the strata that they were in for  analysis in the main study 
(irrespective of whether their age changed such as to imply a change of age stratum). Each 
patient will be identified by this previously allocated number throughout the trial; no additional 
patient or randomisation number will be used for this extension study. 
 
De novo patients only: 
The patients will not be recruited in age strata. The new patient numbers will be allocated 
sequentially in the order in which the patients are enrolled. The fact that a patient has been 
enrolled will be reported immediately and automatically by the electronic data capture system 
to the Investigator, the contract research organization (CRO) and the Sponsor. 
All patients enrolled in this study will be treated with octanorm.  
Patients who participate d in this study and discontinued are not permitted to re -enrol.  
4.5 Relevant Protocol Deviations 
In the case of any major deviation from this study protocol, the Investigator and Octapharma 
will decide on the further participation of the patient in this study, after having discussed all 
relevant aspects.  
A list of all included patients with all deviations from the intended study procedures and other criteria that may affect the validity of patient data for statistical analysis will be prepared after the clinical  phase of the study is completed. The list will be discussed by a panel consisting of 
the clinical study manager, a medical expert of the Sponsor, the data manager and the study statistician. This panel will decide upon the inclusion of each patient in the  analysis populations.

Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
4.6 Subsequent Therapy  
If a patient decides to withdraw from the study or is withdrawn by the Investigator, he/she may 
be switched back to the treatment that he/she received before participation in the study or to another commercially av ailable IVIG or SCIG.  
 
5 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
5.1 Characterisation of Investigational Product(s) 
Name of Medicinal Product:  Octanorm  
Active ingredient of octanorm: Human normal immunoglobulin 
Table 1 Biochemical Characteristics of octanorm 
Parameter  
Total protein (of which  ≥96% is human IgG)  150 – 180 mg per mL  
Maltose  70 – 90 mg per mL  
Octoxynol  ≤5 µg per mL  
TNBP  ≤1 µg per mL  
IgA ≤0.6 mg per mL  
Polysorbate  80 10 – 60 µg per mL  
pH 5.0 – 5.8 
Osmolality  310 – 380 mosmol/kg  
Polymers + Aggregates  ≤5% of the total chromatogram area  
Monomers + Dimers  ≥90% of the total chromatogram area  
Fragments  ≤5% of the total chromatogram area  
Sodium  ≤30 mmol/L  
Each batch (lot) of octanorm is prepared from at least 3,500 donations of human fresh frozen plasma. Effective viral reduction is obtained via a combination of 3 validated manufacturing steps: cold -ethanol fractionation, solvent/detergent treatment with TN BP and Octoxynol, and 
pH 4 treatment. The manufacture of octanorm is based on the Octagam manufacturing  process 
including an additional adsorption step onto commercially available and widely used chromatography column for the removal of coagulation factor  XI. The process is identical up 
to the step of diafiltration. After this step the product solution is concentrated to a target concentration of 200 g/L. Polysorbate 80 and maltose are added during final formulation to final concentrations of 10-60 µg/mL and 70- 90 mg/mL, respectively.  
5.2 Packaging and Labelling 
Octanorm is delivered in glass vials.  The label on the octanorm vial will be in the respective 
language(s) of the country and will be in accordance with local regulations. Label terminology may vary acco rding to local regulations, and country -specific remarks will be added as needed. 
Sample labels will be filed in the TMF . Each octanorm vial will be labelled approximately as 
follows:

5.3 Conditions for Storage and Use 
Octanorm must be stored and transported light -protected at 36 °F to 46 °F (2  °C to +8 °C) and 
must not be frozen. 
 Page 26/53 October 25, 2017  

Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Octanorm must not be used after its expiration date.  
Authorised personnel at the individual study centres will ensure that the investigational product 
is stored in appropriate conditions in a secure refrigerator with restricted access. 
5.4 Dose and Dosing Schedule  
Octanorm has to be ad ministered subcutaneously every week (±2 days). A minimum interval 
of 4 days must be observed between two single subcutaneous infusions. If, during the study, 
the body weight changes by >5%, the dose is to be adjusted to keep the dose constant on a ‘mg per kg body weight’ basis.  
SCIG infusions will be (self -)administered at home. The infusion is to be given at the study site  
at Week 1, (Week 2, de novo patients  only), Week 12, Week 2 4, Week 3 6, Week 4 8, Week  60, 
Week 72, Week 8 4, Week  96, and Week 108.  
Each of these study visit dates may deviate ± 2 weeks  from the planned date. (Visit N for de 
novo patients may deviate ± 2 days.) However, the deviations must not cumulate. 
SCGAM -01 patients only: 
The patients will continue receiving the same octanorm dose in milligram per kilogram body 
weight as was administered at the Week 64 infusion of the SCGAM-01- study. 
 
De novo patients only: 
The same dose as with the  previous SCIG product before study entry will be used. 
The patients' octanorm dose can be individualised, if considered necessary by the investigator, by titrating upward or downward and should be based on the difference between each patient's 
measured serum total IgG trough levels while on octanorm and each patient's  individual target  
serum total IgG trough level.  
5.5 Preparation and Method of Administration 
Vials of octanorm must be allowed to warm to room or body temperature before infusion. 
Thereafter, octanorm should be infused subcutaneously using a syringe driver for precise 
infusion rates and standard infusion materials provided to the patients by the site. The correct 
amount of IgG taken from 12 or 48 mL vials of octanorm will be infused with the aid of a syringe driver. The content of the vials will have to be transferred into the syringes suitable for 
the syringe driver selected. Remaining solution in a vial must be discharged. 
Octanorm must not be mixed with other medicinal products. An aseptic technique must be used 
throughout the procedure. 
Each vial m ust be examined visually for particulate matter and discoloration before 
administration. The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Solutions that are cloudy or 
have a deposit must not be used. 
The patient or his/her relative or caregiver will be  instructed at the clinic/doctor's office or at 
the infusion centre in the use of the following: 
• syringe driver,  
• infusion techniques, 
 Page 27/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• keeping of a Patient Diary and  
• measures to be taken in case of severe AEs.  
 
Infusion sites :  
The maximum number of infusion sites used simultaneously should not exceed 6. 
Infusion sites should be at least 2 inches (approx. 5 cm) apart. The actual sites of infusion should 
be changed with each weekly administration. 
Volume: 
o Adults : The infusion volume can be up to a maximum of 60 mL/ per one infusion site.  
o Children (≥5 years of age): The volume can be up to a maximum of 35  mL/site.  
o Small children (<5 years of age): The volume may be up to 20 mL/site.  
 
Infusion (flow) rate: The maximum recommended flow rate per 1  infusion site is 60 mL per 
hour. 
o For children for all infusion sites TOGETHER the maximum flow rate should not  
exceed a total of 80  mL per hour. 
o For adult patients only : The maximum flow rate  for all infusion sites together  can be 
(gradually) increased up to 150 mL per hou r if the previous rate is well tolerated.  
 
5.6 Blinding, Emergency Envelopes and Breaking the Study Blind  
Not applicable for this open- label study.  
5.7 Treatment Compliance  
5.7.1 Drug Dispensing and Accountability  
All IMP provided to the site will be accounted for. This  includes IMP received at the site, 
dispensed to patients, and IMP returned unused by the subject/patient. 
Sponsor or designee  will deliver octanorm to the participating investigators. Investigator will 
keep current drug inventory and dispensing log, detailing the dates, batch (lot) numbers, and 
quantities of IMP received and dispensed to each patient and the remaining quantity. 
The inventory and drug dispensing log will be available to the monitor to verify drug 
accountability during the study. The study monitor will review all empty and partially used 
vials of IMP and will cross -check versus the patient source documentation (records), eCRF, 
and drug dispensing log.  
After this check, and after the sponsor has granted written approval of destruction, empty or 
partially used vials should be destroyed at the study site following local policies. The 
destruction must be documented. For their home treatment, sufficient amount of octanorm will be handed out to the patients. The 
Investigator or his designee has to document the date, quantities and batch (lot) number(s) of IMP handed out including the corresponding patient number. The patients will be advised to 
 Page 28/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
return used or expired vials to the stud y site at their on -site visits and  the (early) Termination 
Visit.  
5.7.2 Assessment of Treatment Compliance  
Patients will receive infusions at the study site and at home ( administered at home by the patient 
or his/her relative or carer ). Infusion details will be documented together with the batch 
number(s) in the eCRF. 
Throughout the study, patients will be asked to document on a Diary the date, batch (lot) 
numbers, number of vials, speed of infusion, injection site(s), occurrence of infections, TEAEs 
and local tissue reactions at injection sites, missed days from work/sc hool/kindergarten/day 
care, inpatient hospital stays, and any changes in concomitant therapy between visits. The Diary 
will be reviewed during the patient’s infusion visit at the study site.  
5.8 Rescue Medication/ Risk Management  
In the event of a (serious ) AE, infection(s), treatment failure and or if the patient does not 
tolerate the treatment, the Investigator will direct the patient for an immediate unscheduled visit to ensure their safety and wellbeing.     If a patient decides to withdraw from the stud y or is terminated by the Investigator for treatment 
failure or any reason, the patient may switch back to their previous treatment prior to participating in the study or to any other commercially available IVIG or SCIG treatment as determined by their phy sician.   
 In the event of potential risk of allergic reaction, adequate rescue medication will be provided by Investigator to the patient; for example, Epipen (epinephrine injection), Antihistamines and or any other similar medication as determined by the Investigator.  In the case of an adverse 
reaction, patients will be trained by the Investigator on how and when to use the emergency medication and will be instructed to immediately seek emergency medical assistance.  
 
 
 
6 STUDY CONDUCT  
6.1 Observations by Visit 
6.1.1 Screening Visit  
SCGAM -01 patients only (United States, Canada) : 
The Screening (First)  Visit will in most cases be the same as the last study visit (Termination 
Visit scheduled in w eek 65, the End-of- study visit)  of the main study SCGAM -01 (since most 
patients will migrate directly from the main study SCGAM -01 to the present extension study; 
Section  3.2). Screening procedures are to be conducted before  the IMP a dministration for that 
visit.  
If the treatment with octanorm was interrupted between the SCGAM -01 and extension 
(SCGAM -03) studies (for details see Section  3.2), then all screening procedures (see study flow 
chart) are to be conducted at the new Screening  visit.  
 Page 29/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Study- related procedures will begin only after written informed consent has been obtained by 
the patient or their legal guardian. At the Screening Visit the  following activities will be 
performed:  
• Written informed consent. 
• Check of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
• Recording of demographic data ( de novo patients only). 
• Documentation of medical history (SCGAM -01 patients : including all adverse 
conditions that have occurred after the end of the SCGAM-01 study) . 
• Recording of all previous /ongoing drug and non- drug therapies  (SCGAM -01 patients : 
only those administered after the end of the SCGAM -01 study). 
• General physical examination, including body weight and vital signs. 
• Drawing of blood samples for total IgG trough level. 
• Drawing of blood samples for safety laboratory parameters including viral markers.

only new ones, not previously recorded in the SCGAM-01). 
6.1.2 Treatment and Assessment Visits ; Termination Visit 
De novo patients only (Canada) : 
One week after Screening Visit, all patients will attend the site for Visit N. This will be the first  
Treatmen t Visit with octanorm (without laboratory tests).  
 
On study visit days, administration will be performed on site; otherwise, at home 
(Section  3.3.2).  
At the study visits, the following activities will be performed before IMP administration:  
• General physical examination, including body weight and vital signs (every visit). 
• Drawing of blood samples for total IgG trough level (every visit, except Visit N for de 
novo patients ). 
• Drawing of blood samples for safety laboratory parameters (Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and the 
Termination Visit).  
• Drawing of blood samples for viral markers (Visit 6 and the Termination Visit).  
• Urine sampling including urine pregnancy test (in females of childbearing potential 
only; Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). 
 
During or after IMP administration  
• Completion of QoL Q uestionnaire (Visit 6 and the Termination Visit).  
 Page 30/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• Collection of the Patient Diary. The Investigator wi ll review the Diary entries and will 
ask the patient about any AEs that may have occurred and any changes in concomitant 
therapies (medication and non- drug therapy). Any concomitant medication and adverse 
events will be recorded. Relevant Diary data will b e transferred to the eCRF. 
Discrepancies between Patient Diary entries and eCRF entries must be explained by the 
Investigator (every visit).   
• Infusion of octanorm (every visit). 
• Check for injection- site reaction and assessment if any reaction is present (every visit).  
 
For laboratory testing please refer to Section  7.3.4. 
Termination Visit:  
One week after the last infusion (study visit 10 in Week 108, or sooner if a patient withdraws 
prematurely from the study or if the study is ended earlier by one of the events described in Section  3.2), a Termination Visit will be performed  including the following assessments: 
• General physical examination (including vital signs).  
• Drawing of blood samples for safety laboratory parameters including viral markers. 
• Drawing of blood samples for total IgG trough level. 
• Urine sampling including urine pregnancy test (in females of childbearing potential 
only). 
• Completion of QoL Questionnaire. 
• Collection and review of the Patient Diary as at the earlier visits (Section  6.1.2) with 
recording of any AEs and changes in concomitant medications.  
• Assessment of any local infusion- site reactions.  
After the final examination, the clinical study is considered completed for the patient. No further 
study- related assessments  may be performed, unless safety concerns (e.g. ongoing AEs) require 
follow-up. 
 
Unscheduled visits:  
Investigators will be encouraged to perform unscheduled visits, whenever necessary for a 
patient's safety and welfare. This shall be considered in particular for de novo patients from Canada.  
Unscheduled visits will be documented on the e CRF.

becomes commercially available in the respective country  (for details see Section  3.2).  
6.2.3 Premature Termination of the Study  
Both the responsible Investigators and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at 
any time. Should this be necessary, the procedures will be arranged on an individual study basis after review and consultation by both parties. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients' interests. Premature termination will be notified in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
Furthermore, the Investigator should promptly inform the IRB and provide a detailed written explanation. The pertinent regulatory authorities and IRBs are to  be informed according to 
national regulations. 
Early termination of the study as a whole or centre-wise may apply for the following reasons: Clinical Study  
• At any time the study as a whole will be terminated prematurely if e.g.: 
o New toxicological or pharmacological findings or safety reports  invalidate the 
earlier positive benefit -risk-assessment.  
o If more than 2 TEEs (i.e. ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebral 
infarction, cerebrovascular accident, cerebral thrombosis, embolic infarctions, 
 Page 32/53 October 25, 2017

[acute] myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
venous thrombosis excluding thrombophlebitis) are observed fulfilling the 
following criteria:  
 assessed as probably or possibly related to octanorm treatment by Investigator and/or Sponsor; 
 confirmed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). 
o Any other reason rendering the continuation of the study impossible for the Sponsor. 
Study Centre 
• At any time the study can be terminated at an individual centre if e.g.:  
o The centre cannot comply with the requirements of the protocol. 
o The centre cannot comply with applicable standards. 
o The required recruitment rate is  not met.  
Should the study be prematurely terminated, all study materials (completed, partially completed and blank forms, IMP, etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor. 
 
7 ASSESSMENTS AND METHODS 
7.1 Background / Baseline Information  
The following general or background assessments will be performed during the study at 
predefined time points: 
Demographic data: All demographic data (age, weight, height, calculated body mass index, 
ethnic origin, ABO Rhesus blood type) will be taken over from the main study SCGAM -01 
(SCGAM -01 patients ) or recorded  at Screening Visit  (de novo patients). 
Medical history: All medical history (conditions and surgical treatment) will likewise be taken 
over from the main study SCGAM -01 ( SCGAM -01 patients ) or recorded  at Screening Visit  (de 
novo patients). 
Previous and ongoing therapies: Similarly, previous drug and non- drug therapies (e.g. 
physiotherapy) will be taken over from the main study SCGAM -01 ( SCGAM -01 patients ) or 
recorded  at Screening Visit  (de novo patients). 
General physical examination, including vital signs. The physical examination will be 
performed according to study site’s routine procedures and will be as comprehensive as 
necessary to detect relevant somatic or neurological diseases.  
7.2 Efficacy Assessments  
To study the effectiveness of octanorm in the prevention of infections, the following measurements will be recorded throughout the study: 
• Number of episodes of SBI, per person- year on treatment, along with type and severity 
of infection, and time to resolution (primary endpoint). 
 Page 33/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• Number of episodes of any other infections (including acute sinusitis, exacerbation of 
chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, infectious diarrhoea etc), along 
with type and severity of infection, and time to resolution. 
• Number of days of use and annual rate of antibiotics (oral, parenteral, oral plus 
parenteral, prophylactic and therapeutic), along with type and dosage of antibiotic.  
• QoL assessments.  
For the collection of data for the above measurements, each patient will be provided with an individual D iary to be filled in by the patient during the  home therapy  time. The Patient's Diary 
will be checked for accuracy of the data by the Investigator and collected at each study visit. 
The data will be then transferred into the eCRF.  A new Diary will be handed out to the patient 
for the following period until the next infusion visit at the site.  
For the purpose of this study the following events will be considered as SBIs, to be included in the primary efficacy analysis:  
• Bacterial pneumonia. 
• Bacteraemia/sepsis.

• Imaging studies: typical findings on ultrasound, computed tomography scan, magnetic 
resonance imaging scan, or radionuclide scan  
Notes to Table 2: 
Items in bold are considered essential diagnostic features.  
a Two of the following should be present to make the diagnosis of sepsis in adults: temperature >38  °C oral/ 
>39 °C rectal or <36  °C oral or <37  °C rectal; heart rate >90 beats/min; respiratory rate >20 breaths/min, or 
PaCO 2 <32 mm Hg; WBC count >12,000/mm3, <4,000/mm3, or >10% immature (band) forms. For paediatric 
patients, the definition of sepsis using age -specific criteria as recommended by the International Consensus 
Conference on Paediatric Sepsis should be employed. [23] 
b Indwelling cathe ter- or vascular access device- related blood -borne infections are not included because evidence 
is lacking that these are preventable with IVIG replacement therapy. For patients without indwelling catheters 
or vascular access devices, a single blood cultur e positive for a pathogenic organism will meet the diagnostic 
criteria for bacteraemia. Patients meeting criteria for positive blood culture but without 2 or more of the sepsis criteria listed above will be classified as having bacteraemia.

c A blood culture positive for growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitides , or Haemophilus 
influenzae , in combination with CSF leukocytosis and/or decrease in CSF glucose, can serve to confirm the 
diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis.  
d For the diagnosi s of pneumonia in adults, commonly at least 2 of the listed symptoms and/or signs should be 
present in conjunction with at least one laboratory and one imaging studies diagnostic element. However, for 
the purposes of counting serious infection episodes in a clinical trial of IVIG, the finding of a new pulmonary 
infiltrate with consolidation on chest X -ray is considered sufficient. To establish the diagnosis of bacterial 
pneumonia for paediatric patients, most of the same diagnostic criteria listed may be us ed, with the following 
exceptions: Because paediatric patients may not produce a sputum specimen for culture, blood cultures or serology may be substituted to identify the etiologic bacterial pathogen. In infants age 3 to 24 months, who tend to have a higher baseline temperature, fever is defined as a rectal temperature >38.3  °C (101 °F). In children 
>2 years, fever is more commonly defined as a rectal temperature >38  °C (100.4 °F). In paediatric patients, 
elevations of WBC counts >15,000/mm
3 are frequent b ut could be variable in patients with bacterial pneumonia, 
or leukopenia with WBC count <5000/mm3 may be observed, usually associated with severe infection.  
e It is recommended to obtain a deep expectorated sputum gram stain to demonstrate the presence of 
microorganisms on examination of 10 -20 oil immersion microscopic fields and <10 squamous epithelial cells 
and >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 10X low power magnification to determine suitability of sputum 
culture.  
7.3 Safety Assessments 
Any of the following drug safety information shall be collected: Adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) temporally associated with administration of IMP. 
7.3.1 Adverse Events  
7.3.1.1 Definitions  
Adverse event (AE): An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a stud y patient receiving 
an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not 
related to the IMP . 
An AE is defined as treatment -emergent (TEAE) , if the event began or worsened after the start 
of first infusion of trial medication: 
• For patients who migrate into the extension study without interruption of octanorm 
treatment (see Section  3.2), all adverse events occurring in the extension study will be 
considered treatment -related. An adverse event recorded i n the main study will not be 
recorded again in the present one. 
• For patients who receive any other IgG brand  between  the main and the extension studies 
(Section  3.2), “treatment -emergent” will refer to events with onset after the start of the 
infusion with octanorm at the screening visit of the extension study. 
• For de novo patients in Canada who receive d another IgG brand  before this study, 
“treatment -emergent” w ill refer to events with onset after the start of the infusion with 
octanorm at Visit N of the study. 
Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an IMP 
related to any dose. The phrase “response to an IMP” means that a cau sal relationship between 
the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
Other Significant AEs : Any non-serious AE or marked laboratory abnormality that results in: 
 Page 36/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• withdrawal of IMP treatment,  
• and/or dose reduction, 
• and/or initiation of significant additional concomitant therapy (i.e. medications given 
intravenously). 
Withdrawal due to AE /ADR : AE/ADR leading to d iscontinuation of treatment with IMP . Any 
such events will be followed up by the Investigator until the event is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the patient is stable. All follow -up information collected will be made 
available to the Sponsor. 
7.3.1.2 Collection  
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, whether 
scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non- leading question such as  
“How have you been since the last visit  / during the previous study period?” For minor patients 
not understanding the question, the answer must  be obtained from parents or legal guardians. 
In addition, the Patient Diaries  (if applicable) will be checked by the Investigator for any 
documented event. 
Any AE which occurs during the study will be noted in detail on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. If the patient reports several signs or symptoms represent ing one syndrome or diagnosis, 
the diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF. The Investigator will grade the severity of all 
AEs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non- serious or serious) and causality, as 
defined  below (Sections 7.3.1.3, 7.3.1.4, and 7.3.2). The Sponsor is responsible to assess the 
expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected), as defined below (Sec tion 7.3.1.4). 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be confirmed  
and followed- up until they have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation is available . 
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at  a later stage unless they 
represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening). 
The Investigator should always provide detailed information concerning any abnormalities and 
the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action(s), as well as any other observations or 
comments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the patients’ AEs. 
7.3.1.3 Severity  
The intensity/severity of AEs will be graded as follows: 
• mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere  with the 
patient’s routine activities; 
• moderate: an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s 
routine activities; 
• severe: an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s routine 
activities.  
7.3.1.4 Causality 
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by the Investigator : 
 Page 37/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• Probable : reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily  
highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the medicine  and that could not reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the 
patient’s clinical state.  
• Possible : reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or insufficient evidence. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
• Unlikely : reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration. An event which may have been produced by the patient’s clinical state or by e nvironmental factors or other therapies administered. 
• Not related (unrelated) : events for which sufficient information exists to conclude that 
the aetiology is unrelated to the IMP.  
• Unclassified : reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g. because 
of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment). 
Classification of ADRs: 
ADRs will be classified by the Sponsor as either expected or unexpected : 
• Expected:  an ADR that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator's Brochure (or 
other reference for safety information) . 
• Unexpected:  an ADR that is not listed in the current edition of the Investigator's 
Brochure  or other reference safety information , or that differs because of greater 
severity or greater specificity.  
7.3.1.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE has to be classified as follows: 
• recovered, resolved 
• recovering, resolving 
• not recovered, not resolved 
• recovered, resolved with sequelae 
• fatal 
• unknown 
NOTE:  A patient’s death per se  is not an event, but an outcome. The event which resulted into 
a patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within 
4 weeks after IMP treatment end, and without respect of being considered treatment -related or 
not. 
 Page 38/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
7.3.1.6 Action(s) taken  
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recogn ised standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well -being of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment in  an emergency situation. 
The action t aken by the Investigator must be documented: 
a) in general  
• none 
• medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started 
• test performed  
• other (to be specified) 
b) on IMP 
• none 
• product withdrawn 
• treatment interrupted  
• dose reduced 
• dose increased  
The Investigator will follow up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical condition of the 
patient is stable, and all relevant follow -up information will be reported to the Sponsor. 
7.3.2 Local Reactions 
Local injection -site reactions are to be assessed by both patients and investigators. 
Patients have to grade the overall perception of local reactions in their Diaries after each 
infusion using a 4-point rating scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. 
Investigators have to evaluate local reactions wit hin approximately 1 hour after infusion at 
every study visit, using a 4-point rating scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. 
 
The following observations must not be reported as local infusion site reactions as all of them 
can be expected in all patien ts: 
• Local mass (usually reported as "swelling") caused by the injected octanorm volume; 
• Small blood drops at the injection site caused by the needle stitch(es); 
• and short and immediate pain at the injection site caused by the puncture itself.   
 Any other local injection site reactions such as redness, pain (other than the pain caused by the 
puncture itself), pruritus, rash or other skin reactions, bleedings (other than small blood drops caused by the needle stitch), local thrombosis, induration or swellings (caused by other grounds than the injected volume) must be reported on the local injection site reaction page in the eCRF.  
7.3.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death, 
• is life -threatening,  
 Page 39/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
• requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• is another important medical event.  
 
Hospital isation is NOT considered an SAE in case of: 
• hospital isation because of study -related procedures; hospital isation due to hospital 
standard measures (hospital isation for the first infusion of study drug etc.) 
• an elective (surgical ) procedure for which the date was scheduled before inclusion in 
the study 
• prolongation of the existing hospital isation due to economical or social, but not due to 
medical reasons.  
 
NOTE:  The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the patient was — in the view 
of the reporting Investigator — at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/ADR is serious in other 
situations: Important AEs/ADRs that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in 
death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above, should also be considered serious. 
In addition, although not classified under the seriousness criteria, all suspected transmissions 
of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE. A suspected virus transmission means that virus antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive t ransmission of antibodies alone does 
not constitute a suspected virus transmission. 
SAE reporting timelines  
All SAEs, whether suspected to be related to study treatment or not, are to be reported by telephone, fax or e- mail immediately to the Clinical Project Manager or designee.  
Contact details will be communicated at the study initiation visit.  
An Octapharma "Serious Adverse Event Report" must be completed and submitted within 24 hours after recognition of the event. 
All SAEs should be reported to the CRO  responsible for the USA  and Canada  (Premier 
Research), telephone number  
Octapharma's 24 -hour emergency telephone number is  
7.3.4 Laboratory Saf ety Tests  
For children the trial -related blood loss (including any losses in the manoeuvre) should not 
exceed 3% of the total blood volume during a period of 4 weeks and should not exceed 1% at 
any single draw. The total volume of blood is estimated at 80  mL/kg body weight. 
The following laboratory tests will be performed during the course of the study to investigate the efficacy and safety and tolerability of octanorm. At each visit, laboratory tests are to be performed before infusion of octanorm at the study site.

Laboratory determinations will be done at the individual study sites according to local 
procedures.  
The normal ranges of each determination at each laboratory involved will be provided in the 
Clinical Report.  
7.3.5 Viral Safety Tests  
At the Screening Visit, viral markers will be taken before the octanorm infusion, and will be 
tested at the local laboratory according to the site’s standard procedures. For patients positive in Hepatitis A virus at screening , follow- up samples may be omitted . 
Further viral marker samples will be taken, in Week 60 and at the (early) Termination Visit.  
7.3.6 Vital Signs  
To evaluate short -term tolerance, monitoring of vital signs including blood pressure, body 
temperature, pulse and respiratory rate will be performed at visits taking place at the clinic/study 
site; the Screening Visit, then at all subsequent study visits, and finally at the Termination Visit (irrespective of whether termination is regular or premature).  
Measurements will be carried out before the infusion and approximately within 1 hour after  the 
infusion of IMP (not applicable for de novo patients at Screening Visit) . 
7.3.7 Physical Examination 
A general physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit according to routine procedures and will be  as comprehensive as necessary to detect relevant abnormalities. If any 
findings are abnormal  (SCGAM -01 patients : only the findings that newly occurred since end 
of the SCGAM -01 study), the Investigator will document the start date and whether or not the 
abnormal finding is still present at the start of treatment. The physical examination will be 
repeated at all subsequent study visits, and finally at the Termination Visit (irrespective of whether termination is regular or premature). Clinically relevant wo rsening from the status at 
screening  will be documented as an AE.  
 Page 41/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
7.3.8 Other Relevant Safety Information 
Post study related safety reports  
Any SAE which occurs up to four weeks after the completion of the study  should be reported 
by the Investigator  to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of it . Proactive monitoring 
for post -study SAEs is not required. If a post study SAE is identified, the investigator should 
complete a SAE form. Relation to the clinical study should be stated on the report. 
If a patie nt dies within 4 weeks after the last IMP administration, this should be reported as 
well, irrespective of whether or not it is considered treatment- related.  
Pregnancies  
Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP. Pregnancies occurring 
during the study (foetal exposure to the IMP) need to be reported. 
In case of pregnancy during the study the Investigator is asked to complete the pregnancy 
notification form and to send it (by fax or email) to the Sponsor. Follow-up information on the outcome of both mother and foetus will be requested by a Sponsor representative. 
Overdose, interacti on and medication error  
The following safety relevant information should be reported as AE or as SAE, if the reaction 
fulfils one of the criteria for  seriousness (see Section 7.3.3).  
Drug overdose 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of clinical 
relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
Interaction  
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product affects the activity of an IMP, i.e. the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified as drug interaction. 
Medication error  
Medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal 
product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, 
instructions for use/labelling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication error.  
7.4 Other Assessments  
7.4.1 Drug Con centration Measurements  
Samples for total IgG trough levels measurements will be taken at the Screening Visit, before any infusion given at the study site and at the (early) Termination Visit; these samples will analysed at the local laboratory.  
7.4.2 Quality of Life Assessment  
QoL assessments will be made using the Child Health Questionnaire -Parent Form (CHQ -PF50) 
from parent or guardian of patients <14 years of age and the SF -36 Health Survey in patients 
≥14 years of age. The QoL assessments will take place at the S creening  Visit , at Week 60  (Visit 
6), and at the (early) Termination Visit.  
 Page 42/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
7.5 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Safety will be monitored by standard assessment. 
The therapeutic efficacy, defined as the prevention of SBI, is a very important clinical aspec t 
of any IgG replacement therapy and best characterises benefit to the patient.  
Determination of the pre -next-dose trough level of IgG is a standard method for determination 
of the correct dose for the individual patient. The QoL Questionnaires are standar dised, validated instruments that have been widely used in 
clinical studies, including studies with PI patients.  
 
8 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
To ensure that data in the CRFs are accurate and complete and in accordance with source 
records, source data verification will be performed in accordance with Octapharma standards. The extent of source data verification will be defined in detail in the monitoring manual.  
8.1 Documentation of Data 
8.1.1 Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all of the informati on related to clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in the study, written do wn in original records or certified copies of original 
records. The investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g., case histories or 
subject/patient files  for each subject/patient enrolled). Source records should be preserved for 
the maximum period of time required by local regulations.  
For each subject/patient enrolled, the investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the subject/patient participates in this study. 
All data entered in the CRF must be supported by source data in the subject/patient records with 
the exceptions listed in Section 8.1.2. 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IEC/IRB review(s) and 
regulatory inspection(s), by providing direct access to source data/records. 
The investigator may authorize site staff (e.g., sub -investigators, nurses) to enter study data into 
the CRF. This must be documented in the „Delegation of Authority Log“, signed by the 
investigator.  
The following data must be verifiable from the source records: patient’s incl usion in Study 
SCGAM -03, patient number, sex, weight, date of birth, written informed consent, medical 
history, main inclusion and exclusion criteria,  local laboratory test results, PID relevant 
concomitant therapies (medication and non- drug therapy), any  AE occurring in the course of 
the study, details of infusions (batch number, number of vials used, date, dose, rate and site(s)), date and reason for premature withdrawal (if applicable). As part of the source records, laboratory data will be reviewed by the Investigator, assessed as to their clinical significance, signed and dated. 
 Page 43/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
8.1.2 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF)  
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF will be completed within the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system and approved by the Investigator or an authorised sub-investigator.  
Study- site staff (e.g. research nurse)  will be responsible for entering patient data into the 
validated EDC system. All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system and study specific 
eCRF before receiving access to the li ve database for data entry. The site is also provided with 
the approved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist in data entry and data issues/questions. The site will be notified once the database is active to begin data entry. Additional site trainin g may be provided as refreshers throughout the study, if needed. All 
persons allowed to enter or change eCRF data must appear on the delegation of authority log. 
The following data may be entered directly into the EDC system, without prior record of source  
data, turning the eCRF into source: dates of blood sampling, vital signs . 
If any errors in the eCRFs are found during the data review process discrepancies will be 
generated programmatically within the EDC system, and ‘manual’ queries will be generated by  
either a monitor or Data Management. The programmed checks fire automatically once an eCRF page is saved within the system. The output s of the programmed checks are referred to 
as ‘discrepancies’. Discrepancies are generated by the input of illogical eCRF  data with the 
purpose to clarify the context or insertion of illogical or missing data with the site or designee.  
All discrepancies (programmed and manual) will be submitted to the site personnel or monitor for the site within the EDC system. Once the site responds to a discrepancy, Data Management or the monitor will review the new or changed data to ensure an appropriate response and close the discrepancy within the system.  
 
8.1.3 Changes to Case Report Form Data 
Monitors will perform source data verification (SDV) as defined for the study.  
Errors occurring on the EDC system can only be corrected by the investigator(s) or authorised 
site personnel. An audit trail documents all changes to the data over the entire study period. If data is changed as a result of a  query, a comment must be supplied within the query’s text, 
stating the reason for the change, before closing. In addition, any changes to a previously saved eCRF page that has not had a query generated will need to have a reason specified for the data change.  
Once queries have been resolved by the site staff, the resolutions are assessed by Data Management . If the query response provided confirms the data as correct, the discrepancy will 
be closed. If the response does not adequately address the question raised, a new query will be issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks are performed and programs are run throughout the study until the data is clean (all discrepancies resolved) and the database is ready for lock. Source data verification will be confirmed as complete by the monitor, and all eCRFs will be approved by the Investigator 
before database lock.  
8.1.4 Handling of Missing Data 
In general, missing data will not be imputed: calculations pertaining to person -year 
computations will be based on observed values only. Only in case of missing body weight, the 
 Page 44/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
last available weight measurement will be used for calculating the dose per kg bodyweight (last 
observation carried forward).  
If missing values occur in the confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoints, they will be imputed by worst observed values and thus be ranked at the end of the list for the Wilcoxon-Mann -Whitney test. Last-observation- carried -forward (LOCF) and observed -cases (OC) 
analyses will be applied as well as mixed models to explore the sensitivity of the results with 
regard to imputation techniques. 
8.2 Information of Investigators 
An Investigator’s Brochure will be handed out to the Investigator before the start of the study, 
unless the investigator is already in possession of the current Investigator’s Brochure. This brochure contains all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary for the Investigator to be fully and accurately informed about the safety of the IMP under evaluation and the respective benefit -risk ratio.  
The Investigat or’s Brochure will be updated by the Sponsor at regular intervals and in case new 
information concerning the IMP becomes available. 
All participating investigators will be informed about the relevant study procedures, about the 
methods for rating relevant study outcomes and how to complete the eCRF in order to reduce discrepancies between participating investigators and study sites. At the study initiation visit, the eCRF will be explained to all study site staff entitled to document data in the eCRF.  
The i nvestigators will be kept informed of important information related to the safe use of the 
investigational product as the study proceeds. 
8.3 Responsibilities  
The principal Investigator is accountable for the conduct of the clinical study. Responsibilities 
may be delegated to appropriately qualified persons. 
A “Delegation of Authority Log“  will be filled in and signed by the Investigator. In accordance 
with this authority log study -site staff (e.g., sub -investigators, nurses) is authorised to perform 
tasks relating to the study . 
The Investigator is responsible for coordinating the study locally. 8.4 Investigator’s Site File  
At each study site, the Investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable the 
conduct of the study to be fully documented. Essential documents as required by GCP guidelines and regulations (e.g., copies of the protocol, study approval letters, all original informed consent forms, drug dispensing and accountability logs, correspondence pertaining to the study, etc.) should be filed accurately and kept by the Investigator for the maximum period of time required by local regulations.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining a confidential patient identification code list, which provides the unique link between named source records and eCRF data for the Sponsor. The Investigator must arrange for the retention of this confidential list for the maximum period of time required by local regulations.  
 Page 45/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor. Should the Investigator elect to assign the study documents to another party, or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing. 
8.5 Provision of Additional Information 
On request, the Investigator will supply the Sponsor with additional data relating to the study, 
or copies of relevant source records, ensuring that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained. This is particularly important when source data are illegible or when errors in data transcription are encountered. In case of particular issues or governmental queries, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that the patient’s confidentiality is protected in accordance with applicable regulations.  
8.6 Independent Data M onitoring Committee  
The Sponsor will establish an IDMC. During the study, the IDMC will periodically review relevant data and will give advice on the continuation, modification or termination of the study (see Section 6.2.3). A study -specific Charter will define in detail the composition, 
responsibilities and procedures of the IDMC. 
 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
The statistical analysis will b e delegated under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities to 
an external CRO. All Octapharma procedures and policies have to be met by this CRO. 
Discrepancies or exceptions are to be approved by the Sponsor's Manager of Biometrics. 
9.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 45 patients are planned in total: 
• All the patients who complete the main study SCGAM -01 in the USA  or in Canada  and 
who are willing and eligible to continue study treatment will be included in the present 
extension study. At the time of preparation of this protocol is it anticipated that 
approximately 35 patients will take part in the extension study (Section  3.2).  
• Approximately 10 de novo patients who are under other SCIG treatment, but did not 
participate in the main study SCGAM -01 are planned in Canada. 
No further sample-size considerations apply. 
9.2 Statistical Analysis  
No confirmatory statistical analysis will be performed; the results of  this extension study will 
be presented at the descriptive level only.  
9.2.1 Population for Analysis 
The following populations will be considered for the statistical analysis: 
The safety analysis set consists of all patients who received at least part of one inf usion of 
octanorm within this extension study. 
 Page 46/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
The full analysis set (FAS) is defined according to the intention- to-treat principle and consists 
of all patients of the safety analysis set who satisfy all eligibility criteria and for whom any post 
screening  data in this extension study are available.  It is expected that the FAS will coincide 
with the safety set.  
The per -protocol (PP) set consists of all patients of the FAS excluding those with major protocol 
violations which may have an impact on the analysis of the primary endpoint. This is the set of patients who participated in the study as intended and for whom the primary endpoint can be evaluated as planned.  
Only major protocol deviations with the potential to affect the study results significantly or to 
invalidate the interpretation of the data obtained will lead to exclusion of patients from the PP set; protocol devi ations to be considered will include (but will not be limited to): 
• Violations of the study entry criteria.  
• Administration of any other blood or plasma-derived product or of any other 
immunoglobulin preparations during the SCGAM-03 study. 
• Any prohibited concomitant medication (including long term corticosteroids, daily, ≥0.15 mg of prednisone or equivalent/kg/day, immunosuppressive and 
immunomodulatory drugs). 
• Failure to attend two scheduled consecutive visits OR three or more scheduled visits 
during the study for reasons other than clinical reasons. 
Efficacy endpoints will be analysed on the basis of FAS. 
Analysis of the safety endpoints will be based on the safety set.  
The membership of each patient in the respective analysis populations will be determined 
before the statistical analysis in a data review meeting by a panel consisting of a medical expert from the Sponsor, the clinical s tudy manager, the data manager and the study statistician.  
All statistical analyses will be repeated on modified populations, i. e. excluding the 'de novo' patients . 
All data will be summarised for all patients overall and by age group.  
9.2.2 Efficacy Analysis Plan 
No confirmatory efficacy analysis will be performed.  
The rate of SBI per person -year (bacterial pneumonia, bacteraemia/sepsis, osteomyelitis/septic 
arthritis, visceral abscess, bacterial meningitis) during the treatment period with octanorm will be pre sented as point estimates of the rate along with a 99% CI. Calculation of this CI will 
account for intra -patient correlation in incidents following a compound Poisson process model. 
Furthermore, all observed SBIs will be listed individually and in full det ail. 
The duration of infection will be summarised by standard descriptive statistics by type of infection and by severity. The individual characteristics of each infection, including the time to resolution will be listed.  
The use of antibiotics will be reported as a detailed list of all such medications, and the number of patients treated with antibiotics, the number of treatment episodes and the number of treatment days will be tabulated. 
 Page 47/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
The FDA Guidance for Industry suggests that, based on historical dat a, a statistical 
demonstration of a serious infection rate per person- year less than 1.0 is adequate to provide 
substantial evidence of efficacy. [22] Therefore, this background information will be used for a 
descriptive evaluation of the serious infection rate in this extension study. Exploratory statistical 
testing may be performed if considered appropriate. 
The QoL data will be presented descriptivel y by visit, along with the change from baseline 
(defined as the first infusion). 
9.2.3 Safety Analysis Plan 
The safety analysis will comprise descriptive statistics, tabulations and listings of all TEAEs, 
safety laboratory results, viral markers, vital signs and physical examination findings. 
9.2.3.1 Adverse Events  
All reported AEs will be coded according to MedDRA. 
An AE is defined as treatment -emergent, if first onset or worsening is after start of the first 
infusion of octanorm. Only TEAEs are accounted for in the ana lysis.  
AEs that occur between informed consent and the start of the first infusion of octanorm will 
also be documented and will be flagged as pre- treatment AEs.  
For each TEAE, the time relative to the start of the infusion will be calculated and the TEAE will be classified as temporally associated  if the onset is during the infusion or within 72 hours 
after the end of the infusion. 
All reported events will be listed and tabulated in full detail, in particular the following key figures will be presented for each age group and for the study as a whole: 
• Total number of TEAEs reported. 
• Number of temporally associated TEAEs.  
• Infusion rate at the onset of temporally associated TEAEs  
• Narratives will be prepared describing each death, other SAEs, and other signific ant 
AEs that are judged to be of special interest because of clinical importance.  
9.3 Randomisation / Stratification  / Code Release  
There is no randomisation in this study. 
9.4 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned. 
 
10 ETHICAL / REGULATORY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS 
10.1 Ethical / Regulatory Framework 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  Before submission of the study protocol to the IRB and Competent 
Authority, the study will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov . The study protocol and any 
 Page 48/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
subsequent substantial amendment(s), as well as a sample of the information sheet and informed 
consent form, any other materials provided to the patients, and further requested information will be submitted to the IRB and the Competent Authority. The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
In addition, the study will be conducted under a US Investigational New Drug (IND ) 
application, and therefore must meet the applicable FDA requirements including Statement of 
Investigator Form 1572 and financial disclosure statement. 
The regulatory application or submission for regulatory approval will be made by the Sponsor 
as required by national law. Study approval must be available before any patient is exposed to a study -related procedure.  
The Competent Authorities and the IRBs will be notified of the end of the clinical study in accordance with local regulations.  
10.2 Approval of Study Documents  
The study protocol, a sample of the patient information and informed consent form, and further requested information will be submitted to the appropriate IRB and the competent Authority. The study approval letter must be available before any pat ient is exposed to a study -related 
procedure. 
The Sponsor, the Investigator and any third party (e.g. CRO) involved in obtaining approval, 
must inform each other in writing that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient is e nrolled in the study. 
10.3 Patient Information and Informed Consent  
The Investigator will obtain freely given written consent from each patient after an appropriate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards and any other aspect of the study which is relevant to the patient’s decision to participate. The informed consent form must be signed, with name and date and time noted by the patient, before the patient is exposed 
to any study- related procedure, including screening tests for eligibility.  
For minor patients, freely given written consent must be obtained from parents or legal 
guardians. In addition, when required by the local regulatory authorities, IRBs, written assent must be obtained from children and adolescents based upon t he age requirements established 
by those institutions.  
The Investigator will explain to each single patient that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without the need to justify their withdrawal. The Investigator will date and sign the informed consent form of each patient enrolled. 
Each patient, or his parents/legal guardians, will give written consent that his/her source records 
may be reviewed  by study monitors, quality assurance auditors and/or health authority 
inspectors, in accordance with applicable regulations. These persons are bound by confidentiality obligations.  
10.4 Protocol Amendments  
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the Investigator (Coordinating Investigator in multicentre studies) and the Sponsor before its implementation. Any such 
 Page 49/53 October 25, 2017  
Study Protocol SCGAM -03 Version 05 - Canada  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
amendments will be submitted to the IRB and/or Competent Authority responsible as required 
by applicable regulations. IRB approval will at a minimum be requested for any change to this 
protocol which could affect the safety of the patients, the objective/design of the study, any increase in dosage or duration of exposure to the IMP, an increase in the number of patients treated, th e addition of a new test or procedure, or the dropping of a test intended to monitor 
safety.  
10.5 Confidentiality of Patients’ Data  
The Investigator will ensure that the patient's confidentiality will be preserved. On eCRFs  or 
any other documents submitted to the Sponsor, the patients will not be identified by their names, but by an identification code, consisting of a centre number and a patient number. Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor, i.e. the confidential patient identification list, original informed consent forms and source records, will be maintained by the responsible Investigator in strict confidence.  
 
 
11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
11.1 Periodic Monitoring  
The monitor will contact and visit the investigator periodically to review all study -related 
source data/records, verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and 
accuracy of all CRF entries compared to source data. The investigator will co-operate with the monitor t o ensure that any discrepancies identified are resolved.  
For this study, the first monitoring visit shall take place shortly after the inclusion of the first subject/patient. Thereafter, monitoring frequency will depend on study progress  but is expected 
to be approximately every 10-18 weeks.  
The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the clinical study. Source data will 
be available for all data in the CRFs, including all laboratory results. 
11.2 Audit and Inspection  
The Investigator will make all study -related source data and records available to a qualified 
quality as surance auditor mandated by the Sponsor, or to IRB / Regulatory Authority inspectors, 
after reasonable notice. The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to confirm that the 
rights and welfare of the patients have been adequately protected, and that a ll data relevant for 
the assessment of safety and effectiveness of the IMP have been reported to the Sponsor.

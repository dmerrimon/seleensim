Qualification  Every effort must be made to ensure the same assessor will complete 
the clinical efficacy/health outcome assessments for each subject at 
all visits at approximately the same time throughout the study, 
according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Visits should 
be scheduled with the availability of the evaluator(s) tak en into 
account. If the assessor is unable to complete the evaluation, then 
another qualified individual can take the place of the initial 
evaluator, but the substitute evaluator should have examined and 
reviewed the subject with the initial evaluator in o rder to assure 
overlapping experience (consistency between subject evaluations). 
Documentation of who performed the evaluation is to be recorded 
in source notes.  
To be an eligible Joint Assessor, individuals must receive the 
standardized joint count traini ng provided by BMS or be trained by 
an individual who did receive the standardized training 
(documentation filed in the Investigator File and the BMS Study 
File). Such individuals should have appropriate medical credentials 
and/or should be individuals wit h appropriate scientific/medical 
background who are experienced in performing joint assessments. 
If the individual does not have medical credentials, documentation 
of their experience (preferably on a curriculum vitae) must be 
provided to the BMS site mana ger, and their eligibility as joint 
assessor must be confirmed by the BMS medical monitor before the 
individual’s participation in the study as joint assessor.

The Patient Reported Outcome Measures Inf ormation System 
Fatigue (PROMIS -Fatigue) and Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue) instruments 
evaluate a range of self -reported symptoms over the past week, 
from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, 
debilitating and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases 
one’s ability to execute daily activities. … Fatigue is divided into 
the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and 
the impact of fatigue on physical, mental; and soci al activities. 
The first 13 questions of the PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire 
comprise the FACIT -Fatigue questionnaire.   
The PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire is not yet available in all 
languages and will be administered at sites where it is available 
in the local language. In countries where the PROMIS -Fatigue 
questionnaire is not available in the local language, sites will 
administer the FACIT -Fatigue questionnaire to start the 
protocol. Once the PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire is available 
in the local languag e, and with approval from the ethics 
committee, any newly enrolled subjects will complete the 
PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire. Subjects who were 
administered the FACIT -Fatigue at Day  1 will continue to be 
administered the FACIT -Fatigue throughout the study.  The

Section 9.4.1.1 
Primary Endpoint 
Analyses The primary efficacy analysis model for binary endpoints 
(responder/non -responder) will use a logistic regression model to 
assess whether there is a dose -response trend between ACR 20 
response and dose level. The model will include dose level (0, 6, 
12) as a continuous variable, and the following covariates: 
geographic region, TNFi use (experienced/naïve) , DMARD use 
(yes/no), glucocorticosteroid use (yes/no),) and body weight (≥ 90 
kg and < 90 kg) in the model. If the model does not converge, then 
pre-specified covariates will be removed from the model. The odds 
ratio of the dose parameter and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) will be provided.

Secondary 
Endpoint 
Analyses The following secondary continuous endpoints will be assessed at 
Week 16 using dose -response linear regression analysis. The 
change from baseline in HAQ-DI score will be calculated at 
Week 16 and analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). 
Dose level (0, 6, 12) w ill be assessed in the model as a continuous 
variable and the following covariates as fixed effects: geographic 
region, TNFi use (experienced/naïve) , DMARD use (yes/no), 
glucocorticosteroid use (yes/no),) and body weight (< 90 kg and ≥ 
90 kg). The baseline  HAQ-DI value will be added into the model as 
a covariate. Treatment differences based on least -squares (LS) 
means and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% CIs will be provided for 
the dose-response parameter.  
The change from baseline in SF -36 PCS score at Week 1 6 will use 
a similar analysis method as was used for the change from baseline 
in HAQ-DI score.

Endpoints  … Testing of secondary endpoints will occur sequentially and may 
only proceed to the next secondary endpoint if the null hypothesis 
is rejected at alpha = 0.05 (0.10 (2-sided) for the prior endpoint 
showing a positive dose -response in that endpoint.  If an endpoint 
fails at any step, then all subsequent p -values will be considered 
nominal. 
Secondary Family – secondary Secondary endpoints will be tested 
for a positive dose -response trend at a 1-sided alpha = 0.05. Testing 
order of secondary end points will be tested in the following order : 
if the primary endpoint is significant at 1 -sided alpha = 0.05 for a 
dose-response relationship :

If the above dose -response analyses provide a significant 
relationship, pairwise comparisons between each BMS -986165 
dose group compared to placebo will follow. Testing for each BMS -
986165 dose group will be set -up in separate testin g branches. The 
primary endpoint, ACR 20 at Week 16, will be tested for each BMS -
986165 dose compared to placebo at an alpha = 0.025 (1 -sided) 
using Bonferroni adjustment to the overall Type 1 error rate of 0.05 
(1-sided). If the primary endpoint is signif icant for a particular 
BMS-986165 dose compared to placebo, then testing will proceed 
for the secondary endpoints for that BMS -986165 dose. A similar 
testing order as described above within each branch will be followed 
for each secondary endpoint.

Potential  CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE SUBJECTS OF 
CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL  
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below, 
in conjunction with the required restrictions in Inclusion Criterion 
Section 5.1 (3d) of the protocol, is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure , defined as # Days/ 
Weeks Relevant Exposure days/weeks after the end of study 
treatment, plus 30 days. As such, in Part A WOCBP must agree 
to follow instru ctions for methods of contraception for 33 days 
post-treatment completion, and in Part B WOCBP must agree 
to follow instructions for methods of contraception for 190 days 
post-treatment completion.  
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or 
additional contraception methods. Additionally, alternative 
and/or additional contraception methods may be required 
based on background DMARDS the subject may be taking (eg, 
methotrexate, leflunomide, etc.)  
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR MALE 
PARTICIPAN TSSUBJECTS WITH PARTNER(S) OF CHILD 
BEARING POTENTIAL.  
• Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential are 
eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the 
treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.  
• Male subjects are required to use a condom for study duration and 
until the end of relevant systemic exposure defined as # Days/ 
Weeks Relevant Exposure for 93 days/weeks after the end of  
btreatment completion  in the male participant Part A and 250 days 
post-treatment completion in Part B.

Study Population:  
Men and women ≥18 years of age with PsA for ≥ 6 months, with at least 1 confirmed ≥ 2 cm lesion 
of plaque psoriasis, having active arthritis (a minimum of ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints), 
and who are either biologi c-naïve (approximately 70% of the study population) or who have failed 
or been intolerant to 1 TNF -inhibitor (TNFi-experienced, approximately 30% of the study 
population), will be eligible to participate in the study.  In addition, subjects entering the stu dy who 
have failed or have been intolerant to non -biologic DMARDs, NSAIDs and /or steroids will be 
allowed to continue their background medications during the study, the details of which are as 
specified in inclusion criteria.  
It is imperative that subjec ts meet all eligibility criteria. All screening and randomization 
evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eligibility 
criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all subjects screened 
and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.

Overall Design:  
This is a 16-week (Part A) randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of BMS -986165 in subjects with active PsA . A 
total of approximately 180 subjects with active PsA will be randomized  in Part A. This Phase 2 
study will be conducted in a mixed population of subjects with active PsA who have either not 
received prior treatment with a biologic (biologic -naïve, approximately 7 0%) or who have failed 
or been intolerant to 1 TNF -inhibitor ( TNFi-experienced, approximately 30%). In addition, 
investigators will need to specify if the subject’s phenotype is peripheral arthritis or peripheral plus 
psoriatic spondyloarthritis.  
The total duration of participation in Part A is approximately 24 weeks and will be divided into 
the following periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), double -blind placebo-controlled treatment for 
16 weeks (Week 1 to Week 16, Part A), and follow -up (up to 4 we eks). Subjects completing 
double-blind treatment in Part A will have an opportunity to enroll in an optional double -blind 
double-dummy Part B. Treatment in Part B will be given for up to 36 weeks (Week 16 to Week 
52). For subjects completing both Part A an d B of the study, the anticipated study duration is 
approximately 60 weeks : screening (up to 4 weeks ), double-blind placebo-controlled  treatment for 
16 weeks (Week 1 to Week 16, Part A ), double-blind double-dummy treatment for 36 weeks 
(Week 16 to Week 52,  Part B), and follow -up (up to 4 weeks ). 
Efficacy and safety will be assessed throughout the study.  
  
Part A 
Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to 
administration of study medication. Following the screening process, if subjects are eligible for 
randomization then subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio ( approximately 60 subjects per 
arm) to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups:  
• Placebo  
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD  
• BMS-986165 12 mg QD

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  35 Randomization will be stratified by TNFi use (experienced/naïve) and body weight (≥ 90 kg and 
< 90 kg). 
The primary endpoint is A CR 20 response at Week 16.  
In Part A, subjects who discontinue study treatment early for any reason other than consent 
withdrawal will be expected to complete the early termination (ET) visit followed by the safety 
follow-up period.  
Part B 
At Week 16, sub jects will have the option to continue to participate in the double-blind Part B of 
the study. All subjects who receive placebo in Part A will receive ustekinumab in Part B  according 
to approved labeling for PsA ; subjects who receive BMS -986165 in Part A and achieve MDA will 
continue treatment with BMS -986165 at the same dose in Part B, and subjects who receive BMS -
986165 in Part A and fail to achieve MDA will receive ustekinumab in Part B. The treatment 
assignment in Part B will be double -blind, double-dummy as follows : 
• Placebo in Part A: ustekinumab subcutaneous (S Q) injection plus placebo  matching  
BMS-986165 QD in Part B  
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD in Part A with MDA at Week 16: BMS -986165 6 mg QD plus 
placebo matching ustekinumab SQ injection in Part B  
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD in Part A without MDA at Week 16: ustekinumab SQ injection 
plus placebo -matching BMS -986165 QD in Part B  according to respective country product 
monograph s (See Table 5 , table note a)  
• BMS-986165 12 mg QD in Part A wit h MDA at Week 16: BMS -986165 12 mg QD plus 
placebo matching ustekinumab SQ injection in Part B  
• BMS-986165 12 mg QD in Part A without MDA at Week 16: ustekinumab SQ injection 
plus placebo matching BMS -986165 QD in Part B  
In Part B at Week 28, at the discret ion of the investigator , the study design provides for rescue 
therapy for relief of joint symptoms with NSAIDs, intra -articular injections of steroids, systemic 
glucocorticoids or DMAR Ds, as follows:  
• NSAIDs may be added or the dose may be increased according to labeling guidelines  
• A single oral tapering dose of glucocorticosteroid (no greater than 20 mg of prednisone [or 
prednisone equivalent]) per day, not to exceed 2 weeks  
• An intra-articular dose o f glucocorticoids (no greater than 40 mg methylprednisolone or  
40 mg of triamcinolone [or methylprednisolone or triamcinolone equivalent]) into 1 joint 
or divided into 2 joints  
• A single intramuscular dose of glucocorticoids (no greater than 40 mg methylp rednisolone 
or 40 mg of triamcinolone [or methylprednisolone or triamcinolone equivalent])   
• DMARD treatment may not be started; however:

Subjects who need rescue therapy or additional therapy for PsA and/or flares  after the Week 28 
timepoint of Part B will be discontinued from the study.  
At Week 48, subjects will discuss with the ir investigator/treating physicia n plans for treatment 
with ustekinumab after study completion. In order to maintain the study blind and to ensure 
continuity of care for those electing to be treated with ustekinumab after the study  completion ( ie, 
completion of the Week 56 visit), the following Week 52 procedure should be performed:  
• Subjects that elect to be treated  with ustekinumab following study completion will receive 
the following treatment at  Week 52: 
• Subjects that were on ustekinumab treatment in Part B will receive a placebo  matching 
ustekinumab SQ injection 
• Subjects that were on BMS -986165 6 mg or BMS -986165 12 mg treatment in Part B 
will receive ustekinumab  SQ injection  
• Subjects that elect not to b e treated with ustekinumab after the study will not receive any 
treatment at Week 52 (regardless of the treatment that they received in Part B).  
Following completion of the Week 56 visit (ie, at the conclusion of the follow -up period of the 
study), subjects that elected to be treated with ustekinumab following study completion , will be 
due for their ustekinumab injection, as follows:  
• Subjects that were on ustekinumab treatment in Part B will be due for  their next scheduled 
(12-week) dose of ustekinumab SQ injection following completion of the Week 56 visit  
• Subjects that were on BMS -986165 6 mg or BMS -986165 12 mg treatment in Part B will 
be due for  their next scheduled (4 -week) dose of ustekinumab SQ injection following 
completion of the Week 56 visit  
Note: Ustekinumab treatment at Week 56 and beyond will b e part of standard of care and will not 
be provided by the study Sponsor.  
In Part B, subjects who discontinue study treatment early for any reason other than consent 
withdrawal will be expected to complete the  ET visit followed by the safety follow -up period. 
 
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size and Power Determination:  
A total sample size of 180 subjects randomized in a blinded fashion at a 1:1:1 ratio to BMS -986165 
6 mg QD arm, BMS -986165 12 mg QD arm, and placebo (approximately 60 subjects per arm) will 
provide 87.5 % power to detect a significant dose -response trend for the primary endpoint of  
ACR 20 response at Week 16. Power determination is based on the assumption of a placebo 
response rate of 30% and BMS -986165 response rates of 50% and 55% in the 6 mg QD and 12  mg 
QD doses respectively, using a linear trend test with α=0.05 ( 1-sided) or α=0.10 (2-sided).

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  37 General Methodology:  
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will 
include all randomized subjects who are dispensed study drug. Following the intent -to-treat 
principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
The primary efficacy analysis model for the binary endpoint of ACR  20 response (responder/non -
responder) wil l use a logistic regression model to assess whether there is a dose -response trend 
between ACR 20 response and dose level. The model will include dose level (0, 6, 12) as a 
continuous variable, and the following covariates: TNFi use (experienced/naïve) and  body weight 
(≥ 90 kg and < 90 kg)  in the model. Odds ratios and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be provided.  
The composite strategy as defined in ICH E9 R1 will be used to address the following intercurrent 
events: 
- Subjects who discontinue the treatment or study early (ie , prior to Week 16),  
- Start a protocol prohibited medication/therapy,  
- Subjects who are lost to follow -up, 
- Subjects who otherwise have missing endpoint data at or prior to Week 16.  
Subjects with the  above intercurrent events will be imputed using the non -responder imputation 
(NRI) method. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be conducted considering different strategies used for 
addressing intercurrent events. Supportive analyses on the primary endpo int will be conducted 
using the Per Protocol ( PP) set. Tipping point analysis may be performed to assess the robustness 
of the primary imputation method.  
The analysis model for binary secondary and additional endpoints will use a similar analysis model 
as the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The analysis model for continuous secondary and additional endpoints will use analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) to assess the dose -response trend. The model will include dose level (0, 
6, 12) as a continuous variable and the fo llowing covariates as fixed effects: TNFi use 
(experienced/naïve)  and body weight (≥  90 kg and <  90 kg). The baseline value will be added into 
the model as a covariate. Treatment differences based on least -squares (LS) means and the 
corresponding 2 -sided 95% CIs will also be provided for contrast -based tests . 
For continuous efficacy endpoints, the “Composite” and “While on Treatment” strategies will be 
used to address specific intercurrent events. For subjects who discontinue study treatment and/or 
study due to:  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Adverse events

subject’s Week 16 value. For all other intercurrent events, the last valid observation while on 
treatment will be used as the Week 16 value.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Testing Strate gy for Efficacy Endpoints:  
Statistical analysis of secondary endpoints will be performed in a hierarchical fashion. In order to 
preserve the overall Type I error rate, a fixed -sequence testing method will be implemented. 
Testing of secondary endpoints will  occur sequentially and may only proceed to the next secondary 
endpoint if the null hypothesis is rejected at alpha = 0. 10 (2-sided) for the prior endpoint showing 
a positive dose -response in that endpoint. If an endpoint fails at any step, then all subseq uent 
p-values will be considered nominal.  
Safety Analysis:  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs will be summarized using counts and percentages of 
subjects experiencing the event as well as the number of events by system organ class, preferred 
term, and treatment group. Physical examination findings, vital signs, clinical laboratory test 
results, and ECG test results will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variabl es and frequency distributions 
(counts and percentages) for categorical variable.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a 16-week (Part A) randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of BMS -986165 in subjects wi th active PsA . A 
total of approximately 180 subjects with active PsA will be randomized  in Part A. This Phase 2 
study will be conducted in a mixed population of subjects with active PsA who have either not

or been intolerant to 1 TNF -inhibitor ( TNFi-experienced, approximately 30%). In addition, 
investigators will need to specify if the subject’s phenotype is peripheral arthritis or peripheral plus 
psoriatic spondyloarthritis.  
The total duration of participation in Part A is approximately 24 weeks and will be divided into 
the following periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), double -blind placebo -controlled treatment for 
16 weeks (Week 1 to Week 16, Part A), an d follow-up (up to 4 weeks). Subjects completing 
double-blind treatment in Part A will have an opportunity to enroll in an optional dou ble-blind 
double-dummy Part  B. Treatment in Part B will be given for up to 36 weeks (Week 16 to 
Week 52). For subjects co mpleting both Part A and B of the study, the anticipated study duration 
is approximately 60 weeks: screening (up to 4 weeks), double -blind placebo -controlled treatment 
for 16 weeks (Week 1 to Week 16, Part A), double -blind double -dummy treatment for 36 wee ks 
(Week 16 to Week 52, Part B), and follow -up (up to 4 weeks).  
Part A 
Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to 
administration of study medication. Following the screening process, if subjects are eligibl e for 
randomization then subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (approximately 60 subjects per 
arm) to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups:  
• Placebo  
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD  
• BMS-986165 12 mg QD  
Randomization will be stratified by TNFi use (experienced/naïve) and body weight (≥ 90 kg and 
< 90 kg). 
The primary endpoint is ACR 20 response at Week 16.  
In Part A, subjects who discontinue study treatment early for any reason other than consent 
withdrawal will be expected to complete the ET visit followed by the safety follow -up period.  
Part B 
At Week 16, subjects will have the option to participate in the  double-blind Part B of the study.

5.3 Lifestyle Restrictions  
General sk in care measures (with above restrictions for topical treatments) are recommended that 
are standard for patients with plaque psoriasis. Subjects should avoid excessive sun exposure and 
avoid risks that are known to provoke flare of psoriasis.  
5.3.1 Meals and Die tary Restrictions  
Study treatment  may be taken without regard to meals, however, subjects are required to fast for a 
minimum of 10 hours before visits on which fasting lipid, fasting glucose, and post-dose PK 
samples will be drawn. Details are provided in Section 8.5. 
5.3.2 Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco  
No restrictions are required; however, extensive use of caffeine, alcohol , and tobacco should be 
avoided. 
5.3.3 Activity 
No restrictions are required; however, unusual physical exertion should be avoided during the 
study. 
5.4 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but who are 
not subsequently randomized in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required 
to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to meet the Consolidated Standards o f 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, as applicable, and to respond to queries 
from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, demography, screen 
failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs. 
5.4.1 Retesting During Screening or Lead -in Period  
For laboratory parameters that initially do not meet eligibility requirements, a single retest within 
the 28-day screening period is permitted before subject is declared a screen failure. This is an effort 
to find all possible well -qualified subjects. Consultation with the Medical Monitor may be needed 
to identify whether repeat testing of any particular parameter would be clinically relevant.  
The study permits the rescreening (after the end of the initial 28 -day screen ing period) of a subject 
who discontinues the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, the subject fails to meet eligibility criteria 
and has not been treated). The subject must be reconsented, will be assigned a new identification 
number, and a full screening  visit must be performed again. A subject can only be rescreened 1 
time (ie, if the subject fails 1 rescreening attempt, no additional rescreening is allowed). Duration

6 TREATMENT  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study subject according to the study randomization 
or treatment alloca tion. 
Study treatment for IM011084 includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Product (IP/IMP) and 
Noninvestigational [Medicinal] Product (Non -IP/Non-IMP) as shown in  Table 3. 
An IP, also known as IMP in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differ ently 
than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form.  
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as comp onents of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non -IPs.

Subjects that complete Part A will have the option to enroll in Part B of the study to receive study 
drug in a double -blind, double -dummy fashion  over 36 weeks  (Table 5). The treatment group  
assignment  in Part B will depend  on the treatment the subject received in Part A as well as if the 
subject ach ieved MDA at Week 16 (Part A). Subjects will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:  
• Ustekinumab SQ injection PLUS Placebo matching BMS -986165 
• BMS-986165 6 mg PLUS Placebo matching ustekinumab injection  
• BMS-986165 12 mg PLUS Placebo matching ustekinumab injection  
Study treatment will be dispensed and administered in a double -blind, double -dummy fashion as 
described in Section 4.1.  
BMS-986165 6 mg, 12 m g, or placebo matching BMS -986165 tablets:  
As the blister cards provided to the sites will be double -blind, all dispensing must be performed 
via the IRT system. Blister cards will be dispensed at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. 
An adequate su pply of blister cards will be dispensed to cover the subject until their next scheduled 
visits.  
The tablets will be arranged into sets and the subject will be instructed to take 2 tablets daily in the 
morning (total of 2 tablets daily). Any missed doses s hould be returned at the next study visit.  
Ustekinumab or placebo matching ustekinumab:  
The ustekinumab or placebo matching ustekinumab will be administered SQ at Weeks 16, 20, 32, 
and 44.  Additionally another dose of ustekinumab or placebo matching ustek inumab will be 
administered at Week 52 based on the investigator/treating physician’s and subject’s decision to 
take ustekinumab post -study completion (ie , following Week 56 visit completion).  
The ustekinumab vials provided by the Sponsor will be open -label. Normal saline will be used as 
the placebo for ustekinumab. An unblinded pharmacist (or appropriate drug preparation person) 
will need to prepare the SQ injection based on the subject’s treatment assignment (i e,  ustekinumab 
SQ injection or placebo matching ustekinumab SQ injection). The syringe used for administration 
of ustekinumab or placebo must be identical. However, the color and viscosity of the solutions 
may be different. Even though the subject will not b e able to distinguish the difference, study 
personnel who administer both preparations may be able to perceive the difference. For this reason, 
the person designated as the unblinded drug administrator will not be involved in any other study 
conduct. Depen ding on the site, the unblinded pharmacist (or appropriate drug preparation person) 
and the unblinded study drug administrator may be the same person.

after the study completion ( ie, completion of the Week 56 visit), the following  treatment will be administered at  
Week 52: 1) subjects that were on ustekinumab treatment in Part B will receive a placebo  matching ustekinumab 
SQ injection, or 2) subjects that were on BMS -986165 6 mg or BMS -986165 12 mg treatment in Part B will receive 
ustekinumab SQ injection  
b Ustekinumab is weight based dosing. Two vials will be used for injections to create 90 mg doses. Dosing will be 
in quick succession and different syringes will be needed  
 
6.2 Method of Treatment Assignment  
At the time of the screening visit, before any study -related procedures are performed, the 
investigative site will access the enrollment option of the IRT  system for assignment of a subject 
number. This number is assigned sequentially by the system and will be unique across all sites. If 
a potential subject is rescreened, a new identification number will be used.  
At Week 0 (Day 1)  of Part A , subjects who mee t all criteria for enrollment at Screening and  
Day 1 will be centrally  randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio to BMS-986165 6 mg QD, BMS-986165  
12 mg QD, or placebo  matching BMS -986165, as determined by a computer -generated 
randomization schedule using IRT. The ran domization lists will be generated by the IRT vendor 
using a permuted block design within each combination of stratum level. Randomization will be 
stratified by TNFi use (experienced/naïve)  and body weight (< 90 kg and ≥ 90 kg). After all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met for a subject, the investigative site will access the IRT

based on th e above-described randomization schedule and each subject will be assigned a unique 
randomization number. In addition, a kit number will be assigned to the subject corresponding to 
the treatment  assignment.  
Subjects completing Part A will have the option to enroll into Part B of the study. Treatment 
assignment in Part B will be based on the subject’s treatment assignment in Part A as well as the 
patient’s MDA score at Week 16. Similar to Part A, blister cards will be dispensed to create a 
1-month supply. 
6.3 Blinding  
6.3.1 Maintaining the Blind  
Treatment assignments and study drug dispensing in Part A and in Part B will be managed using 
IRT. Investigative site staff, the Sponsor, and subject will remain blinded to treatment assignment 
with the exception of an  unblinded pharmacist (or appropriate drug preparation person) , an 
unblinded study drug administrator (Part B),  and an unblinded site monitor who will be involved 
only with drug accountability in Part B . Depending on the site, the unblinded pharmacist (or 
appropriate drug preparation person) and the unblinded study drug administrator may be the same 
person. 
BMS-986165 6 mg, 12 mg tablets, or placebo matching BMS -986165: 
Each strength of BMS -986165 (6 mg or 12 mg) will have a matching placebo. The tablets wi ll be 
provided to the sites in blister cards and each subject will need to take 2 tablets daily.   
Ustekinumab or placebo matching ustekinumab:  
Ustekinumab vials for SQ injection will be provided by the Sponsor. Normal saline will be used 
as the placebo fo r ustekinumab and will be procured by the site. An unblinded pharmacist (or 
appropriate drug preparation person) will need to prepare the SQ injection based on the subject’s 
treatment assignment (i.e. ustekinumab SQ injection or placebo matching ustekinuma b SQ 
injection). The syringe used for administration of ustekinumab or placebo must be identical ; 
however, the color and viscosity of the solutions may be different. Even though the subject will 
not be able to distinguish the difference, study personnel wh o administer both preparations may 
be able to perceive the difference. For this reason, the person is designated as the unblinded drug 
administrator and will not be involved in any other study conduct. Depending on the site, the 
unblinded pharmacist (or ap propriate drug preparation person) and the unblinded study drug 
administrator may be the same person.

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  82 6.3.2 Circumstances for Unblinding  
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject in which knowledge of the IP 
is critical to the subject ’s management, the blind for that subject may be broken by the i nvestigator. 
The subject’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment 
assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject ’s treatment, the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it will alter the subject ’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the IP, the 
problem may be properly  managed by assuming that the subject is receiving active product. It is 
highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate authority for the decision to unblin d. The 
Principal Investigator should only call in for emergency unblinding AFTER the decision to 
discontinue the subject has been made.  
In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted access to randomization information via 
IRT and is capable of  breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the 
Sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify the Medical Monitor and/or study 
director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT manua l. 
Subject and unblinded treatment information and the reason for the blind being broken must be 
recorded on the appropriate study status page of the elec tronic case report form (eCRF). In 
addition, the information that is requested on the emergency unblin ding envelope must be 
completed. After unblinding via IRT, the investigator shall notify the Medical Monitor.  
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt is made 
to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a su bject for nonemergency purposes must be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor.    
The DMC will assess safety and risk benefit on an ongoing basis, and will have access to unblinded 
treatment codes for individual subjects An analysis team, including a reporting  statistician and 
programming support, who are not involved with the conduct of the study, will provide analyses 
to the DMC. The procedures to be respected and the reasons for unblinding of the DMC are 
discussed in the DMC charter.  
In addition, an unblinde d analysis of the safety and endpoint data will be performed after all 
subjects complete their Week 16 visit (Part A). The analysis will be performed by an independent 
statistical team who are not involved in the conduct of the study and reviewed by non -study team 
members who will use the data to support Phase 3 development decision making.  Study team 
members will remain blinded as subjects move into Part B.  
A bioanalytical scientist in the Bioanalytical Sciences department of BMS Research & 
Development (or  a designee in the external central bioanalytical laboratory) will be unblinded to 
the randomized treatment assignments in order to minimize unnecessary bioanalytical analysis of 
samples.

6.4 Dosage Modification  
There is no provision for dose -modification of study treatment. If a subject interrupts treatment 
due to an AE, study treatment can be restarted in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
6.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study subjects. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel according  to local regulations.  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment 
should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately.  
Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.  
IP documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintain ed that includes all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, a dministration sets).  
Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in 
APPENDIX 2 . 
The unblinded pharmacist (or appro priate drug preparation person) will obtain treatment 
assignment by IRT in Part B and prepare the ustekinumab or placebo injection . 
  
 
6.6 Treatment Compliance  
Study treatment compliance will be periodically monitored using standard drug accountability 
procedures (comparing the number of tablets returned to number dispensed, considering the 
expected regimen and any reported missed doses). Drug accountability will be reviewed by the 
investigative s ite staff at each visit to confirm treatment compliance. Site staff will discuss any 
discrepancies with the subject and remind the subject of the importance of compliance with the 
assigned regimen. A real -time monitoring platform may be used.

7.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment  
Subjects MUST discontinue IP (and non-IP at the discretion of the investigator) for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Subject’s request to stop study treatment. Subjects who request to discontinue study treatment 
will remain in the study and must continue to be follo wed for protocol specified follow -up 
procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject specifically withdraws consent for 
any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by subject to provide this 
information  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the 
investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the 
subject 
• Termination of the study by BMS 
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent th rough imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness  
• eGFR <45 mL/min confirmed on a repeat assessment within 7  days 
• Abnormal liver tests suggestive of drug -induced liver injury (DILI), as defined in   
Section 8.2.8 or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the  subject 
• The subject develops a malignancy, with the exception of a subject who develops 
nonmelanoma skin cancer who may continue in the study at the discretion of the investigator  
• Pregnancy, positive pregnancy test, or subject expresses an interest in becoming pregnant 
(refer to Section  8.2.6) 
• Subject develops active TB during the study or prematurely discontinues treatment for LTBI, 
or subject is noncompliant with LTBI therapy (refer to Section  8.4.4) 
• Unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment for any reason (emergency or nonemergency)  
• Inability or failure to comply with protocol requirements in the opinion of the  investigator  
• Clinically significant worsening of disease , while taking study treatment , that require s the use 
of medications listed as prohibited in the protocol  
Refer to the Schedule of Activities for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation 
and follow -up and for any further evaluations that can be completed.  
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the Medical Monitor/d esignee of this event. In most cases, the study treatment 
will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for 
subject safety). Refer to Section  8.2.6 Pregnancy.  
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol-specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities, Section 1.3. The only exception to this 
requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study procedures including post -treatment

for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page. 
7.1.1 Post-Study Treatment Study Follow Up   
Subjects who discontinue study treatment will be followed through the scheduled 30 -day safety 
follow-up period  or longer, as required, and in line with Section 8.2.4. 
7.2 Discontinuation from the Study  
Subjects who request to discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to 
be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information.  
• Subjects should notify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -
up in writing , whenever possible.  
• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
investigator and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  
• In the event that vital status (wh ether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly 
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in 
accordance with local law.  
• If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future informatio n, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• During part B of the study (Week 16 to Week 52), and after 12 weeks of treatment ( at Week 28 
only), for subjects who do not achieve MDA, the study design provides for rescue therapy for 
relief of joint symptoms with NSAIDs, intra -articular injections of steroids, systemic 
glucocorticoids or DMARDs . After Week 28, s ubjects who need rescue therapy or additional 
therapy for PsA and/or flares will be discontinu ed from the study.  
7.3 Lost to Follow -Up 
• All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities  (Section 1.3).  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allow ed. 
• All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Medical Monitor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specifie d in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibility criteria before randomization. The investigator will maintain a s creening 
log to record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signi ng of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
8.1 Efficacy Assessments  
8.1.1 Rater Qualification  
All rheumatologic and dermatologic evaluations must be performed by a qualified assessor that 
is blinded to the subject’s safety data, previous efficacy data, and treatment. Every effort must be 
made to ensure the same assessor will complete the clinical efficacy/health outcome assessments 
for each subject at all visits at approximately the same time throughout the study, according to 
the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Visits should be scheduled with the availability of the 
evaluator(s) taken into account. If the assessor is unable to complete the evaluation, then another 
qualified individual can take the place of the initial evaluator, but the substitute evaluator should 
have examined and reviewed the subject with the initial evaluator in order to assure overlapping 
experience (consistency between subject evaluations). Documentation of who performed the 
evaluation is to be rec orded in source notes.  
To be an eligible Joint Assessor, individuals must receive the standardized joint count training 
provided by PRA/BMS or be trained by an individual who did receive the standardized training 
(documentation filed in the Investigator Fi le and the Study File). Such individuals should have 
appropriate medical credentials and/or should be individuals with appropriate scientific/medical 
background who are experienced in performing joint assessments. If the individual does not have

be provided to the study site manager, and their eligibility as joint assessor must be confirmed by 
the PRA or BMS medical monitor before the individual’s participation in  the study as joint 
assessor. 
The Joint Assessor may also perform the enthesitis and dactylitis, as well as assess the Target 
Lesion and conduct the PASI scoring. Training in these assessments will be provided by BMS  or 
PRA and is required in order to perf orm this function.  
Individuals performing the Physician’s Global Assessment of psoriatic arthritis must be a 
physician or other healthcare professional who is competent to perform the assessment.   
Subjects will complete all subject reported questionnaires , which will be considered source 
documents in this study. All subject reported outcomes must be performed prior to all other 
assessments, including phlebotomy, physical exam, joint and skin assessments.  
8.1.2 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Improvement Criteria  
The ACR 20, ACR 50 or ACR 70 definition of improvement is a 20%, 50% or 70% 
improvement, respectively, over baseline in tender and swollen joint counts and a 20%, 50% or 
70% improvement, respectively, in 3 of the 5 remaining core data  set measures ( APPENDIX 5 ): 
 
≥ 20%, 50% or 70% improvement from baseline in the number of tender joints (68 joint count)  
≥ 20%, 50% or 70% improvement from baseline in the number of swollen joints (66 joint count)  
≥ 20%, 50% or 70% improvement from baseline in 3 of the following 5 domains:  
• Subject Global Assessment of disease activity ( APPENDIX 7 ) 
• Physician Global Assessment of psoriatic arthritis   
• Subject global assessment of pain ( APPENDIX 8 ) 
• Health Assessment Questionnaire -Disability Index (HAQ -DI, APPENDIX 6 ) 
• hsCRP 
8.1.3 Health Assessment Questionnaire -Disability Index (HAQ -DI) 
The HAQ -DI is a patient -reported outcome measure that assesses the degree of difficulty a subject 
has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and 
grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity 
category consists of 2  to 3 items. For reach item in the questionnaire the level of activity is cored 
from 0 to 3 with 0 representing “no difficulty”, 1 as “some difficulty”, 2 as much “difficulty”, and 
3 has “unable to do”. Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the 
use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a  more limited functional 
status (see APPENDIX 6 ).

The PASI is a measure of the average erythema, induration thickness and scaling of psoriatic skin 
lesions (each  graded on a 0 to 4 scale), weighted by the area of involvement  (head, arms, trunk to 
groin, and legs to top of buttocks).26 The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from  
0 to 72, with higher PASI scores denoting more severe disease activity. The PASI can also be used 
to assess response to treatment. The PASI 50 is the proportion of subjec ts who experience at least 
a 50% improvement in PASI score as compared with the baseline value. The PASI 75, PASI 90, 
and PASI 100 are defined similarly. BMS will host a training session prior to initiation of the study  
to demonstrate proper PASI scoring. All PASI assessments should be performed by a trained 
assessor experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients (see APPENDIX 9 ). 
8.1.5 Disease Activity Score 28  CRP  
A Disease Activity Score (DAS) can be used to assess patients’ PsA disease activity, to 
determine whether it is under control , and if any treatment adjustments are required. It can also 
assist in establishing a target score to aim for, to help inform treatment decisions , and optimize 
disease management.   
DAS 28 CRP is a composite outcome measure that assesses:   
• How many joints in the hands  (including  metacarpophalangeal and proximal 
interphalangeal joints , but excluding distal interphalangeal joints) , wrists, elbows, 
shoulders, and knees are swollen and/or tender over a total of 28  
• CRP in the blood to measure the degree of inflammation  
• Subject Global Assessment of disease activity ( APPENDIX 7 ) 
The results are combined to produce the DAS 28 CRP score, which correlates with the exte nt of 
disease activity:  
•    < 2.6: Disease remission  
•    2.6 – 3.2: Low disease activity  
•    3.2 – 5.1: Moderate disease activity  
•    >5.1: High disease activity  
8.1.6 Dactylitis  
The number of digits in hands and feet with dactylitis will be counted by a blinded assessor.  The 
Leads Dactyli tis Index (LDI) Basic is a quantitative measurement of dactylitis in the 20 digits 
using a dactylometer. The circumference of the affected and contralateral digits, and tenderness of 
the affected digits are measured to ge nerate a total score. A higher score indicates worse dactylitis 
and is based on the current evaluation. Training will be provided so dactylitis will be evaluated in 
a consistent manner throughout the study.77

The number of sites with enthesitis will be evaluated by a blind ed assessor using the 
Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Enthesitis index and t he Leeds 
Enthesitis index (LEI).  
The SPARCC Enthesitis Index has a 0 to 16 score that is derived from the evaluation of 8 locations: 
the greater trochanter (R/L), quadriceps tendon insertion into the patella (R/L), patellar ligament 
insertion into the patella and tibial tuberosity (R/L), Achilles tendon insertion (R/L), plantar fascia 
insertion (R/L), medial and lateral epicondyles (R/L), and the supraspinatus insertion (R/L). A 
higher count indicates a higher enthesitis burden based on the current evaluation. It has been 
validated in anky losing spondylitis and correlates well with the LDI.78 
The LEI was developed specifically for PsA. An overall score of 0  to 6 is derived from the presence 
or absence of tenderness at 6 entheseal sites (right and left: lateral epicondyle, medial femoral 
condyle, and Achilles tendon insertion) at the time of evaluation. A higher count indicates a greater 
enthesitis burden .79 
8.1.8 Physicians Global  Assessment -Fingernails (PGA -F) 
In this assessment, the overall condition of the fingernails is rated on a 5 -point scale: 
0 = clear, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe  
The Physician’s Global Assessment – fingernails (PGA -F) will be performed only in subjects with 
psoriatic fingernail involvement to assess severity and subsequent improvement. An example is 
provided in APPENDIX 10 . The PGA -F should be performed by a n appropriately trained assessor  
experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients . 
8.1.9 Minimal Disease Activity (MDA)  and Very Low Disease Activity (VLDA)  
Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response is where an MDA responder is defined as a subject 
fulfilling 5 of 7 of the following outcomes:  
• tender joint count ≤ 1  
• swollen joint count ≤ 1  
• PASI ≤ 1 or body surface area ( BSA) ≤ 3% 
• Subject Global Assessment of pain ≤ 15 (APPENDIX 8 )  
• Subject Global Assessment of disease activity ≤ 20 (APPENDIX 7 ) 
• HAQ-DI ≤ 0.5 
• Tender entheseal points ≤ 1  
Very low disease activity (VLDA) response is where a VLDA responder is defined as a subject 
fulfilling all 7 of 7 of the MDA outcomes.

8.1.11 Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis Score  
The Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis Score  (DAPSA) is a composite measure to assess 
peripheral joint involvement that is based upon num erical summation of 5 variables of disease 
activity: tender/painful joint count, swollen joint count, Subject Global Assessment of disease 
activity (APPENDIX 7 ), Subject Global Assessment of pain (APPENDIX 8 ), and CRP .  
8.1.12 PsA Response Criteria (PsARC)  
The Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria  (PsARC) consists of 4 measurements: tender/painful 
joint count, swollen joint count, Physician Global Assessment of psoriatic arthritis , and Subject 
Global Assessment of pain ≤ 15 (APPENDIX 8 ). 
In order to be classified as a PsARC responder, subjects must achieve improvement in 2 of 4 
measures, one of which must be joint pain or swelling, without worsening in any measure.

8.1.15 Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System -Fatigue 
(PROMIS -FATIGUE ) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue)  
The Patient -Reported Outcome Measures Information System -Fatigue (PROMIS-Fatigue) and 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue) instrument s evaluate 
a range of self -reported symptoms over the past week, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness 
to an overwhelmin g, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one’s 
ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles . Fatigue is divided 
into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and t he impact of fatigue on 
physical, mental, and social activities. The first 13 questions of the PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire 
comprise the FACIT -Fatigue questionnaire.  
The PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire is not yet available in all languages and will be administered 
at sites where it is available in the local language. In countries where the PROMIS -Fatigue 
questionnaire is not available in the local language, sites will adm inister the FACIT -Fatigue 
questionnaire to start the protocol. Once the PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire is available in the 
local language, and with approval from the ethics committee, any newly enrolled subjects will 
complete the PROMIS -Fatigue questionnaire . Subjects who were administered the FACIT -Fatigue 
at Day 1 will continue to be administered the FACIT -Fatigue throughout the study. The PROMIS -
Fatigue Short Form 13a (FACIT -Fatigue), along with 5 supplemental fatigue items from the 
PROMIS item bank, is pr ovided in APPENDIX 13 .  
8.1.16 Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ)  
The Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) is a 25 -item self-report that measures the on -the-job 
impact of  chronic health conditions and treatment over the past 2 weeks. It focuses on assessing 
limitations while performing specific job demands from the following 4 domains:  
1) Time management: difficulty with handling time and scheduling demands (5  items) 
2) Physical demands: ability to perform job tasks that involve bodily strength,  
movement, endurance, coordination, and flexibility (6  items) 
3) Mental-interpersonal demands: cognitively demanding tasks and on -the-job 
social interactions (9  items) 
4) Output demands:  concerns reduced work productivity (5  items) 
 
The score can be used to calculate a percent of lost work productivity due to a particular disease 
state. The WLQ Short Form will be used in this study . An example is provided in APPENDIX 14 ).

8.1.18 Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3)  
RAPID3 (routine assessment of patient index data 3) is a pooled index of the 3 patient -reported 
ACR Core Data Set measures: function, Subject Global Assessment of pain, and Subject Global 
Assessment  of disease activity . Each of the 3 individual measures is scored 0 to 10, for a total of 
30. Disease severity may be classified on the basis of RAPID3 scores: >12 = high; 6.1 -12 = 
moderate; 3.1 -6 = low; < or =3 = remission. RAPID3 s cores are correlated with the disease activity 
score 28 (DAS 28) in clinical trials and clinical care, and are comparable to DAS 28 scores in the 
capacity to distinguish active from control treatments in clinical trials.80

8.2 Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in APPENDIX 3 . 
AEs will be reported by the subject (or, when ap propriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the subject to 
discontinue before completing the study.  
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in APPENDIX 3 . 
8.2.1 Adverse Events of Interest  
Adverse events of interest (AEIs) are AEs for a particular product or class of products that a 
Sponsor may wi sh to monitor carefully. AEIs may be serious or nonserious. Such events may 
require further investigation to better characterize and understand them. In the BMS -986165 
clinical development program, certain skin -related AEs (eg, acne), infection AEs, and creatine 
kinase (CK) elevation have been identified as potential AEIs; however, there has been no definitive 
assessment on the causal relationship between these events and treatment with BMS -986165. 
Additionally, given a potential association between treatme nt for immune-mediated disease s and 
increased  risk for cancer, malignancy  has been identified  as a potential AEI. Therefore,  additional 
information about certain skin -related AEs, infection AEs, CK elevation , MACE, and malignancy 
may be collected on the CRF in order to better characterize and understand  them.

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  95 8.2.2 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study treatment unti l 
discharge, at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Nonserious AE 
information should also be collected from the start of a placeb o lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. The Reference Safety 
Information in Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 of the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) should be used to 
determine the expectedness of SAEs f or expedited reporting.  
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent, including those thought to be 
associated with protocol -specified procedures and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing.  
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy).  
• Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent wil l be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module.  
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in APPENDIX 3 .  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor or designee within 24  hours 
of updated information being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, 
if the investigator le arns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment 
or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The meth od of evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in APPENDIX 3 . 
8.2.3 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occu rrence of one or more AEs.) 
8.2.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see APPENDIX 3 ). 
• Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious A E page of 
the CRF. Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory 
abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the e vent is 
otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3).

8.2.5 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical r esponsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a product 
under clinical investigation are met.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs ) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of 
Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction (SUSAR) is a subset o f SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.  
8.2.6 Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product administration, the investiga tor must immediately notify PRA Drug 
Safety of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to PRA Drug Safety 
within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures 
described in APPENDIX 3 . 
If the investigator determines  a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of 
study treatment, or re -initiation of study treatment, a discussion between the investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur.  
Protocol-required procedures for study disc ontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject. 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information , must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance F orm. 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study subject should be reported to PRA 
Drug Safety. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information 
from the female partner, the female partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of this information. 
Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
8.2.7 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the AE eCRF page.  
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an AE or SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted

therapy 
If a laboratory test result meets the definition of an AE or SAE, the laboratory test result should be 
reported as an AE or SAE and submitted to PRA Drug Safety, as specified in APPENDIX 3 .  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
8.2.8 Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 8.2 and APPENDIX 3  for reporting 
details). 
Potential DILI is defined as:  
1) ALT or AST elevation > 3 times ULN  
AND 
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),  
AND 
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
8.2.9 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsenin g noted during interim or final physical examinations, ECG, x-ray 
filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should also be 
recorded as a nonserious or SAE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.  
8.3 Overdose  
For this study, taking more than 2 days’ worth  of study treatment  within a 24-hour time period will 
be considered an  overdose.  
In the event of an overdose the investigator should:  
1) Contact the Medical Monitor  immediately  
2) Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory  abnormalities  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject.

imaging (eg, chest  x-ray, chest CT s can) at the screening visit is required if not already performed 
and documented within 6  months of obtaining  written informed consent. A subject must not have 
active signs or symptoms of TB, as judged by the investigator, to be eligible for the  study.  
In addition to a complete PE and medical history to evaluate exposure to TB, all subjects will have 
a screening test, an IGRA (eg, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold) performed centrally. If unable to  obtain 
central laboratory  results, an IGRA test could be obtained locally, after consultation  with the PRA 
Medical Monitor. A subject with an indeterminate IGRA test result must be re -tested for 
confirmation. If the second result is again indeterminate, the subject will be excluded from the 
study. If the second result is positive, the subject should be considered as having LTBI provided 
there are no signs or symptoms of active TB. If the second result is negative, the subject may be 
eligible provided no other exclusion criterion for TB is  met. 
8.4.5 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.  
A central/local laboratory will perform the analyses and will provide reference ranges for these 
tests.

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  105 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size considerations are based on provi ding exposure in a sufficient number of subjects for 
2 dose levels of BMS -986165, 6 mg QD and 12 mg QD , to be able to observe a true dose -response 
trend that is significantly greater than placebo in the primary endpoint of ACR  20 after 16 weeks 
of treatmen t.  
BMS-986165 is expected to provide similar PsA efficacy as observed in current biological trials. 
With this assumption, the expected overall placebo response rate is assumed to be 30% and  
BMS-986165 response rates to be 50% and 55% in the 6 mg QD and 1 2 mg QD doses respectively.  
A total sample size of 60 subjects per arm randomized in a blinded fashion at a 1:1:1 ratio to  
BMS-986165 6 mg QD arm, BMS -986165 12 mg QD arm, and placebo will provide 87.5% power 
in a mixed population to detect a significant dose-response trend compared to placebo for the 
primary endpoint of ACR  20 response at Week 16 using a trend test with α  = 0.05 (1-sided) or 
with α = 0.10 (2 -sided). 
9.2 Populations for Analyses  
For purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets will be used in this trial:  
Population  Description  
Enrolled Population  All subjects who sign informed consent.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  All randomized subjects who are dispensed study drug. Following 
the intent-to-treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to 
the treatment assigned at randomization. The FAS will be the 
primary efficacy analysis population. This is the same as the 
intent-to-treat population.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS)  A subset of the FAS who are compliant with the study treatm ent 
(compliance criteria will be defined in the SAP) and who do not 
have any important protocol deviations that may impact the 
primary efficacy endpoint assessments. The PPS will be a 
supportive efficacy analysis population.  
Safety Set (All Treated)  All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
double-blind study treatment. Subjects will be analyzed according 
to treatment received.

9.4 Statistical Analyses  
A description of the subject population will be included in a statistical output report, including 
subgroups of age, gender , and race. 
9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses  
Categorical data will be summarized as frequenc y counts and percentages. Continuous data will 
be summarized using n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum unless 
otherwise specified. Efficacy data will be primarily summarized using the FAS population unless 
otherwise stated. Variables will be summarized for all visits in which the variable is assessed. 
Complete details of the planned analyses will be documented in the SAP and finalized before 
database lock.  
During the first 16 weeks of treatment, data will be presented for the following treatments:  
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD  
• BMS-986165 12 mg QD

9.4.1.1 Primary Endpoint Analyses  
The primary efficacy analysis model for binary endpoints (responder/non -responder) will use a 
logistic regression model to assess whether there is a dose -response trend between ACR  20 
response and dose level. The model will include dose level (0, 6, 12) as a continuous variable, and 
the following covariates: TNFi use (experienced/naïve) and body weight (≥ 90 kg and < 90 kg) in

provided.  
9.4.1.1.1  Imputation Methods for Primary Endpoint  
The estimand of interest is to assess the dose -response of multiple doses of BMS -986165 on 
subject response to ACR 20 criteria at Week 16 for all rand omized subjects receiving at least one 
dose of study treatment. Occurrence of intercurrent events such as:  
• Subjects who discontinue the treatment or study early (ie , prior to Week 16)  
• Start a protocol prohibited medication/therapy  
• Subjects who are lost to follow-up 
• Subjects who otherwise have missing endpoint data at or prior to Week 16  will use the 
“Composite Strategy” as defined in ICH E9 R1 addendum and will be considered as a 
measure of non -response to treatment. Non -responder imputation (NRI) will be used for 
binary endpoints for the above intercurrent events  
9.4.1.2 Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Endpoint  
The following strategies for addressing intercurrent events will be used in sensitivity analyses of 
the primary efficacy endpoint:  
1. While on Treatment Strategy – the last observation while the subject was on blinded 
treatment will be considered as their Week 16 value. This is essentially the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) imputation methodology.  
2. For subjects with an intercurrent event at Week 16 , “While on Treatment” strategy will be 
used for placebo subjects and “Composite” strategy will be used for BMS -986165 subjects. 
Therefore, placebo subjects with an intercurrent event will be imputed using the LOCF 
method and BMS -986165 subjects will be im puted using the NRI method in this analysis.  
Furthermore, tipping point analysis may be performed to assess the robustness of the primary 
imputation method. The goal of this analysis is to identify assumptions about the missing data 
under which the conclus ions change. Further details of this procedure may be described in the 
SAP. 
9.4.1.2.1  Supportive Analyses for the Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will also be analyzed for the PPS using the analysis described in 
Section 9.4.1.1. 
9.4.1.2.2  Subgroup Analyses for the Primary Endpoint  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint for the FAS using the 
analysis model described in Section 9.4.1.1 as well as the imputation method described in  
Section 9.4.1.1.1. Subgroups will not be further st ratified based on the factors used for 
randomization. Subgroups that may be  evaluated include the following:

In addition, additional subgroups defined for descriptive summaries will be specified in the SAP. 
9.4.1.3 Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
The secondary endpoint of PASI 75 response at Week 16 will be assessed in a dose-response 
analysis. The binary endpoint (responder/non -responder) will use a logistic regression analysis 
similar to the primary analysis.  
The secondary  continuous endpoints will be assessed at Week 16 using dose -response linear 
regression analysis. The change from baseline score will be calculated at Week  16 and analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Dose level (0, 6, 12) will be assessed in the model as 
a continuous variable and the following covariates as fixed effects: TNFi use (experienced/naïve) 
and body weight (< 90 kg and ≥ 90 kg). The baseline value will be added into the model as a 
covariate. Treatment differences based on least -squares (LS) means and the corresponding 2 -sided 
95% CIs will be provided . 
9.4.1.3.1  Imputation Methods for Secondary Endpoints  
Similar strategies for addressing intercurrent events will be used for binary secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  
For continuous secondary efficacy e ndpoints, the “Composite” and “While on Treatment” 
strategies will be used to address specific intercurrent events. For subjects who discontinue study 
treatment and/or study due to:  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Adverse events  
or who start a protocol prohibited medicat ion/therapy, the baseline observation will be used as the 
subject’s Week 16 value. For all other intercurrent events, the last valid observation while on 
treatment will be used as the Week 16 value.

Statistical analysis of secondary endpoints will be performed in a hierarchical fashion. In order to 
preserve the overall Type I error rate, a fixed -sequence testing method will be implemented. 
Testing of secondary endpoints will occur sequential ly and may only proceed to the next secondary 
endpoint if the null hypothesis is rejected at alpha = 0. 10 (2-sided) for the prior endpoint showing 
a positive dose -response in that endpoint. If an endpoint fails at any step, then all subsequent 
p-values wil l be considered nominal.  
Secondary Family – Secondary endpoints will be tested for a positive dose -response trend  in the 
following order : 
a. Change from baseline in HAQ -DI score at Week 16  
b. PASI 75 response at Week 16  
c. Change from baseline in SF -36 PCS score at Week 16  
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for testing of additional endpoints. Nominal p -values will 
be provided as descriptive statistics.  
9.4.2 Safety Analyses  
Safety data will be analyzed for AEs, SAEs, laboratory analytes, physical exam, vita l signs, and 
ECGs. Safety will be summarized using the Safety population. Categorical data will be 
summarized as frequency counts and percentages. Continuous data will be summarized using n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum unless oth erwise specified. Safety 
data for Part A and B will be summarized separately.  
During the first 16 weeks of treatment, data will be presented for the following treatments:  
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD  
• BMS-986165 12 mg QD  
• Placebo 
After Week 16, subjects continuing in Part B of the study will have their data presented depending 
on MDA response in Part A, as follows : 
• BMS-986165 6 mg QD → BMS -986165 6 mg QD

The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by loc al health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects.  
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opinion(s) the dev iation or change will be submitted, as 
soon as possible to:  
• IRB/IEC for  
• Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by local regulations (per national requirements)  
 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to BMS.  
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the subject: 
(1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC( s) for review and 
approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects pri or to enrollment.  
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
Investigators and sub -Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financi al interests during the course of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regardin g clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and  other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate.  
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form which will include all elements requ ired by ICH, GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood.  
• Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.  
• Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
• Obtain the IRB/IEC’s writt en approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially g iven by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or her 
informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject. 
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representa tive or legal guardian, 
of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the subject's willingness 
to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.  
The consent form must also include a statement that B MS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records.  
Subjects unable to give their written consent (e.g., stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative . The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit w ish of a subject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing information to refuse 
participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time should be considered by 
the investigat or. 
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accura te case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consist ent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.  
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs will be 
prepared for all data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and paper Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively. If 
electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the p rivacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs.  
The completed CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvestigator and who is delegated this task on the 
Delegation of Authority Form. Subinvestigators in Japan may not be deleg ated the CRF approval 
task.  For electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the 
electronic data capture tool. The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of 
the changes and corrections.  
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet Sponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the electronic data capture tool using the unique user account 
provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or re assigned to other 
individuals  
MONITORING  
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to 
determine a schedule of on -site visits for targeted review of study records.  
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity. On site they will review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study w ith the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source 
documents:  
In addition, the study may be evaluated by Sponsor or designee internal auditors and government 
inspectors w ho must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse Event Definition:  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study drug and 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment .  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug.  
Events Meeting the AE Defin ition 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or results 
from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically s ignificant in the medical and 
scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or other safety assessments 
should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis 
is known, the reported term sho uld be updated to be the diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention 
or a concomit ant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the investigator), 
should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of seque lae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term.   
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward me dical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital).  
 
DEFINITION OF SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.

BMS-986165 TYK2 Inhibitor  
23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  137 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious Adverse Event Definition: Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death  
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see note 
below) 
Note: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening even t) 
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the 
study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies to 
oncology proto cols)  
Results in persistent or significant disability or permanent damage  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalizatio n but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples 
of such events include, but  are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization. Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical ev ent (see Section 8.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI).  
 
Pregnancy and potential DILI must follow the same transmission timing and processes to BMS as 
used for SAEs (see Section 8.2.5 for reporting pregnan cies). 
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  138 EVALUATING AE s AND SAE s 
Assessment of Intensity  
The intensity of AEs is determined by a physician and will use the following levels:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort, and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient  discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility of a relationship” conveys 
that there are facts, evidences, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship rather 
than a relationship cannot be ruled out.   
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationshi p of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the inve stigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if n ew 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 
24 hours to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial 
SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization meth ods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of am enorrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level > 40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause.  
 
Note: Females tr eated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a 
physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. 
The duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should 
use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels.  
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week m inimum for oral products  
 
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.  
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE SUBJECTS  OF CHILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL  
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below, in conjunction with the required 
restrictions in Inclusion Criterion Sec 5.1 (3d) of the protocol, is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure plus 30 days. As such, in Part A WOCBP must

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  141 agree to follow instructions for methods of contraception for 33 days post -treatment completion , 
and in Part B WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for methods of contraception for 190 days 
post-treatment completion.  
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods.  
Additionally, alternative and/or additional contr aception methods may be required based on 
background DMARDS the subject may be taking (eg, methotrexate, leflunomide, etc.)  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationb  
− oral  
− intravaginal  
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb  
− oral  
− injectable  
Highly Effective  Methods That Are User Independent   
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation b 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective me thod of contraception should be used.  
• Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, 
as specified in Section 2.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP subjects chooses to forego complete abstinence

23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  142 NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use 
should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
subjects participating in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may b e susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which 
may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible 
only when there is sufficient evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter 
hormonal  exposures such that contraception would be ineffective or result in increased 
exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods of 
contraception should be utilized.  
c Intrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing  systems are acceptable methods of 
contraception in the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures 
from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness  
 
Less Than Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are Use r Dependent  
Failure rate of >1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide.  Male and female condoms cannot be 
used simultaneously  
• Diaphragm with spermicide  
• Cervical cap with spermicide  
• Vaginal Sponge with spermicide  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action  
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception  
• Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)  
• Withdraw al (coitus interruptus).  
• Spermicide only  
• Lactation amenorrhea method (LAM)  
 
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR MALE SUBJECTS  WITH PARTNER(S) OF 
CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL.  
Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree 
to the following during the treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.  
• Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study a nd the need to 
comply with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator.  
• Male subjects are required to use a condom for study duration and for 93 days post-treatment 
completion in Part A and 250 days post -treatment completion in Part B.  
• Female partners of males participating in the study to consider use of effective methods of 
contraception for 93 days after the end of treatment in the male subject in Part A and 250 days 
after the end of treatment in the male subject in Part  B.

BMS-986165 TYK2 Inhibitor  
23 Septembe r 2019, v2.0, Final, Approved  BMS Confidential  166 PsAID12 SCORING AND CALCULATION RULES  
 
The PsAID is calculated based on 12 Numerical rating scales (NRS) questions. Each 
NRS is assessed as a number between 0 and 10.  
 
Calculation  
 
PsAID final value =  
(PsAID1 (pain) NRS value 
(range 0-10) x 3) 
+ (PsAID2 (fatigue) NRS value (range 0 -10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID3 (skin) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 2) 
+ (PsAID4 (Work and/or leisure activities) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 2) 
+ (PsAID5 (function) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 2) 
+ (PsAID6 (discomfort) NRS va lue (range 0 -10)  x 2) 
+ (PsAID7 (sleep) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 2) 
+ (PsAID8 (coping) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 1) 
+ (PsAID9 (anxiety) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 1) 
+ (PsAID10 (embarrassment) NRS value (range 0 -10)  x 1) 
+ (PsAID11 (social life) NRS valu e (range 0 -10)  x 1) 
+ (PsAID12 (depression) NRS value (range 0 -
10) x 1) The total is divided by 20.  
Thus, the range of the final PsAID value is 0 -10 where higher figures indicate worse status.  
 
Missing data imputation  
 
If one of the 12 NRS values composing the PsAID is missing, the imputation is as 
follows: calculate the mean value of the 11 other (non -missing) NRS (range, 0 -10) 
impute this value for the missing NRS  
Then, calculate the PsAID as explained above.  
 
If 2 or more of the NRS are missing,  the PsAID is considered as missing value (no imputation).

Study Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Serlopitant for the Treatment of Pruritus in Adults 
and Adolescents with a History of Atopic Dermatitis  (ATOMIK)  
Protocol Number:  MTI-103 
Sponsor:  Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  
Development Phase:  Phase 2 
Study Objectives:  Primary objective : To assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of 
pruritus in adults and adolescents with a history of atopic dermatitis.  
Secondary objectives:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of 
serlopitant in adults and adolescents with a history of atopic dermatitis . 
• To assess the psychometric properties of Worst -Itch Numeric Rating 
Scale ( WI-NRS ). 
Study Design:  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in 
adults and adolescents with a history of atopic dermatitis. Subjects who meet the 
study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses 
of serlopitant 1 mg, 5  mg, or placebo for 6 weeks. The study will be conducted 
at approximately 40 study sites.  
The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 
12 weeks:  
• Screening period: 2 weeks  
• Treatment period: 6 weeks  
• Follow -up period: 4 weeks  
During the screen ing period, subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will 
have their baseline symptom scores established. Subjects must be willing and 
able to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) within a consistent timeframe on a 
daily basis , to wear actigraphy devices during sleep,  and to comply with 
restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies for the duration of the study.  
At the baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 
serlopitant 1 mg, serlopitant 5 mg, or placebo. Subjects w ill take a loading dose 
(3 tablets taken orally) at bedtime on the first day of the treatment period (Study 
Day 1). Starting on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day taken 
orally at bedtime. Subjects will be instructed to take all doses at approximately 
the same time each day and no sooner than 2 hours before or after a meal.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed during  Week 6 of treatment .  
After completion of the 6- week treatment period, all subjects will enter a 4 -week 
follow -up per iod. Subjects who discontinue treatment early at any time during 
the treatment period will have an Early Treatment Discontinuation  (ETD) visit 
within 7 days after their last dose of study drug in addition to a follow -up visit .

following study drug exposure  
• Plasma concentrations of serlopitant and metabolites  
Exploratory Endpoints:  Exploratory endpoints include the following : 
• Change in Investigators’ Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis  
severity  (IGA -AD) 
• Change in s leep efficiency  
• Change in m ean activity during the sleep period  
Decision Rule and 
Sample Size  A stepdown procedure will be used to control for multiplicity of dose groups 
with testing starting with the 5  mg group and then proceeding to the 1  mg group.  
A gatekeeper procedure within dosing group will be used for the key secondary 
endpoints.  
The sample size of 150 per group has been selected to achieve 90% power for 
the pairwise tests  with a 5% one -sided alpha level  assuming a treatment effect 
(placebo  change from baseline  - serlopitant change from baseline) of -1 and a 
standard deviation of 2.9. 
Statistical Methods:  Efficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat philosophy.  The primary 
efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that will include all 
randomized and treated subjects.  Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment 
group to which they are randomized.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) model controlling for the stratification factors. A main effects model 
with an interaction term (treatment b y stratification factors) and a Type II 
hypothesis will be used. Missing data imputation will be used for subjects who 
fail to complete the eDiary at Week 6 or receive excluded therapy.  The primary 
endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by  treatment group and 
study week . These summary statistics will include estimates of the treatment 
differences and associated confidence interval.  
Testing , using an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) model  or Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH)  test of the key seconda ry endpoints will also be employed.  
Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be 
tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ 
class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more t han one AE that 
was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be 
counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An 
overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 9 AEs, AE s by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be 
presented.  
Clinical safety laboratory values  will be measured by a central laboratory. 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be 
tabulated for laboratory results by scheduled visit. Graphs of laboratory values 
over time will also be produced.   
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at 
any post -baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
laboratory values will be tabulated. 
The observed vital signs and ECG data and change from baseline for each 
measurement day will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Study Sites:  Approximately 40 study sites 
Planned Dates of Study:  Oct 2016- Dec 2017  
Expected Duration of 
Subject’s Participation  Approximately 12 weeks: 2 weeks of screening, 6 weeks of treatment, and a 
follow -up period of 4 weeks.  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

1.1 Atopic D ermatitis  and Pruritus  
Atopic dermatitis (AD, atopic eczema, eczema) is an inflammatory, chronically relapsing and 
intensely pruritic skin disease occurring often in families with atopic diseases (AD, asthma, 
and/or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis) .3 It is frequently referred to as “the itch that rashes ,”4 
highlighting the central role that pruritus plays in AD pathology. Pruritus is the “cardinal 
symptom” in AD5 and it has been characterized as the “ most distressing ” symptom of AD.6 
Mollanazar et al7 describe a prevalence of 58%-91 % of c hronic pruritus in patients with AD. 
Overall, pruritus is responsible for much of the disease burden borne by patients and their 
families .1 
1.2 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor  
The itch/scratch cycle is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis  and is a major factor in perpetuating 
the disease.6 The itch in atopic dermatitis  often begins without visible lesions8,9  and has been 
shown to involve altered sensory responses to exogenous and endogenous stimuli10,11 as well 
as modifications in sensory innervation of involved skin, including increased density of 
substance P -positive nerve fibers .12  
Substance P  (SP) is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, 
a group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B.13 SP has been implicated in a 
number of biological functions, both physiological and pathophysiological, including pruritus 
perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory responses.14,15,16 The 
role of SP in pruritic conditions has been supported by evidence of increased s erum levels in 
atopic dermatitis ,17 as well as other pruritic diseases such as cholestatic pruritus ,18 and 
prurigo nodularis.19 
The biological actions of SP are mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist  of seven 
hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G- proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have 
been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, and neurokinin-3 receptors.20 The 
neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK 1-R) in particular has been studied in great detail. NK 1-R is the 
primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple ce ll types, include 
central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells.  
NK 1-R stimulation  has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus  perception .21 
Inhibition of this pathway results in decreased pruritus  and scratching reflexes in animal 
models.22 More importantly, a commercially available NK 1-R antagonist (aprepitant, 
Emend) has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients  with chronic pruritus due 
to etiologies such as cutaneous T- cell lymphoma23,24,25 and erlotinib-induced pruritus .26,27 
Additionally, in a study of 20 patients  with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with 
aprepitant , 16/20 patients  (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity .28

Version 3.0  Page 16 1.3 Serlopitant  
1.3.1 Serlopitant Background 
Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK 1-R antagonist that is administered orally 
and metabolized by CYP3A4, with a plasma half- life of 70 -80 hours. It binds with high 
affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP 
binding with a half- maximal inhibition conce ntration (IC 50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent 
functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. 
Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic 
toxicology and carcinogenicity studies.  
In humans, serlopitant has been evaluated in over 850 subjects across thirteen Phase 1 studies 
and three completed Phase 2 studies. Escalating single doses up to 400 mg have been well 
tolerated in healthy young males. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a day fo r 4 weeks have been 
well tolerated in healthy young males , and a single (loading) dose of 15 mg followed by daily 
doses of 5 mg for 2  weeks have been well tolerated in elderly males and females.  Forty-one 
(41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily (bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 
1 year. Plasma concentrations  of serlopitant appea r to increas e in a dose-proportional 
fashion in both young males  and elderly  subjects ( males and females ). Peak plasma 
concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 4 hours in both young and elder ly 
subjects . 
In the Phase 1 studies, no drug- related serious adverse events  (SAE s) were observed . The 
most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) in subjects who received serlopitant in the 
Phase 1 studies w ere headache (15%), diarrhea (5%), dizziness (5%), drowsiness (4%), 
nausea (4%), somnolence (3%), abdominal discomfort (3%), loose stools (3%), cough (3%), 
cold (3%) sore throat (3%) and tiredness (2%). Laboratory abnormalities noted were transient 
microsc opic hematuria (4%) and mild transient elevation of liver function tests (2 to < 3 fold 
increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2%).  
In a Phase 2 study examining treatment of overactive bladder (Study P003), the most 
common clinical AEs across all treatment groups were headache (5.7%), diarrhea (5.2%), 
urinary tract infection (4.7%), dry mouth (4.5%), nasopharyngitis (4.5%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (4.3%), fatigue (4.1%), dizziness (3.8%), back pain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%), 
and peripheral edema (2.2%). 
1.3.2 Serlopitant in Chronic Pruritus  
Serlopitant has been evaluated in a Phase 2 study of subjects  with chronic pruritus 
(TCP -101). A Phase 2 study in subjects  with prurigo nodularis (TCP-102) has been 
conducted i n Germany ; the clinical study report is under preparation. 
TCP-101 
Study design: a total of 257 adult subjects  18-65 years of age with chronic pruritus were 
randomized to receive one of 4 dose groups: placebo (64 subjects), serlopitant 0.25 mg 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 17 (64 subjects ), serlopitant 1 mg (65 subjects), and serlopitant 5 mg (64 subjects ). Subjects  
received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 
6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measured on a visual anal og 
scale (VAS), summarized as a percentage change from baseline.  
Efficacy results: The mean percent decreases from baseline VAS scores were larger in the 
active-treatment groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. The 
largest pairwise differences of least squares means versus placebo occurred in the serlopitant 
1 mg group (p -value < 0.05 at study Weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10). Similar  results were seen in  
the serlopitant 5 mg group for the least squares mean differences versus placeb o 
(p-value < 0.05 at study Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10).  
Safety results: Treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs) were reported in 25.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group and in 31.3%, 36.9%, and 37.5% of subjects in the serlopitant 
0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg groups, respectively. “Infections and Infestations” was the system 
organ class ( SOC ) with the highest incidence of TEAEs.  
Overall, headache was the most commonly -reported TEAE, reported in 6.3% of subjects in 
the placebo group and in 1.6%, 4.6%, and 1.6% of subjects in the serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, 
and 5 mg groups, respectively. Somnolence and diarrhea were the TEAEs with the highest 
overall incidence in the active-treatment groups. Somnolence was reported in 1.6% of 
subjects in the placebo group and in 1.6%, 4.6%, and 4.7% of s ubjects in the serlopitant 
0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg groups, respectively. Diarrhea occurred in 1.6% of subjects in the 
placebo group and in 0%, 6.2%, and 3.1% of subjects in the serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 
5 mg groups, respectively. 
Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two severe TEAEs were reported: 
hypothyroidism in 1 subject in the serlopitant 0.25 mg group and peripheral neuropathy in 
1 subject in the serlopitant 5 mg group. Both of thes e events were considered not related to 
study treatment.  
Treatment -related TEAEs were reported in 7.9% of subjects in the placebo group and in 
10.9%, 13.8%, and 12.5% of subjects in the serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg groups, 
respectively. “Nervous systems disorders” was the SOC with the highest incidence of 
treatment -related events.  
One SAE (spontaneous abortion) occurred in a subject in the serlopitant group. This event 
was considered not related to study treatment. Six  subjects (3 in the placebo group, 1 in the 
serlopitant 1 mg group, and 2 in the serlopitant 5 mg group) discontinued the study as a result 
of a TEAE. Two of these subjects had events considered not related to study treatment 
(pruritus in 2 subjects) and 3 subjects had events considere d to be treatment related 
(headache in 1 subject; diarrhea in 1 subject; and symptoms of a panic attack in 1 subject).  
There was no evidence of meaningful trends in laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital 
signs. Two subjects had a clinically signific ant change in an electrocardiogram ( ECG ). One  
subject in the serlopitant 0.25 mg group had a normal ECG at screening and Visit 4 but at 
Visit 6 was noted to have supraventricular extrasystoles and ectopic atrial rhythm. These 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 18 changes were considered mild and possibly due to study drug but required no treatment. One  
subject in the serlopitant 5 mg group had first degree AV block at screening, Visit 4 and Visit 
6. Although the ECG interpretation was the same at each time point, the investigator 
considered the on- study findings clinically significant. No treatment was required.  
These results, together with the extensive safety experience with serlopitant to date, the 
scientific rationale for neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK 1-R) inhibition in the treatment of pruritus , 
and the previously published human data with aprepitant, serve to support the evaluation of 
serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of 
pruritus in adults and adolescents with  a history of atopic dermatitis . 
The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults and 
adoles cents with a history of atopic dermatitis  
• To assess the psychometric properties of the Worst -Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS ) 
 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled st udy to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults and adolescents with a 
history of atopic dermatitis . Approximately 450 subjects who meet the study entry criteria 
will be randomized in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 1 mg, 5 mg , or 
placebo for 6 weeks. The study will be conducted at approximately 40 study sites . 
The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 12 weeks:  
• Screening period: 2 weeks  
• Treatment period: 6 weeks  
• Follow-up period: 4 weeks 
 
Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated procedures, including the 
stopping of any  excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the initial Screening visit. During 
the screening  period, subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation  and will have their baseline 
symptom scores established . Subjects  must be willing and able to complete an electronic 
diary (eDiary) within a consistent timeframe  on a daily  basis , to wear actigraphy devices 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 19 during sleep, and to comply with restrictions on allowable therapies for the duration of the 
study. Subjects who meet initial screening requirements will be provided with an electronic 
device for recording eDiary assessments th roughout the study. 
At the baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug 
(serlopitant 1 mg, serlopitant 5 mg, or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets 
taken orally ) at bedtime on the first day of the tre atment period (Study Day 1). Starting on 
Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet  per day taken orally at bedtime. Subjects  will be 
instructed to take all doses at approximately the same time each day and no sooner than 
2 hours before or after a meal.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed during Week 6 
of treatment .  
After completion of the 6- week treatment period,  all subjects will enter a 4 -week follow-up 
period. Subjects who discontinue treatment early at any time during the treatme nt period w ill 
have an Early Treatment Discontinuation  (ETD)  visit within 7 days after their last dose of 
study drug in addition to a follow-up visit. 
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection 
In the TCP-101 study, serlopitant demonstrated superior efficacy compared to pl acebo for the 
treatment of chronic pruritus in a broad population of subjects  (N = 257), including subjects  
with atopic diathesis (i.e. h istory of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and/or allergic rhinitis) . The 
super ior efficacy was observed at multiple timepoints with both the serlopitant 1 mg and 
5 mg doses, but not with the serlopitant 0.25 mg dose . Safety profiles between the three 
serlopitant doses were comparable, and serlopitant was generally well -tolerated  at the doses 
evaluated . 
The current MTI -103 study is d esigned to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus, specifically in patients  with a history of atopic 
dermatitis . Although the TCP-101 study included subjects  with a history of atopic dermatitis , 
the greater number of subjects  in the MTI -103 study will allow for a more in -depth 
evaluation of the efficacy and safety profile of serlopitant in this population. 
As a post- hoc analysis of the TCP -101 study s uggested possible variability in baseline levels 
of pruritus and change over time based on gender and race, in MTI -103 r andomization will 
be stratified by gender (male, female) and race (white, non -white).  
The serlopitant 1 mg and 5  mg doses were selected for this study based on their comparable 
safety and efficacy profiles in the TCP -101 study. The clinical outcomes seen in TCP-101 
support the previously completed human CNS P ET receptor occupancy studies with 
serlopitant, which demon strated higher CNS NK 1-R occupancy levels with once daily doses 
of 1 mg and 5 mg compared to lower doses. Analyses of dosing relative to body weight 
suggest that the doses selected for this study are suitable for body weights 32 kg and up.  
In the complete d serlopitant Phase 2 studies, over 250 subjects  were exposed to serlopitant at 
doses and durations similar to those planned for the MTI -103 study. 41 subjects  were 
exposed for one year. Overall, serlopitant was well tolerated . The results from MTI -103 are 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 20 expected to provide additional data regarding  any potential differences in either efficacy or 
safety between the 1  mg and 5 mg doses.

5.3 Dosing Regimen 
Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally ) at bedtime on the first day of the 
treatment period  (Study Day 1) . Starting on Study Day 2, subjects  will take  one tablet  per day 
taken orally at bedtime . Subjects  will be instructed to take all doses at approximately the 
same time each day  and no sooner than 2 hours before or after a meal . 
5.4 Dose Modification 
No dose modification of study drug will be allowed during this study. 
5.5 Missed or Delayed Doses  
Each dose of study drug after the first dose must be administered once daily at bedtime, no 
sooner than 2 hours before or after a meal . If the bedtime dose is missed, that dose should be 
skipped, and the following dose should be taken at bedtime of the following day. The 
skipped dose will be considered and documented as a missed dose.  
5.6 Study  Drug Discontinuation 
Subjects  will be discontinued from study drug treatment in the following events: 
• The subject experiences a NCI CTCAE Grade 2  or higher treatment emergent AE that is 
assessed as likely related to study drug.  
• The subject receives  treatment with an excluded  therapy or has a clinically significant 
change in dose or frequency of allowed adjunctive therapies (see Section 5.7.3 for 
additional details regarding exceptions) 
• The female subject becomes pregnant or female partner of a male subject becomes 
pregnant or is breastfeeding 
Discontinuation from study drug treatment may  also occur for any of the following reasons: 
• Subject decision to discontinue study drug treatment, or subject decision to withdraw 
consent /assent  from the study 
• Any medical condition that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, 
in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion 
• Discontinuation is deemed to be in the best interest of the subject, in the investigator’s 
and/or Sponsor’s opinion 
 
The S ponsor or designee should be contacted within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of 
any study drug treatment discontinuation. Investigators should make every effort to contact 
the Sponsor or designee before discontinuing study drug treatment , if possible.

Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 26 Subjects who discontinue treatment with study drug prior to completing the treatment period 
will have an ETD  visit within 7 days after their last dose of study drug in addition to a 
follow-up visit. 
5.6.1 Early Termination 
Early termination from the study may occur due to loss to follow-up or withdrawal of 
consent /assent  by the subject. In accordance with legal requirements and International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, every 
subject or his/her legal representative has the right to withdraw from  the study at any time 
and without providing reasons. If a subject is willing to provide a reason for withdrawal, this 
will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). 
5.7 Concomit ant and Excluded Therapies  
Concomitant therapies include any therapies (including over-the-counter medications) used 
by a subject  from  initiation of study drug treatment through the follow-up perio d. A record of 
all medications used will be maintained for each subject  throughout the study. Reported 
information will include a description of the type of drug, treatment period, dosing regimen, 
the route of administration, and drug indication. 
5.7.1 Allowed Therapies 
Subjects using oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, or other maintenance 
therapies that are not Excluded Therapies ( Section 5.7.2)  may continue their use durin g the

5.8 Assignment to Treatment  
5.8.1 Randomization 
Eligible subjects  will be randomized to receive serlopitant 1 mg, 5 mg , or placebo in a 1:1:1  
ratio. Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization will be stratified 
by gender  (male, female) and race (white, non -white) . 
An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization.  
5.8.2 Blinding  
This study will be conducted as a double-blind study with the treatment assignment 
concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees 
of the Sponsor who interact directly with investigative sites. The placebo will be formulated 
to be indistinguishable from the active study product(s). Study materials will be packaged 
and issued in a manner designed to maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel 
involved in the direction and execution of study procedures, study assessments, and 
collection of data. The ran domization code for each subject will be available to the sites  for 
use only in an emergency situation. For details of the procedure for unblinding of individual 
subjects in cases of emergency see Section 7.6.  
5.9 Treatment Compliance  
Records of study drug used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be kept 
during the study. Dosing dates and times  will be recorded. Subjects will be asked to return all 
partially used and empty bottle s to the study site at each visit . The site staff will count and 
record the number of remaining tablets in each returned bottle . The site staff will assess the 
subject’s compliance with dosing by r eviewing the subject’s eDiary  (available in the eDiary  
website) and the number of remaining study drug tablets relative to the number of days since 
the bottle  was dispensed. A subject who has deviated significantly from the once- daily 
dosing regimen will b e counseled. 
6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSM ENTS   
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  is a validated, self -reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It 
uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects  to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 29 scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater 
itch intensity. In this study, both worst itch intensity (WI- NRS) and average itch intensity 
(AI-NRS) during a 24-hour recall period will be captured. Subjects will record their Itch 
NRS scores once daily via eDiary throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up 
periods, as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.2 Static Patient Global Assessment of I tch Severity  
The sPGA is designed to assess overall itch severity. Each subject is asked to rate the 
severity of his/her itchiness in the past 7 days on a 5-point scale as none, mild, moderate, 
severe, and very severe. Higher scores indicate greater itch severity . The sPGA scores will be 
captured  via eDiary as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.3 Patient Global Impression of Change in Itch Severity 
The PGIC in Itch Severity is a single item used to assess the change in overall itch severity  
since the baseline visit. Each subject will rate the change in his/her itch severity on a 7-point 
scale from (very much better) to (very much worse). PGIC scores will be captured via eDiary 
as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.4 ItchyQoL  
ItchyQoL is a validated, pruritus- specific instrument that measures the degree to which 
pruritus affects quality  of life (Q oL).29 This impact is quantified into 3 subscores (symptom, 
function, emotion) and an overall score. A higher score corresponds to a more adverse impact 
on Qo L. Subjects will complete ItchyQoL  as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.5 5-D Pruritus Scale  
The 5 -D Pruritus Scale is a validated, multi- dimensio nal measure of itching that assesses the 
five domains of degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution. Subjects  rate their 
symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. 
Subjects  will complete the 5 -D Pruritus Scale during study visits as outlined in Appendix A.  
6.1.6 Actigraphy 
High -resolution actigraphy is a n objective method for quantifying nocturnal scratching 
events  and sleep -related parameters  using high resolution a ctigraphy devices  on each wrist . 
The device weighs 16g (0.56oz) without the strap, and is made of medical device grade 
housing material. The device is water resistant up to 10 meters, dust-tight, and drop- resistant 
to 0.5m. It is functional for operation be tween 41 and 104 degrees Fahrenh eit (5 and 
40 degrees Celsius ). 
The assessment requires each subject to wear the actigraphy devices, which are the size of a 
medium size wrist watch, on each wrist during sleep , with the option to wear them  during 
waking hours as well . The devices will be programmed and activated prior to being provided 
to subjects. Once received, the subjects can simply put the devices on their wrists and they 
will record  automatically . The devices are returned to the study site where the data are 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 30 downloaded and sent for a nalysis.  Subjects will be permitted to not wear the devices  up to 
three sleep sessions over any seven -day period throughout the study, to allow for cases of 
temporary irritation or discomfort.  
The 3 -D acceleration data (m/sec2) from the actigraphy device i s analyzed with a neural 
network that was developed to discriminate scratching from other nighttime events. The 
algorithm was developed and tested in a study of 24 subjects (6 healthy, 18 with atopic 
dermatitis) who were video recorded for one night in a s leep lab while wearing actigraphy 
devices on each wrist. The video recordings were scored to quantify the time and duration of 
each scratching event. A strong correlation  was shown  (r = 0.98) between the number of 
scratching events per hour measured with t he actigraphy analysis versus the video scoring. In 
contrast, subjective questionnaires completed by the subjects the following morning had a 
poor correlation with the true number of scratching events. For example, the best correlation 
was 0.6 with a VAS . The full description of the algorithm and the study has been submitted 
to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics .30  
Actigraphy measurements will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.7 Investigator s’ Global Assessment of Atopic D ermatitis  Severity  
The IGA -AD is an instrument used to assess the overall severity of atopic dermatitis  at a 
given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 6-point scale ranging 
from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe). The IGA -AD uses clinical characteristics of erythema, 
infiltration, papulation, oozing and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity 
assessment .31 IGA -AD scores will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.2 Safety Parameters  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; 
vital signs; physical examinations; clinical laboratory assessments; ECGs ; pharmacokinetics 
(PK) measurements; and other protocol- specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study drug. 
6.2.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, sitting blood pressure, respiration rate, 
and temperature. Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A  and at unscheduled 
study visits when clinically indicated. Th e subjects’ height and weight will be measured as 
outlined in Appendix A . 
6.2.2 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations will be performed as outlined in Appendix A  and at  unscheduled 
study visits when clinically indicated. A complete physical examination will be performed at 
the initial S creening visit , while subsequent examinations may be abbreviated and targeted to 
changes in disease activity and/or subject s’ symptoms.

7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include exacerbation s of pre -existing illness es that are temporally associated with the 
use of study drug and AE s that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 38 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is considered “serious” if i t results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Important medical event (i.e. an event th at may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or 
Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or 
other hospital department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an 
important medical or life -threatening event), an electiv e surgery planned prior to signing 
consent /assent , admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or 
routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g. routine colonoscopy). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an 
AE (e.g. m ild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g. s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Serio usness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on 
the eCRF.  
7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogr am 
Findings  
Abnormal physical exam findings that are clinically significant  and are identified prior to the 
first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically 
significant abnormal physical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug 
should be recorded as AEs.   
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 39 Only a bnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by the investigator (e.g. require active management or are associated with 
accompanying symptoms/signs ) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF. 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study 
drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the fir st 
dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease  or condition (e.g. el evated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney diseas e), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease ) needs to be recorded on 
the AE eCRF.  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs unless their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes. 
7.1.4 Deaths  
Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent /assent  to the follow-up visit, 
regardless of attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the 
death.  See MTI -103 SAE and Pregnancy Form Completion Instructions for complete 
instructions. 
The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post- mortem findings and/or relevant medical 
reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies  and Contraception Requirements for Males and Fe males  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any female 
who has experienced menarche and is pre- menopausal; a postmenopausal state is defined as 
no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating 
female.  A fertile male is defined as any male who is post -pubertal and not castrated 
(e.g. history of bilateral orchiectomy) or sterilized (i.e. history or vasectomy).  
For the purposes of this  study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on 
Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals:  ICH M3(R2)  dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines32,33,34:  
1. For female subjects:  All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following 
acceptable methods:  
a. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 
b. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 40 c. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may 
include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, 
or transdermal delivery methods.   
i. Progesterone only oral contraceptives are excluded as  a highly effective method, 
as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. 
d. Intrauterine device/system   
e. Exclusive monogamous heterosexual intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) 
or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner  
2. For male su bjects: All fertile male subjects , with sexual partners  who are females of 
childbearing potential,  must use condoms with or without spermicide.   
3. All subjects who are fertile males or females of childbearing potential must also refrain 
from sperm/egg donation starting from first dose of study drug and until 4 weeks after 
last dose of study drug. 
 
Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject , from 
the first study drug administration through the 4- week follow-up visit must be reported 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See MTI -103 SAE and 
Pregnancy Form Completion Instructions  for complete instructions.  
The inves tigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion ) 
may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See 
MTI-103 SAE and Pregnancy Form Completion Instructions for complete in structions.  
7.1.6 Worsening of P ruritus or Atopic D ermatitis   
Pruritus  or atopic dermatitis  should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if considered by the 
investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or worsened beyond the subject ’s 
normal fluctuations during the study. It is important to include a description of the nature of 
the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g. si gnificant atopic dermatitis  
flare in previously uninvolved skin). 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 41 7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting Adve rse Events  
7.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded on source documentation and eCRF at 
the site, in accordance with protocol instructions.  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration  through the 
follow-up visit. After the 4- week follow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug-
related should be reported. 
After informed consent /assent , but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by 
the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. 
SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the SAE form, not on the AE form of the eCRF. Subjects  who 
undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs 
recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject  contact through the 
follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized 
study personnel, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, 
and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator wil l make 
an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 
7.2.3 Assessment of Severity 
All AE s entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0335 to describe the 
maximum intensity of the AE .  
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the invest igator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in T able 1.

disabling (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading cr iteria)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE   
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not 
in the NCI CTCAE listing.  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ w ithin the alternate description  of the grade.  
b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0335 
 
Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for 
the definition of an SAE. 
The Sponsor or designee should be notified within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of 
any Grade 3 or higher AE whenever possible. 
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality 
The i nvestigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AE s (serious and 
non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. 
Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: 
• Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely 
factors than the study drug. 
• Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due 
to factors other than the study drug. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 43 7.3 Follow- up of A dverse E vents and Serious A dverse E vents 
The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution 
until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject  is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined 
that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 
7.4 Reporting Serious A dverse E vents to the Sponsor and Institutional 
Review Board or Ethics Committee  
The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report cer tain SAEs to regulatory authorities 
related to investigational drugs in clinical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified 
within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol 
definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug.  
An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after 
informed consent /assent  should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator 
learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the 
SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the 
Sponsor. 
Please see the MTI -103 SAE and Pregnancy Form Report Completion Instructions for safety 
reporting instructions.  
The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of 
SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)  or Ethics Committee (EC) . This may include 
initial or follow -up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 
7.5 Reporting Serious A dverse E vents to Regulatory Authorities and Study 
Investigators 
The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected 
related AE s to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A 
Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as 
required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC 
of any expedited SAE reports submitte d to regulatory authorities.  All investigators 
participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE 
reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities. 
7.6 Emergency Unblinding  
The investigator will immediate ly notify the Sponsor or the medical monitor to discuss the 
need for unblinding any subject via IWRS. There is no specific antidote for serlopitant and 
usual supportive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency.  
8 STATISTICAL METHO DS  
Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics  by treatment group and visit. For 
continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n, mean, standard 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 44 deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and  percentages 
will be used. 
Baseline for measures other than the eD iary and actigraphy based measures, will be the last 
recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For Itch NRS measures, baseline will be the 
average result measured over 7 days prior to treatment. Additionally, the Itch NRS measures 
will be summarized in one week intervals by taking the average result recorded within the 
associated week.  
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize  
This study contains two active dosing arms. A stepdown procedure will be used to control for 
multiplicity.  This procedure will start by testing the primary endpoint for the 5 mg treatment 
group and then proceed to the 1 mg group should statistical significance ( one-sided p- values 
< 0.05) be reached for the 5 mg vs placebo comparison.  
Statistical significance for the key secondary endpoints will be dependent upon statistical 
significance being reached for the primary endpoint at the given dose level (i.e. a gatekeeper 
within dose arm will be used for the secondary endpoints). As there are multiple secondary 
endpoints a stepdown procedure will be used starting with the WI- NRS endpoint and then the 
ItchyQoL.  
If the one- sided p -values are additionally less than 2.5%, then the serlopitant- based regimen 
will have met the generally accepted level of evidence required to demonstrate efficacy.   
The target sample size of 450 randomized and dosed subjects (150 per group) has been 
determine based upon a 1:1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups, an assumed common 
treatment effect for the 1  mg and 5 mg arms, and a 5% one-sided alpha level. One -hundred 
and fifty subjects per group results in  90% power for each test individually assuming a 
treatment effect (placebo change from baseline - serlopitant change from baseline) of -1 and 
a standard deviation of 2.9.  
The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 1336 and use a t- test. The primary 
analysis will control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power 
estimate will under -estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction 
resulting from stratification into account .37 
8.2 Handling of M issing D ata and Excluded Therapy Use  
For summary statistics results will generally be reported based upon observed data. Should a 
determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre -treatment) be required for AE s or 
concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a  partial date , the 
event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are 
available indicate this is not possible . 
If a subject fail s to complete their eD iary for a week or more , the Itch NRS endpoints, 
including the primary endpoint, will be missing for that week. In this case , their Itch NRS 
change from baseline value will be imputed. This approach uses the subject’s last week with 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 45 data. From that point forward their trajectory will be imputed based upon the trajectory of 
their treatment group.  
The imputation  approach first determines the average change for each week  for each 
treatment group . The difference in the weekly measures between weeks n -1 and n will be 
considered the change for Week n. These weekly change measure will be used to ‘fill in’ the 
missing weeks between the last completed week and Week 6.  
For subjects who receive excluded therapy  or with clinically significant changes in allowed 
adjunctive therapies as outlined in Section 5.7.3, their Itch NRS results after the use of this 
therapy will be imputed using the same algorithm as indicated above . Hence, a placebo 
subject who receives excluded therapy in Week 4 will have their Week 6 WI -NRS change 
from baseline imputed as ∆ 4+∆P(4-6), where ∆ 4 is the observed change from baseline result for 
the subject up to Week 4 and ∆ P(4-6) is the placebo change from Week 4 to 6 (i.e. the average 
placebo decrease from Week 4 to 6). 
As a sensitivity analysis, a similar approach will be used where the imputation step uses 
multiple imputation methodology.  
8.3 Analysis Population s  
The primary efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that  will include all 
randomized and treat ed subjects . Following the intent- to-treat philosophy, s ubjects  will be 
analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomiz ed.  
The primary safety population will be all treated subjects . For safety analyses, subjects  will 
be classified based upon the treatment received.   
8.4 Subject Disposition  
An accounting of all randomiz ed subjects  by disposition will be presented. Subjects  who 
discontinue study drug prematurely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and 
listed, with a description of the r eason for early termination/withdrawal.  
8.5 Subject  Characteristics   
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. 
8.6 Concomitant M edications   
Concomitant medications will be coded by the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary to Ana tomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) and preferred drug name. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and 
listed.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 46 8.7 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure  
Compliance with study drug dosing will be recorded within the  eDiary. From these entries, 
summaries of treatment compliance and exposure will be produced. 
8.8 Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy endpoints will be summarized within the FAS using descriptive statistics by 
time point and treatment.  For the WI- NRS and  AI-NRS end points (change from baseline, 
3-point and 4-point responders) results will be summarized at the primary time point, 
Week  6, as well as at Week 2 and 4. The WI -NRS and AI- NRS results will be summarized at 
baseline and Weeks 2, 4 and 6. For each of these measures the result at a time point are based 
upon the average of the results leading up to that time point. The night- time scratching 
events , ItchyQoL , 5-D Pruritus Scale  and sPGA will also be summarized at baseline and 
Weeks 2, 4 and 6 with change from baseline summarized at Weeks 2, 4 and 6.  Week 6 is the 
primary time point for the  ItchyQoL . The PGIC will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4 and 6. 
For the primary and key secondary endpoints these statistics will include 95% confidence 
intervals for the t reatment difference. Testing will also be used for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints.  
For the responder rate endpoints subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least 
a 3 or 4 point reduction in WI- NRS / AI -NRS between baseline and the corresponding week. 
The difference in the pr imary efficacy outc ome meas ure (WI-NRS  change from baseline to  
Week 6 ) between treatment groups will be tested using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model controlling for the stratification factor s. A main effects model with an interaction term 
(treatment by stratification factors) and a Type II hypothesis will be used. More precisely this 
ANOVA model uses the following as a stratified adjusted measure of the change from 
baseline for a given treatment group: 
∆=∑𝑛𝑛1𝑗𝑗𝑛𝑛2𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛1𝑗𝑗+𝑛𝑛2𝑗𝑗4
𝑗𝑗=1 ∆𝑗𝑗 , 
where j  represents the stratification cells, n is the sample size for treatment 1 and 2 and ∆ j is 
the change measures for stratum j .  
Conceptually t he hypotheses being tested are:  
H0:∆Placebo ≥  ∆Serlopitant  H a: ∆Placebo < ∆Serlopitant  
 
where ∆Placebo  is the placebo change from baseline and ∆ Serlopitant  is the similar measure for 
serlopitant. Each serlopitant treatment group (1 mg and 5 mg) will be compared to placebo 
separately.   
The primary endpoint will utilize the imputation methods as outlined in Section  8.2. 
Sensitivity analyses in which Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF, and Base line 
Observation Carried Forward, BOCF, are used will be performed. The LOCF approach 
assumes subject’s final assessment is reflective of their future assessment and can be useful if 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 47 subjects are withdrawing due to lack of efficacy, as this lack of efficac y is carried forward. 
The BOCF approach for responder rate endpoints is equivalent to a missing equals failure 
imputation.  
The differences between treatment groups  for the ItchyQoL  key secondary endpoint  will be 
tested using the same analysis of variance ( ANOVA) model used for the primary endpoint.   
A Cochran Mantel Haenszel ( CMH) test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification 
factor s will be used for the responder rate key secondary endpoint. 
8.9 Psychometric Analyses   
A psychometric assessment of th e WI -NRS will be conducted to assess test -retest reliability, 
construct validity and responsiveness. These will be conducted outside of the statistical 
analysis plan for this study and will include analyses of : intra -class correlation coefficients 
(ICC), P earson’s correlations, and change scores for test -retest reliability; Pearson Product 
Moment or Spearman Correlations for concurrent validity; t- test analyses or ANOVA for 
known groups validity; and correlations of change scores for WI-NRS and other measures for 
responsiveness. In addition, a responder definition will be explored using anchor- and 
distribution -based methods. 
8.10 Safety Analyses  
8.10.1 Adverse E vents   
The incidence of all AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. 
These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject  
reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, 
the subject  will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. 
An overview of AEs, which includes subject  incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, AEs 
by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.   
SAEs will be listed and summariz ed in a similar manner to AEs . 
8.10.2 Clinical Safety Laboratory R esults   
Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. S ummary statistics 
for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by 
scheduled visit. Graphs of laboratory values over time will also be produced.  
Subjects  with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at any 
post- baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory values will be 
tabulated . 
8.10.3 Vital Signs  
The observed data and change from baseline for each measurement day will be summari zed 
with descriptive statistics.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential

The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or normal) will be summarized along with a 
summary of how many subjects developed a post treatment abnormal result. The study 
relevance of the finding will be provided in a listing. 
8.11 Interim Analyses  
This study includes an iDMC that will review study results to identify potential safety 
concerns. The iDMC is not tasked with stopping the study early for efficacy or for futility 
determinations.  
8.12 Pharmacokinetics Data   
The PK data and analysis for serlopitant and metabolites will be reported in a PK report that 
will be a  part of the clinical study report .

Obligations documents.  
9.5 Informed C onsent  
The purpose of the study, the procedures to be carried out, and any potential risks of stud y 
participation will be described in non- technical terms in the ICF. After having reviewed and 
understood the ICF, subjects will be required to read, sign, and date an IRB-approved or 
EC-approved consent form before any study- specific procedures are carried out. Subjects 
below the legal age of consent will be required to read, sign, and date an IRB-approved or 
EC-approved assent form, and his/her parent(s)/guardian(s) will be required to read, sign, and 
date an IRB -approved or EC -approved consent form. Subj ects will be assured that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardizing medical care related to or required 
as a result of study participation. The original signed consent and assent  form s will be 
maintained in the investigator site  file. Copies of signed consent/ assent form s will be 
provided to the subject. 
9.6 Communication with the Institutional R eview Board or Ethics C ommittee  
The IRB  or EC  is constituted and operates in accordance with the principles and 
requirements described in the IC H E6 guideline. The protocol, informed consent /assent  form, 
other written subject information, and any proposed study advertising material must be 
submitted to the IRB  or EC  for written approval. IRB or EC  approval of these documents 
will be provided to the investigator. The study will not start until the IRB  or EC  has granted 
its approval of the study materials and procedures. 
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB  or EC  as explained in Section 9.1. SAE 
information will be submitted to the IRB  or EC  as explained in Section 7.4.  
If the study is terminated by the Sponsor, a written statement fully documenting the reason(s) 
for study termination will be provided to the IRB or EC . 
9.7 Disclosure and C onfidentiality  
By sig ning this protocol, the investigator agrees to keep all information provided by the 
Sponsor in strict confidence and to require the same confidentiality from site staff and the 
IRB or EC . Study documents provided by the Sponsor (e.g. protocol, IB, eCRFs) w ill be 
stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. The information provided by the Sponsor 
to the investigator may not be disclosed to others without direct written authorization from 
the Sponsor, except to the extent necessary to obtain informed consent /assent  from subjects 
who wish to participate in the study.  
The investigator must ensure that the subjects be identified by a unique subject study 
number. Other study- related documents that may contain confidential participant information 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 50 (e.g. si gned ICFs) will be kept in strict confidence by the investigator and be stored in a 
secure location with access restricted to the study staff.  
9.8 Records and Electronic Case Report Forms  
All study data except central laboratory, PK, eDiary,  actigraphy,  and EC G data will be 
recorded in an eCRF system. Data will be entered at the site by the appropriately designated 
and trained site personnel. All source documents from which eCRF entries are derived should 
be placed in the subject’s medical records.  eCRFs will b e completed for every subject 
screened in the study.  
The study monitor will review all eCRFs in detail and will have access to participant medical 
records, laboratory data, and other source documentation to allow required eCRF fields to be 
verified by sour ce data.  
Data consistency and plausibility checks against data entered into the eCRF will be included 
in the eCRF system. Data corrections can be performed in the eCRFs by the site. For each 
instance of data modification, the system requires a reason for c hange. The system keeps a 
full audit trail of the data values, the date and time of modification, and the electronic 
signature of the user who performed the change. 
After a full review of the eCRFs  by the study monitor and resolution of any data 
clarifications, the investigator will review, sign, and approve the subject’s eCRF. All 
essential documents, source data, clinical records, and laboratory data will be retained by the 
site in accordance with  the ICH E6 guideline and the site’s data retention policies. These 
records must be available for inspection by the Sponsor, monitor, and regulatory authorities. 
Further detail regarding data management and eCRFs is included in the Data Management 
Plan.  
9.9 Good C linical P ractices and E thical Study C onduct

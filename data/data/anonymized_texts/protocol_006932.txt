 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
TITLE:   A Randomized Open Label Phase 2 b/3 Study of  the Safety and Efficacy of  NP-120 
(Ifenprodil) for the T reatment of  Hospitalized Patients with Confirmed COVID -19 Disease  
TRIAL DESIGN:  Open -label , multi- center , randomized, parallel group study  
This p rotocol is largely based on the recommendations of the WHO R&D Blueprint Clinical Trials Expert 
Group COVID- 19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis , and associated Master Protocol . 
NUMBER OF STUDY CENTERS : Approximately 10 
STUDY LOCATION: Canada , US, Australia , Philippines, Romania  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: 2b/3  
INDICATION:  Treatment of SARS -CoV -2 Infected Patients  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT : NP-120 ( Ifenprodil  tartrate ) 
STUDY RATIONALE:  NP-120 (Ifenprodil) is an N -methyl -D-Aspartate (NDMA) inhibitor that is 
specific for the NR2B subunit of the NMDA Receptor. The NMDA receptor, and specifically the NR2B 
subunit, is involved in glutamate signaling, and is expressed on both neutrophils and T cells. In the case of 
neutrophils, activation of the NMDA receptor can (1) result in expression of CD11b which targets 
neutrophils via ICAM -1 to areas of inflammation, and (2) trigger the autocrine release of glutamate. In the 
case of T -cells, activation of T cells via glutamate can cause (1) T cell proliferation and , (2) the  release of 
cytokines. The activation of T cells and cytokine release can be blocked in vitro  by the addition of 
Ifenprodil. As such it could be a potent anti -inflammatory agent.  
Ifenprodil was discovered  by a genome wide RNAi assay to uncover gene targets associated with 
cytoprotective activity against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza, specifically by preserving cell viability 
in vitro. When tested in a murine model of H5N1, the drug at clinically relevan t doses: (1) improved 
survivability from 0% at day 6 to 40% day 14 post -infection, (2) the drug significantly reduced edema and 
lung injury score and (3) reduced infiltrating T cells , neutrophils  and NK cells and attenuated the 
‘cytokine storm’. The mortal ity rate of H5N1 in humans is >50%, whereas the mortality rate of SARS -
CoV -2 infected patients is < 5%, and both viruses cause acute lung injury and share similar pulmonary 
pathologies.   NP -120 has also been shown to mediate anti -inflammatory responses and reduce pulmonary 
fibrosis in a murine model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a complication which can occur after a 
respiratory virus infection.  
Based on the fact that H5N1 has a signi ficantly higher mortality rate than SARS -CoV -2 but still shares 
similar lung pathologies, Algernon Pharmaceuticals believes Ifenprodil could reduce lung injury 
associated with COVID -19 disease, thereby improving lung function and accelerating patient recov ery. 
The purpose of this Phase 2 b/3 trial is to determine the  safety and  efficacy of NP -120 in the treatment of 
COVID -19 disease.  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE S: To investigate the  clinical efficacy  and safety of NP -120 (20 and 40 mg 
TID) compared to standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID -19 disease . 
• The choice of the primary outcome measure for Phase 3 will be determined by a pilot Phase 2b 
study of the first 150 subjects.  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
7 
 • Subject clinical status (on the WHO7- point ordinal scale ) at day 15 is the default primary 
endpoint  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical efficacy  of NP -120 (20 and 40 mg TID) as 
compared to the control arm as assessed by:  
 
• Ordinal scale:  
o Time to an improvement of one category from baseline on an ordinal scale.  
o Subject clinical status on an ordinal scale at days 3, 5, 8, 11, and 29.  
o Mean change in the ranking on an ordinal scale from baseline to days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 and 29 from baseline  
• National Early Warning Score (NEWS):  
o The time to discharge or to a NEWS of ≤ 2 and maintained for 24 hours, whichever 
occurs first.  
o Change from baseline to days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, and 29 in NEWS  
• Oxygenation:  
o Oxygenation free days in the first 28 days (to day 29)  
o Effect on the rate of change of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
taken at baseline and measured once  daily up to 2 weeks of treatment in IP versus control 
group patients  
• Mechanical Ventilation:  
o Ventilator free days in the first 28 days (to day 29)  
o Incidence and duration of new mechanical ventilation use during the trial  
• Hospitalization : 
o Duration of hospitalization (days)  
o Time to discharge (days)  
• Mortality : 
o 15-day mortality  
o 28-day mortality  
 
EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:  To investigate the effects of NP -120 (20 and 40 mg TID) on lung 
function , health status , and SARS -CoV -2 RNA status  in hospitalized patients with COVID -19 disease.  
SAFETY OBJECTIVES:  To study the safety of NP -120 (20 and 40 mg TID) in hospitalized patients  
with COVID- 19 disease.  
PATIENT POPULATION : Individuals with COVID -19 disease that are currently hospitalized , and 
either requiring supplemental oxygen, or non- invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices . This 
corresponds to a score of 4 or 5 (moderate and severe disease) on the WHO proposed ordinal scale for 
clinical improvement.  
STUDY CONDUCT:  The trial will be conducted in two stages:  
1. A Pilot Stage (Phase 2 b) and,  
2. A Pivotal stage  (Phase 3)

 NUMBER OF SUBJECTS FOR THE PILOT  STAGE  OF THE STUDY:  Approximately 15 0: 
Treatment Arm  A:  Ifenprodil  (20 mg TID)  on top of Standard of Care (N= 50) 
Treatment Arm B:  Ifenprodil (40 mg TID) on top of Standard of Care (N=50)  
Control Arm:   Standard of Care (N= 50) 
 
For the pilot phase, a sample of approximately 150 patients (50 in Arm A, Arm B and SOC) will be 
recruited. To account for drop out of 10%, a total of 168 patients will be enrolled . 
 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS FOR THE PI VOTAL  PHASE 3 STAGE OF THE STUDY:  
 
For the pivotal phase, a  sample of 4 62 patients (2 31 in the SOC group and 231 in the active treatment 
group /s) achieves 90%  power to detect a change in the log odds ratio of 0.5596 when the significance 
level (alpha) is 0.05 using a two-sided test. A log odds ratio of 0.5596 corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.75 
comparing treatment to SOC.  To account for drop out of 10%, a total of 514 patients will be enrolled . 
 
Phase 2b Interim analysis and increasing the patient number: An interim a nalysis will be conducted on 
the ITT population when 75  patients complete the clinical status assessment at day 15 (the primary 
endpoint) .  A preliminary full analysis report of 150 patients with up to Day 29 entered will  also be 
presented.  An interim analysis that allows stopping for futility or efficacy will be considered for P hase 3. 
Details for the Phase 3 futility or efficacy analysis wi ll be specified in the  Phase 3  Statistical Analysis 
Plan and DSMB Charter as appropriate.  
 PRIMARY EFFICACY PARAMETER:  Patient clinic al status (on the  WHO 7- point ordinal scale
) at 
day 15 in IP versus SOC control group patients :

 • Effect on the rate of change of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio taken at 
baseline and measured once daily up to 2 weeks of treatment in IP versus control group patients  
EXPLORATORY EFFICACY PARAMETERS:  
• Changes in the extent of dyspnea  from baseline, using a Likert scale, at Days 2 , 4, 8, and 14 in IP 
versus control group   
[Likert scale: The patient grades his/her current breathing compared to when he/she first started 
the study  (from - 3 to 3). "0" = no change, "1" =minimally better, "2" =moderately better, "3" 
=markedly better, " -1" =minimally worse, " -2" =moderately worse, " -3" =markedly worse] .  For 
the first questionnaire (at baseline), the patient compares their current shortness of breath to their 
shortness of breath when they are well.  
• Rate of change to patient’s experience of cough (Visual analog scale [VAS]) at Days 2 , 4, 8,  and 
14 in IP versus control group 
VAS: The patient draws a vertic al line on an axial graph (from 0 to 100) to show the degree of 
how he/she feels about coughing. The number "100" equals the worst coughing the patient has 
ever felt and the number "0" equals the best he/she has felt since baseline . 
• Changes in D -dimer in IP versus control group 
• Qualitative PCR for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, days 5 (while hospitalized, and days 15 and 29 (if 
able to return to clinic or still hospitalized)  
• Quantitative PCR  (if available)  for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, days 5 (while hospitalized, and days 
15 and 29 (if able to return to clinic or still hospitalized)  
 
 
SAFETY PARAMETERS:  
• Type, frequency, severity, and relationship of AEs to investigational product (IP)   
• Number of patients who discontinue IP due to any AE  
• Frequency of clinically significant changes in vital signs and/or laboratory findings

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:   
Primary Efficacy Analysis : The SOC and treatment arms under WHO7 ordinal scale will be compared 
with respect to the primary endpoint using proportional odds model s (ordinal logistic regression)  adjusted 
for site and age . Treatment will be compared to SOC by testing whether the common odds ratio differs 
from 1.0 at day 15 using two- sided test at 2.5% level of significance  under  the ITT population set, 
followed by PP population set . All modeling assumptions will be verified.  
Separate 95% CI and p- values will be computed across each of the ordinal scale between SOC and 
treatment arms  for both ITT and PP population sets . Multiple comparison techniques (to be detailed in the 
SAP) will be employed to ensure type I error is controlled to 5% for these comparisons.  
If, following the second interim analysis, the primary endpoint changes, details will be written in the SAP, 
and a protocol amendment will be created.

 Sample size d etermination:   
For the pilot Phase 2b phase, a sample of 150 patients (50 in Arm A, Arm B and SOC) will be recruited. 
To account for drop out of 10%, a total of 168 patients will be enrolled.  
 
For the pivotal Phase 3 phase, A sample of 4 62 patients (2 31 in the SOC group and 231 in the active 
treatment group) achieves 90%  power to detect a change in the log odds ratio of 0.5596 when the 
significance level (alpha) is 0.05 using a two- sided test. A log odds ratio of 0.5596 corresponds to an odds 
ratio of 1.75 comparing treatment to SOC. The sample size was estimated using the Tests for Two Ordered Categorical Variables module in PASS 14
. To account for drop out of 10%, a total of 514 
patients will be enrolled . 
The sample size assumes that the distribution of patients on day 15 will be as shown in T able 2, which is 
scenario 4 in the WHO master protocol (2020)  for enrol led patients with moderate to severe disease  under 
an odds ratio of 1.75.

PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL/DISCONTIUNATION CRITERIA:  
1. Patients who suffer vasodilative shock. However, physicians can use rescue therapy such as 
vasopressin to restore blood pressure and allow patients to continue in the study, at the discretion of the attending physician.  
2. Patients who se ALT/AST rise to >5x upper limit of normal or Child -Pugh of 10- 15. 
3. Patients who experience a cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction

 TRIAL STOPPING RULES:  The Medical Monitor team will review AE / SAE data every 2 weeks. If 
there are a concerning number  of unexpected AEs, the DSMB will be asked to review safety data in an ad 
hoc meeting.  
The DSMB will review safety data after every 25  subjects are entered into the trial  up to 100 subjects, and 
then at every 50 subjects  ad hoc reviews will be undertaken if there are other specific safety concerns. The 
study will not stop enrolment awaiting these DSMB reviews, though the DSMB may recommend 
temporary or permanent cessation of enrolment based on their safety reviews. Based on the 
recommendations o f the WHO R&D Blueprint Clinical Trials Expert Group  and given the severity of 
illness in COVID -19, there are no pre -specified study stopping rules for safety.  
For Phase 2b, a n interim analysis will also be performed when 75 pa tients completed Day 15 assessments 
for the primary endpoint. For this  interim analysis with first 75 patients with Day 15 efficacy data, in 
addition to standard DSMB outputs, the following descriptive statistics efficacy analysis will also be 
presented:  
 
1. WHO- 7 efficacy with Day 15 assessment  
2. Status on an ordinal scale assessed daily while hospitalized and on days 15  
3. NEWS assessed days 3, 5, 8 ,11 while hospitalized and on days 15 in IP versus control group 
patients  
4. Effect on the rate of change of partial p ressure of oxygen (PaO2) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio taken at 
baseline and measured once daily up to 2 weeks of treatment in IP versus control group patients  
5. Rate of mechanical ventilation in IP versus control group patients (Patients who received 
Invasive/non- invasive Mechanical Ventilation by Day 15)   
 
For item 5, if a patient did not experience mechanical ventilation by Day 15, he/she will be marked as a 
negative response even if the patient did experience mechanical ventilation past Day 15. This is different 
to the final analysis described above.

 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
COVID -19 is a severe respiratory infection caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus. The disease occurs was 
first detected in China’s Wuhan province in 2019 and spread globally over several months , in spite of 
efforts to quarantine infected patients. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and fatigue. A 
minority of patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, nasal discharge, sore throat, muscle pain, 
and diarrhea. Severe patients often suffer from dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after symptom onset, and severe patients can rapidly progress to acute respir atory distress syndrome, septic shock, difficult to 
correct metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction and multiple organ failure. Most patients have a good 
prognosis and a minority are in critical condition; however, the prognosis of the elderly and thos e with 
chronic underlying diseases is more poor ( Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan
).  
The mortality rate of the disease has yet to be determined but is generally estimated at <5%. An early 
published study showed that fatalities are often attributed to respiratory failure, and there is evidence that 
suggests that COVID -19 mortality might be due to a virus -activated “cytokine storm syndrome” ( Ruan et. 
al., 2020 ).  
2.2 Study rationale  
Ifenprodil , an NMDA antagonist , specifically targeting the NR2B subunit, with a piperidinoalkanol 
structure , was first approved in  Japan  in 1971. It was developed as a vasodilator and  has been used in  
Japan in the treatment  of dizziness and vertigo, as well as in France in the treatment of Peripheral Arterial 
Obstructive Disease (Williams, 2001 ). Due to the widespread use of Ifenprodil in Japan and France , the 
safety, tolera bility and pharmacokinetics of the drug are well established. The drug was also approved in 
South Korea in 2003.  
The N -methyl -D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) is historically regarded as a neurological target, but its 
functional expression has been reported in pulmonary tissue. The NMDAr is activated by glutamate (Glu), 
the main excitatory neurotransmitter which acts on receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). But overactivation of these receptors can cause several damages to neural cells including death. However, the 
target is also important for immunological function. The NMDA receptor, and specifically the NR2B 
subunit is expressed on both neutrophils ( Del Arroyo, 2019) and T cells  (Kahlifu ss, 2014
). In the case of 
neutrophils, activation of the NMDA receptor can (1) result in expression of CD11b which targets 
neutrophils via ICAM -1 to areas of inflammation  (Li, 2015 ), and (2) trigger the autocrine  release of 
glutamate. In the case of T -cells, activation of T cells via glutamate can cause (1) T cell proliferation and, 
(2) the release of cytokines. The activation of T cells and cytokine release can be blocked in vitro  by the 
addition of If enprodil. Recent studies have also shown that the glutamate agonist N -methyl- D-aspartate 
can trigger acute lung injury (ALI).

cells 
 
 
ALI is a direct and indirect injury to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cell, causing diffuse 
pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema and acute hypoxic respiration failure ( Zhe et. al., 2018 ). ALI is 
characterized by  reduced lung volume and compliance, and imbalance of the ventilation/perfusion ratio, 
inducing hypoxemia and respiratory distress and its severe stage (oxygen index <200) known as acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a common, devastating c linical syndrome of acute lung 
injury with high mortality ranging from 40% to 60%. Furthermore, pathological findings show that 64% of ARDS patients may have pulmonary fibrosis (PF) during convalescence (
Qiao et. al., 2009 ). 
Antagon ism of glutamate signaling could therefore ameliorate some of the complications of ALI and 
thereby also prevent the development of PF.  
A recent paper from an independent group in China, found that repurposing ifenprodil could be useful for preventing virus -induced acute lung injury ( Zhang et. al., 2019
). A genome wide RNA interference 
(RNAi) screen was performed to identify gene targets that could rescue lung cell viability from H5N1 infection in vitro . Drug bank searches for compounds that could affect the same gene targets as were 
identified by the RNAi screen selected ifenprodil as a lead for further testing in an in vivo mouse model of 
H5N1 infection. The H5N1 is a highly lethal infection in humans with a >50% mortality rate, far  larger 
than the estimated overall mortality rate of COVID -19 disease  at <5%.  
Notably, treatment with ifenprodil was able to significantly increase the survival of H5N1 -infected mice: 
after 6 days, survival was 60% in the treatment group vs. 0% in the con trol group, and after 14 days, 
survival was 40% of ifenprodil -treated animals (see figure inline; No.42 refers to ifenprodil). In addition, 
several markers of lung function improved significantly including the lung injury score, the lung wet/dry ratio and the infiltrating cell count , in particular T cells and neutrophils . Multiple proinflammatory 
cytokines/chemokines which are elevated in the “cytokine storm” associated with viral infection were also significantly reduced.

(Zhang et al., 2019 ). 
Early clinical reports suggest that the COVID -19 mortality might be due to virus activated “cytokine 
storm sy ndrome” or fulminant myocarditis, the latter of which could be addressed by Ifenprodil treatment 
(Ruan et al., 2020 ). 
The ability of Ifenprodil to reduce pulmonary fibrosis was demonstrated using a murine bleomycin-
induced IPF model  (see Investigator’s Brochure  for details ). In this experiment, disease severity as 
measured histologically was significantly reduced in animals treated with Ifenprodil versus control 
animals who received vehicle treatment . Ifenprodil was also tested in a guinea pig citric acid tussive 
model using Gefapixant as a positive control . Ifenprodil was found to significantly reduce both coughing 
frequency and onset of first cough. Pulmonary fibrosis also correlates with outcome in adult respiratory 
distress syndr ome ( Martin et. al., 1995 ). 
The purpose of this trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of Ifenprodil in the treatment of patients with 
COVID -19 disease.  This Protocol is largely based on the recommendations of the WHO R&D Blueprint 
Clinical Trials Expert Group COVID -19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis , and associated Master Protocol . 
The choice of the primary outcome measure for Phase 3 will be determined by a pilot Phase 2b study of 
the first 1 50 subjects. Subject clinical status (on a 7- point ordinal scale) at day 15 in treatment versus the 
control group is the default primary endpoint.  
2.3 Risk/Benefit analysis  
Currently, neither a vaccination nor a cure is available for COVID -19 disease. Treatment is performed on 
the basis of symptom management, prevention and management of complications, treatment of underlying 
diseases, prevention of secondary infections, and prompt support of organ functions. Respiratory support (including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is 
indicated in severe cases. The use of antiviral therapy (interferon -α, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, 
chloroquine phosphate, and umifenovir) has been pr oposed, but data on the effectiveness of these agents 
are not yet available. Use of tocilizumab has been suggested for patients with extensive and bilateral lung 
disease and severely ill patients with elevated IL -6 levels; however, this agent is contraindi cated in 
patients with active infections . For patients with progressively deteriorating oxygenation index, rapid

24 
 imaging progression, and overactive inflammatory responses, short -term (3 -5 days) glucocorticoid 
treatment may be used; however, the immunosuppressive function of high- dose glucocorticoid may delay 
the clearance of coronavirus from the system. There remains an unmet need for a therapy which can 
reduce levels proinflammatory cytokines and ameliorate lung injury without inhibiting the immune 
system . 
Ifenprodil  has a well -established safety record, having been used in Japan and France for almost 50 years .  
In addition, a review of 8 years of post -marketing surveillance in over 15,000 patients revealed no serious 
side effects.   
Overall, based on the medical need and on the available Ifenprodil safety, tolerability, and efficacy data, 
the proposed Phase 2 b/3 clinical trial design is considered appropriate and potential benefits of evaluating 
Ifenprodil in the study outweigh the pe rceived risks.

 4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a Phase 2b/3 , multicenter , open label , randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of 
Ifenprodil in patient s with COVID -19 disease.  
In the Phase 2b phase, patient s will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 :1 to either a) 20 mg TID IP plus 
Standard of Care group, b) 40 mg TID IP plus S tandard of Care  or c) Standard of Care  only group. 
Investigators will collectively enroll approximately 50 evaluable patient s in each treatment group, for a 
total of 150 patient s. Patients receive either oral Ifenprodil (20 or 40 mg TID) for up to 14 days  in addition 
to Standard of Care , or Standard of Care only.  The Standard of Care for each patient  will be captured in 
the eCRF.  
Randomization will be stratified by site , and age  (<65 versus ≥65) .  
For Phase 2b, One interim statistical analys is will be performed on the primary endpoint  of each arm after 
the first 75 patients have completed up to 2 weeks of treatment  (Day 15) .   This analysis is being done to 
allow safety  assessment and some snapshots of efficacy assessments as the trial progres ses. 
 
The P hase 2 b study will also evaluate the different constructs of the ordinal scale (different days and 
different number of categories) by severity (severe vs. mild -moderate).  Data from the Phase 2 b study will 
be used to down select and prioritize the secondary endpoints.  . The protocol would then be amended for 
the Phase 3 study to include the additional required number of patients to be recruited for the study to 
meet statistical significance in its primary endpoint.  
An additional placebo arm will be added in the Phase 3 portion of the study. The number of participants to 
be enrolled in Phase 3 pivotal stage will be determined based upon the outcome of pilot Phase 2b stage of 
the study. Participants  will be randomized to receive IP  plus SOC, or Placebo plus SOC. Details will be 
outlined in a protocol am endment

 4.2 Planned Number of Patients  
In total, approximately 682 patients with COVID- 19 disease at sites in Canada , the US , Australia, the 
Philippines, and Romania  will be enrolled  competitively . Addition countries may be added depending on 
enrolment.  Adjustments to sample size may be made depending on the results of the final analysis from 
Phase2b . 
4.3 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
An Indepe ndent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (D SMB) will be established. The DSMB is an expert 
advisory group commissioned and charged with the responsibility of evaluating, primarily, cumulative 
safety data at regular intervals. The DSMB will review blinded dat a and provide recommendations to the 
Sponsor based on their evaluation.  All DSMB members will be independent of the Sponsor and study. 
Membership in the independent DSMB will consist of at least a medical monitor, a physician, a 
statistician,  and a pharmacologist. All members have experience and expertise in their field of practice, 
and will not have scientific, financial or conflict of interest related to the trial.  
A DSMB Charter will be prepared and signed prior to initiation of the first D SMB meeting . The charter 
will outline the specific purpose and functions of the DSMB  in monitoring the safety of patients in the 
trial. This charter will also describe the procedures for data extraction and data delivery conventions to 
and from the DSMB me mbers for review purposes, and decision criteria to recommend changes to study 
parameters like the primary endpoint, eligibility requirements, and sample size.  
The first DSMB meeting  to review safety data , other than the orientation meeting, will occur whe n 25 
subjects have completed Visit 2 (Day 15) of the study. A subsequent DSMB meeting will occur after each 
25 subjects have completed Visit 2 (Day 15)  up to 100 subjects; subsequent to 100 subjects, review will 
occur after every 50 subjects have completed  Visit 2 (Day 15) .  The study will not stop enrolment 
awaiting these DSMB reviews, although the DSMB may recommend temporary or permanent cessation 
of enrolment based on their safety reviews.  
Should initial enrollment be slower than expected, the DSMB will  have the option of reviewing data prior 
to the 25 subject/ Visit  2 event if the DSMB believes such a review would be of value. An earlier review 
would be in addition to the planned 25 subject/ Visit  2 review. Should any untoward safety issue be 
observed, the DSMB will schedule an immediate meeting to review the relevant safety data.  
Additional data may be requested by the DSMB, and interim statistical reports may be generated as 
deemed necessary and appropriate by the DSMB. The DSMB may receive data in aggr egate and 
presented by treatment arm. The DSMB may also be provided with expected and observed rates of the AEs in an unblinded fashion and may request the treatment assignment be unblinded for an individual 
subject if required for safety assessment. The D SMB will review grouped and unblinded data in the 
closed session only. As an outcome of each review/meeting, the DSMB will make a recommendation as 
to the advisability of proceeding with study interventions (as applicable), and to continue, modify, or terminate this trial.  
4.4 Design Justification  
This study represents one of the first repurposed investigation s of Ifenprodil in patient s with COVID- 19 
disease. This study will provide information on the safety and clinical efficacy in the SARS -CoV -2 
infected  population prior to advancing to larger clinical trials, as well as provide critical information for 
the design of future studies in this population.  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
31 
 The purpose of this study is to determine  whether  Ifenprodil is effective and safe in the treatment of 
patient s with COVID- 19 disease. The primary measure of efficacy will be patient clinical status (on a 7 -
point ordinal scale) at day 15 in IP versus control group patients.  This protocol is based on the 
recommendations of the WHO R&D Blueprint Clinical Trials Expert Group .   
The Phase 2b stage  will be an open label  study with patient s, investigator, site and CRO  staff aware  of 
treatment received.  The Phase 3 stage  of the protocol will also include a placebo arm to allow for double -
blinding.  
4.5 Dose Justification  
 
20 mg TID:  
20 mg T ID of Ifenprodil i s within  the recommended dosing guidelines for other indications as per the 
manufacturer’s package insert.  
Assuming a 60 kg person, a single 20 mg dose would yield a 0.333 mg/kg weight adjusted dose. To 
convert to a mouse dose, a factor of 12 is applied to the hum an equivalent dose (Nair and Jacob, 2016 ), 
which results in approximately 4 mg/kg for mice .  
A 4 mg/kg dose given three times daily (12 mg/kg total daily dose) was found to be efficacious in reducing pulmonary fibrosis, and better t han a single 30 mg/kg daily dose in reducing fibrosis in mice. 
The independent study involving H5N1 infection in mice also used a single daily dose of 20 mg/kg.  
Similarly, the single 1.5 mg/kg dose selected in the acute cough model in the guinea pig was a lso 
equivalent to the single 20 mg/kg human dose on a body surface area adjusted basis based on an adjustment factor of 4.6.  
Thus, the current 20 mg TID human dose is proposed to be a reasonable dose for this initial exploratory 
study. Please refer to the I nvestigator’s B rochure  for additional details on the aforementioned pre -clinical 
studies.  
40 mg TID:  
40 mg TID of Ifenprodil is also expected to be a reasonable dose for this exploratory study.  L ong term 
pre-clinical toxicological studies suggest dosing up to 16 mg/kg/day should produce no adverse effects. 
Specifically, the no- observed- adverse- effect level (NOAEL) observed were 50 mg/kg/day (HED of 8 
mg/kg/day) in repeat oral dose studies in the rat of up to 52 weeks (Kawai et al, 1975a; Kawai et a l, 
197b), 30 mg/kg day (HED of 17 mg/kg/day) in dogs of up to 6 months (Nagata et al, 1997), and 50 
mg/kg/day (HED 16 mg/kg/day) in rabbit of 30 days (Kawai et al, 1976).  
Furthermore, h igh doses of Ifenprodil (60- 300 mg/day) have been used for analgesic pu rposes  in humans . 
In addition, a  trial using 120 mg/day of Ifenprodil for methamphetamine dependence is underway in 
Japan (UMIM clinical trial registry UMIN000030849 ; Kotajima -Murakami et al, 2019
) for 84 days. 
Assuming a 60 kg subject, the proposed 40 mg TID dose in this study is 2 mg/kg/day dose level and 
limited to 14 days exposure , well within previously used dosing regimens .

 4.6 Trial Schedule and End -of-Trial  
First patient first visit is planned for the Third Quarter of 2020 and last patient last visit is planned for the 
First Quarter 2022. The expected total duration of the trial is approximately 18 months . 
The End of Trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient  to complete the study . 
At the end of the trial patient s will be treated for their COVID -19 disease at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
4.7  Trial Stopping Rules and Safety  
The Medical Monitor  will review AE / SAE data every 2 weeks. If there are a concerning number of 
unexpected AEs, the DSMB will be asked to review safety data in an ad hoc meeting.  
The DSMB will review safety data after every 25  subjects are entered into the t rial up to 100 subjects, and 
then at every 50 subjects ; ad hoc reviews will be undertaken if there are other specific safety concerns. 
The study will not stop enrolment awaiting these DSMB reviews, though the DSMB may recommend 
temporary or permanent cessation of enrolment based on their safety reviews. Follow ing the 
recommendations of the of the WHO R&D Blueprint Clinical Trials Expert Group  and given the severity 
of illness in COVID -19, there are no pre -specified study stopping rules for safety.  
   
5. SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION AND WITHDRAWAL

Participation in observational registry studies is permitted . 
5.3 Screening/Baseline/Randomization  
Screen failures are defined as patient s who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are never 
subsequently enrolled . In this study, a patient  can become a screen failure at any time during t he 
screening  visit  (Visit 1 ), prior to randomization. In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
patient s, meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)  publishing requirements, and 
respond to queries from Regulatory authorities, a minimal set of screen failure information is required including Demography, Screen Failure details, and Eligibility Criteria . 
When a patient  meets all eligibility requirements,  study site personnel will consult the study database to 
obtain the patient ’s randomization number and treatment assignment.  
Under no circumstances will patients randomized  in the trial be permitted to be re -screened and 
randomized  for a second time in this trial.  
5.4 Premature Withdrawal and Discontinuation Criteria  
 
5.4.1  Withdrawal from Randomized Treatment or from the Study by Patient  
The patients have the right to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason, without the need to 
justify their decision. However, the Investigator should record the reason for the patient’s withdrawal, if 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
34 
 possible. Every effort should be made to encourage patients to remain in the study for the duration of their 
planned outcome assessment.   
In case the patient has withdrawn consent, no new data can be entered into the e- CRF and data will be  
recorded in the medical records only. Correction of previous  data entries and/or entering of data related to 
visits/procedures done prior to but made available after withdrawal of consent (e.g. laboratory results) 
will be allowed unless the patient disapproves it.  
5.4.2  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
A patient in th is clinical study may discontinue study drug for any of the following reasons:  
• An adverse event which, in the opinion of the Investigator necessitates withdrawal of study 
drug 
• A patient’s substantial non -compliance (e.g. visits non- compliance)  
• The Investi gator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the trial is not appropriate. The 
Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if it is considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
• Patient requests to discontinue study drug  
• Patients who suffer vasodi lative shock. However, physicians can use rescue therapy such as 
vasopressin to restore blood pressure and allow patients to continue in the study, at the discretion of the attending physician.  
• Patients whose ALT/AST rise to >5x upper limit of normal  or Ch ild Pugh score of 10- 15. 
• Patients who experience a cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction  
Patients discontinued from study treatment should remain in the study and complete all remaining study assessments.  If not possible, at a minimum, they should be invited to a Safety Follow -up Visit 7 days 
after the last dose of IP as soon as possible after a decision of discontinuation has been taken. At these visits, the Investigator will obtain all the required details and document the date of the prema ture 
termination and the main reason in the e -CRF.   If the reason for study drug discontinuation is an adverse 
event, the specific event will be recorded in the e- CRF.  
NOTE:  patients that progress to mechanical ventilation during the study may remain on s tudy drug and 
should not be withdrawn.  
Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity:  
The occurrence of any of the following toxicities from the initial dose of Ifenprodil administration (in combination with Standard of Care (SOC)) which results in:  
a. The necessi ty to delay ifenprodil administration in the participant, OR  
b. To reduce the dose of ifenprodil administered, either for the participant, or for subsequent 
participants,  
will be considered a DLT, if judged by the investigator to have a reasonable possibil ity of being related to 
the ifenprodil administration.   
Severity is graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
Version 5.0 equivalents of mild, moderate or severe:  
1. Grade 3 or higher toxicity, except elevations i n gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT)  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
35 
 2. Grade ≥ 3 AST/ALT elevation  
3. Grade ≥ 2 AST/ALT elevation with Grade ≥ 2 bilirubin elevation  
5.4.3  Withdrawal of Patients from the Study  
The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients  from the study post initial dosing. Whenever 
possible the patient should be followed for all assessments per protocol.  Patients will be withdrawn in the 
following circumstances:  
• Patients withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the study for any reason  
• Death of the patient  
• Terminat ion of the study  
• Loss to follow -up (every effort must be made to contact the patient; phone calls on three separate 
days must be made, and a certified letter must be sent to the patient’s most recent address)  
Any withdrawal must be fully documented in the e -CRF and source documents, registered in the e -CRF 
as discontinued, and followed by the Investigator/Investigative Staff.   Patients who withdraw from the 
study or are lost to follow -up after signing the info rmed consent form and randomization will not be 
replaced.  
5.5 Rescue Medication and Risk Management Plans   
Cautions from the manufacture r of Ifenprodil include monitoring for hypotension, palpitations/ increased 
heart rate, and risk of bleeding (including t hose patients on drugs with a risk of bleeding) .  Investigators 
should monitor their patients for occurrence of these adverse events and proceed as follow s: 
Vasopressin can be used as a rescue therapy for patients who suffer vasodilative shock. If low bloo d 
pressure occurs, use of vasopressor medication may also be considered. This may or may be coincident 
with an increased heart rate, in which case a vasopressor may correct both events. In the event of an 
increased heart rate in the absence of coincident h ypotension, use of a positive inotropic agent may be 
considered. In the event of an increased risk of bleeding, antifibrinolytic therapy may be considered. Please consult with the Medical M onitor regarding the best course of treatment should any of these e vents 
occur.   
In addition, patients should be monitored for elevation in liver enzymes.  Those patients whose  ALT/AST 
rise to >5x the upper limit of normal  and/ or Child Pugh score of 10 -15 should be discontinued from study 
medication (ifenprodil) . In addition, the Medical Monitor and DSMB will monitor for the occurrence of 
these adverse events as part of their normal safety review.  Additional guidance or updates to the protocol 
will be provided if necessary.  
The DSMB  will review the adverse events profile after 25, 50, 75 and 100 patients enrolled in the study, 
then every 50 patients thereafter. Particular attention will also be paid to patients over 65 for the 
frequency and severity of serious adverse events (e.g. ALT/AST, creatinine)  as the manufacturer has 
mentioned caution should be taken in this particular age group.  If, based on the DSMB’s opinion, there is a significant concern in any of the identified risk groups , additional restriction s may  be added to the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
5.6 Appropriate Methods of Contraception for Study  
Female s of childbearing potential :  Women who are sexually active with a non- sterilized male partner 
must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception , such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020

 device, or diaphragm plus spermicide from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such 
precautions for 90 days after the final dose of study drug(s)  
Non-sterilized males:  Men  who are sexually active with a female partner of child bearing potential must 
use condom plus spermicide from day 1 through 90 days after receipt of the last dose of study drug(s)

7.4 Assessments 
7.4.1  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured a s indicated in Section 7. 3 and Table 3 and will include blood pressure 
(measured after the patient has been in a seated position , if possible, for ≥3 minutes of r est), pulse, 
respiration rate, body temperature , SpO2, and weight and height  (screening visit only) . Standard of care 
measurements can be used if they fall within the protocol specific windows.  
The Investigator should evaluate the clinical significance of the results. Clinically significant abnormal 
findings will be reported as adverse events.  
7.4.2  Safety Laboratory Parameters  
Samples for laboratory analysis in local laboratories will be collected during the study at time point 
specified in the schedule of events ( See Table 3 and Section 7.3 ). All safety laboratory tests will be 
analyzed at the local laboratory, unless specified in the protocol . Standard of care measurements can be 
used if they fall within the protocol specific windows.  
The Investigator will review the laboratory results and evaluate and document whether the results are normal or abnormal and whether abnormal results are non- clinically significant or clinically significant. 
Pre-existi ng clinically significant conditions diagnosed as a result of the screening procedures must be 
recorded as medical history. If any clinically significant abnormal findings are discovered after informed consent or any pre -existing conditions worsen during t he trial, these must be recorded as adverse events. 
The laboratory report will be signed and dated by the Investigator.  
7.4.2.1  Hematology  
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell counts, including differential, platelet count, red blood 
cell count , myoglobin

12, TNF -α  
Cytokine markers to be collected at Baseline, Day 5, Day 15.  
7.4.4  Clinical support s tatus  
Patient s will be assessed for their  measures of clinical support , including:  
• Hospitalized  
• Oxygen requirement  
• Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (via mask)  
• Mechanical ventilator requirement (via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube)  
• ECMO requirement  
• Ordinal Scale Assessment  
o The ordinal sc ale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study 
day. Each day, the worse score for the previous day will be recorded. i.e. on Day 3, Day 2 
score is obtained and recorded as Day 2.  
o For the purposes of baseline the worse score from the previous day (Day -1) will be used  
o The scale is as follows:  
1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities  
2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities  
3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen  
4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxyge n 
5. Hospitalized, on non- invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices

7.4.5  National Early Warning Score (N EWS) 
The NEW score has demonstrated an ability to discriminate patients at risk of poor outcomes (
WHO 
R&D Blueprint Master Protocol ; Royal College of Physicians 2012 and 2017 ). This score is based on 7 
clinical parameters. The NEW Score is being used as an  efficacy measure.  
This should be evaluated at the first assessment of a given study day. These parameters can be obtained 
from the hospital chart using the last measurement prior to the time of assessment. This is recorded for the 
day obtained. i.e. on Da y 3, Day 3 score is obtained and recorded as Day 3.  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
47 
 A copy of the Table for determining NEW Score can be found in Appendix 16.1 . 
7.4.6  Demography  
Demographic data will be collected at the Screening Visit, including gender, date of  birth, race, and ethnic 
origin (to the extent allowed by local regulations).  
7.4.7  Medical and Surgical History  
Information on clinically significant previous and concomitant illnesses, or any clinically significant signs 
or symptoms that are present before informed consent, or pre -existing conditions identified through 
findings from assessments and examinations done during the Screening Visit will be recorded as medical and surgical history at Screening. For planned procedures/hospitalisations  during the trial, documentation 
should be completed at the time of the Screening.  
7.4.8  Physical Exam  
A limited physical examination will be performed at screening.  
Assessments for the physical examination should include those systems affected by the SARS -CoV -2 
infection.  These can include: General appearance, Eyes, Ears/Nose/Throat, Respiratory 
(Chest/Pulmonary), Heart, Abdomen, Vascular, Neurological, Musculoskeletal, Lymphatic (Lymph nodes), Skin.  
Standard of care measurements can be used if they fall within the protocol specific windows.  
If during routine clinical care during the study the physician notes any physical findings of interest these should be noted in the eCRF. 
7.4.9  Prior and Concomitant Therapies  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription), treatments, and therapies taken by the patient  from 
screening throughout their entire participation in the study, including those initiated prior to the start of 
the study, must be recorded on the patient ’s source document and on the appropriate  page of the eCRF. 
The dose, unit, frequency, route, indication, date the medication was started, and date the medication was 
stopped (if not ongoing) must be recorded.  
All Investigational COVID -19 therapeutic agents used both prior to, and current to randomization and 
participation in the study should be captured in the CRF. 
7.4.10  Lung F unction Test  
Lung function will be assessed by PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio analyses, and two patient questionnaires. 
These assessments should be completed following the t ime points specified in the schedule of events (See 
Table 3 and Section 7.3).  Standard of care measurements can be used for PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
analyses if they fall within the protocol specific windows. 
7.4.10.1 PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 Measurement Considerations  
It is recognized that the performing of PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 measurements can cause significant discomfort to patients.  All efforts should be made in obtaining each PaO2 sample as per protocol.  
However, if not possible (e.g. patient refuses) at a minimum complete PaO2 measurements at 
baseline, Days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 and 29.   
For those days where PaO2 measurements are not able to be taken, SpO2 should be obtained.  
First preference is for these measurements to be taken using a forehead sensor.  Fingertip probes 
may be used if forehead sensors are not available.  The site should remain consistent with the 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
48 
 method of testing for the patient over the course of the study, e.g. all SpO2 measurements are 
taken with only forehead sensors.   
7.4.10.1  Extent of Dysp nea (Likert scale)  
The patient should grade his current breathing compared to when he first started the study (from -
3 to 3). "0" = no change, "1" =minimally better, "2" =moderately better, "3" =markedly better, " -
1" =minimally worse, "- 2" =moderately worse, " -3" =markedly w orse 
For the first questionnaire (at baseline), the patient compares their current shortness of breath to 
their shortness of breath when they are well.  
A copy of the Extent of Dyspnea (Likert Scale) can be found in Appendix 16.2 .  
7.4.10.2  VAS Questionnaire  
Cough severity will be measured using a 0- 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from “no cough” 
to “worst cough ever.”  
A copy of the VAS Questionnaire can be found in Ap pendix 16.3 . 
Note: the site should hand out the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to the subject for completion. If this is not possible, any alternative administration of the VAS must be documented clearly in the 
source. Reasons for an alternative method may include e.g. site policy to avoid document 
contamination, or a visually impaired subject. The following alternative options are accepted:  
• Subject pointing to the VAS with some device and another person adding the line for 
them.  
• If this is not possible, the subject can rank the score 0 – 100 (as the VAS line is 100mm). 
Site should hold up the VAS in front of the subject and /or describing this to try and retain some 
visual aspect . 
 
7.4.11  Prohibited Therapy  
Patient should not be taking dr oxidopa . Single use of ketamine is permitted.   Use of unapproved/off label 
medications for COVID -19 treatment is permitted if they fall under the established local standard of care.  
7.4.12  Safety Evaluations  
Adverse events reporting, including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, physical examinations and vital signs. AE event collection will be performed from signing of ICF , until end of study.  
7.4.13  SARS -CoV -2 RNA Testing  
Confirmation of SARS -CoV -2 RNA using one of the methods outlined in the Inclusion criteria should be 
performed at baseline, Day 5 (or at discharge if sooner), and at Day 15.  Additional testing should be done at Day 29 if the patient still has detectable viral RNA at Day 15.  
If possibl e, testing should be done using both qualitative (e.g. positive/negative) and quantitative (e.g. 
viral RNA load) methods, but at a minimum qualitative testing should be used.  The route of testing (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, blood, etc.) should be capt ured in the CRF.

 8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Adverse E vent Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Events MEETING the definition of an AE include the following:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (urinalysis, h aematology, or clinical chemistry) or other 
safety assessments (e.g. ECGs, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and are felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the 
investigator  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for any 
medical, nursing or pharmacy consultation, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgi cal 
procedures  
• Overdoses and medication errors of the IP or concomitant medication with and without clinical 
consequences  
Events NOT meeting the definition of an AE include the following:  
• The disease being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptom s of the disease being 
studied, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the patient ’s 
condition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments 
which are associated with the underly ing disease, unless more severe than expected for the 
patient ’s condition  
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected 
at the start of the study that do not worsen  
8.1.1  Treatment Emergent Adverse Even ts 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are undesirable events do not present  prior to medical 
treatment, or an already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency following the treatment 
up to and including the follow up period.
 
8.2 Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events  
8.2.1  Collection of Treatment Emergent A dverse Events  
The Investigator must monitor the condition of the patient throughout the trial from signing the ICF  until 
the last visit.  
The sources of treatment emergent adverse events cover:  
• The patient’s response to questions about his/her health (a sta ndard non- leading question such as 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit).  
• Symptoms spontaneously reported by the patient.  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
50 
 • Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed by the Investigator to be 
clinica lly significant changes or abnormalities.  
• Other information relating to the patient’s health becoming known to the Investigator (e.g. hospitalisation).  
When an TEAE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., 
hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will 
then record all relevant information regarding an TEAE /SAE in the e -CRF. It is not acceptable for the 
investigator to send photocopies of the patient ’s medical records in lieu of completion of the TEAE/SAE 
e-CRF page.  
8.2.2  Reporting of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
 A qualified Investigator will evaluate all TEAEs as to:  
8.2.2.1  Adverse Event  
• Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and 
symptoms should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record. 
• If a pat ient suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the patient recovers 
in between the events, the adverse events should be recorded separately.  
• Note the following: A procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the 
procedure is. Hospitalisation is not an adverse event; the reason for hospitalisation is. 
Death is not an adverse event, but the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death of 
unknown cause, which is an adverse event).  
8.2.2.2  Intensity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/intensity of the event and assign 
to one of the following categories  (NCI CTCAE
): 
 
Mild  
• Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only  
• Everyday activities minimally or not affected  
• Intervention not indicated; no or minimal therapy required  
Moderate  
• Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort  
• Some interference with normal everyday activities  
• Local or non- invasive intervention indicated; drug therapy may be required  
Severe  
• Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain  
• Inability to perform daily social and functional activities (e.g. absenteeism and/or bed 
rest) 
• Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention; drug therapy is required  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
51 
 • An event is categori zed as “serious” when it meets one of the pre- defined criteria for 
seriousness; an event may be severe in intensity but be of relatively minor medical 
importance (e.g. a severe headache). An event that is categorized as severe will not be 
confused with an SAE.  
Life Threatening  
• Life threatening consequences  
• Urgent intervention required 
Death  
8.2.2.3  Causality  
The possibility of whether the IP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the following:  
Reasonable possibility  
The term “reasonable possibility” conveys that there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event, rather than to imply that a relationship cannot be ruled out. The adverse event may occur as part of the pharmacologi cal 
action of the IP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence  
 
No reasonable possibility  
A causal relationship of the AE to IP administration is unlikely or remote , or other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event  
Causality should be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available information. Causality is to be reassessed as necessary and provided as additional information 
becomes available.  
8.2.2.4  Duration  
The investigator will record the start and stop dates of the event. The date of onset is the date 
when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. If the adverse event is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an ex amination, the onset date is the date the 
sample was taken,  or the examination was performed. For pre -existing clinically significant 
conditions (diagnosed or observed as a result of the screening procedures) becoming worse after 
IP administration, the dat e of onset is the date the worsening began. The date of outcome is the 
date the patient recovered or died, or that the disease condition worsened.  
8.2.2.5  Action Taken  
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as ap plicable 
(i.e. discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IP, as appropriate), and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were given for the event.  
 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
52 
 8.2.2.6  Outcome 
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs . The Investigator is 
responsible for following all SAEs until the event has resolved or has stabilized.  
8.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study.  
• Requires treatment, modification/interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention; or  
• Is judged to be of significant clinical importance.  
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be 
documented as an SAE.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or 
syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the e -CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a 
diagnosis or syndrom e, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If possible, the 
laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not as an abnormal laboratory result 
(e.g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).  
8.4 Adve rse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest include known side effects of Ifenprodil . Nausea, dry mouth, loss of 
appetite, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, allergic reactions, and heart palpitations 
are known to occur in between 0.1 – 5% of patients.  Elevated ALT/AST levels  have been observed in 
<1% of patient s. 
8.5 Pregnancy  
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female patient  or partner of a male patient  
must be reported immediately. The IP should be discontinued, and the patient  withdrawn from the trial.  
The Investigator will follow the female patient  until completion of the pregnancy and collect the outcome 
of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal, the Investigator should report the abnormal outcom e as an 
AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth 
should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that 
the Investigator suspects is related to the in -utero exposure to the IP should also be reported within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event . 
8.6 Serious Adverse Events  
8.6.1  SAE Definition  
An SAE is an adverse event at any dosage that:  
• Results in death ; 
• Is life threatening (in the opinion of the Investigator, at the time of the event;  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
• Results i n persistent or significant incapacity/disability ; 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
53 
 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event  
Important medical events are defined as those that that may not be immediately life- threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. Medical and scientific judgement 
should be exercised in deciding whether events qualify as medically importa nt. 
8.6.2  Reporting of Treatment Emergent SAEs  
In order to meet the requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific requirements to applicable regulatory authorities and IRB/IEC , all SAEs, must be reported to the Sponsor  within 24 hours 
from the time the site investigational team first be come aware of the event  using the appropriate method 
as outlined in the Safety Reporting Guidelines .  
As further information regarding the SAE becomes available, such follow -up information should be 
documented on a new SAE report form, marked as a follow -up report, and reported using the appropriate 
method as outlined in the Safety Reporting Guidelines .  
Withdrawal from the study in the event of an SAE and therapeutic measures taken shall be at the discretion of the Investigator. A full explanation for the discontinuation from the study should be made in the patient’s medical records and in the eCRF.  
A planned hospitalization will not be a requirement of SAE reporting.  
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consi stent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the patient  signs informed consent until 7 days after the last dose of IP) or any SAE made known 
to the Investigator at any time there after that is suspected of being related to IP.  
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary of 
hospital records and other relevant documents. If a patient  died and an autopsy has been performed, 
copies of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to the Investigator  as soon as these become 
available.  
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/ IEC of the SAE 
and providing them with all relevant i nitial and follow -up information about the event. The Investigator 
must keep copies of all SAE information on file, including correspondence with the IRB/ IEC. 
8.7 Follow -up of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
During the trial, t he Investigator must follow -up on each adverse event until it is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the patient is stable.  
After the patient’s last visit, the Investigator must follow -up on any adverse event classified as serious or 
considered to have a reasonable possible causality to the IP until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the patient is stable . The Sponsor’s Safety Surveillance Contact will follow all SAEs with 
outcomes pending until the last subject enrolled has completed the study.

 9. DATA HANDLING  
9.1 Data and Documents  
The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study and 
the distribution of the investigational product are complete, accurate, filed, and retained. Examples of source documents include: hospital records; clinic and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; 
patient ’s diaries or evaluation checklists; dispensing records; recorded data from automated instruments; 
copies or transcription s certified after verification as being accurate copies; microfiche; x -ray film and 
reports; and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico -technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
9.2 Electronic Case Record Form  
An e -CRF system provided by an independent third- party CRO will be used for data capture. The system 
is validated and access at all levels to the system is granted/revoked following the CRO ’s procedures, in 
accordance with regulatory and system requirements.  
Data s hould be entered into the system timely after the patient has attended a visit or after the data 
become available, as applicable.  
The Investigator will approve/authorise the e- CRF entries for each patient with an electronic signature 
which is equivalent to  a handwritten signature.  
The e -CRF system and the database will be hosted at the independent third party CRO. After the trial 
database is declared clean and released to the statistician, a final copy of the database will be stored at the 
Sponsor.  The Investigator will also receive a copy of the trial site’s final and locked data (including audit 
trail, electronic signature and queries) as write- protected PDF -files produced by the independent third 
party CRO. The PDF -files will be stored on a n appropriate electronic storage device and will be provided 
to the Investigator before access to the e- CRF is revoked.  
Errors occurring in the e -CRF will be corrected electronically. Such corrections/modifications will be 
automatically tracked by an audit trail detaili ng the date and time of the correction and the name of the 
person making the correction. 
9.3 Data Management  
Data will be collected via e -CRF and entered into the clinical database per the CRO’s standard operating 
procedures (SOPs). This data will be elect ronically verified through use of programmed edit checks 
specified by the clinical team. Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the 
database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  
9.4 Records Retention  
Essential documents must be retained by Canadian Investigators for a minimum of 25 years after conclusion of the clinical study.  For  other jurisdictions, e ssential documents must be retained by the 
Investigator for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH regi on, or at least 2 
years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator must retain these documents for the time period described above or according to local laws or requirements, whichever is longer. Essen tial documents are listed in Section 8 of the ICH consolidated 
guideline on GCP (Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial).  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
55 
 The Investigator must notify the Sponsor if he/she wishes to assign the essential documents to someone 
else, remove t hem to another location, or is unable to retain them for a specified period. The Investigator 
must obtain approval in writing from the Sponsor prior to destruction of any records. If the Investigator is 
unable to meet this obligation, the Investigator must  ask the Sponsor for permission to make alternative 
arrangements. Details of these arrangements should be documented.  
All study documents should be made available if required by relevant health authorities. The 
Investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.

 10. STATI STICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
10.1 Overview  
Key elements of the S tatistical A nalysis P lan (SAP)  are outlined in this section. The comprehensive plan 
will be documented in a separate SAP.  
10.2 Study Population Definitions  
The analysis populations are:  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT):  The ITT population consists of all enrolled  patient s assigned to receive 
treatment regardless of whether  they took study drug or stopped active treatment to receive only 
SOC . Patient s will be classified according to the treatment group to which they were randomized . 
• Per-Protocol (PP):  The PP population consists of all ITT patient s who are not major protocol 
violators with regards to inclusion/exclusion criteria, investigational product compliance and 
concomitant medication instructions. Protocol violations that would exclude patient s from the PP 
population will be defined and documented in the SAP  prior to unblinding.  
• Safety:  The Safety population consists of all patient s who received at least one dose of study 
drug. This population will be used for all assessments of safety and tolerability. Patient s will be 
summarized according to actual dose of study drug taken.  
10.3 Sample Size and Power Considerations  
 
For the pilot Phase 2b phase, a sample of 150 patients (50 in Arm A, Arm B and SOC) will be recruited. 
To account for drop out of 10%, a total of 168 patients will be enrolled.  
 
For the pivotal Phase 3 phase, A sample of 4 62 patients (2 31 in the SOC group and 231 in the active 
treatment group) achieves 90%  power to detect a change in the log odds ratio of 0.5596 when the 
significance level (alpha) is 0.05 using a two- sided test. A log odds ratio of 0.5596 corresponds to an odds 
ratio of 1.75 comparing treatment to SOC . The sample size was estimated using the Tests for Two 
Ordered Categorical Variables module in PASS 14 . To account for drop out of 10%, a total of 514 
patients will be enrolled . 
 The sample size assumes that the distribution of patients on day 15 will be as shown in Table 2
, which is 
scenario 4 in the WHO master protocol (2020)  for enrolled patients with moderate to severe disease under 
an odds ratio of 1.75.  
  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
57 
 Interim analysis and increasing the sample size  
An interim analysis during Phase 2b will be conducted on the ITT population when 75 patients complete 
the clinical status assessment at day 15 (the primary endpoint) . Details of outputs for interim analyses in 
Phase 3 will be specified in a separate mock shell document . A preliminary full analysis report of 150 
patients with up to Day 29 entered will  also be presented.  
The following design features will also be assessed for pos sible changes for Phase 3 during the second 
interim analysis  and/or final analysis for Phase2b.  
• Target population; eligibility criteria  
• The choice of primary endpoint  
• The need for seven categories in the outcome scale (versus fewer)  
• The distribution of pat ients across the outcome scale at day 15 
• The timing (day 15) of the primary endpoint  
10.4 Statistical Methods  
 
Complete details of the statistical analysis methods, including data conventions, will be provided in the SAP.  
10.4.1 General Conventions  
Results will be presented by treatment group.  
A baseline value is defined as the most recent available value collected or derived prior to the first study drug administration. A change from baseline value is defined as the difference between a result at a post -
baseline time point and the baseline value. A percent change from baseline is defined as the ratio of the 
change from baseline value relative to the baseline value expressed as a percentage.  
In general, continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g. arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum), as well as change from baseline for each 
applicable scheduled time point, when appropriate. Categorical variables will be summarized by 
frequency and percent observed in each category and at each time point as applicable. 95% CI may also be performed for some selected key outcomes of interest.  
10.5 Patient Disposition  
Patient  disposition (analysis population allocation, entered, discontinued along with primary reason for 
discontinuation, completed) will be summarized using frequency and percentage.  
A summary of patient s enrolled by site will be provided. 
Analysis sets and Protocol violations/deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.  
Patient disposition information will also be listed.  
10.6 Background and Demographic Characteristics  
Patient s’ age, height, weight, and other continuous demographic and baseline ch aracteristics will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, while gender, race, and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabulations. Medical history data will be summarized using frequency 
tabulations by system organ class and preferred term.  Analysis will be done using the safety set and listed.  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
58 
 10.7 Prior and Concomitant Medication  
Concomitant medications will be coded using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD) 
and are defined as all medications taken during study treatment (including day 1) up to and including the 
follow up period. The number and percentage of patient s using at least one concomitant medication will 
be displayed together with the number and percentage of patient s using at least one medication within 
each therapeutic class (ATC -Level 4) and preferred name (ATC -level 2). These will be summarized under 
safety analysis set and listed.  
10.8 Treatment Exposure and Compliance  
Treatment exposure and study drug compliance will be summarized using descriptive statistics under ITT , 
PP and Safety populations and listed.  
10.9 Efficacy  
10.9.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 
The SOC and treatment arms under WHO7 ordinal scale will be compa red with respect to the primary 
endpoint using proportional odds model s (ordinal logistic regression)  adjusted for site and age. Treatment 
will be compared to SOC by testing whether the common odds ratio differs from 1.0 at day 15 using two-
sided tests at 2.5% level of significance under the ITT population set, followed by PP population set. All 
modeling assumptions will be verified.  
Separate 95% CI and p- values will be computed across each of the ordinal scale between SOC and 
treatment arms for both ITT an d PP population sets. Multiple comparison techniques (to be detailed in the 
SAP) will be employed to ensure type I error is controlled to 5% for these comparisons.  
If, following the Phase 2b interim analysis  or final analysis , the primary endpoint changes  for Phase 3 , 
details will be written in the SAP, and a protocol amendment will be created.  
10.9.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Time to events, like initiation of mechanical ventilation, death, or hospital/ICU discharge, will be 
summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and analyzed using proportional hazards regression where 
appropriate . VAS cough score will be summarized descriptively. All secondary efficacy analyses will be  
analyzed using an appropriate 2-sided hypothesis test  at 5% level of signif icance using ITT and PP 
population sets . Assumptions of all models and tests will be verified.  
 
10.10 Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by AEs, laboratory testing (haematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), and vital signs.  
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population ( Section 10.2
). Treatment -emergent 
AEs will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summa rized by system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship 
to IP. Treatment Emergent Adverse events leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment and 
TESAEs will also be tabulated. All adverse events, regardless of whether it  is treatm ent emergent or not, 
will be listed.  
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3

 Laboratory data will be summarized descriptively by visit. In addition, shift tables showing the number of 
patient s with values low, normal, and high compared to the normal ranges pre -treatment versus post-
treatment will be provided  for the applicable lab parameters. Change from baseline analysis will also be 
reported if applicable.  All laboratory data will be listed . 
Vital sign measurements, including weight, will be summarized descriptively by visit a nd presented as 
shift tables  and listed .

 11. CHANGES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE TRIAL  
11.1 Protocol Amendments  
Any change to this Protocol will be documented in a Protocol Amendment, issued by either Algernon 
Pharmaceuticals or designated CRO, and agreed upon by both the Algernon Pharmaceuticals  and the 
Investigator prior to its implementation.  
Protocol amendments will be submitted for notification of Regulatory authorities and IECs in accordance 
with local regulations . IEC approval is requ ired for any substantial amendment i.e. one which could affect 
the safety of the patients, or which entails a change to the desi gn and/or scope of the trial.  
Changes to the protocol intended to eliminate immediate hazards to trial patients may be implemented prior to IEC approval.  
11.2 Deviations from the Protocol  
Deviations from protocol should not occur. In the event of a deviati on from protocol, the Investigator 
must inform the Monitor, and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Any 
deviation must be documented in writing ( and included in e -CRF data ). A set of deviations must also be 
accompanied by a description of the deviation, the relevant dates, and the action taken. A Log of Protocol 
Deviation Reports will be maintained by the Investigator  or CRO. Deviation reports and supporting 
documentation must be kept in the Investigator’s File and the Trial Ma ster File.  
11.3 Premature Trial Termination  
Both the Sponsor and the  Investigator (with regard to his/her participation) reserve the right to terminate 
the trial at any time . Should this become necessary, the procedure shall be agreed upon following 
consul tation between Sponsor  and the Investigator . Both the Investigator and the Sponsor  will ensure that 
appropriate consideration is given to the protection of the best interests of the patients. Regulatory authorities and IECs will be informed.  
In addition, t he Sponsor  reserves the right to terminate the participation of individual trial sites. 
Conditions that may warrant termination include but  are not limited to: insufficient adherence to protocol 
requirements; failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate; falsification of records; and GCP non-
compliance .

 12. MONITORING PROCEDURES  
12.1 Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification  
In accordance with applicable regulations including GCP, Monitors from the CRO will contact the site 
prior to the start of th e study to review with the site staff the protocol, study requirements, and their 
responsibilities to satisfy regulatory and ethical requirements.  
When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the e -CRF will serve as the source document.  
The monitor will verify that the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate, and complete  
• Safety and rights of patient s are being protected  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements  
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents.  
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of the entries 
made onto the e -CRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any resulting discrepancies will be 
reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her sta ff. Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the 
e-CRFs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that 
informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and documentation of SAEs and their proper 
recording be verified. Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study- specific monitoring 
plan.  
Remote monitoring considerations:   
Remote monitoring activities may be used as a method to assess a site’s compliance with the protocol, 
ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. Examples of when remote monitoring may be utilized 
are in preparation for or in between on- site monitoring visits, interim data analyses and data locks. During 
remote monitoring, eCRF data can be reviewed for t imeliness of entry, completeness, internal 
consistency, protocol and ICH GCP compliance and logic. Remote monitoring activities may also include selected source data review and verification where source documents are available remotely. There are 
certain l imitations when conducting remote monitoring as there is no physical or direct access to review 
source documentation, facilities and Investigational Product (IP). In exceptional circumstances, remote 
monitoring may be conducted in lieu of on- site monitorin g, e.g. implementation of restrictive site policies 
due to a major COVID -19 disease outbreak or other health crises. Remote monitoring can be conducted 
when it is included in the study- specific monitoring plan.  
12.2 Audits and Inspections  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicab le regulatory requirements, the Monitor may conduct a 
quality assurance assessment and/or audit of the site record s, and the regulatory agencies may conduct a 
regulatory i nspection at any time during or after completion of the study.  
In the event of an assessment, audit or inspection, the  investigator (and institution) must agree to grant the 
advisor(s), auditor(s) and in spector(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time 
and the  time of their st aff to discuss the conduct of the study, any findings/relevant issues and to 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
62 
 implement any corrective and/or preventative actions to address any findings/issues identified. If the 
Investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact the Sponsor immediately.

 14. REGULATORY AND ETHICAL ASPECTS  
14.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of 
this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, its authorized representative, and Investigator  abide by 
GCP, as described in ICH Guideline E6, an d in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in 
the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/ IEC prior to commencement. 
The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable nation al, state, and 
local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
14.2 Investigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for GCP and in the local regulations. The Sponsor or an authorized representative will eval uate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select 
their staff.   
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, and their study- related duties and f unctions. The Investigator 
should maintain a list of sub- Investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she 
has delegated significant study- related duties.  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all patient s who sign an ICF and are screened for 
entry into the study. Patient s who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the patient ’s source 
documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during monitoring 
visits to review data, resolve queries, and allow direct access to patient  records (e.g. medical records, 
office charts, hospital charts, and study- related charts) for source data verification. The Investigator must 
ensure timely and accurate completion of e- CRFs and queries.  
14.3 Patient Information and Informed Consent  
An English master version of the Patient Information and Informed Consent documents will be provided 
for translation and adaptation into local languages. If changes are made to the Patient Inf ormation and 
Informed Consent documents by the IEC and/or the trial sites, the amended documents must be submitted 
back to the Sponsor for approval.  
The patient will receive a copy of the patient information and his/her signed consent.  
The Investigator wil l obtain a freely given written consent from each patient after an appropriate 
explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards, and any other aspects of the trial 
which are relevant to the patient’s decision to participate. The tr ial patient must be given ample time to 
consider participation in the trial, before the consent is obtained. The informed consent form must be 
signed and dated by the patient before he is exposed to any trial -related procedure, including screening 
tests fo r eligibility. The Investigator will also sign and date the form.  
The Investigator will explain that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the trial or to 
withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without the need to 
justify their decision.  
If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the trial patient’s willingness to continue participation in the trial, a new patient information and informed consent form will be forwarded to the 
Ifenprodil   CONFIDENTIAL  Version 2.0, 16- November -2020  
Clinical Trial Protocol AGN120 -3   
65 
 IECs (and regulatory authority, if required). The trial patients will be informed about this new information 
and re -consent will be obtained.  
Each patient will be informed that the monitor(s), quality assurance auditor(s) assigned by sponsor or 
mandated by r egulatory authority inspector(s), in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, 
may review his/her source records and data. Data protection will be handled in compliance with ICH 
guideline, local laws, and local regulations.  
14.4 Confidentiality  
The Sponsor  affirms the patient 's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance 
with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). T he Sponsor requires the  Investigator 
will permit the Sponsor ’s representatives and , when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities 
to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the patient ’s 
signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the patient 
or his/her legal representative.  
14.5 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/ IEC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their dates of 
issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.  
Investigational product can only be supplied to an Investigator by the Sponsor or its authorized representative after documentation on all e thical and legal requirements for starting the study has been 
received by the Sponsor or its authorized representative . This documentation must also include a list of 
the members of the IRB/ IEC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/ IEC will n ot disclose the 
names, occupations, and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accept ed as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/ IEC 
should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number (if applicable), study site (or region or area 
of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other documents reviewed. It must mention t he date on which the 
decision was made and must be officially signed by a committee member. Before the first patient  is 
enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met.  
The IRB/ IEC and, if applicable, the authorities must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments 
in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal 
approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.  
14.6 End-of-Trial and End- of-Trial Notification  
End-of-Trial is defined as the date the last patient performs the last visit in the trial. At the end of the trial, 
the regulatory authorities and IECs will be notified of trial completion according to national requirements.

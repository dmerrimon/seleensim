PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 4 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  1.0 Objectives  
 The purpose of the study is to determine if opiates are required to 
achieve adequate analgesia after knee arthroscopy and ACL 
reconstruction in outpatient surgery.  
 We hypothesize that patients are frequently prescribed more 
opiates than are needed after surgery, resulting in excess 
medications that are at risk for misuse, diversion and contribution 
to the opioid epidemic.  
 
2.0 Backgro und 
Perioperative pain management is an important aspect of quality patient care. 
Opioid pain medications are increasingly being used for pain control, with the 
United States writing over 250 million prescriptions for painkillers per year [1]. 
Increased usage has led to unintended negative consequences for individuals and 
society. It is estimated that 46 people die each day from an overdose of 
prescription painkillers, and individual use can lead to the development of 
tolerance and worse treatment o utcomes [1, 2]. Further issues arise when opioids 
are misused, it is estimated that n ontherapeutic use has increased three fold in 
recent years [3]. In the United States alone in 2006 the estimated total cost of 
opioid prescription misuse was $53.4 billion, of which $42 billion was attributed 
to lost productivity, $8.2 billion to cr iminal justice cost and the remainder drug 
abuse treatment and medical complications [4]. The federal government has 
recognized this epidemic and raised a call for clinicians to more responsibly 
prescribe opiate pain medications [5]. 
 
Opiate use has increased in recent years, from 2000 -2010 the use of opiates in 
office based visits nearly doubled from 11.3% to 19.6% whereas there was no 
change in the prescribing of non -opioid pharmacotherapies. Further, when 
specifically looking at new musculoskeletal pain visits, one half resulted in 
pharm acologic treatment, with the prescribing of non -opioid pharmacotherapies 
decreasing from 38%  to 29% from 2000 to 2010, respectively [6]. The clinical use 
of opioids for post -operative pain control has also been linked to the opioid 
epidemic and risk of future abuse [7]. Legitimate opioid use before high school 
graduation is independently associated with a 33% increased risk  of future misuse 
after high school [8]. 
 
It has been estimated that orthopedic surgeons prescribe 7.7% of all opioids in the 
United States [9].Special attention needs to be paid to the amount of opioid pain 
medications orthopedic surgeons prescribe to patients after ambulatory surgery, 
there is considerable variability amo ng surgeon and procedure in regards to the 
amount of opioids to pre scribe with many patients left with excess unused 
medication [10].An analysis of 250 patients undergoing outpatient upper extremity 
surgery found that on average patients consumed 10 opioid pills, with 19 pills left 
over and a total of 4,639 pills going unused in the cohort [10]. Leftover 
prescription opioids are at risk for div ersion to family and friends for nonmedical 
use[11]. Further studies are needed to quantify the amount of opioids to prescribe 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 5 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  for specific orthopedic procedures to limit excess narcotic use, misuse, diversion 
and contribution to the opioid epidemic.

7.0 Study Timelines  
This study will be observational in nature. Patient will fill out a 
preoperative questionnaire related to specific risk factors for opiate 
use/abuse. Following their operation a phone call will be placed  at 24 
hours, 48 hours, and between 7 -14 days after surgery and asked how many 
opiate pain medications they took, how many are left over and when the 
date they stopped taking them. If they are still taking pain medications at 
that point 1 follow -up call wi ll be placed at 21 days again asking the same 
questions. Maximum total length of the study will be 21 days post -
surgery.  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 6 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020   
8.0 Study Endpoints  
This study is observational in nature. The study will end once we have collected 
data for 60 patients for each  arm in order to sufficiently power the subsequent 
analysis  as a level 1 prospective study . 
 
9.0 Procedures Involved  
This study will be a pilot randomized control trial to establish non -
inferiority in opiate prescribing patterns.  
 
Eligible patients will be identified in clinic by the treating attending 
physician. Patients will subsequently be approached by research personnel 
at that time. In the event that a patient determines that they wish to pursue 
surgery and this is discussed by phone without an additio nal clinic visit 
they will be approached on the day of surgery by our research staff.  
 
All patients will fill out a preoperative questionnaire asking them the 
questions below related to specific risk factors for opiate use/abuse.  
 
 Age 
 Sex 
 BMI  
 Do you actively smoke cigarettes?  
 If no, have you ever consistently smoked cigarettes (daily for > 1 month)?  
 What is your employment status?  
 Is this injury part of a workers ’ compensation claim?  
 Are you actively participating in organized sporting activities? If so, at 
what level (i .e. professional, college, recreational) ? 
 Are you currently using narcotic pain medications?  
 Do you have a personal history  of substance abuse  (ex. prescription or 
illicit drugs, alcohol) ? 
 Do you have a family history of substance a buse (ex. prescription or illicit 
drugs, alcohol) ? 
 What is the highest level of education you attained?  
 What is your average yearly household income?  
 
Additionally, the patients undergoing knee arthroscopy will be 
randomized into two groups prior to surger y by the research staff.  The 
surgeons’ physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the 
appropriate medications.  
 
 Group 1:  Will have all of their post -operative prescriptions sent 
down to the pharmacy on the day of surgery to be collected.  
 Group 2:  Will have all prescriptions sent to pharmacy with the 
exception of an opiate prescription. Instead, they will be handed a 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 7 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  physical paper prescription. They will be instructed to only fill the 
prescription if absolutely needed.  
 
The patients under going ACL reconstruction surgery will be randomized 
into two groups prior to surgery by the research staff. The surgeons’ 
physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the appropriate 
medications.  
 Group 1:  Will be prescribed 60 opiate tablets in  addition to other 
routine post -operative pain medication regimens.  
 Group 2:  Will be prescribed 30 opiate tablets in addition to other 
routine post -operative pain medication regimens.  
 
In order to limit potential variability in sample size, block randomiz ation 
will be utilized with the following parameters: 18 blocks with 5 patients in 
each block. The blocks will be as follows  (Block #/#/#) : 
 
Block (1/7/13 ) 
22112  
 
Block  (2/8/14 ) 
11221  
 
Block  (3/9/15 ) 
21121  
 
Block  (4/10/16 ) 
21122  
 
Block  (5/11/17 ) 
21211  
 
Block  (6/12/18 ) 
22121  
 
A computer program will randomly select a block number. Once a block is 
selected patients will be enrolled in the order listed in the block. For 
example, if block 6 is selected initially Patient 1 will be enrolled in Group 
2, Patient  2 will be enrolled in group 2, Patient 3 will be enrolled in group 
1, etc. After every 5th patient is randomized to a group a new block will be 
randomly selected.  
 
The surgeons’ physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the 
appropriate med ications.  To clarify, we do not electronically prescribe C2 
medications as a routine part of practice and do not intend to as part of the 
study . 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 8 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  All patients will be provided the same counseling regardless of the amount 
of narcotics they are prescribed. In the event that a patient requires 
additional narcotics on top of the original prescription the treating surgeon 
will need to be notified in order to accurately a ssess the amount already 
consumed and appropriately prescribe additional medications.  
 
Please note that there is considerable variability in opiate prescribing 
between practitioners. Patient's that undergo ACL reconstruction typically 
are prescribed between 30 -60 Norco depending on the practitioner. Our 
randomization falls within the variability of the current standard for which 
there is no evidence based literature.  Additionally, we are attempting to 
discern if 30 opiate tablets would be sufficient f or patient s undergoing 
ACL reconstruction. W e suspect that the majority of patients prescribed 
60 tablets do not take greater than 50% of what they are prescribed. We 
are interested in determining the number of opiates left over after ACL 
reconstruction an d if the amount prescribed affects the total amount 
consumed.  
 
Following their operation, all patients will have Pain -Numeric Pain 
Rating Scale (NPRS) assessed at 2 hours post -surgery  by the authorized 
co-investigators or research staff while the patient is recovering in the 
post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) .  
 
Additionally, a phone call will be placed at 24 hours, 48 hours and 
between 7 -14 days after surgery and asked  a Numeric Pain Rating Score 
(NPRS) , how many opiate pain medications they took, how many are left 
over and when the date they stopped taking them.  
NPRS scores can be performed verbally. The following statement will be 
provided to patients:  
The 11 -point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme 
(e.g. “no pain”) to '10' repre senting the other pain extreme (e.g. “pain as 
bad as you can imagine” or “worst pain imaginable”), please rate your 
pain on a scale of 0 -10. 
If they are still taking pain medications at that point, an additional follow -
up call will be placed at 21 days  (+1-3 days)  after surgery asking the same 
questions.  We will allow 4 total phone calls (24 hours, 48 hours, 7 -14 
days, and 21 (+ 1 to 3) days post -surgery. If patients continue to take 
narcotics 21 days after surgery they will be listed as >3 weeks of narcoti c 
use) 
 
Refill requests will also be recorded.  
 
Maximum total length of the study will be 21 days post -surgery.

26.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
N/A 
 
27.0 Economic Burden to  Subject s 
There may be the possibility that there will be a greater expense to subjects who 
are in ACL -Group 1 as they will be required to pay for two times the number of 
pain pills.  However, f or patient's paying cash, the cost for 30 and 60 Norco at the 
Northwester n Walgreens  are $31.49 and $56.99 respectively. This discrepancy 
will likely be less for those with prescription insurance. Some patients are 
prescribed 60 Norco as standard of practice so those being prescribed 30 are 
incurring less of an expense. This co uld potentially be somewhat of a  benefit of 
the study.  
 
28.0 Consent Process  
Each subject enrolled in the study will provide informed consent for 
participation in the study.   
 
Informed consent will initially take place during initial contact with 
potential sub jects in the orthopedic surgery clinic. Risks, benefits, and 
alternatives of participation in the study as well as the ability to withdraw 
participation at any time will be discussed with the eligible subject.  
Understanding of these aspects of the study a s well as whether the 
potential subject would like to enroll in the study will be confirmed over 
the phone.

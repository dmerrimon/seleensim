USARIEM, Natick MA: USARIEM is a DoD research facility within the US Army Medical 143 
Research and Development Command.  It is the Institute responsible for conducting basic and 144 
applied research to determine the effects of exposure to environmental extremes, occupational 145 
tasks, physical training, deployment, operational stress and nutritional factors on the health and 146 
performance of military personnel.  The facility contains environmental chambers for controlling 147 
temperature and humidity, an environmentally controlled hypobaric chamber, a water immersion 148 
laboratory, as well as several dry and wet laboratories for animal and human experimentation.  149 
The dry laboratories are capable of a broad range of experiments, including biomechanical 150 
analysis, body composition, energy expenditure, and muscle strength and endurance.  The wet 151 
laboratories include general clinical chemistry analyzers, as well as equipment for ELISA, RIA, 152 
histology, and molecular biology assays.  Each investigator at the facility has a personal 153 
computer with software for data management, analysis, presentation and report generation.  154 
Staff computers are interfaced with a network server for easy, secure data handling and 155

SECTION B:  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 160 
 161 
B1.  ABSTRACT    162 
 163 
Endurance exercise elicits skeletal muscle and systemic inflammation, reflected in large part by 164 
increases in circulating concentrations of the pleotropic cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6).  Circulating 165 
IL-6 facilitates skeletal muscle tissue repai r and serves as an energy sensor during prolonged 166 
endurance exercise by upregulating glycogenolysis to maintain blood glucose.  The IL- 6 167 
response to endurance exercise is normally attenuated with adequate rest and recovery as 168 
skeletal muscle adapts with training.  However, performing repeated bouts of prolonged and 169 
unaccustomed, muscle damaging (i.e., eccentric loading) endurance exercise may be 170 
detrimental to performance and limit the adaptive responses to exercise by diminishing the 171 
absorption of key nutrients (i.e., iron). Warfighters are commonly exposed to such exercise 172 
bouts during sustained training and combat operations (SUSOPS), the effects of which may be 173 
exacerbated by negative energy balance.   We recently reported that IL-6 and hepcidin, a 174 
hepatic-derived protein that arises in response to inflammation and limits iron absorption, 175 
increased by approximately 245% and 33%, respectively in Norwegian Soldiers participating in 176 
a short-term (96 h) Arctic SUSOPS [1].  Circulating hepcidin concentrations post-SUSOPS were 177 
associated with total daily energy expenditure ( r = 0.4), energy intake ( r = -0.26), and energy 178 
balance ( r = -0.43), suggesting that nutritional interventions designed to increase energy intake 179 
during SUSOPS may attenuate IL-6 and its untoward downstream effects by limiting the 180

 magnitude of energy deficit.  However, these data, which were derived from an uncontrolled 181 
military field study, are not indicative of causality and changes in iron absorption.  Therefore, t o 182 
define the putative role of energy balance on IL -6 and its downstream effects , we will conduct a 183 
controlled laboratory study that simulates the physiological stressors imposed during SUSOPS 184 
to determine if the IL-6 response is exacerbated by underfeeding.   Fifteen male, weight-stable , 185 
active duty military personnel (aged 18 – 39 years) will be recruited to participate in a 22 d, 186 
longitudinal study.  The study is comprised of four sequential phases: 1) a 72 h SUSOPS, 2) a 7 187 
day recovery period (Recovery 1), 3) a second, 72 h SUSOPS, and 4) a final, 7 d recovery 188 
period (Recovery 2).   During SUSOPS, subjects will be randomized to consume either sufficient 189 
food (combat rations) to maintain energy balance within ± 10% of estimated total daily energy 190 
expenditure (SUSOPS BAL) or will be provided only enough food to match 45% of total dail y 191 
energy expenditure to elicit severe negative energy balance (SUSOPS NEG BAL). Testing 192 
procedures and primary outcome measures include dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 193 
maximal and sub-maximal aerobic exercise testing, load carriage exercise, controlled feeding, 194 
stable isotope assessments of energy expenditure, fractional iron absorption and whole-body 195 
protein turnover, percutaneous muscle biopsies to assess intramuscular IL-6, glycogen status, 196 
and regulators of muscle remodeling and substrate metabolism, intestinal permeability, gut 197 
microbiome composition and function, and blood sampling to assess circulating concentrations 198 
of IL-6 and other biomarkers of inflammation, muscle damage, nutritional , metabolic stress, and 199 
immune responses to SUSOPS BAL and NEG BAL.  Physical performance will be assessed 200 
before and after each SUSOPS and during each recovery period using the vertical jump test.  201 
Self-reported mood, sustained attention, and cognitive performance will be assessed twice daily 202 
using the Profile of Mood States, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, the Evaluation of Risk 203 
Questionnaire, the Match- to-Sample task, the Grammatical Reasoning test, and the N-Back 204 
task.   Overall vigilance and nighttime sleep quality will be assessed via the wrist-worn 205 
USARIEM Vigilance Monitoring System, the Fatigue Science ReadiBandTM actigraph, Philips 206 
Respironics Actiwatch® Spectrum Plus, or equivalent device. This design will test the 207 
hypothesis that maintaining energy balance will attenuate the IL-6 response to SUSOPS, 208 
improve iron absorption, and attenuate the potential negative effects of excessive inflammation 209 
on whole-body metabolic homeostasis.   Risks include those associated with venous 210 
catheterization, venipuncture, muscle biopsies, DEXA, exercise, and the discomfort of severe 211 
underfeeding.            212

B2.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   214 
 215 
Physiology of the Inflammatory Response to Exercise  216 
Prolonged strenuous exercise is characterized by a large increase in circulating concentrations 217 
of IL-6 ( Figure 1A ) followed by increases in cytokine inhibitors, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist 218 
(IL-1ra), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [2-4]. In fact, concentrations of IL- 6 219 
consistently increase more than any other cytokine during an exercise bout [5]. The immediate 220 
increase in circulating concentrations of IL-6 with exercise is mediated by the transcriptional 221 
upregulation and release of IL-6 by contracting skeletal muscle fibers [6, 7]. Although many 222 
cytokines are expressed in skeletal muscle (termed ‘myokines’) after prolonged exercise [8], IL- 223 
6 is the only myokine known to be released from skeletal muscle in appreciable concentrations. 224 
IL-6 synthesized and released by contracting skeletal muscle during prolonged exercise is 225 
thought to exert metabolic effects and is dependent on muscle glycogen availability [6, 7, 9] 226 
(Figure 1B ). For example, reduction in intramuscular glycogen prior to exercise increases 227 
transcription of IL-6 mRNA in skeletal muscle and plasma IL-6 concentrations [6, 7], an effect 228 
which may be mediated through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase [10] and p38 229

 mitogen activated protein kinase [6]. Moreover, infusion of humans with recombinant human IL- 230 
6 (rhIL-6) induces a dose- dependent rise in blood glucose concentrations [11] and increases in 231 
glucose disposal [12, 13], indicating that IL-6 may signal for hepatic glucose release to maintain 232 
blood glucose during exercise. In addition to increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and 233 
gluconeogenesis, rhIL-6 enhances lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes [14, 15] , 234 
perhaps to provide free fatty acids and energy when glycogen stores are low. 235 
Another source of IL-6 is immune cells. During recovery from exercise, microstructural damage 236 
as a result of microtrauma to contractile elements and connective tissue within muscle tissue 237 
signal immune cell infiltration and secretion of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, 238 
IL-6, IL-1ra, and IL-10) to heal the tissue. The rapid release of TNF-α and IL-1β stimulate the 239 
production of IL-6, which in turn, is thought to be the central mediator in activating the acute- 240 
phase response and the systemic release of hepatocyte-derived acute phase proteins [16] . 241 
These are likely delayed or secondary to the metabolic effects of IL-6 during exercise (i.e., 242 
during recovery), as peak circulating concentrations of muscle-derived IL-6 occur immediately 243 
following exercise and are acute, whereas IL-6 produced by immune cells occurs after this 244 
peak, is of lower magnitude, and may remain elevated for an extended period of time to repair 245 
the damaged tissue [5, 17, 18] ( Figure 1A ).  246 
247 
Figure 1. Plasma IL-6 response to exercise and potential nutritional interventions. (A) IL-6 is released into 248 
circulati on by contracting skeletal muscle (i.e., ‘muscle-derived IL-6’) during prolonged, strenuous 249 
exercise. This produces a large peak in circulating concentrations of IL-6 immediately after the completion 250 
of exercise followed by a rapid decline to baseline concentrations. If tissue injury occurs with exercise 251 
(e.g., strenuous eccentric exercise), immune cells infiltrate the muscle and release IL-6 to signal the 252 
acute-phase response and tissue repair (i.e., ‘immune cell-derived IL-6’). This produces a rise in 253 
circulating concentrations of IL-6 that is lower in magnitude, but more sustained than concentrations of IL- 254 
6 in circulating following exercise. Sufficient calories to match the energy requirement prior to exercise 255 
and carbohydrate supplementation during prolonged, strenuous exercise may be an effective strategy to 256 
reduce increases in muscle-derived IL-6 immediately following exercise. (B) Glycogen stores are depleted 257 
with prolonged, strenuous exercise. Reductions in muscle glycogen signal for the transcriptional 258 
upregulation of IL-6. IL-6 is released from contracting muscle, resulting in a rise in circulating levels of IL- 259 
6. IL-6 signals for hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Prolonged exercise also signals for the 260 
upregulation of IL- 6 in adipose tissue and an increase in lipolysis. Circulating fatty acids and glucose and 261 
fatty acids released from lipolysis of intramuscular triglycerides are transported to muscle mitochondria for 262 
oxidation, resulting in increased ATP and energy for the exercising muscle. Dietary carbohydrate and lipid 263 
increase available glucose and free fatty acids and stores of glycogen and triglycerides, thereby sparing 264 
glycogen. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; FFA, free fatty acids; IL-6, interleukin-6 (figures adapted from 265

 Factors that affect the source and magnitude of IL-6 released from muscle and immune cells in 267 
response to exercise include mode and location of muscle mass, frequency, duration, intensity, 268 
and training status [reviewed in [5, 13, 17, 18]]. In general, eccentric and strenuous exercise 269 
involving multiple muscle groups for prolonged durations produces the greatest increase in IL- 6 270 
as a cytokine and myokine, respectively. Although skeletal muscle damage is not required for 271 
the release of IL-6 from muscle during and immediately following exercise [5], it is important to 272 
note that the release of muscle- and immune cell-derived IL-6 is not mutually exclusive. Higher 273 
concentrations of muscle-derived IL-6 during and immediately following exercise generally 274 
indicate greater muscle damage, leading to an increase in immune cell infiltration and the time 275 
required for tissue repair and regeneration.  276 
Potential Detriments of Inflammation on Iron Absorption during Sustained Operations 277 
The release of IL-6 during exercise has been described as a double-edged sword [20], as IL- 6 278 
has the potential for both beneficial and detrimental effects. Beneficial adaptations resulting 279 
from exercise occur when the stressor dose and the exercise bout are within a specific range 280 
and followed by a rest period [21], whereas detrimental effects may occur when the dose or 281 
exercise bout is excessive and not followed by periods of adequate rest and nutrition. For 282 
example, repeated bouts of exercise on the same day or over the course of two days elevates 283 
circulating concentrations of immune cells and induces a more pronounced increase in plasma 284 
IL-6 as compared to a single bout of exercise [22, 23] . Further, repeated bouts of exercise 285 
without adequate rest and nutrition may result in decreased performance, particularly if muscle 286 
glycogen concentrations are low prior to exercise (e.g., fasted state, inadequate recovery, etc.) 287 
or if the duration of exercise is too long to maintain glycogen stores.  288 
Importantly, sustained elevations in IL- 6 may result in a decline in nutrient absorption, 289 
particularly the nutritionally essential mineral iron. Circulating levels of iron increase immediately 290 
following exercise and decline with recovery [24]. Inflammation, specifically the release of IL-6, 291 
is known to contribute to the decline in iron (termed the ‘hypoferremia of inflammation’). For 292 
example, infusion of humans or animals with IL-6 reduces circulating concentrations of iron 293 
>50% [25, 26]. The mechanism for the hypoferremia of inflammation is well established and 294 
involves IL-6-induced increases in the hepatic, acute-phase protein hepcidin [26]. Hepcidin is 295 
thought to bind to Cys326 in the extracellular domain of the iron exporter ferroportin [27], resulting 296 
in the phosphorylation and subsequence ubiquitination of ferroportin [28]. The hepcidin- 297 
ferroportin complex is then endocytosed and degraded in the lysosome [29], thereby inhibiting 298 
iron efflux into circulation. 299 
Human and rodent models suggest that IL- 6 may contribute to the exercise-induced increase in 300 
hepcidin, as rises in hepcidin are subsequent to the post-exercise increase in muscle-derived 301 
IL-6 [19]. Work from our laboratory indicates declines in iron status during military training [30, 302 
31], concomitant with increased inflammatory biomarkers, including IL-6 and hepcidin [32, 33] . 303 
As poor iron status is associated with a decrease in cognitive and physical performance [31] 304 
these data indicate that prolonged or repeated IL-6-mediated increases in hepcidin during 305 
training may be of concern if resulting in diminished iron status. 306 
Nutritional Countermeasures to Inflammation: Role of Substrate Availability and Energy 307 
Balance 308 
Sparing muscle glycogen and maximizing recovery is essential for optimal performance during 309 
exercise and in conferring the adaptive benefits of repeated exercise bouts with recovery (i.e., 310

 training). Because IL-6 is thought to respond to the energy available to the exercising muscle, 311 
various nutritional interventions have been studied with the goal of mitigating increases in 312 
circulating concentrations of IL-6 [19] . Collectively, these studies suggest that diets providing 313 
adequate energy and that are high in carbohydrate (>60%) prior to exercise may attenuate the 314 
depletion of glycogen stores and the resulting muscle-derived IL-6 response following exercise. 315 
This is consistent with the notion that IL-6 release from contracting skeletal muscle is related to 316 
pre-exercise glycogen availability [9] and that circulating concentrations of IL-6 post-exercise 317 
are negatively correlated with skeletal muscle glycogen concentrations [34] such that the 318 
duration and intensity of the exercise must be great enough to decrease skeletal muscle 319 
glycogen concentrations for diet to have an effect.  320 
Sustained Operations, Energy Balance and Inflammation: Observations from Military 321 
Field Studies 322 
Military personnel experience periods of negative energy balance resulting from increased 323 
energy expenditure, limited dietary intake, or combined effects of both during sustained combat 324 
and training operations (SUSOPS).   Warfighters engaged in various SUSOPS (i.e., 1-7 d 325 
operations, separated by minimal rest (1-3 d), and repeated for ≥ a month) expend an average 326 
of 4600 kcal/d [35, 36].  In some cases, energy expenditure may exceed these levels; total 327 
energy expenditures for Marines engaged in mountain warfare training exceed 7000 kcal/d [37].  328 
During military training and operations, energy supply and intake may be insufficient to maintain 329 
energy balance, thus resulting in extreme energy deficits [35, 38].  For example, mean energy 330 
expenditure during a 54-hr field training exercise was 6100 kcal/d for men, yet energy intake did 331 
not exceed 1500 kcal/d, resulting in a significant loss of total body mass [39].  Prolonged or 332 
repeat exposure to periods of negative energy balance can diminish physical performance, and 333 
may increase the risk of injury.  334 
Military training and operations have been associated with inflammation and degraded 335 
nutritional status.  For example, short-term (7 d) military training results in significant elevations 336 
in IL-6 and hepcidin [33].  Longer-term military training, such as basic combat training (7-10 wk), 337 
results in diminished iron status, which may be due to the physiologic response to repeated 338 
exposure to IL-6 [30-32].  A number of studies have investigated the effect of macronutrients, 339 
including carbohydrates, on the inflammatory and immune response to physical activity [40, 41], 340 
although these studies have not carefully controlled for energy intake.  The relationship between 341 
energy balance and the inflammatory response, particularly the hepcidin response, is not well 342 
described.  Previous studies from our laboratory show that  IL-6 and hepcidin increased by 343 
approximately 245% ( Figure 2A) and 33% ( Figure 2B), respectively in Norwegian Soldiers 344 
participating in a short-term 96-h Arctic SUSOPS that produced high energy expenditures 345 
(~6000 kcal/d) and severe energy deficits (~50% total energy expenditure) [1].  Circulating 346 
hepcidin concentrations post-SUSOPS were associated with total daily energy expenditure ( r = 347 
0.4), energy intake ( r = -0.26), and energy balance ( r = -0.43 , Figure 2C) [1].  Collectively, these 348

 data indicate that interventions aiming at maintaining energy balance during periods of high 349 
energy expenditure should be considered in efforts to attenuate the inflammatory response 350 
associated with energy deprivation and military training.  Although observational studies have 351 
uncovered statistical associations between energy balance and physiological outcomes, 352 
intervention studies have not directly tested the hypothesis that preventing energy deficit 353 
attenuates the inflammatory response, particularly the hepcidin response, to arduous physical 354 
activity. 355

Secondary Objectives 360 
 361 
Military Operational Stress, Intestinal Permeability, and Gut Microbiota Composition 362 
 363 
Decreased gut barrier integrity has been reported following exposure to physical and 364 
psychological stressors such as those commonly experienced during military training [42-44].  365 
The resulting increase in intestinal permeability can facilitate translocation of antigens from the 366 
gut into systemic circulation thereby inducing inflammation that can worsen gut barrier 367 
dysfunction [43].  A critical mediator of gut barrier integrity is the composition and activity of the 368 
bacteria residing in the human gut, the gut microbiota [45].  Our laboratory recently reported a 369 
positive association between changes in serum IL-6 concentrations and changes in intestinal 370 
permeability in Norwegian Soldiers participating in a 96-h Arctic SUSOPS characterized by 371 
severe energy deficit [44].  Changes in intestinal permeability and inflammation coincided with 372 
pronounced shifts in gut microbiota composition and activity, and changes in intestinal 373 
permeability were associated with both the composition of the microbiota before SUSOPS and 374 
changes in microbiota activity during SUSOPS [44].  Severe energy deficit alone has been 375 
shown to adversely affect gut barrier integrity, and gut microbiota composition and activity [46, 376 
47].  The gap in knowledge is to what extent decrements in intestinal permeability and the gut 377 
microbiome can be mitigated by maintaining energy balance during SUSOPS.  We will address 378 
this gap by measuring intestinal permeability and gut microbiome composition and function. 379 
 380 
A primary finding from our Norwegian study was that of an increase in gut microbiota diversity 381 
which was associated with increases in intestinal permeability during SUSOPS.  Greater 382 
diversity in the microbiota is generally considered a marker of a healthy and more resilient gut 383 
microbiota, and diversity has been reported to decrease in response to various stressors in 384 
animal models [48, 49].  It was recently shown that longer intestinal transit time is associated 385 
with increased gut microbiota diversity and changes in the relative abundance of multiple taxa 386 
[50], implicating transit time as an important confounder in studies assessing the gut microbiota, 387 
especially when studying effects of conditions known to impact intestinal transit.  Exercise [51] , 388 
underfeeding [52], and psychological and physical stress [53] have been independently shown 389 
to alter gastrointestinal motility.  The effects of SUSOPS on gastrointestinal transit time, and its 390 
impact on gut microbiota composition, are undetermined.     391 
 392 
Military Operational Stress , Appetite Regulation and Eating Behavior 393 
 394 
Warfighters frequently endure substantial energy deficit during SUSOPS, even when enough 395 
food is provided to meet energy demands [54, 55].  This is counterintuitive because in most 396

 settings, energy deficit elicits a strong counter-regulatory response which stimulates appetite to 397 
alleviate energy deficit and prevent weight loss.  Various psychological, logistical, and 398 
environmental factors have all been cited as contributing to undereating during SUSOPS [54, 399 
55], but whether appetite actually increases sufficiently to balance energy intake with elevated 400 
energy expenditure is unclear.  The observation that endurance exercise transiently suppresses 401 
appetite, increases appetite-suppressing hormone concentrations (e.g., peptide-YY (PYY), 402 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP)), and depresses appetite- 403 
stimulating hormone concentrations (i.e., acylated ghrelin) suggests that the counter-regulatory 404 
response to energy deficit could be blunted during SUSOPS [56-58].   However, to our 405 
knowledge, this question has not been examined.  Moreover, changes in gastrointestinal transit 406 
time have been associated with changes in appetite and appetite-mediating hormone secretion 407 
[52, 59] suggesting that exercise- and/or energy deficit-mediated decreases in transit time could 408 
contribute to appetite suppression during SUSOPS.   An improved understanding of how 409 
appetite and biological factors regulating appetite (i.e., appetite-mediating hormones and 410 
gastrointestinal transit rate) respond during SUSOPS is needed to optimize feeding strategies 411 
within these environments, and to elucidate the contribution of these factors to eating behaviors 412 
(e.g., food choice) that promote weight regain following SUSOPS.  As such, this study will 413 
measure appetite, food preferences, and biological factors mediating appetite and food choice 414 
before and after SUSOPS during both induced energy deficit and energy balance.  415 
 416 
A Systems Biology Approach for Characterizing Military Operational Stress 417 
 418 
Stress elicits systemic changes in gene and epigene expressions; behavior and performance; 419 
metabolism, and immune function.  A comprehensive understanding of the spectrum of 420 
pathways involved in regulating the stress response to military-relevant stress, and how those 421 
pathways interact to influence health and behavior is needed to both identify biomarkers of 422 
stress responses in Warfighters, and to elucidate targets for precision therapeutics aiming to 423 
mitigate stress responses that may compromise Warfighter health and performance.  For 424 
example, a systems biology approach interrogating the blood transcriptomic landscape was 425 
recently used to identify 1400 transcripts that were differentially expressed in Soldiers before 426 
and after Army Ranger Assessment and Selection [60] , a notoriously grueling training program.   427 
The analysis identified transcripts involved in the immune response as the most impacted 428 
biological response to Ranger School, and elucidated pathways underlying impaired immune 429 
function in this population.  This systems-biology approach will be expanded in this study by 430 
integrating genomic and epigenomic (saliva), metabolomic (blood, feces, saliva), microbial 431 
metagenomic (feces, saliva), and proteomic (saliva and blood) analyses.  In addition to 432 
providing unique insight into the stress response in a military-relevant environment, this 433 
approach will enable studying interactions among the microbiome and host physiology, the 434 
“interactome”, to elucidate how the interactome responds to SUSOPS and the role of negative 435 
energy balance in this response.     436 
 437 
B3.  MILITARY RELEVANCE     438 
Warfighters are often exposed to physical and cognitive stress, which likely contribute to 439 
documented declines in iron status , physical performance, and cognitive function during military 440 
training [30, 31, 61]. Thus, it is critical to identify factors that contribute to the decline in iron 441 
status and effective interventions to sustain and optimize Warfighter health and performance.  442 
This highly-controlled study will delineate the effects of repeated bouts of strenuous activity 443 
endured during SUSOPS on the IL-6 and hepcidin response, iron absorption and status, whole- 444 
body and skeletal muscle homeostasis, physical and cognitive performance, and determine if 445

 maintaining energy balance is an effective strategy to mitigate that response.  Data obtained 446 
from this study may be used in the development of countermeasures to attenuate the 447 
detrimental physiological effects of negative energy balance during strenuous military 448 
operations.  Data obtained from this study will also be used to identify novel potential 449 
biomarkers associated with the severity of stress responses to strenuous military operations.   450

B4.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS    452 
 453 
Objectives 454 
 455

fractional iron absorption.  457 
 458 
2. To determine whether energy balance and severe energy deficit modulate IL-6, 459 
hepcidin, and fractional iron absorption during a simulated 72-h SUSOPS.  460 
 461 
Secondary Objectives 462 
 463 
1. To determine whether energy balance and severe energy deficit modulate 464 
intramuscular inflammation, transcriptional modifications (e.g., microRNA and factors 465 
involved with energy substrate metabolism), anabolic signaling, remodeling, and 466 
whole-body (e.g., protein balance, immune function, etc.) adaptive responses to a 467 
simulated 72-h SUSOPS.  468 
 469 
2. To determine to what extent maintaining energy balance mitigates decrements in 470 
intestinal barrier integrity and in gut microbiome composition and function, and 471 
influences gastrointestinal transit time during a simulated 72-h SUSOPS. 472 
 473 
3. To determine whether energy deficit increases appetite, and alters food preferences 474 
and biological mediators of appetite (i.e., appetite-mediating hormones and 475 
gastrointestinal transit time) during a simulated 72-h SUSOPS, and identify effects 476 
on food choice following SUSOPS. 477 
 478 
4. To determine the effects of a simulated 72-h SUSOPS on physical performance, 479 
mood, cognitive performance, vigilance assessed continuously, and nightly sleep 480 
quality and determine whether energy deficiency exacerbates the effects of 481 
SUSOPS. 482 
 483 
5. Characterize genomic and epigenomic stress markers in blood and saliva, 484 
particularly markers interacting with the microbiome from gut and saliva, to build 485 
networks that identify the “interactome” response associated with changes in energy 486 
homeostasis during SUSOPS.  487 
 488 
Hypotheses 489 
 490 
1. SUSOPS will increase circulating concentrations of IL-6 and hepcidin and decrease 491 
fractional iron absorption.  492 
 493 
2. Energy balance will attenuate circulating concentrations of IL-6 and hepcidin and 494

 improve fractional iron absorption compared to severe energy deficit. 495 
 496 
Secondary Hypotheses 497 
 498 
1. Energy balance will attenuate muscle glycogen depletion, intramuscular 499 
inflammation, minimize upregulation in microRNA transcription, facilitate muscle 500 
remodeling, and limit negative protein balance, and decrements in immune function.  501 
 502 
2. Energy balance will attenuate increases in intestinal permeability, increases in 503 
gastrointestinal transit time, increases in markers of gut damage, and changes in gut 504 
microbiota composition and function during SUSOPS. 505 
 506 
3. Energy deficit will increase appetite, change food preferences, increase circulating 507 
concentrations of appetite-suppressing hormones, and suppress circulating 508 
concentrations of appetite-stimulating hormones during SUSOPS, and alter food 509 
choices following SUSOPS. 510 
 511 
4. SUSOPS will negatively impact physical performance, mood, cognition, and 512 
vigilance, and SUSOPS also will alter the sleep quality of participants.  Negative 513 
energy balance will  exacerbate the effects of SUSOPS on these parameters. 514 
 515 
5. A systems biology approach integrating multi-omics data derived from fecal, blood, 516 
and saliva will elucidate genetic targets within host-microbiome relationship 517 
dynamics and biological pathways within the human host that are affected by 518 
military-relevant stress and are associated with physical and cognitive performance, 519 
and identify novel markers of physiological stress.  520

B5.2.1 Subject Population (s)   531 
 532 
Healthy, recreationally-active adult men, who are active duty military, will be recruited to 533 
participate in this study . Male subjects were chosen because of known sex differences in 534 
iron status and absorption and differences in their response to exercise, including the IL- 535 
6 response to exercise [62, 63].   Pending the outcomes from this study, future, more 536 
targeted studies will be designed to address potential sex-based differences in 537 
physiological responses to SUSOPS.   538 
 539 
B5.2.2 Number of Subjects, Records, and/or Specimens   540 
 541 
This protocol requires 15 subjects complete testing to provide 80% power to detect 542 
significant differences in circulating hepcidin responses between SUSOPS 1 and 543 
SUSOPS 2. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled to account for attrition and screening 544

Experimental Design 600 
After completing pre-study baseline testing [e.g., medical clearance, anthropometrics, diet and 601 
activity records, resting metabolic rate (RMR), peak aerobic capacity (VO 2peak)] and exercise and 602 
performance familiarization trials, volunteers will complete a glycogen normalization protocol 603 
and be provided a 48 h carbohydrate refeeding diet on days 1 and 2 to restore muscle glycogen 604 
content pre-SUSOPS ( Figure 3 ). On day 2, following an ≥ 8 h fast (0000 h), volunteers will 605 
undergo the first of three fractional iron absorption studies (Iron  606 
Study 1), during which time volunteers will ingest a stable isotopically labeled iron (54FeSO 4) 607 
drink followed by serial blood draws over the next 6 h. A fasting blood draw and percutaneous 608

 muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis will be collected on the morning of day 3. Volunteers will 609 
also complete approximately 3-4 mood/cognitive-performance familiarization sessions and 1 610 
baseline session before the SUSOPS testing period.  Immediately thereafter, volunteers will 611 
complete a 72-h SUSOPS, and will be provided either sufficient food (combat rations) to 612 
maintain energy balance within ± 10% of estimated total daily energy expenditure (SUSOPS 613 
BAL) or  only enough food to match 45% of total daily energy expenditure to elicit severe 614 
negative energy balance (SUSOPS NEG BAL). Volunteers will reside at the Doriot Climatic 615 
Chambers during the SUSOPS beginning the evening of days 1 and 11  (volunteers will be 616 
provided standardized meals), and ending after final data collection on days 6 and 16 .  617 
Throughout these periods, volunteers will wear the USARIEM Vigilance Monitoring System, the 618 
Fatigue Science ReadiBandTM actigraph, Philips Respironics Actiwatch® Spectrum Plus, or 619 
equivalent device on their non-dominant wrist.  The activities performed will be comprised of 620 
load carriage and unloaded steady-state exercise and Warfighter operational tasks (e.g., 15 m 621 
timed casualty evacuation drag of a 123 kg dummy, move under fire , prepare fighting positions ) 622 
to increase total daily energy expenditures.  Physical performance will be assessed before and 623 
after each SUSOPS.  Mood, cognitive performance and overall vigilance will also be assessed.  624 
Sleep will be restricted to four hours per night during SUSOPS to mimic recent field studies.  On 625 
day 6 , immediately following the final exercise bout and 8 h after dinner on day 5 , a second 626 
muscle biopsy will be collected (alternate leg from biopsy one) and volunteers will undergo Iron 627 
Study 2 (57FeSO 4). Days 7- 12 will serve as a recovery period from SUSOPS 1 (Recovery 1).  628 
Fasted blood draws will be collected on days 7-9 during Recovery 1, and a second baseline 629 
mood/cognitive test session will occur during Recovery 1.  Starting on day 11, volunteers will 630 
complete a second glycogen normalization and 48 h carbohydrate refeeding protocol.  On day 631 
13, following an overnight fast, a blood draw and a third muscle biopsy (alternate leg from 632 
biopsy two) will be collected.   Immediately thereafter, volunteers will complete the second 72 h 633 
SUSOPS.  All testing , planned activity, and sleep restrictions will be the same as described for 634 
SUSOPS I; however, volunteers will switch to either SUSOPS BAL or SUSOPS NEG BAL.  Iron 635 
Study 3 (58FeSO 4) and the fourth and final muscle biopsy (alternate leg from biopsy three) will 636 
occur on day 16 immediately following the final exercise bout and 8 h after dinner on day 15.  637 
Days 17- 22will serve as Recovery 2 (7 d post-SUSOPS recovery blood draw will be collected on 638 
day 22 to match the 7 d recovery from SUSOPS 1)   Diet records will be recorded on days 6-8 , 639 
and 16- 18. 640 
 641 
SUSOPS BAL and SUSOPS NEG BAL 642 
The SUSOPS will be comprised of a variety of Warfighter tasks, designed to elicit high energy 643 
expenditures, muscle damage and fatigue, sleep deprivation, and decrements in physical and 644 
cognitive performance as well as self-reported mood status.  Most importantly, the SUSOPS will 645 
be designed to elicit a marked inflammatory response.  Physical activity/exercise will be 646 
prescribed at levels to expend ~5000- 6000 total kcal/d using the ACSM metabolic equations for 647 
steady-state exercise [64] and the compendium of metabolic equivalents for physical activities 648 
[65].  Total daily energy expenditure estimates will be consistent with our recent reports in 649 
Norwegian Soldiers and matched between SUSOPS BAL and NEG BAL [55, 66].   Combat 650 
rations (Meal Ready- to-Eat) will serve as the underlying diet during SUSOPS BAL and NEG 651 
BAL (refer to SUSOPS Diet Intervention section for details).  Low- to-moderate intensity (30-65% 652 
VO 2peak) steady-state endurance-type exercise will be the primary exercise modality.    653 
Volunteers will perform three prolonged steady-state exercise bouts per day.  All three exercise 654 
sessions will be conducted outdoors on Natick Soldier Systems Center grounds (NSSC fitness 655 
trail).  Two of the three exercise bouts will be ~ 60-180-min load carriage exercise sessions, 656 
whereas the third will be unloaded. The total distance covered will be dictated by individual 657 
exercise prescriptions, and the load carried will be ~32 kg [comprised of the basic uniform (~5.3 658

 kg), weapon and tactical equipment (~11.2 kg), and rucksack (~15 kg)]. The loads carried are 659 
consistent with infantry occupation standards. Volunteers will be permitted to consume water ad 660 
libitum throughout each exercise trial to maintain hydration. During the remainder of each day, 661 
volunteers will perform a number of Warfighter tasks [e.g., 15 m timed casualty evacuation drag 662 
of a 123 kg dummy, move under fire (15, 6.6 m rushes with weapon and full combat load (32 kg) 663 
for time, with 5 secs between rushes), prepare fighting positions (move 16, 18 kg sandbags 10 664 
m while wearing full combat load minus a weapon (~26.5 kg)].  The Warfighter task measures 665 
will be performed daily to increase energy expenditure by simulating some operational tasks. 666 
Volunteers will perform at least two familiarization trials of each task to reduce injury risk during 667 
the pre-study baseline period.  Mood, cognitive, and vigilance will also be assessed.  Self- 668 
reported mood and cognitive performance will be assessed twice per SUSOPS day in addition 669 
to the sessions performed prior to SUSOPS 1 during the baseline testing phase of the protocol 670 
and the session performed during Recovery 1.     Vigilance testing using the USARIEM Vigilance 671 
Monitoring System will only be active during specific intervals of wake time. Sleep will be 672 
restricted to 4 h per day to be consistent with previous USARIEM SUSOPS studies beginning 673 
the evening of days 3 and 13(i.e., volunteers will not be permitted to sleep until 0100 the 674 
morning of days 4 and 14 ) [67].  675 
 676 
Warfighter Tasks 677 
Move under Fire : During this task, volunteers will wear an approximately 32 kg fighting load 678 
[comprised of the basic uniform (~5.3 kg), weapon and tactical equipment (~11.2 kg), and 679 
rucksack (~15 kg)]. They will begin the task in the prone position.  Upon command, volunteers 680 
will sprint approximately 6 m to a marker and assume the predetermined position for that marker 681 
(either the kneeling or prone position).  They will remain in this position for approximately 5 682 
seconds.  Upon signal, volunteers will get up and sprint approximately 5 to 8 m to the next 683 
marker and assume the predetermined position for that marker. This will be repeated until they 684 
have covered a total of 100 m (15 rushes of ~6.6 m).  After starting in the prone position, the 685 
next two positions will be kneeling, and then a prone position until the course is completed.  686 
Time to complete the task will be recorded. Each testing session will take approximately 1- 2 687 
minutes.   688 
 689 
Casualty Evacuation Drag : Volunteers will drag a simulated casualty (approximately 123 kg) up 690 
to 15 m as fast as possible in 60 sec, while wearing an approximately 32 kg fighting load 691 
[comprised of the basic uniform (~5.3 kg), weapon and tactical equipment (~11.2 kg), and 692 
rucksack (~15 kg)].  If the volunteer is unable to pull the casualty the full 15 m in 60 sec, the 693 
distance the casualty was dragged will be measured to the nearest 0.25 m.  694 
 695 
Prepare Fighting Positions (Sandbag Carry) : While wearing a fighting load minus the weapon 696 
(approximately 26.5 kg), volunteers will lift and carry a total of 16 sandbags weighing 18 kg 697 
each, carry them 10 m, and place them on the floor  in a 4 bag wide x 2 bag deep x 2 bag high 698 
formation as quickly as possible.  The completion time will be recorded. The test is expected to 699 
take approximately 3-5 minutes per volunteer. 700 
 701 
Diet and Total Daily Energy Expenditure Prescription during SUSOPS 702 
Volunteers will complete a 3 d diet record and a 3 d activity log during baseline pre-study testing 703 
(days - 14-0) and according to instructions provided by a registered dietitian to characterize pre- 704 
study diet and exercise habits (see “Diet Record” and “Activity Log” ).  To predict total daily 705 
energy expenditure (TDEE), volunteers’ resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be measured during 706 
the baseline pre-study testing period using standardized techniques and an indirect, open circuit 707 
respiratory system (True Max 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah, USA).  RMR will be multiplied 708

 by a factor of 1.3 to estimate energy expenditures for activities of daily living.  Together, these 709 
data will serve as the baseline total daily energy requirements for SUSOPS 1 and 2.    710 
 711 
To increase TDEE to approximately 5000-6000 kcal/d, volunteers will be prescribed l ow-to- 712 
moderate intensity (30-65% of pre-determined peak oxygen uptake, VO 2peak and corresponding 713 
heart rate) endurance-type exercise using the ACSM metabolic equations for steady-state 714 
exercise [64] and the compendium of metabolic equivalents for physical activities (refer to 715 
descriptions of Determination of Peak Oxygen Consumption and SUSOPS BAL and SUSOPS 716

kcal/d * 1.3) of 2600 kcal/d and a VO 2peak of 45 mL/kg/min, would expend approximately 2468 720 
kcal during two, 90-min load carriage exercise bouts combined [i.e., 85kg+32kg load = 117 kg * 721 
(~50% of VO 2peak is 6.7 METS *3.5 mL/kg/min)/1000) * (90 min of work * 5 kcal/L/min) = 1234 722 
kcal/exercise bout], 600 kcal during a 60-min unloaded exercise session (calculations follow the 723 
same format), and approximately 100 kcal/d performing the Warfighter tasks, for an estimated 724 
TDEE of ~ 5768 kcal/d. TDEE prescriptions are individualized to each volunteer’s requirements 725 
and will be held constant between SUSOPS 1 and 2. Exercise intensities, total duration 726 
exercised, and TDEE will likely differ between volunteers.  Every attempt will be made to 727 
maintain TDEE between 5000-6000 kcal/d across all volunteers; however, some individuals 728 
may expend more and others less. 729 
 730 
Registered Dietitians will develop individualized daily menus for SUSOPS 1 and 2 using Food 731 
Processor SQL (ESHA Research, Salem, OR, Version 10.14). The diets during each SUSOPS 732 
period will be derived primarily from components of the US military Meals Ready- to-Eat (MRE) 733 
rations to achieve appropriate macronutrient proportions.   The macronutrient distribution of the 734 
MRE-based diets will not be manipulated.  Thus, volunteers will be consuming a diet providing 735 
approximately 60% carbohydrate, 10-15% protein, and 25-30% fat. The macronutrient 736 
distribution, as a % of total energy, will remain constant during SUSOPS NEG BAL by uniformly 737 
reducing total energy intake across carbohydrate, protein, and fat.  This feeding paradigm will 738 
most closely resemble field-feeding practices observed during recent USARIEM studies [55, 739 
66].  The micronutrient content of the ration will not be altered.  However, to limit the potential 740 
confounding effect of differing iron intakes across SUSOPS 1 and 2, volunteers will consume 741 
supplemental iron sulfate mixed in water (Ferrous sulfate drops, RxChoice, available OTC) 742 
during SUSOPS NEG BAL to match total iron consumed during SUSOPS BAL. This equates to 743 
only ~4- 10 mg supplemental iron and will be consumed with one meal each day to mimic iron 744 
intake during SUSOPS BAL (iron content of SUSOPS BAL is approximately 20-25 mg/d). Water 745 
will be allowed ad libitum and total amount consumed will be recorded by study team members. 746 
During the 48 hours prior to each SUSOPS period (beginning on days 1 and 11, volunteers will 747 
be fed meals derived of commercially available foods which will meet calculated energy 748 
requirements to maintain their body weight.       749 
 750 
Volunteers will receive instructions from study dietitians on how to consume an ad libitum diet 751 
with the same macronutrient distribution during the two recovery periods (see “Choosing Your 752 
Foods During Recovery” document).   Food records will be maintained by study volunteers on 753 
days 6-8 and 16- 18.  Volunteers will meet with study dietitians to review these records. These 754 
records will be used to determine how energy deficit during SUSOPS impacts food selection 755 
during recovery.  Physical activity will be restricted during both recovery periods.   756

 Doubly labeled water (DLW) will be used to determine actual TDEE during SUSOPS 1 and 759 
SUSOPS 2 and verify the accuracy of estimated TDEE.  DLW will be administered during the first 760 
iron study on day 2 (~0000 h after an 8 h fast).  Immediately before drinking the DLW, volunteers 761 
will provide a urine sample to determine the natural abundance of 18O and 2H.  They will not eat or 762 
drink anything for 4 h (~0400 h) after consuming a total of 120 g DLW containing 10% H 218O 763 
(~0.285 g H 218O·kg total body water [TBW]-1) and 99% 2H2O (~0.15 g 2H2O·kg TBW-1; Sigma- 764 
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO or similar company).   The DLW dose container will be rinsed with local tap or 765 
bottled water, which the volunteer will drink.  Urine samples will then be collected approximately 4 h 766 
and 6 h after the DLW dosing for initial TBW determinations to be made.  Volunteers will be free to 767 
eat and drink after these urine samples.   768 
 769 
Two volunteers will be chosen at random to consume only locally available drinking water to control 770 
for natural changes in 2H and 18O abundance (local water will be analyzed to determine isotopic 771 
enrichments).  Rate of disappearance of 18O and 2H for volunteers dosed with DLW will be 772 
corrected for mean changes in background enrichments based on controls.  Morning urine samples 773 
will be collected daily during each SUSOPS period to determine elimination rates over time.  TBW 774 
will be calculated by determining the regression line for the elimination of 2H and 18O and 775 
extrapolated to a maximum enrichment. All urine samples will be collected and stored in 5ml tubes 776 
and shipped to the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) for analysis.   777 
 778 
Enrichments of 2H and 18O will be measured using isotope ratio mass spectroscopy (Finnigan Mat 779 
252, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA or similar model).  The 2H and 18O isotope elimination 780 
rates (k H and k O) will be calculated by linear regression using the isotopic disappearance rates 781 
during each training phase. 782 
 783 
rCO 2 = (N/2.078)(1.01k O – 1.04k H) – 0.0246rH 2Of 784 
 785 
where N is TBW; k O and k H are 18O and 2H isotope disappearance rates respectively, and rH 2Of  786 
is the rate of fractionated evaporated water loss and is estimated to be 1.05 N * (1.01 k O – 1.04 787 
kH).  Total daily energy expenditure will then be calculated using the energy equivalent of CO 2 788 
for a respiratory quotient of 0.86 [68].   789 
 790 
Anthropometric Data 791 
Anthropometrics and body composition will be performed using standardized techniques and 792 
equipment to characterize study volunteers, and evaluate responses to SUSOPS 1 and 2.  793 
Height will be measured in duplicate to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer at baseline . 794 
Body weight will be measured, n ude (scale will be placed in a locked bathroom) and after an 795 
overnight fast (≥ 8 h), using a calibrated digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg at baseline (days - 14- 796 
0) and then daily throughout the 22 d study to ensure weight maintenance and/or weight loss.   797 
 798 
Body composition will be determined on days 2 , 6, 12, and 16 using a four-compartment model 799 
derived from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, DPX-IQ, GE Lunar Corporation, 800 
Madison, WI) and bio-electrical impedance (InBody 720, BIOSPACE, Korea) [69]. The DEXA 801 
technique allows for the non-invasive assessment of soft tissue composition by region with a 802 
precision of 1-3%. The volunteer will lay face-up on the DEXA densitometer table in shorts, t- 803 
shirts, and stocking feet, and will be asked to remain motionless for the 8-10 min scan. The 804 
InBody measure takes less than a minute to complete, will be performed immediately before or 805 
after the DEXA, with volunteers wearing the same clothing described for DEXA.  These data will 806 
be used to calculate body water , protein (i.e., lean mass), mineral (i.e., bone), and fat mass.  807

 Determination of Peak Oxygen Uptake 809 
Peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak) will be determined using an indirect, open circuit respiratory 810 
system (True Max 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah, USA) on a cycle ergometer.  The value will 811 
be used to better estimate exercise-induced energy expenditure (EIEE) during SUSOPS and to 812 
determine the workloads necessary for the glycogen normalization protocol (see below).  813 
Volunteers will be clothed in appropriate athletic attire and perform this assessment in a 814 
temperature and humidity controlled room.  The volunteer will be allowed to warm-up by 815 
pedaling at 70 W for 5 min.   At the start of testing, the volunteer will put on a nose clip and a 816 
mouthpiece connected to a 2-way respiratory valve, which is attached to a head piece to hold it 817 
in place.  Every minute, workload intensity will be progressively increased by 30 W until the 818 
volunteer is fatigued or unable to maintain a pedaling rate that either maintains or increases O 2 819 
consumption.   Heart rate will be monitored using a heart-rate monitor (Polar Electro Inc, Oulu, 820 
Finland) and recorded during the last 30 sec of each workload.  The test will be stopped 821 
immediately if the subject reports angina-like symptoms, exertional syncope, shows signs of 822 
poor perfusion (i.e., light- headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or cold and 823 
clammy skin), or if the testing equipment fails.   824 
 825 
Glycogen Normalization Protocol 826 
To normalize muscle glycogen content and its potential influence on inflammation leading into 827 
both SUSOPS periods [days 1 and 11 following an overnight fast (≥ 10 h)], participants will 828 
perform a glycogen normalization protocol followed by a 2-d refeeding protocol. The glycogen 829 
normalization protocol will be completed on a cycle ergometer. The intensity will be based on 830 
VO 2peak.  Volunteers will begin with a 5 min warm-up at 50% VO 2peak before beginning the 831 
protocol.  After a warm-up period, the cycle ergometer protocol is comprised of repeated periods 832 
of 2 min of work at 80 ± 5% V ̇O2peak followed by 2 min of recovery at 50 ± 5 % VO 2peak.  The 833 
protocol will last approximately 50-min (12 work:rest cycles). To ensure familiarity with the 834 
testing procedures, volunteers will perform one practice session during the baseline pre-study 835 
period.  Volunteers will be permitted to consume water ad libitum  during the protocol.   836 
 837 
After completing the glycogen depletion protocol, volunteers will be fed a controlled diet 838 
prescribed to maintain energy balance and provide at least 6.0 g carbohydrate ∙kg-1∙d-1 (~55- 839 
60% of total energy consumed ) to ensure adequate glycogen repletion and homogeneous 840 
glycogen levels within and across volunteers between SUSOPS phases (BAL and NEG BAL).  841 
All food and beverages (except water) will be prepared and provided by study dietitians and 842 
consist largely of military combat ration and supplemental food items.   843 
 844 
Determination of Fractional Iron Absorption 845 
Volunteers will undergo three acute fractional iron absorption studies (Iron Studies 1, 2, and 3).  846 
The studies will occur on days 2, 6, and 16 in the morning (~0000 h) after an 8 h fast.  The iron 847 
studies on days 6 and 16 will occur ~3 h after completing the last exercise bout of the SUSOPS 848 
to correspond to peak hepcidin responses to exercise.   An indwelling 18 gauge intravenous 849 
catheter will be placed in the antecubital fossa (or distally) and a baseline blood sample will be 850 
drawn before consuming the iron isotope (0 min).  Volunteers will then consume a 300 mL drink 851 
containing 3.8 mg iron (representative of dietary iron in an iron-rich meal) as isotopically labeled  852 
54FeSO 4, 57FeSO 4, or 58FeSO 4 (Trace Sciences International). Venous blood samples will be 853 
collected at 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min-post iron loading [70] to assess the effects of a 854 
transient exercise-induced increase in IL-6 (and hepcidin) on the appearance of absorbed iron 855 
in blood.   856

 Page 28 of 59 
 Percutaneous muscle biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis using a 5 mm 859 
Bergstrom needle with manual suction while the volunteer is under local anesthesia (1% 860 
lidocaine) according to the approved USARIEM SOP [71, 72].  The biopsy procedures will be 861 
performed after a ≥ 8 h fast immediately before starting and after completing each SUSOPS 862 
period (days 3, 6 , 13, and 16).  The muscle biopsies collected on days 6 and 16 will occur within 863 
30 min of completing the final exercise bout before starting iron tracer studies 3 h post-exercise 864 
(refer to Determination of Fractional Iron Absorption). The muscle samples obtained will be 865 
analyzed for muscle glycogen content, intramuscular markers of inflammation, proteolytic, 866 
energy-sensing, and anabolic cell signaling. Volunteers will undergo four total biopsies.  Each 867 
biopsy will require a new incision and the biopsied leg will alternate between days.    868 
 869 
Whole-Body Protein Utilization 870 
Whole-body protein turnover (15N-alanine) will be assessed before (days 2 and 12) and on the 871 
last day of each SUSOPS period (days 5 and 15), as previously reported in several studies from 872 
this laboratory [55, 66, 73, 74].  Total nitrogen, ammonia, and urea (15N-nitrogen, 15N- ammonia, 873 
and 15N-urea) enrichments will be used to measure whole-body protein turnover [75].  After 874 
providing a urine sample to determine background 15N enrichments , volunteers will consume a 875 
single dose of 15N-alanine ( 300 mg·d-1, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and 876 
collect their urine for the next 24 h.  Total nitrogen intake will be determined from ration dietary 877 
analysis.    878 
 879 
Urine samples will be frozen and shipped to Metabolic Solutions Inc. (Nashua, NH) for isotopic 880 
analysis using a fee-for-service contract.   The 15N enrichment of urinary ammonia and N (ratio 881 
of tracer to tracee, t:t) will be determined using isotope ratio mass spectroscopy.  The t:t ratio for 882 
the cumulative sample will be corrected for the background 15N-ammonia enrichment.  Nitrogen 883 
intake ( I) during the 24 h period will be determined by ration analysis.  Nitrogen flux ( Q), protein 884 
synthesis (PS), protein breakdown (PB), and net protein balance (NET) will be calculated 885 
according to Stein et al.[76] .   886 
 887 
Determining Lower-Body Performance 888 
Physical performance (i.e., lower-body power) will be assessed before and after each SUSOPS 889 
and during each recovery period on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19using the vertical jump test 890 
(Vertec™ device). Volunteers will place their feet at shoulder width with their knees slightly bent 891 
while standing on a flat, clean surface.  On command, volunteers will perform an arm swing and 892 
a countermovement to a self-selected depth and jump with maximal effort.  Volunteers will tap 893 
the fins of the Vertec™ at peak jump height. Volunteers will receive three attempts separated by 894 
one minute of recovery. Vertical displacement (jump height) will be  calculated as the difference 895 
between maximal jump height and reach height and peak power will be calculated using the 896 
following equation [77].  897 
 898 
Peak Power (Watts) = [60.7 x jump height (cm)] + [45.3 x body mass (kg)] - 2055  899 
 900 
Volunteers will receive detailed instruction, demonstration by study staff, and complete two 901 
familiarization trials during the pre-study period.   All experimental conditions will be held 902 
constant between testing days. 903 
 904 
Eating behavior, appetite and food preferences and cravings 905 
Volunteers will rate self-perceived appetite using visual analog scales (see “ VAS” document).  906 
The VAS will be administered before and after meals, and before and after morning exercise on 907

 study days -1 (may be adjusted ± 2d if needed) , 3-5, and 13- 15, (note on day -1 the VAS will be 908 
administered at the same time of day as the morning exercise sessions on days 3-5, and 13- 909 
15).  Visual analog scales will be administered using paper and pencil, or via electronic means 910 
(e.g., tablet or laptop).   During study day -1, participants will remain in the lab under staff 911 
supervision from breakfast through dinner (~0600-~ 1900) .  All meals will be provided in 912 
sufficient quantity to meet weight maintenance energy requirements, and participants will 913 
remain sedentary throughout the day.  Appetite-mediating hormones (acyl ghrelin, leptin, GLP- 914 
1, PYY, PP, and insulin) and metabolic markers putatively involved in appetite regulation 915 
(glucose, FFA, BHB) will be measured following a ≥8 hr fast on the mornings of study days 3, 5 , 916 
7, 9, 13, 15, 17, and 19 and following the morning ruck march on days 3, 5 , 13 and 15. 917 
   918 
Food preferences will be measured using the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ) 919 
which will be administered before and after lunch on study days -1 (may be adjusted ± 2d if 920 
needed) , 5, and 15.  The LFPQ is a computerized platform that measures different components 921 
of food preference and hedonics, and is administered on a computer [78].   For the tests, 32 922 
pictures of individual food items that vary in 3 dimensions; protein (low and high), taste (sweet 923 
and savory), and/or fat (low and high) will be selected from a validated database of common 924 
foods. At least four pictures from each food type will be selected.  To measure explicit liking 925 
(i.e., perceived hedonic impact of the food), the volunteer will be shown each picture in random 926 
order and asked to respond to the question “how pleasant would you find the taste of this food 927 
right now” using a visual analog scale. To measure explicit wanting (i.e, conscious desire to 928 
consume a food), the volunteer will be shown each picture in random order and asked to 929 
respond to the question “how much do you want to eat this food right now”, using a visual 930 
analog scale. Mean ratings for each food category will be computed to determine explicit liking 931 
and explicit wanting for each food type. Implicit wanting (i.e., automatic subconscious attraction 932 
to a food) will be measured using forced choice methodology.  Pairs of food images from 933 
separate food categories will be presented in randomized pairs on the computer screen. 934 
Volunteers will be asked to as quickly as possible select the food that they most want to eat at 935 
that moment. Both frequencies of selections within each food category and response time will 936 
be recorded.  A familiarization session will be conducted before study day -1.  The LFPQ will be 937 
will be purchased or used with permission and takes ~15min to complete 938 
 939 
Gut microbiome composition and activity 940 
Volunteers will collect 5 separate fecal samples to determine the effects of SUSOPS with and 941 
without energy deficit on gut microbiome composition and activity.  A single fecal sample will be 942 
collected during baseline (days -1-0 (may be adjusted ± 2d if needed)), and study days 5-6 , 9- 943 
10, 15 -16, and 19-20. At each time point participants will be given a 48-h window to collect a 944 
usable sample.  A usable sample is defined as being >15g wet weight, and having been 945 
delivered to study staff as soon as possible and within 12 hr of defecation while being kept cold 946 
but not frozen from the time of collection to delivery. If a participant does not provide a usable 947 
sample within the timeframe noted above, the collection period will be extended until a usable 948 
sample is produced. To collect fecal samples, all participants will be given pre-labeled 949 
containers with covers and a plastic device to hold the container in the toilet. Participants will 950 
defecate into the collection container which will then be given to study staff.  During free-living 951 
phases of the study participants will be given plastic sealable bags, a cooler or insulated bag , 952 
and ice packs to store and transport the samples (see “Fecal Collection Instructions”).  Gut 953 
microbiota composition, function, and activity will be measured at the US Army Center For 954 
Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Ft Detrick using next generation shotgun- 955 
sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics. Additional aliquots will be archived by USARIEM at 956 
-80○C and may be analyzed for other gut related outcomes at a later date.  957

Gastrointestinal permeability 959 
A differential sugar absorption test will be used to provide a functional assessment of 960 
gastrointestinal permeability [79]. For this test participants will consume 2 g sucralose and 2 g 961 
erythritol dissolved in 180 mL water in the morning during study days -1 (may be adjusted ± 2d if 962 
needed), 4, and 14. Sucralose and erythritol are sugar substitutes commonly used in a variety of 963 
food products. Consumption of the solution will be conducted under staff supervision. Participants 964 
will then collect urine produced over the subsequent 24 hr.  Urine aliquots will be taken after 5 hr 965 
and 24 hr and frozen immediately. Urine sucralose and erythritol concentrations will be analyzed by 966 
PBRC, and will provide a measure of small intestinal, large intestinal and whole-gut permeability 967 
[79].  Coolers or insulated bags with ice packs will be used to keep urine cool and for transport of 968 
samples outside of the lab (see “Fecal Collection Instructions”).    969 
 970 
Gastrointestinal transit time 971 
Gastrointestinal transit time will be measured on days -1, 4 and 14 using the SmartPill 972 
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN).  The SmartPill is an ingestible FDA-approved wireless motility 973 
capsule similar in size to a multi-vitamin pill that transits the gastrointestinal tract while 974 
transmitting data to a receiver kept near the body 975 
[http://www.medtronic.com/covidien/products/motility-testing/smartpill-motility-testing-system# ].  976 
The device continuously measures gastrointestinal pH, core temperature, gastrointestinal 977 
pressure, and gastrointestinal transit time for up to 5 d, and can isolate transit through the 978 
stomach, small bowel, and colon [80].  One sterile SmartPill will be ingested immediately after 979 
breakfast on days -1 , 4, and 14 under staff supervision.  The pill is easy to swallow and 980 
volunteers will be given ample instruction. Elimination of the pill from the gastrointestinal tract 981 
will be confirmed by a temperature decrease when the capsule passes from the body into toilet 982 
water.  If a pill stops transmitting before being eliminated from the body, a new pill may be 983 
administered and fecal sample collections will be used to visually search for and confirm exit of 984 
the pill that is no longer transmitting.  We expect most volunteers will pass the capsule within 985 
24-48 hr based on data from Rao et al. [81] who reported median [IQR] whole gut transit time of 986 
30 hr [22-46 hr] in 81 healthy adults.  Volunteers will wear a bracelet indicating the pill is inside 987 
of them until elimination from the body is confirmed by study staff.  Transit time will be used in 988 
interpretation of the gut microbiota, gastrointestinal permeability, and appetite results as 989 
changes in transit time could impact all of these measures. A subset of volunteers will be 990 
recruited randomly to participate in this procedure using a random number generator. If any 991 
volunteer who is randomly selected reports difficulty swallowing large pills or any other 992 
contraindication (see below), they will be replaced with a randomly selected alternate. 993 
 Contraindications: 994 
 History of gastric bezoar 995 
 Swallowing disorders; severe dysphagia to food or pills 996 
 Suspected or known strictures, fistulas, or physiological/mechanical GI obstruction 997 
 Implanted or portable electro-mechanical medical devices  998 
 Using proton pump inhibitors 999 
 Cannot stop use of the following medications within 48hr of procedure: histamine 1000

to evaluate mucosal immunity. Saliva samples will be collected using the non-invasive 1014  
commercially-available Salimetrics polyester Oral Swab (SOS) technology (Salimetrics, CA, 1015  
USA). Subjects will be asked to place one SOS under their tongue for 3 minutes before 1016  
returning it to the provided vial. Participants will then place a second SOS under their tongue 1017  
until the swab is saturated with saliva. This sampling technique will enable us to obtain the 1018  
required amount of saliva to determine sIgA concentration and the salivary flow rate at each 1019  
time point. Salivary SIgA is a well-documented biomarker of mucosal innate immunity, used to 1020  
predict upper respiratory tract infections and to study the influence of stress and dehydration on 1021  
immune function [84-86] . The collected saliva will be stored at -80̊C until analysis. Saliva 1022  
osmolality will be determined using a freezing point depression osmometer, and samples will be 1023  
analyzed simultaneously for sIgA concentration using a commercially-available ELISA.  1024  
 1025  
Self-Reported Mood, Cognitive Performance, and Vigilance Assessments 1026  
Several mood and cognitive performance assessment sessions will be conducted during the pre- 1027  
SUSOPS period of testing so that volunteers become familiar with the test battery and their 1028  
performance is stable. The last of these sessions will serve as the baseline data for statistical 1029  
analyses.  During the simulated SUSOPS periods, a morning and evening mood/cognitive test 1030  
session will be conducted on each day.  Ambulatory vigilance will be assessed via the wrist-worn 1031  
USARIEM Vigilance Monitoring System.  The Fatigue Science ReadiBand™ actigraph, Philips 1032  
Respironics Actiwatch® Spectrum Plus, or an equivalent device will record sleep data at night and 1033  
daytime motor activity. (see “POMS” and “EVAR” documents). 1034  
 1035  
The Profile of Mood States (POMS): The Profile of Mood States (POMS) Questionnaire [87] is a 65- 1036  
item inventory of self-reported mood states that is sensitive to a wide variety of nutritional 1037  
manipulations including undernutrition[88] and environmental factors including hypoxia [89], sleep 1038  
loss, and sub-clinical doses of various drugs [90-92].  Participants rate each of 65 mood-related 1039  
adjectives on a five-point scale, in response to the question, “How are you feeling right now?”  The 1040  
adjectives factor into six mood sub-scales (tension/anxiety, depression/dejection, anger/hostility, 1041  
vigor/activity, fatigue/inertia, and confusion/bewilderment.  The POMS will be used to assess the 1042  
overall mood states of the participants in the present study.  The POMS Questionnaire takes less 1043  
than 5 minutes and will be administered via computer software.   This questionnaire will be 1044  
purchased and used with permission. 1045  
 1046  
Evaluation of Risks Scale (EVAR):  The Evaluation of Risks (EVAR) Questionnaire measures 1047  
willingness to take risks through participant responses to 24 items which they mark on a visual 1048  
analog scale [93] .  Each end of the line is anchored by descriptors such as “not at all” and “very 1049  
much.” Respondents simply mark the point on the line that best describes their current feeling state. 1050  
The scale yields five factors, including Self-control, Danger-seeking, Energy, Impulsiveness, and 1051  
Invincibility, as well as a Total Risk-Taking Propensity score, which is derived by summing all 24 1052  
items. These items are internally consistent, yielding a coefficient a of 0.78 [94]. The scale has been 1053  
shown to differentiate individuals who routinely engage in risky behavior, and it also correlates with 1054  
measures of sensation-seeking and other risk-related traits [93, 94]. The EVAR takes less than 5 1055  
minutes to complete.   This questionnaire is publicly available. 1056

 The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) : The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measures simple 1058  
visual reaction time which is particularly sensitive to the vigilance decrements associated with sleep 1059  
restriction or disruption [95]. A series of stimuli are presented at random intervals on a screen and 1060  
the subject must respond as rapidly as possible when a stimulus appears. The subject hits either 1061  
the left or right arrow keys to respond to the stimulus. Parameters recorded include reaction time, 1062  
false alarms, and number of lapses (long duration responses). PVT performance lapses refer to the 1063  
times when a subject fails to respond to the task in a timely manner (i.e., > 500 msec). The test 1064  
requires subjects to sustain attention and respond to a randomly appearing stimulus on a computer 1065  
screen by pressing a button.  The PVT takes 10 minutes to complete and will be administered via 1066  
computer software.   This test was developed at USARIEM and does not require any permission for 1067  
use. 1068  
 1069  
Matching to Sample: The Matching to Sample Test assesses short-term spatial memory (working 1070  
memory) and pattern recognition skills [90, 91]. The participant responds by pressing the down 1071  
arrow key when the word "READY" appears on the screen. The participant is then presented with 1072  
an 8 X 8 matrix of a red and green checkerboard on a color screen. The matrix is on the screen for 1073  
4 seconds. Afterwards, the sample is removed and followed by a variable delay interval during 1074  
which the screen is blank (except for the word delay at the bottom of the screen). After the delay, 1075  
two matrices are presented on the screen: the original sample matrix and a second matrix that 1076  
differs slightly in that the color sequence of two of the squares will be reversed.  The participant 1077  
selects the comparison matrix by responding on the left or right arrow key that matches the original 1078  
sample matrix.  A response (left or right arrow key) must be made within 15 seconds; otherwise a 1079  
time-out error will be recorded.  Correct responses will also be recorded, as will response time to 1080  
choose a matrix. The task lasts approximately 5 minutes and will be administered via computer 1081  
software. After the delay, two matrices are presented: the sample matrix and a second matrix that 1082  
differs slightly in that the color sequence of two of the squares is reversed.  The participant selects 1083  
the comparison matrix by responding on the left or right arrow key that matches the original sample 1084  
matrix.  A response must be made within 15 seconds; otherwise a time-out error will be recorded.  1085  
Correct responses will also be recorded, as will response time to choose a matrix. The task lasts 1086  
approximately 5 minutes and will be administered via computer.   This test was developed at 1087  
USARIEM and does not require any permission for use. 1088  
 1089  
Grammatical Reasoning:  The Grammatical Reasoning Test assesses language-based logical 1090  
reasoning and has been used to assess the effects of various treatments on cognitive function [96] .  1091  
It has been adapted from the Baddeley Grammatical Reasoning Test.  On each trial, the letters AB 1092  
or BA follows a statement.  The participant must decide whether or not each statement correctly 1093  
describes the order of the two letters.  The "T" key on the keyboard is pressed for correct 1094  
(statement is true) and the "F" key is pressed for incorrect (statement is false).  Statements can be 1095  
positive/negative or active/passive, and a given letter may precede/follow the other letter.  A 1096  
session lasts for 32 trials and is made up of the above combination of statements.  The time to 1097  
complete this test is approximately 5 minutes and it will be administered via computer software.   1098  
This test was developed at USARIEM and does not require any permission for use. 1099  
 1100  
The N-back Task: The N-back Task measures working memory [97]. It requires on-line monitoring, 1101  
updating, and manipulation of remembered information and allows for the parametric assessment of 1102  
different working memory loads. Participants will be shown a series of letters one at a time in the 1103  
center of a computer screen and will be required to mentally take note of those depicted letters.  1104  
They will then respond by pressing the spacebar if the letter presented is the same as the previous 1105  
letter (1-back condition), 2 previous letters back (2-back condition), or 3 previous letters back (3- 1106  
back condition).  Dependent measures include response time and accuracy. This task takes 1107

 approximately 15 min to complete and will be administered via computer software. This version of 1108  
the task was developed at USARIEM and does not require any permission for use. 1109  
 1110  
The Balloon Analogue Risk Task: The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computerized 1111  
test designed to measure willingness to take risks versus “play it safe” and requires the 1112  
participant to fill a simulated balloon with air [98].  Points are given for keeping the balloon as full 1113  
as possible. The more expanded the balloon gets, the more points are earned. However, all 1114  
points are lost if the balloon is over-inflated and pops. The object of this task is to earn as many 1115  
points as possible by keeping the balloon inflated without popping. Additionally, there is a risk- 1116  
learning component to this task as some balloon colors pop with less inflation and others with 1117  
more, while a third category is unpredictable. Standard administration of this task allows 30 1118  
trials.  The BART takes approximately 10 min to complete and will be administered via computer 1119  
software.   This test is publicly available and does not require permission for use.  1120  
 1121  
Ambulatory Vigilance and Sleep Evaluation:  The USARIEM developed wrist-worn Vigilance 1122  
Monitoring System (produced in collaboration with PCD, Inc., Ft. Walton Beach, FL) will be used to 1123  
continuously measure a variety of key behavioral and environmental factors while volunteers are 1124  
engaged in daily activities.  The monitors are lightweight devices slightly larger than a wristwatch 1125  
and are worn on the non-dominant wrist.  Each monitor contains a microprocessor, non-volatile 1126  
memory, and several other sensors.  The monitors measure ambient temperature, sound intensity, 1127  
and environmental light levels as well as vigilance, rest, and activity.  The monitors will be 1128  
programmed such that at random intervals, averaging approximately 10 times an hour, an audible 1129  
tone sequence, a light stimulus and/or a vibratory stimulus, similar to the vibration of a pager or cell 1130  
phone, will be emitted. Vigilance during Baseline, SUSOPS and recovery will be assessed during 1131  
specific standardized times.  The volunteer will be required to push a small button on the monitor in 1132  
response to the stimuli.  Vigilance and response time will be assessed by monitoring correct 1133  
responses and the latency to respond to the tone.  These measures provide estimates of different 1134  
aspects of vigilance, the ability to detect stimuli and the ability to respond as rapidly as possible. 1135  
Measurements of sleep and activity will be collected using the Fatigue Science ReadiBand™ 1136  
actigraph, Philips Respironics Actiwatch® Spectrum Plus, or equivalent device. Volunteers will wear 1137  
the monitors during the baseline and simulated SUSOPS portion of the research. 1138

 occur after an overnight fast (venipuncture). 3A second blood sample will be collected post-exercise for 1163  
the notated analytes on days 3, 5 , 13, and 15. 4Serum, EDTA, LiHep archived blood samples are derived 1164  
from the blood draws at each specific time point, and stored in the event certain assays require re- 1165  
analysis, or for future analysis if any sample remains. Based on this explanation, the total number of 1166  
study blood draws is 42 (iron study days, 8 x 3 = 24; 2 on days 3, 5 , 13, and 15, for 8 total draws; and 1 1167  
on every other indicated blood draw day, 10 total). Serum and plasma will be archived from each blood 1168  
draw. The total volume of blood collected per participant is ≤ ~530 mL.  1169  
 1170  
Saliva analysis 1171  
Saliva collection is a non-invasive technique with easy achievability that may facilitate sample 1172  
collection in austere environments by study volunteers with minimal instruction.  The technique 1173  
may therefore provide an efficient alternative to using blood and/or fecal collection to monitor 1174  
physiological status in Warfighters engaged in SUSOPS or during deployment.  However, the 1175  
validity of saliva collection as a deployable solution for monitoring physiologic status requires 1176  
validation.  As such, saliva and blood samples will be collected in tandem.  Blood will be 1177  
subjected to mRNA-seq, targeted micro-RNA (see mRNA, myomiR, and c-myomiR Expression 1178  
below) and metabolomics analyses.   Saliva will be subjected to microRNA profiling, ion 1179  
abundance measurement  and metabolomics analyses .   Results will be compared between 1180  
sample types, and in relation to the gut microbiome, and cognitive and physical performance 1181  
outcomes.  In addition to validating the approach, analyses will be undertaken to explore 1182  
associations between the salivary microbiome and stress responses.   1183  
 1184  
Saliva samples will be collected on study days 2, 6 , 9, 16 and 19  at the same time blood 1185  
samples will be collected for mRNA-seq, microRNA-seq and metabolomics assays, 1186  
respectively.  During saliva collection, a Salivette tube with opaque white cap (SARSTEDT, Inc.) 1187  
will be opened; the swab will be removed and placed in the mouth. After 45 seconds (gentle 1188  
chewing possible, but not required), the saliva-soaked swab will be returned to the Salivette® 1189  
which will be closed with the plug for storage and transport.  The expected yield is 0.8-1.4 mL 1190  
saliva. A second round of sample collection will occur 30 minutes later following the same 1191  
procedure. The tubes will be frozen at - 80oC and shipped to USACEHR. Upon receiving the 1192  
tubes, the tubes will be centrifuged at room temperature at 1000g for 2 minutes. The first tube 1193  
will be used for microRNA sequencing and microbiome shot gun sequencing. The second tube 1194  
will be used for metabolomics and targeted proteomics (inflammatory panel of 65 protein 1195  
markers will be tested using the Luminex platform). 1196  
 1197  
Determination of Fractional Iron Absorption 1198  
Stable isotope concentrations in whole blood will be determined by inductively coupled plasma 1199  
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) by the Energy and Environmental Sustainability Laboratory 1200  
(EESL) at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) using a fee-for-service contract.  1201  
 1202  
The amount of absorbed iron in circulation will be calculated using isotope dilution as described 1203  
previously [70, 99] . Briefly, the amount of absorbed iron circulating in blood will be calculated 1204  
based on the amount of stable isotope administered, the amount of stable isotope detected in 1205  
the blood, hemoglobin concentration, and blood volume, which will be estimated based on 1206  
volunteer height and weight [100]. Isotope dilution will also be used to calculate fractional iron 1207  
incorporation into red blood cells after administration of the stable isotope and assuming 80% 1208  
incorporation [70] .  1209

Muscle Glycogen 1221  
Approximately 20 mg of muscle from each muscle biopsy will be dehydrated in a freeze dryer.  1222  
Samples will then be ground to powder and visible connective tissue will be removed.  1223  
Powdered muscle will be placed in 500 µl 2 N HCl.  Samples will then be placed in an incubator 1224  
for 120 min at 100˚C.  Following incubation samples will be neutralized with 1500 µl 0.67 N 1225  
NaOH.  Muscle glycogen will be in solution at this point.  Glycogen will be quantified by a 1226  
fluorometric assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA or equivalent).  Muscle glycogen will be 1227  
quantified to determine the contribution of endogenous carbohydrate availability on inflammation 1228  
in response to SUSUPS BAL and NEG BAL.       1229  
 1230  
mRNA, myomiR, and c-myomiR Expression 1231  
Total RNA will be isolated from approximately 25 mg of muscle using a mirVanaTM miRNA 1232  
isolation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or equivalent.  Quantity and quality of RNA will be 1233  
assessed using a Nanodrop ND- 1000  spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA).  1234  
Equal amounts of total RNA will be synthesized into cDNA for analysis of mRNA (iScriptTM 1235  
Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit; Bio-Rad or equivalent) and a TaqMan® microRNA RT kit 1236  
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or equivalent.   Individual primers will be used to 1237  
determine the mRNA expression of known muscle inflammato ry, anabolic, proteolytic, 1238  
myogenic, and metabolic markers susceptible to stress, to include but not limited to, TNF-α , 1239

Myogenenin, Pax7, PGC-1α, SIRT1, p53, ACC, and AMPK. microRNA analysis will be 1241  
conducted using individual Taqman® probes (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent, assessing 1242  
microRNA that may be associated with inflammation and metabolism.  This microRNA targets 1243  
will include, but not be limited to, miR-1, miR-23a/b, miR-26, miR-29, miR-34a, miR-103, miR- 1244  
107, miR-133a/b, miR-146, miR-206, miR-208a, miR-486, and miR- 499a.  1245  
   1246  
Following identification of skeletal muscle microRNA that had a significant change, Taqman® 1247  
probes (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent will be used to assess the expression of these 1248  
microRNA in serum to determine their potential use as noninvasive markers of altered 1249  
metabolism in response to elevated inflammation during and following SUSOPS.  Circulating 1250  
miRNA will be extracted from 200 µL serum using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit, which allows 1251  
for extraction and purification of small (< 200 nucleotides) cell-free RNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 1252

 the small amount of RNA in the serum, 3.5 µL of a Spike-In Control (C. elegans miR-39; Qiagen 1256  
or equivalent) will be added to all samples prior to extraction of RNA to determine the yield of 1257  
template recovered.  After extraction 3 μl of serum RNA will reverse transcribed using the 1258  
TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent with miRNA-specific stem-loop 1259  
RT primers pooled in 1X-Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer for a final dilution of 0.05X.  A pre-amplification 1260  
step will be performed after reverse transcription to increase cDNA template using a primer pool 1261  
of 20 X Taqman® Small RNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent for miRNA of interest 1262  
at 0.05X concentration in 1X TE buffer.  All serum miRNA will be normalized to the geometric 1263  
mean of external (Spike-In Control C. elegans miR-39) and internal controls to allow for both 1264  
technical and inter-individual normalization [101]. Geometric mean of controls will be used to 1265  
correct for possible outlying values and abundance differences between the different controls 1266  
[102].   1267  
 1268  
All reverse transcription for mRNA and miRNA, and pre-amplification of serum miRNA will be 1269  
conducted in a T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA or similar model). A 1270  
StepOnePlusTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or similar model will be used to 1271  
perform all mRNA and miRNA analysis.  Fold changes will be calculated using the ∆∆cycle 1272  
threshold (∆∆ CT) method as described below in statistical analysis section. 1273

Bioinformatics Analysis 1275  
microRNA with significant changes in their expression will be uploaded to DNA Intelligent 1276  
Analysis (DIANA)-miRPath 3.0 (Alexander Fleming Biological Sciences Research Center 1277  
[BSRC], Athens, Greece; http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr) to determine potential molecular 1278  
pathways that these microRNA have previously been reported to regulate. Relevant Kyoto 1279  
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathways will be 1280  
identified using experimentally verified targets from TarBase 7.0 (Alexander Fleming BSRC).  1281  
Based on findings from this analysis, any additional gene and protein expression of relevant 1282  
targets will be assessed.    1283  
 1284  
Western Blotting 1285  
Approximately 30 mg of muscle will be homogenized in ice-cold buffer (1:10 w/v) containing 50 1286  
mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% 1287  
glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton-X, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM benz-amidine, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg mL−1 trypsin 1288  
inhibitor and 2 μg mL−1 aprotinin.  Homogenate will be centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 1289  
4°C.  Protein concentration of supernatant (lysate) will be determined using 660 nm Protein 1290  
Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA or equivalent).  Phosphorylation status and 1291  
total protein expression of intramuscular inflammation and markers of muscle carbohydrate 1292  
metabolism will be determined by Western blot.  Muscle lysates will be solubilized in Laemmli 1293  
buffer, with equal amounts of total protein (15 μg) separated by SDS-PAGE using precast 1294  
Tris·HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins will be transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 1295  
membranes and incubated with commercially available primary antibodies of intracellular 1296  
markers involved in inflammation, anabolism, proteolysis, and substrate metabolism [e.g., IL-6, 1297  
TNFα, NF-kB, IKKα/β , Akt, mTORC1, p70SK1, AMPKα, p38 MAPK, PGC-1α , SIRT1, CaMK, 1298  
p53, and ACC (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA)] at 4°C overnight.  Labeling will 1299  
be performed using secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugate with horseradish peroxidase; 1300  
Cell Signaling Technology), and chemiluminescent reagent will be applied (Super Signal, West 1301  
Pico Kit; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA or equivalent). Blots will be quantified using 1302  
the ChemiDoc XRS from Bio-Rad and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad) or similar model. To 1303  
confirm equal protein loading per well a normalizing protein such as HSP90 or GAPDH will be 1304  
assessed.  1305

All data and medical information obtained will be considered privileged and held in confidence.  1309  
Study volunteers will be assigned unique subject identification (ID) numbers that will not contain 1310  
any personal identifiers such as name, social security number, address, date of birth, zip code, 1311  
etc.  Subject ID numbers will be used on all data collection instruments, to include 1312  
questionnaires, data collection forms, computer records, etc.  A number will be assigned as 1313  
each volunteer is enrolled for participation.  A master list linking the volunteers’ names and ID 1314  
numbers will be kept in a separate locked file in the principal investigator's or the project 1315  
coordinator’s office, or kept in a computer file with password-protected access restricted to the 1316  
principal investigator and the project coordinator. Social security numbers and banking 1317  
information will be collected to process volunteer payments.  The master list link, social security 1318  
numbers, and banking information will be deleted immediately after the study has been 1319  
completed and payment has been confirmed.  When the results of the research are published or 1320  
discussed in conferences, no information will be included that would reveal identity.  Study 1321  
biological samples will be processed on site at USARIEM and stored in Military Nutrition 1322  
laboratory freezers (rooms 322, 304) using the subject identification number until analyzed on 1323  
site or until sample aliquots are shipped to other laboratories for analysis.   Aliquots will be made 1324  
of all study samples and stored on site in Military Nutrition laboratory freezers indefinitely for 1325  
reanalysis if necessary.  Aliquots of c oded biological samples will be shipped overnight on dry 1326  
ice to Dr. Hammamieh at USACEHER, Dr. Rood at PBRC, Metabolic Solutions Inc., and to the 1327  
Energy and Environmental Sustainability Laboratory (EESL PSU) at Pennsylvania State 1328  
University for analyses.  Once samples have been analyzed by these respective laboratories, 1329  
there will be no remaining sample for storage.  Coded data will be transmitted between the 1330

Power analyses were performed using www.biomath.info/power/prt.htm  and indicate that 1383  
11 participants will provide adequate power (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8) to detect 1384  
significant changes in circulating concentrations of IL-6 and hepcidin in response to 1385  
stress and differences in energy balance. To account for potential attrition (~30% attrition 1386  
in 16- 02-HC), 4 additional subjects are requested for a total of 15 subjects.  Data used in 1387  
calculating samples size estimates (i.e., means and standard deviations) are derived 1388  
from previous studies that found significant increases in IL-6 and/or hepcidin in 1) male 1389  
athletes (n=12) after a 7-day training block [103], 2) male athletes (n=9) after two 75 min 1390  
endurance exercise bouts separated by 3 h of rest [22], 3) male athletes (n=8) after two 1391  
high-intensity endurance exercise bouts over two days [23], and 4) male athletes (n=11) 1392  
completing a 1.5 h treadmill run [104]. The outcome measures, means, standard 1393

We have previously shown that an increase of intestinal permeability of 55-60% is 1397  
associated with inflammation in military-relevant environments (USARIEM protocol 14- 1398  
33HC [44]) .  Using means (pre-SUSOPS sucralose excretion = 2.0%), standard 1399  
deviations (SD = 1.1), and correlations for repeated measurements of sucralose 1400  
excretion (r = 0.5) from 14-33HC, we estimate that 14 subjects will allow detection of a 1401  
main effect of study phase (BL vs. SUSOPS-NEG BAL vs. SUSOPS-BAL) if the effect 1402  
size of SUSOPS-BAL vs. SUSOPS-NEG BAL on intestinal permeability is medium 1403  
(~20% decrease)  at power = 0.80 and alpha = 0.0 17 1404  
(https://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org/).   Of note, larger effect sizes have been reported 1405  
in studies investigating the effects of nutritional interventions on intestinal permeability 1406  
during exercise [105].  Additionally, we feel that it is likely that the SDs measured in this 1407  
laboratory study will be slightly lower than those measured in our previous study (14- 1408  
33HC) which was conducted in a field environment.  A 25% decrease in the SD would 1409  
allow us to detect a main effect of phase with 11 subjects at power = 0.80 and alpha = 1410  
0.017.  As such we expect an n of 11 to 15 will provide adequate power to detect a main 1411  
effect of phase on intestinal permeability.   1412  
 1413  
Power calculations for appetite-mediating hormones outcomes were conducted using 1414  
data obtained during USARIEM protocol H10- 09 [73, 106].  In that study an energy 1415  
deficit (3700 kcal/d) slightly greater than that which will be imposed in this study resulted 1416  
in a 2.5-fold decrease in fasted acyl ghrelin, a 2.2 fold decrease in leptin, a 1.7-fold 1417  
decrease in PYY, and a 3-fold increase in PP concentrations concomitant to an ~11-fold 1418  
increase in appetite and overeating during recovery from energy deficit.   Based on these 1419  
results we expect to observe the hormone responses in the table below where fasting 1420  
concentrations will be approximately maintained during BAL, and the maximal difference 1421  
between BAL and NEG BAL will be observed on SUSOPS day 3 followed by a full 1422  
recovery of hormone concentrations by recovery day 3.  For all but PP, 12 subjects will 1423  
provide ≥80% power at alpha = 0.01 to detect a phase- by-time interaction. 1424

Using data obtained using the SmartPill in a study of 73 healthy adults we estimate that 1430  
mean gastrointestinal transit time at baseline will be 29.5 hr (SD = 11.0 hr) [107].  Horner 1431  
et al. [108] reported a large effect size of 1.0 in a meta-analysis of high-quality studies 1432  
that measured changes in orocecal transit time in response to exercise.  A similar effect 1433  
size was reported by Corvilain et al. [109] who measured gastric emptying in healthy 1434

 adults before and after a 4-d fast.  Using these data and a conservative correlation 1435  
between repeated measurements of r = 0.50 (Diaz-Tartera et al. [107] reported r = 0.99), 1436  
we estimate that n = 8 participants will provide >80% power to detect a main effect of 1437  
condition at alpha = 0.05.  This sample size will also provide >80% power to detect a 1438  
main effect should the effect size be medium (effect size = 0.5) and the correlation 1439  
between repeated measurements (r = 0.90) more similar to that reported by Diaz-Tartera 1440  
et al. [107]. We will enroll at least n = 9 in this procedure to ensure complete data is 1441  
collected on 8 participants.  Due to equipment availability, n = 9 is also the maximum 1442  
number of participants we can measure simultaneously.  However, should multiple 1443  
iterations be needed to complete data collection, we will enroll up to n = 9 participants 1444  
during each iteration.  Although n = 8 is sufficient to detect a main effect of condition, 1445  
enrolling more than n = 9 will provide greater power to detect associations between 1446  
changes in gastrointestinal transit time and changes in gut microbiota composition, 1447  
intestinal permeability, and appetite-related outcomes.  1448  
 1449  
Next Generation Sequencing (maximum 200 million pair-end reads) of blood mRNA 1450  
samples from 15 participants will yield 60% statistical power to detect a true difference in 1451  
expression of at least 1.5 fold with group coefficient variation 0.4, and  a conservative 1452  
false discovery rate of 0.05 using moderated t-tests and with transcriptome coverage of 1453  
9 over reference human genome with sequence length of 150 base pairs . Note, a more 1454  
liberal false discovery rate (e.g., 0.20) may be used to reduce type 2 error rates and 1455  
increase power.  For microbiome analysis, shotgun sequencing (maximum 50 million 1456  
pair end reads) of 15 participan ts will achieve ≥ 69% power to detect a true difference in 1457  
relative abundance of at least 1.5 fold with group coefficient variation 1.3, and false 1458  
discovery rate of 0.05. Again, a more liberal false discovery rate (e.g., 0.20) may be 1459  
used to reduce type 2 error rates and increase power.  Power calculations were 1460  
conducted using pairwise distances and PERMANOVA power with respect to effect size.  1461  
However, power will be enhanced by correlating the blood mRNA data with other omics 1462  
readouts derived from saliva (micro RNA -seq, metabolomics and microbiome) and blood 1463  
(targeted microRNA and metabolomics), and by temporal sample collection.  As such, 1464  
we expect that 15 participants will provide adequate power to detect differences in blood 1465  
mRNA expression, and gut microbiome community and genome composition between 1466  
study phases, and correlations between these parameters and other –omics readouts. 1467  
   1468  
B5.8.2 Data analysis   1469  
 1470  
Statistical analyses will be conducted using either SPSS (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY), SAS 1471  
9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Carey, NC), or equivalent.  Common descriptive statistics will be 1472  
used to describe volunteer characteristics.  Shapiro-Wilk tests will be used to determine 1473  
normality of data, and transformations will be applied as appropriate to ensure mode l 1474  
assumptions are met.  Correlation and multiple regression will be used to evaluate 1475  
relationships between study outcomes.   1476  
 1477  
Primary Objectives 1478  
Linear mixed models will be used to determine main effects of phase (SUSOPS BAL and 1479  
SUSOPS NEG BAL), time within phase, and their interaction on inflammation, iron 1480  
absorption, mood/cognitive, and measures of muscle, nutritional, and metabolic 1481  
homeostasis.  If phase by time interactions are observed, a Bonferroni correction will be 1482  
applied for multiple comparisons.  Statistical significance will be set at P < 0.05. To test 1483  
for carryover effects a main effect of group (SUSOPS BAL first, SUSOPS NEG BAL first) 1484

 and a group- by-phase interaction will be included in initial models.  These terms will be 1485  
removed if they do not significantly contribute to the overall fit of the model.   When 1486  
significant phase- by-time interactions are observed post hoc comparisons will be made 1487  
using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections.    1488  
 1489  
Secondary Objectives 1490  
Linear mixed models will be used to examine changes in intestinal permeability and 1491  
gastrointestinal transit time. Models will include subject as a random factor, and study 1492  
phase as a fixed factor.  To test for carryover effects a main effect of group (SUSO PS 1493  
BAL first, SUSOPS NEG BAL first) and a group- by-phase interaction will be included in 1494  
initial models.  These terms will be removed if they do not significantly contribute to the 1495  
overall fit of the model.  When a significant main effect is observed post hoc 1496  
comparisons will be made using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections.  1497  
 1498  
Fecal metabolomics data will be visualized using hierarchical average-linkage clustering 1499  
and principal components analysis. Bacterial taxonomic data will be visualized using 1500  
hierarchical average-linkage clustering and principal coordinates analysis of beta (i.e., 1501  
between samples) diversity scores (e.g., Bray-Curtis, and weighted and unweighted 1502  
UniFrac). Alpha (i.e., within-sample) diversity will be calculated for taxonomic data using 1503  
Shannon, Simpson and Chao1 indices.   Linear mixed models will be used to examine 1504  
changes in biomarkers of gut health, fecal metabolite concentrations, and alpha diversity 1505  
over time. Models will include subject as a random factor, and study phase, time within 1506  
phase, and their interaction as fixed factors.  To test for carryover effects a main effect of 1507  
group (SUSOPS BAL first, SUSOPS NEG BAL first) and a group- by-phase interaction 1508  
will be included in initial models.  These terms will be removed if they do not significantly 1509  
contribute to the overall fit of the model.  Models for bacterial taxa and gene abundance 1510  
will be analyzed using the R statistical software package “DESeq2” or equivalent.  The 1511  
Benjamini-Hochberg correction will be used to control the false discovery rate in 1512  
microbiome-specific and metabolite models.  Data analysis will be completed using 1513  
SPSS, XLSTAT, R, Qiime, or similar software as needed. 1514  
 1515  
Linear mixed models will be used to examine changes in appetite-mediating hormone 1516  
concentrations, appetite ratings, food preferences, food choice during recovery (i.e., diet 1517  
macronutrient proportion and energy intake). Models will include subject as a random 1518  
factor, and study phase, time within phase, and their interaction as fixed factors.  1519  
Separate analysis will be conducted for fasted and post-exercise appetite-mediating 1520  
hormones.  To test for carryover effects a main effect of group (SUSOPS BAL first, 1521  
SUSOPS NEG BAL first) and a group- by-phase interaction will be included in initial 1522  
models.  These terms will be removed if they do not significantly contribute to the overall 1523  
fit of the model.   When significant phase- by-time interactions are observed post hoc 1524  
comparisons will be made using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections.  1525  
 1526  
The mRNA seq strand-specific libraries will be assayed using the Illumina HiSeq 1527  
platform. Paired end reads of the strand-specific RNA sequences (RNA-Seq) will be 1528  
generated using NextSQ from one flow cell with eight lanes, producing at least 30 million 1529  
reads of 100 bases per sample. Based calling and expression analysis will be conducted 1530  
using the Illumina-provided tool CASAVA. miRNA (20-40 bp) will be size selected from 1531  
total RNA and will be processed by Illumina NextSQ. Image analysis and base calling 1532  
will be performed using the newest available version of the Illumina pipeline. 1533  
Preprocessing of raw base calls and sample de-multiplexing will be performed using the 1534

 standard open source tool CASAVA. The microRNA read count matrix will be generated 1535  
by a series of tool kits of latest version including CutAdapt, short read aligner Bowtie and 1536  
PICARD. Metabolomics and proteomics reads will be processed by the software offered 1537  
by the vendors namely Waters Corporation and BioRad, respectively. 1538  
 1539  
Using a systems approach, we will integrate multiple levels of biological information. We 1540  
have published the analysis pipeline and implemented it successfully in the past. Our 1541  
pipeline uses industry standards and our established SOPs. We will start by analyzing 1542  
and processing data at the analyte level for each data type such as mRNA expression, 1543  
miRNA expression, microbiome, proteomics, and metabolomics. We will first examine 1544  
the confounding factors or batch effects caused by non-biological factors, such as the 1545  
technical error, sample processing date etc., using principal component analysis and 1546  
ANOVA. If necessary, corrections will be made using the COMBAT algorithm. All 1547  
datasets will be visually inspected using PCA, heatmaps, and boxplots before and after 1548  
any required normalization, correction, or filtering, to assure quality control. 1549  
 1550  
Using R package the significantly altered analytes will be mined by t-test p-values 1551  
(<0.05) and fold-change 1.5. The R package BETR in conjunction with standard and 1552  
lagged correlation analysis will be used to find biological signatures which vary 1553  
systematically with the phenotypic data. Data dimension reduction, specifically latent 1554  
factor analysis for phenotypic (clinical indices of disease onset) and PCA/PCoA for 1555  
omics data will be used to uncover underlying mechanisms and dominating trends. Venn 1556  
diagrams will be used to identify the biological signatures, including the molecules and 1557  
enriched networks/pathways, which will emerge common/unique to different treatment 1558  
groups and common/unique to control vs. treated specimens. To assess gene ontology 1559  
and pathway enrichments, and analyze regulatory networks and common pathways we 1560  
will use the Hypergeometric Test (false discovery rate, q < 0.05) of Bingo 2.44 and 1561  
ClueGO (Cytoscape 3.0.1 plugins; http://www.cytoscape.org/), Fisher’s Exact Test of 1562  
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity, Inc., Redwood, CA), and Gene Set 1563  
Enrichment Analysis (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) software sets. Gene- 1564  
metabolite condition ‘interactomes’ will be constructed and visualized using Gephi.0.8.2 1565  
beta (www.gephi.org). Using a suite of platforms such as ClueGo, Bingo, IPA, David and 1566  
IMPaLA, we will deliver a panel of networks informed by multiple levels of molecular 1567  
evidence that are unique to treatment groups. From these analyses we will produce a 1568  
suite of networks informed by multiple levels of molecular evidence that are unique to 1569  
treatment groups. 1570  
 1571  
We will employ our in-house developed tool, Core Module Biomarker Identification with 1572  
Network Exploration (COMBINER), to look for those novel functional groupings of 1573  
molecules, which are statistically perturbed across time course.  In addition, Feature 1574  
Assisted Clustering for Time-series (FACT), a pipeline for exploratory analysis and 1575  
visualization of longitudinal data, will identify differential expressed molecules, 1576  
pathways/GO terms, separate clusters of similar patterns, and compare pathway 1577  
dynamics.   Finally, we will use commonly accepted criteria of Receiver Operator Curve 1578  
(ROC), using Area Under Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the 1579  
performance of individual molecules.       1580

C1.  RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT    1586  
 1587  
C1.1 Identification and Selection of Subjects   1588  
 1589  
Interested volunteers who have been briefed on study procedures will be provided the 1590  
opportunity to consent to participate.  After consent, and before medical clearance, study 1591  
eligibility will be determined based on volunteer responses to questions pertaining to 1592  
self-reported study inclusion and exclusion criteria (see “Background Questionnaire”). If 1593  
still eligible, volunteers will make an appointment for a medical screening. If an individual 1594  
fails the screening, their screening and demographic data will be destroyed. An 1595  
additional demographic and nutritional questionnaire will be administered during the pre- 1596  
study baseline period to those participants who are enrolled in the study (see “Additional 1597  
Demographic and Nutritional Survey” ). 1598  
  1599  
The medical clearance will take place at USARIEM (Natick, MA) by OMSO staff.  1600  
Volunteers recruited through SSIT may undergo OMSO medical clearance at their home 1601  
duty station prior to arrival at USARIEM (clearances will be coordinated between the PI, 1602  
OMSO, and the unit’s Brigade Surgeon). The clearance will include a blood draw to 1603  
assess health status and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The medical screening visit will 1604  
take approximately 1 hr. If any medical screening tests show a possible medical 1605  
concern, the volunteer will be notified. Those who receive study clearance and meet the 1606  
inclusion/exclusion criteria will continue on pre-study, baseline testing.  1607  
 1608  
C1.2 Recruitment Process    1609  
 1610  
Volunteers will be recruited from the Natick Human Research Volunteer (HRV) Pool, and 1611  
the active duty population located at other military organizations, to include coordination 1612  
with NSSC Soldier/Squad Interface Team (SSIT) .  1613  
 1614  
For HRVs , the Principal Investigator will provide a copy of the informed consent 1615  
document to the HRV Program Coordinator or designee. The Coordinator will schedule 1616  
the consent briefing for the military human research volunteer platoon and will serve as 1617  
ombudsman during the briefing. The HRV Coordinator may also organize consent 1618  
briefings for Soldiers at their Advanced Individual Training unit.  The Coordinator will 1619  
serve as an ombudsman for the offsite consent briefings.  In addition, other military 1620  
organizations may be recruited through coordination with NSSC SSIT.  The NSSC SSIT 1621  
Coordinator will schedule the consent briefing for the military research volunteers and an 1622  
ombudsman will be present during briefing. Ms. Katelyn Guerriere will serve as the 1623  
ombudsman for the current study .  1624  
 1625  
Superiors of Service members (e.g., unit officers, senior NCOs, and equivalent civilians) 1626  
shall not be present at any recruitment sessions or during the consent process in which 1627  
members of units under their command are afforded the opportunity to participate as 1628  
human subjects of research. 1629  
 1630  
Other active duty personnel may also be recruited by “word of mouth” and posted flyers   1631  
Recruiting materials will be distributed around NSSC. The te xt-based flyer will be posted 1632  
on various USARIEM social media sites and used in distribution media requiring a text 1633

 format (e.g., electronic newsletters).  Approvals from the requisite parties will be 1634  
obtained prior to any recruitment activities.  1635  
 1636  
C1.3 Eligibility    1637  
All potential volunteers will complete the background questionnaire pertaining to the 1638  
study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Volunteers must then be medically cleared by 1639  
OMSO for participation in accordance with USARIEM procedures outlined for screening 1640  
volunteers for research involving exercise. Volunteers recruited through SSIT may 1641  
undergo OMSO medical clearance at their home duty station prior to arrival at USARIEM 1642  
(clearances will be coordinated between the PI, OMSO, and the units Brigade Surgeon) . 1643  
Volunteers will be screened for anemia and problems with blood clotting, including 1644  
prothrombin time ( PT)/ partial thromboplastin time ( PTT), which is a specific criterion for 1645  
research involving muscle biopsies. Health problems identified during the screening 1646  
process will be documented and a copy provided to the volunteer. The volunteer will be 1647  
encouraged to make an appointment with their primary care pr ovider for a full evaluation 1648  
of the problem. Volunteers with evidence of any physical, mental, and/or medical 1649  
conditions that would make the proposed studies relatively more hazardous will be 1650  
excluded. Any personal health information collected during this screening process will be 1651  
destroyed at the time of study withdrawal or at the completion of the study.  1652  
 1653  
All volunteers must be willing to consume only food and beverages provided by study 1654  
staff during the SUSOPS phases of the protocol, and they must be willing to adhere to 1655  
exercise and physical activity prescriptions and restrictions.  If the results of all screening 1656  
tools reveal the volunteer fits the screening criteria, they will be eligible to volunteer for 1657  
the study.   1658  
 1659  
C1.4 Consent Process 1660  
 1661  
Prior to providing informed consent, discussions with potential volunteers (such as over 1662  
the telephone) will not involve the collection of any personally identifiable information 1663  
besides their name, email, and telephone number. The principal investigator , an 1664  
associate investigator or the project coordinator will brief potential volunteers about the 1665  
nature, purpose, procedures involved, risks, expectations and requirements for 1666  
participation in the study. Study briefings will be scheduled to occur in-person, and will 1667  
not occur over the phone.  Prospective volunteers will be familiarized with the study 1668  
procedures and informed verbally and in writing of their rights to withdraw from any part 1669  
of the study without penalty or prejudice. The principal investigator or designee will 1670  
answer all group and private questions. Potential volunteers will have at least one hour 1671  
after they are briefed, with the ombudsman remaining present, to read and review the 1672  
Informed Consent document and decide whether they wish to consent to participate . No 1673  
study procedures will occur prior to any volunteer giving their informed consent.   An 1674  
ombudsman will not be required for any individual briefings. A copy of the informed 1675  
consent document will be provided to the volunteer with the original kept for study 1676  
documentation. If they meet all the medical selection and eligibility criteria after 1677  
completing the screening health assessment and consenting to participate, they will 1678  
begin preliminary testing. Volunteers who have already consented will be informed of 1679  
any new information or changes to the protocol that may affect their willingness and 1680  
ability to continue participation in the study using an approved consent addendum. 1681

It is the policy of USAMRDC that data sheets are to be completed on all 1704  
volunteers participating in this research for entry into the U.S. Army Medical 1705  
Research and Development Command Volunteer Registry Database.  The 1706  
information to be entered into this confidential database includes name, address, 1707  
social security number, study name, and dates.  The intent of the database is 1708  
twofold: first, to readily answer questions concerning an individual’s participation 1709  
in research sponsored by the USAMRDC; and second, to ensure that the 1710  
USAMRDC can exercise its obligation to ensure research volunteers are 1711  
adequately warned (duty to warn) of risks and to provide new information as it 1712  
becomes available.  The information will be stored at the USAMRDC for a 1713  
minimum of 75 years. 1714  
 1715  
C2. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION    1716  
 1717  
Volunteers will receive a total of $1050  for completing the study.  This is based on an amount of 1718  
$25 per blood draw (42 total draws).  1719  
 1720  
Note: Volunteers who receive more than $600 in a calendar year will have this income reported 1721  
to the Internal Revenue Service.   1722  
 1723  
C3. WITHDRAWAL FROM RESEARCH PARTICIPATION   1724  
 1725  
Volunteers will be allowed to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 1726  
they would otherwise be entitled. An investigator may stop an individual’s participation in the 1727  
study if the volunteer is unwilling or unable to complete study procedures or follow study 1728  
diets/exercise prescriptions. An investigator may also withdraw a volunteer if the individual 1729  
becomes ill or injured or it would not be in the volunteer’s best interest to continue. If the 1730  
participant is withdrawn by the investigator or decides to voluntarily withdraw himself, all further 1731  
data collection will discontinue, but the data that was collected up to the point of withdrawal may 1732

 still be used for analysis.  Participants will be compensated for any blood draws they completed 1733  
up until that point, and they will be asked to return any study food and/or wrappers, study 1734  
supplies that were provided, in addition to any study logs that they had completed up to the 1735  
point of withdrawal.  1736  
 1737  
C4. PRI VACY FOR SUBJECTS    1738  
 1739  
To protect the volunteer’s privacy, all of their research-related records will be labeled or “coded” 1740  
with an assigned research volunteer number that will not include their name or any other form of 1741  
identifiable information.   The principal investigator or project coordinator will keep the link 1742  
between volunteer number and the volunteer’s research records in a locked cabinet.  Any 1743  
documents that will require the volunteer’s name, such as the consent form, will be kept in a 1744  
locked cabinet separate from any research documents that contain the volunteer’s ID number.  1745  
The principal investigator and project manager are the only people who will be able to match the 1746  
research volunteer number with any of their personal identifying information.    1747  
 1748  
When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will 1749  
be included that would reveal the volunteer’s identity to others.  If photographs, videos, or audio- 1750  
tape recordings of volunteers are used for educational purposes, volunteer identity will be 1751  
protected or disguised.  All identifiable or recognizable information (e.g., names and faces) will 1752  
be covered in any photographs unless volunteers agree to sign a photo release form. If 1753  
volunteers do not sign a photo release form, any photographs taken of them will be destroyed. 1754  
 1755  
C5.  CONFIDENTIALITY PROCEDURES FOR RESEARCH RECORDS, DATA, HUMAN 1756  
BIOLOGICAL SPECIM ENS  1757  
 1758  
All data and medical information obtained will be considered privileged and held in confidence.  1759  
Study volunteers will be assigned unique subject identification (ID) numbers that will not contain 1760  
any personal identifiers such as name, social security number, address, date of birth, zip code, 1761  
etc.  This study subject ID number will be used on all data collection instruments, to include 1762  
questionnaires, data collection forms, computer records, etc.  A number will be assigned as 1763  
each volunteer is medically cleared for participation.  A master list linking the volunteers’ names 1764  
and ID numbers will be kept in a separate locked file in the principal investigator's or project 1765  
manager’s office, or kept in a computer file with password-protected access restricted to t he 1766  
principal investigator and project manager.  When the results of the research are published or 1767  
discussed in conferences, no information will be included that would reveal identity.  Study 1768  
samples will be processed on site at USARIEM, and off-site at PBRC, USACEHR, and at the 1769  
fee-for-service labs.  All samples will be stored using the subject identification number.  The 1770  
volunteers name or other identifiable information will not be included on any data, data 1771  
collection sheets, specimens, or other research records.   Coded data from the LFPQ will be 1772  
provided to the University of Leeds for analysis using encrypted email or a secure file transfer 1773  
website (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/ Welcome.aspx ).  Coded study data may be shared 1774  
with the USACEHR for integration with –omics data sets.  Any shared data will be transferred 1775  
using encrypted email, a secure file transfer website 1776  
(https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/Welcome.aspx) or the SysBioCube platform 1777  
(https://sysbiocube-abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).  No personally identifiable information will be shared with 1778  
PBRC, the University of Leeds, or USACEHR.      1779

C6.  RISKS OF HARM, MEASURES TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF HARM, AND BENEFITS 1787  
OF PARTICIPATION  1788  
 1789  
C6.1 Risks of Harm    1790  
 1791  
Research Procedure Name:  Venipuncture 1792  
Research Procedure Description: A needle is used to draw blood from a superficial 1793  
vein.    1794  
Research-related Risks:   Venipuncture is a routine clinical procedure the medical 1795  
community commonly uses to obtain blood samples. The risks of venipuncture are small 1796  
and usually limited to local bruising or swelling. Sometimes volunteers feel faint or may 1797  
faint during or right after venipuncture.  If the volunteer has had problems with fainting 1798  
during blood draws in the past, they may be more prone to them during future 1799  
procedures. Dizziness or faintness constitutes no long-term harm, and immediate relief 1800  
is achieved by having the subject put their head down between their knees or lie down. 1801  
In addition, a hematoma may result from the venipuncture, but this is more unsightly 1802  
than risk producing.  Late complications might include thrombosis of the vein due to 1803  
trauma or infection. These complications are extremely rare .  1804  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   Volunteer monitoring, aseptic technique, 1805  
including sterile disposable blood collection apparatus and adherence to standard 1806  
medical precautions reduce risk. Trained technicians will perform all venipuncture. 1807  
         1808  
Research Procedure Name:   Venous Catheterization  1809  
Research Procedure Description:   A needle will be used to guide a catheter into a 1810  
superficial vein in the antecubital fossa (or distally). The catheter will either be attached 1811  
to saline, or flushed periodically with saline, to keep the line patent for serial blood 1812  
draws.     1813  
Research-related Risks:   The risks of venous catheterization are small and usually 1814  
limited to local bruising or swelling.  Sometimes volunteers feel faint or may faint during 1815  
or right after the catheter is placed.  If the volunteer has had problems with fainting 1816  
during blood draws in the past, they may be more prone to them during future 1817  
procedures. Dizziness or faintness constitutes no long-term harm, and immediate relief 1818  
is achieved by having the subject put their head down between their knees or lie down. If 1819  
the catheter becomes clogged at any time during the protocol, it will be replaced to 1820  
continue blood sampling and therefore the study. This will require another needle to be 1821  
inserted.   1822  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Trained technicians will use aseptic techniques 1823  
to place the catheter; however, in spite of being careful there is a chance that the site 1824  
may become infected. Volunteers should not give blood for 4 months before and 2 1825  
months after the study.   1826  
 1827  
Research Procedure Name:  Oral Stable Isotope Administration 1828  
Research Procedure Description:  Volunteers will consume a drink containing stable 1829  
isotopically labeled iron or amino acids on multiple occasions.   1830  
Research-related Risks:  There are no known risks or reported side effects associated 1831  
with oral administration of stable isotopes to humans during clinical or experimental 1832

 studies.  This is because there is relatively little mass difference between the isotopic 1833  
tracers and the more prevalent natural isotopes, and the body’s naturally occurring pool 1834  
of stable isotopes is high enough that types of experimental protocols proposed have no 1835  
appreciable effect on the total abundance of the isotopes present in the body.  1836  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  All staff who directly participates in the stable 1837  
isotope studies will be properly trained to prepare and administer from Dr. Pasiakos, who 1838  
has extensive experience with stable isotopes.  1839  
 1840  
Research Procedure Name:  Percutaneous Skeletal Muscle Biopsy  1841  
Research Procedure Description: A small incision will be made in the skin and fascia 1842  
of the vastus lateralis.  A 5-mm Bergstrom biopsy needle will pass through these 1843  
incisions with manual suction applied to collect muscle samples, while the volunteer is 1844  
under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine).  1845  
Research-related Risks:  Percutaneous needle muscle biopsies have been established 1846  
as a non-routine, but safe research procedure. Similar to blood draws, there is a risk that 1847  
volunteers will feel faint or may faint right after a muscle biopsy.  If the volunteer has had 1848  
problems with fainting during blood draws or muscle biopsies in the past, they may be 1849  
more prone to them during future procedures.  The most common risks associated with 1850  
muscle biopsies are pain (~1.27%), erythema (~1.27%), and ecchymosis (1.27%).[110, 1851  
111] Panic episode, bleeding, and edema have also been reported (0.21%, 0.42%, and 1852  
0.84%, respectively).[110] Denervation, numbness, and atrophy may occur but have not 1853  
been verified in the literature.  Some minimal scarring will accompany healing of the 1854  
incision and formation of a hypertrophic scar or keloid is possible.  Although this is a rare 1855  
event in fair-skinned persons, the incidence of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation 1856  
associated with healing of a primarily closed skin biopsy site (i.e., one which was closed 1857  
with sutures immediately afterward) is 5-10% in dark-skinned persons.   1858  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Complications of bleeding can be reduced by 1859  
applying direct pressure to the wound following the biopsy.  If symptoms should occur, 1860  
they usually do not interfere with normal walking or heavier exercise.  Volunteers with 1861  
evidence of bleeding diathesis should be excluded during medical clearance; those with 1862  
local skin infection or irritation or recent use of anticoagulant medication not identified 1863  
during initial medical screening (including aspirin) will be withdrawn by the PI in 1864  
consultation with OMSO. Volunteers will be instructed about precautions against 1865  
hematoma and infection.  They will be given a handout outlining instructions for proper 1866  
care of the incision site (see “Biopsy Care Instructions”).  Muscle biopsies will be 1867  
performed using sterile procedures by Dr. Stefan Pasiakos or Dr. Lee Margolis, who will 1868  
abide by USARIEM’s Percutaneous Skeletal Muscle Biopsy SOP (OMSO-approved 1869  
USARIEM SOP for Invasive Procedures, Chapter 10) of 11 July 2017 in all regards. The 1870  
PI and OMSO will follow-up with volunteers within 3 d post-biopsy to monitor for any sign 1871  
of infection, bleeding, or hematoma. 1872  
 1873  
Research Procedure Name:  Lidocaine Injection  1874  
Research Procedure Description:   Approximately 8-10 mL of 1% lidocaine will be 1875  
injected using a 25 g needle at the site of the incision, superficially (i.e., skin) and within 1876  
the vastus lateralis.  1877  
Research-related Risks:   Slight pain at the site of injection might occur.  Although rare, 1878  
anaphylactic reactions may also occur following administration of lidocaine.  Unlikely, but 1879  
possible side effects could include: dizziness, confusion, shakiness, visual changes, 1880  
nausea, and unusually slow heartbeat.   1881

 Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Volunteers will be instructed to notify a study 1882  
investigator or the project coordinator immediately if an allergic (i.e., swelling, itching, 1883  
rash, hives, difficulty swallowing, or difficulty breathing) reaction occurs. In the case of 1884  
severe reaction, lidocaine use will be discontinued and OMSO will be notified 1885  
immediately.  Dr. Pasiakos or Dr. Margolis will be the only ones administering the 1886  
lidocaine, and medical staff will be onsite.  The PI and study staff will closely monitor the 1887  
volunteers throughout the procedure.  1888  
 1889  
Research Procedure Name:   Exercise  1890  
Research Procedure Description:   Exercise includes peak aerobic capacity and 1891  
glycogen normalization studies on a cycle ergometer, outdoor load carriage exercise, 1892  
steady-state elliptical and cycle ergometer exercise sessions, exercise associated with 1893  
the Warfighter tasks .   1894  
Research-related Risks:  Exercise is generally considered safe and beneficial for 1895  
individuals without cardiovascular disease. The US prevalence of fatal events is 1896  
approximately 1:100,000 to 1:300,000 in competitive high school athletes and increases 1897  
to 1:15,000 to 1:50,000 in athletes over the age of 35.  Current civilian and military 1898  
guidelines state that individuals less than 40 years of age who have no symptoms of or 1899  
known presence of heart disease or major coronary risk factors have a low risk for 1900  
cardiac complications during vigorous exercise.  All volunteers in this study fall into this 1901  
low risk category.  Local muscle discomfort and fatigue may occur in active muscles 1902  
during and shortly after exercise.  Exercise often carries a risk of injury, including 1903  
dehydration, acute musculoskeletal strains and sprains, overuse injuries, and accidental 1904  
injuries caused by the test apparatus.  The risk of musculoskeletal injury from bouts of 1905  
endurance exercise is minimal. Muscle soreness, ranging in intensity from mild to 1906  
severe, may persist for 1 to 7 days. Additional risks associated with exercise include foot 1907  
blisters, skin chafing, muscle cramps, stress fracture, trauma due to falling, and 1908  
hypotension following the completion of the exercise bout.  The frequency of many of 1909  
these risks increases with the duration of the exercise bout.   1910  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   Studies have confirmed the safety of maximal 1911  
exercise testing, particularly among apparently healthy persons without significant 1912  
cardiovascular risk factors.  As a precaution, there will be at least one spotter/monitor 1913  
during all exercise sessions, and heart rate will be monitored in real time during testing. 1914  
Exercise monitors and test administrators will be CPR-certified.  Additional safeguards 1915  
taken to minimize risk during exercise include: (a) qualified personnel will administer the 1916  
maximal exercise tests, (b) the volunteer will be asked to report any pain or discomfort 1917  
resulting from exercise, followed up if necessary by medical examination and 1918  
postponement or curtailment of further testing, (c) volunteers will be required to wear 1919  
correctly sized footwear, and (d) volunteers will have access to water (ad libitum) to 1920  
remain hydrated.  1921  
 1922  
Research Procedure Name:   Energy Balance and Negative Energy Balance Diet 1923  
Interventions 1924  
Research Procedure Description:   Volunteers will be fed adequate energy to maintain 1925  
body mass during SUSOPS BAL and only 45% of total energy expenditure during 1926  
SUSOPS NEG BAL to elicit negative energy balance (where dietary intake is < energy 1927  
expenditure). Combat rations will be the primary food source (some perishable whole- 1928  
foods).     1929  
Research-related Risks:  The foods and MRE components used in this study pose no 1930  
known risks to volunteers. All of the meals that volunteers will be fed during both 96 hour 1931

 SUSOPS periods consist solely of MRE components.  Sudden changes to the diet can 1932  
cause gas, cramping, bloating, constipation, or other abdominal discomfort in some 1933  
individuals. The main discomfort associated with a low energy diets is hunger. 1934  
Volunteers will be shown copies of study menus and food lists at the initial study 1935  
recruitment brief. This will be used to determine if prospective volunteers have an 1936  
allergy, intolerance, or personal preference to foods listed. 1937  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   All efforts will be made to accommodate the 1938  
volunteers with regard to dietary preferences while keeping the major constituents of the 1939  
diets consistent with study design and between volunteers. Those who have an allergy 1940  
or intolerance to a menu component, which cannot be accommodated, will not be 1941  
enrolled in the study. 1942  
 1943  
Research Procedure Name:   Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) Scan  1944  
Research Procedure Description:  Volunteer will lay face-up on the DEXA 1945  
densitometer table in shorts, t-shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to 1946  
remain motionless for the 8-10 min scan.  1947  
Research-related Risks:  The DEXA scan is an X-ray and is considered to be a low risk 1948  
procedure.  The radiation dose of the whole-body DEXA scan is 0.1 mrem.  This dose is 1949  
equivalent to approximately 1/250 of normal annual background radiation, 1/9 of the 1950  
radiation received in a transatlantic flight, or 1/30 of the radiation received in a chest X- 1951  
ray.   1952  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   A quality assurance check will be completed on 1953  
the DEXA each day prior to its use; the software will not allow the use of the DEXA 1954  
densitometer if the quality assurance check fails.   1955

 1961  
Research Procedure Name:   Multi-sugar absorption test for intestinal permeability 1962  
measurement  1963  
Research Procedure Description:  Participants will consume 2 g sucralose and 2 g 1964  
erythritol dissolved in 180 mL water. All urine produced over the subsequent 24hr will be 1965  
collected. 1966  
Research Related Risks:  Sucralose and erythritol are commonly consumed sugar 1967  
substitutes which may cause gas, cramping, diarrhea or bloating in some individuals.  1968  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Any participant reporting gastrointestinal 1969  
distress following the test will be given the option of not participating in the test at the 1970  
next opportunity.  1971  
 1972  
Research Procedure Name:   SmartPill 1973  
Research Procedure Description: The SmartPill is an ingestible FDA-approved 1974  
wireless motility capsule that transits the gastrointestinal tract while continuously 1975  
measuring pH, temperature, pressure, and gastrointestinal transit time.  A single pill will 1976  
be ingested by volunteers and allowed to pass normally through the gastrointestinal 1977  
tract. 1978  
Research Related Risks: Choking, aspiration, retention gastrointestinal tract.  1979  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: Potential participants with contraindications for 1980  
use will not be allowed to participate in the SmartPill procedure.  If they are randomly 1981

 1998  
C7.1 Monitoring  1999  
 2000  
The PI will, with the assistance of Associate Investigators and project coordinator, 2001  
continuously evaluate recruitment, the informed consent process, adverse events, and 2002  
protocol adherence and deviations in order to identify unanticipated problems or risks to 2003  
the volunteers associated with the research. The PI will ensure that the number of 2004  
volunteers recruited for this study complies with the protocol.  The PI will submit a 2005  
monthly summary of all adverse events to the Research Monitor to determine whether 2006  
the number of adverse events is excessive for the risks outlined in the research protocol.  2007  
The PI and onsite physician or PA will discuss “discontinuation criteria” for individual 2008  
volunteers as the study progresses, based on their observations of the volunteer during 2009  
testing or non-testing periods. Every morning, volunteers will be asked the following 2010  
questions to evaluate their readiness to test. 2011  
 2012  
 How have you been feeling well since the last test in our laboratory (below 2013  
average, average, above average)? 2014  
 Do you have any pain or symptoms to report that may affect our testing today 2015  
(e.g., sinus congestion, fatigue, muscle soreness, fever, gastrointestinal pain, 2016  
etc.)? 2017  
 Have you reported all food and beverages consumed in the last 24 h that 2018  
were not provided to you by study staff? 2019  
 What time did you fall asleep last night and awake this morning? 2020

C8.  REPORTABLE EVENTS     2033  
 2034  
C8.1 Expected adverse events  2035  
 2036  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 2037  
human research volunteer, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam 2038  
or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the individual’s 2039  
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the individual’s 2040  
participation in the research. 2041  
 2042  
A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any adverse event temporally associated with the 2043  
subject’s participation in research that is fatal, life-threatening, permanently disabling, 2044  
requires inpatient hospitalization, or results in congenital anomalies/birth defect, 2045  
overdose or cancer, or based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 2046  
volunteer, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above 2047  
outcomes. 2048  
  2049  
All medical events that the USARIEM Office of Medical Support and Oversight (OMSO) 2050  
evaluates will be reported to the ORQC.  The PI will report all adverse events to the 2051  
Research Monitor.    2052  
 2053  
Expected adverse events which are not serious are reported to the IRB at the time of 2054  
continuing review of the protocol.  These events include bruising, infection, swelling and 2055  
slight pain from the IV placement; slight pain from the lidocaine injection; pain, soreness, 2056  
infection, and bruising from the muscle biopsy; feeling faint with IV placement, blood 2057  
draw or biopsy; fatigue and muscle soreness from study exercises and SUSOPS 2058  
activities; hunger, bloating, gas, cramping, constipation from the dietary invention ; 2059  
fatigue and headaches during the negative energy balance portion of the dietary 2060  
intervention. 2061  
 2062  
C8.2 Unexpected adverse events and unanticipated problems 2063  
 2064  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event temporally associated with the subject’s 2065  
participation in research that is fatal, life-threatening, permanently disabling, requires 2066  
inpatient hospitalization, or results in congenital anomalies/birth defect, overdose or 2067  
cancer, or based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant, or 2068  
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. 2069  
 2070  
All medical events will be reported to USARIEM’s Office of Medical Support and 2071  
Oversight (OMSO). OMSO staff will retain a copy of the report in the subject’s OMSO 2072  
medical file as a means of tracking and analyzing trends in medical events.  The PI will 2073  
report all adverse events to the Research Monitor, if one was appointed for the study. 2074  
 2075  
All unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, and serious adverse 2076  
events that are unexpected and determined to be at least possibly or definitely related to 2077  
study participation, will be promptly reported within one working day by phone (508- 233- 2078  
6306/4811) or email ( usarmy.natick.medcom-usariem.mbx.usariem-rqc@mail.mil ) to the 2079

Adverse events assessed by the PI as not serious and serious adverse events that are 2084  
deemed to be unrelated to participation in the study will be reported to the IRB at the 2085  
time of continuing review of the protocol. 2086  
 2087  
The research monitor is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to 2088  
volunteers or others, serious adverse events and all volunteer deaths associated with 2089  
the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event.  At a minimum, the 2090  
research monitor should comment on the outcomes of the event or problem, and in the 2091  
case of a serious adverse event or death, comment on the relationship to participation in 2092  
the study.  The research monitor should also indicate whether he or she concurs with the 2093  
details of the report provided by the study investigator.  Reports for events determined 2094  
by either the investigator or research monitor to be: possibly related, unexpected, and 2095  
serious or suggest that the research places subjects or others at increased risk of harm 2096  
during participation will be promptly forwarded to the ORQC and HQ USA MRDC IRB. 2097

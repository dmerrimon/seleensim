Number of 
Participants  Approximately 60, with approximately 20 participants in each of the 
3 treatment groups  
Study Treatment  Participants will be randomized via an interactive response system to 
3 groups  in a 1:1:1 ratio : 2 active treatment groups and 1 matching 
placebo. Participants in the 2 active t reatment groups start at a dose of 
5 mg QD and will undergo  dose adjus tment  at W eek 6 based on 
plasma concentration of mavacamten in samples taken at the Week 4 
visit. P articipants in the p lacebo group will undergo  the same 
assessments in order to preserve the blind. Target trough 
concentration is approximately 200 ng/mL for active treatment 
(Group 1 ) and approximately 500 ng/mL  for active treatment ( Group 
2). Dosing will continue to Week 16. During the study, participants 
who are treated for their hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM)  
condition (eg,  beta blocker or calcium channel blocker) should 
receive a stable dose of such treatment for  at least 2 weeks prior to 
Screening , and every effort should be made to keep such treatment 
unchanged (ie, at the same dose) throughout the entire study duration 
until t he final end of study visit at Week 24 . 
Doses of mavacamten used in this study will be 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg.  
Randomization will be stratified  according to current treatment with  
beta blocker  (yes or no)  and type of exercise testing (treadmill or 
bicycle) . Study drug will be administered as 1 capsule QD by mouth. 
Study Duration  The study duration for any  individual participant  will be 28  weeks 
(± 7 days); this includes  a 4-week screening period, a 16 -week 
treatment period, and an 8- week post -treatment follow -up period.  
Inclusion Criteria Each participant must meet the following criteria to be included in 
this study:  
1. Able to understand and comply with the study procedures, 
including CPET, understand the risks involved in the study, and 
provide written informed consent according to federal, local, and 
institutional guidelines before the first study- specific procedure  
2. Is at least 18 years old at Screening  
3. Body weight is greater than 45  kg at Screening  
4. Diagnosed with nHCM (hypertrophied and non- dilated left 
ventricle in absence of systemic or other known cause) consistent  
with current American College of Cardiology 
Foundation/American Heart Association and European Society of 
Cardiology guidelines , ie, the participant must meet at least 1 of 
the 2 following criteria  at the time of Screening : 
• Left ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≥  15 mm, or  
• LV wall thickness ≥  13 mm with a  positive family history of 
HCM  
5. Has documented left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 55% at the 
Screening visit as determined by the e chocardiography central 
laboratory  
6. Has adequate acoustic windows to enable accurate transthoracic 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 8  
 
 
echocardiograms  
7. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) peak gradient at rest AND 
during  Valsalva AND post -exercise <  30 mmHg  as determined by 
the e chocardiogr aphy central laboratory  
8. If intracavitar y gradient is present  and distinctly measurable from 
the LVOT gradient , then maximal in tracavitary gradient at rest 
AND during  Valsalva AND post -exercise <  30 mmHg as 
determined by the echocardiography central laboratory  
9. Has New York Heart Association ( NYHA)  Class  II or III 
symptoms at Screening  
10. Has an elevated NT -proBNP at rest (>  300 pg/mL ) at Screening  
11. Has safety laboratory parameters (chemistry, hematolog y, 
coagulation, and urinalysis) within normal limits (according to 
the central laboratory reference range) at Screening; however, a 
participant with safety laboratory parameters outside normal 
limits may be included if he or she meets all of the following 
criteria:  
• The safety laboratory parameter outside normal limits is 
considered by the investigator to be clinically unimportant  
• If there is an alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase result, the value must be <  3 × the upper 
limit of the labo ratory reference range  
• The body size –adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate is 
≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 
12. Female participants must not be pregnant or lactating and, if 
sexually active, must be using one of the following acceptable 
birth control methods from the Screening visit through 3 months 
after the last dose of study drug. Hormonal contraceptives are not 
considered highly effective contraception for this study because 
mavacamten could reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives.  
• Double -barrier method (eg, male using a condom and female 
using a diaphragm or cervical cap)  
• Barrier plus nonhormonal contraception (eg, male using a 
condom and female using a nonhormonal intrauterine device 
or nonhormonal intrauterine system)  
• Female is surgically sterile for 6 months or postmenopausal 
for 2  years. Permanent sterilization includes hysterectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or 
documented bilateral tubal occlusion at least 6 months prior to 
Screening. Females are considered pos tmenopausal if they 
have had amenorrhea for at least 2  years or more following 
cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and follicle -
stimulating hormone levels are in the postmenopausal r ange  
13. Male participants with sexual partners must agree to  use c ondoms 
for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the last dose 
of study medication in order to prevent passing mavacamten  to 
the partner in the ejaculate

This study will include a total of approximately 60 
participants,
 
or 
approximately 20
 
participants per treatment group. Such a sample 
size will be sufficient to obtain sound variability estimates while 
yielding reasonable 
effect size estimates 
for future planning purposes.

a Preferred  order of assessments is symptom questionnaires; the following 3 assessments in any order: ECG, vital signs, and TTE; pre -exercise blood draws; 
exercise test; and post -exercise blood draws.  
b Screening may  require more than 1 visit to accommodate all of the study procedures.  
c All post− Day 1 study visits have a window of ±  7 days. At Weeks 2, 10, and 14, participants will be contacted by telephone to collect AE and concomitant 
medication data.  
d Changes in base line conditions from once the ICF is signed are recorded on  the medical history eCRF unless the change is related to a study procedure, 
which is then considered an AE. All changes that occur after the administration of the IMP are recorded as AEs.  
e At Scre ening, ET (if applicable), Week 16 (end of treatment), and Week 24 (end of study), complete v ital signs includ ing temperature, HR, respiratory rate, 
and BP will be obtained . At all other onsite visits  except Week 6 , only HR and BP are required. If PK sampl ing is conducted at a visit, vital signs should be 
collected before PK sampling. V ital signs should be taken with the participant in the same position  at all visits . BP should be taken via an automated recorder  
after the participant rests  for at least 5 mi nutes . 
f For participants who have ICDs, information including rhythm strips and events will be downloaded from the ICDs.  
g At Screening, Week 16, and Week 24, a complete physical examination will be conducted, including a neurological examination. At Week 4, Week 8, and 
Week 12, an abbreviated cardiopulmonary physical examination will be conducted, with other systems assessed as directed by in terval history. Physical 
examinations will also include height (at Screening only) and weight (at all onsite visits at which a physical examination is performed).  
h 12-lead ECGs will be performed at Screening and all onsite visits except for the Week 6 visit after 10  minutes of rest. Each time an ECG is completed, a 
10-second  paper ECG will be obtained and maintained in the study participant’s source documentation. On Day 1, an ECG will be performed predose.  
i Resting TTE should be performed prior to post -exercise stress echocardiography or CPET.  Instantaneous peak LVOT gradient at rest and provoked peak 
LVOT gradient (Valsalva  maneuver) will be assessed only at Screening.  
j After a 4 -hour fast, participants will undergo a standard symptom -limited exercise test by standardized treadmill or bicycle ergometer. Instantaneous peak 
LVOT gradient will be assessed immediately post -exerci se by TTE.  
k CPET by standardized treadmill or bicycle ergometer will be performed on both Day 1 and at Week 16/ET prior to dosing. CPET i s done after a 4 -hour fast. 
Obtain CPET with study participant in the same position at Week 16 as done on Day 1.  
l The accelerometer is to be distributed during Screening and at the Week 12 visit and retrieved at  the Day 1 and Week 16 visits.  
m The cardiac monitoring adhesive skin patch is to be applied during Screening and at the Week 12 visit and retrieved at  the Day 1 and We ek 16 visits.  
n Blood samples for PK will be collected at all post- Screening onsite visits except for the Day 1 and Week 6 visit s. The time of each blood draw will be 
recorded. At Week  16, a PK sample will be collected before dosing  as well as within 2 hours  postdose . On other PK sampling days, the PK blood samples 
can be taken at any time that best facilitates conduct  of all scheduled study procedures. The date and time of the last dose of IMP taken prior to the PK 
sample collection will be recorded.  
o At Scre ening, the blood draw for NT -proBNP will occur prior to post -exercise stress echocardiography. At the Day 1 and Week 16 visits, the blood draw for 
NT-proBNP will be obtained both prior to and immediately after CPET.  
p FSH testing at Screening for postmenopausal women to confirm postmenopausal status.  
q Pregnancy testing for all females of childbearing potential. Conduct serum test at Screening  and a urine pregnancy test at all other visits shown ; conduct 
serum test if a urine test is positive . At Wee k 20, a urine p regnancy test  will be conducted at home.

OVERALL STUDY DESIGN
 
AND
 
PLAN
 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, exploratory
,
 
randomized, double
-
blind
 
study 
to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, 
preliminary 
efficacy,
 
PD,
 
and PK
 
of 2 
target drug concentration
s
 
of 
mavacamten
 
compared with placebo 
in participants with symptomatic nHCM. 
Approximately 60 participants with symptomatic nHCM will be enrolled. Participants will be 
randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to 
1
 
of 
2
 
active 
treatment groups 
or 
matching placebo
 
group
 
(
Figure 
1
)
.
 
Randomization will be stratified according to current treatment with 
beta 
blocker
 
(yes or no)
 
and 
type of exercise testing (treadmill or bicycle)
.
 
Par
ticipants w
ill be treated for 
16
 
weeks and then followed up approximately 8
 
weeks after the last dose of study drug.
 
At 
Week 6, a
ll participants will undergo
 
blinded dose adjustment based on Week 4 assessments
 
(see 
Section 
2.2
 
for details)
.
 
P
articipants who are 
treated for 
their
 
HCM
 
condition 
(eg,
 
beta 
blocker or calcium channel blocker)
 
should 
receive a stable dose of such treatment for at 
least 2 weeks prior 
to 
Screening
, and every effort should be made to keep such treatment 
unchanged (ie
,
 
at 
the 
same dose) throughout the entire study duration until the 
EOS
 
visit at 
W
eek 
24.
 
During the 
S
creening process, 
participant
s will undergo a variety 
of
 
general, 
cardiopulmonary, laboratory, 
, 
patient
-
reported outcomes (PRO), 
and 
symptom assessments as detailed in
 
Table 
1
. 
Particip
ants will receive their first dose of study 
drug on Day
 
1
. Participants will 
then 
undergo a variety of assessments as noted in 
Table 
1
 
every 2 weeks
 
through Week
 
1
6
. Assessments will be conducted a
t the clinical site at Weeks 
4, 
6, 
8, 
12, and 16
; 
assessment
s
 
will be conducted via telephone call
 
a
t 
Week
s
 
2
, 10, and 14
. 
At Wee
k 24
,
 
participants will undergo 
EOS
 
procedures as described in 
Table
 
1
.
 
 
 
 
 
. 
Data from these PRO assessments will not be made available to the 
investigators and other 
site personnel throughout the study. Participants will first be informed of this when they fill 
out the consent form that is required in order to participate in the trial. The form will include 
information explaining
 
that the PRO in
formation gathered via the device is not shared with 
their healthcare provider and they should therefore report any concerning symptoms directly 
to their physician. Participants will then be reminded of this every time they 
go
 
to complete 
the assessment on
 
their handheld device. When the participant logs onto his/her handheld 
device to complete the assessments, a message screen will be shown advising the participant 
to consult his/her healthcare provider if he/she has any concerning symptoms. The participan
t 
will not be able to continue with the PRO assessments until he/she has acknowledged that 
he/she has read 
a provided
 
message
 
that any symptoms, health issues, or other concerns 
he/she is having may need to be discussed with his/her healthcare team
.

study -specific procedure  
2. Is at least 18  years old at Screening  
3. Body weight is greater than 45  kg at Screening  
4. Diagnosed with nHCM (hypertrophied and non -dilated left ventricle  in absence of 
syste mic or other known cause) consistent  with current American College of Cardiology 
Foundation/American Heart Association and European S ociety of Cardiology guidelines, 
ie, the participant must meet at least 1 of the 2 following criteria  at the time of Screen ing: 
• LV wall thickness ≥  15 mm, or  
• LV wall thickness ≥  13 mm with a  positive family history of HCM  
5. Has documented LVEF  ≥ 55% at the Screening visit as determined by the 
echocardiography central laboratory  
6. Has adequate acoustic windows to enable accurate transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs)  
7. LVOT  peak gradient at rest AND during Valsalva AND post -exercise < 30 mmHg as 
determined by the echocardiography central laboratory  
8. If intracavitary gradient is present  and distinctly measurable from the LVOT gradient ,

< 30 mmHg as determined by the echocardiography central laboratory  
9. Has NYHA Class II or III symptoms at Screening  
10. Has an elevated NT -proBNP  at rest ( > 300 pg/mL)  at Screening  
11. Has safety laboratory parameters (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) 
within normal limits (according to the central laboratory reference range) at Screening; 
however, a participant with safety laboratory parameters outside normal limits may be 
included if he or she meets all of the following criteria:  
• The safety laboratory parameter outside normal limits is considered by the 
investigator to be clinically unimportant

12. Female participants must not be pregnant or lactating and, if sexually active, must be 
using one of the following acceptable birth control methods from the Screening visit 
through 3 months af ter the last dose of study drug. Hormonal contraceptives are not 
considered highly effective contraception for this study because it is unknown if 
mavacamten reduces the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  
• Double -barrier method (eg, male using a condom and female using a diaphragm or 
cervical cap)

2 years or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and 
follicle -stimulating hormone levels are in the post menopausal range  
13. Male participants with sexual partners must agree to  use condoms for the duration of the 
study and for 3 months after the last dose of study medication in order to prevent passing 
mavacamten  to the partner in the ejaculate

5.4 Screening and Enrollment  
An informed consent form (ICF) must be signed and dated by the participant befor e any 
study -specific  tests or procedures may be performed. 
Each participant  will be assigned a unique  identification number when informed consent has 
been obtained. The identification number will be assigned based on information obtained 
from an interactive response system  (IXRS ). Participants will be considered enrolled once an 
identification number has been assigned. The identification number will be used to identi fy 
the participant  throughout the study and should appear on all study -related documentation. 
Numbers will not include identifiable information.  The investigator will ensure that informed 
consent is obtained from each p articipant before any study -specific procedures are 
performed.  
Participant s that fail to meet all inclusion criteria or present with an exclusion criteri on may 
be re -screened . Refer to the Study Reference Manual for re -screening  criteria  and procedures . 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 38  
 
 
6 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING PROCE DURES  
6.1 Randomization  
Participant s who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized via an IXRS to 1 of 
3 groups in a 1:1:1  ratio : 2 active treatment groups and 1 matching placebo group. 
Randomization will be stratified according to current treatment with beta blocker  (yes or no)  
and type of exercise testing (treadmill or bicycle) . 
6.2 Study Blinding  
Participant s will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups via the  IXRS.  All participants receive either  
5 mg  mavacamten  or matching placebo from D ay 1 to W eek 6. Blinded dose adjustment  (2.5, 
5, 10, or 15 mg mavacamten or placebo)  via the IXRS will begin  at Week 6  based on PK 
measurements  at W eek 4. Study drug administration will occur in a double -blind manner  via 
the IXRS  such that the investigator , site staff , the pharmacist , and the participant  will not 
know which st udy drug is being administered.  
In addition, the Sponsor, the central and core laboratories, and clinical site monitors will be 
blinded to assigned treatment. Echocardiography results ( eg, LVEF) performed at clinic 
visits w ill be blinded to the investigator  and study staff . The 4 different doses of mavacamten  
and matching placebo will be identical in appearance in order to preserve the blind. Study 
drug ( 2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mg mavacamten or matching placebo ) will be labeled with a unique 
identifying number that will be assigned to a participant through the IXRS. 
The pharmacovigilance team will be unblinded for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
react ion (SUSAR) reporting. The IDMC may also review unblinded safety and efficacy data.  
6.3 Methods for Unb linding  
Unblinding by the investigator independently of  the Sponsor also may occur if an AE or 
toxicity necessitates identification of the medication for the  welfare of the participant . Please 
refer to the IXRS  Manual  for the unblinding process and contact information.

7 STUDY TREATMENT  
Study drug is defined as mavacamten  or placebo.  
All randomized study participants  will receive either mavacamten  (5 mg from D ay 1 to 
Week  6 and one of a  range  of doses [2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mg] from Week 6  to Week  16) or 
matching  placebo (Day 1 to Week 16) in a  double -blind manner . 
7.1 Formulation , Packaging, and  Labeling  of Study Drug  
Mavacamten capsules and matching placebo have the same appearance. The study drug 
presentation is size 2, blue opaque capsules printed with a yellow band on the body and black 
band on the cap. Eac h capsule contains white to off -white powder. The active capsules are 
supplied in 4 strengths: 2.5, 5, 10, and  15 mg.  
Mavacamten active and placebo capsules have been manufactured according to current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. They will be supplied in high- density 
polyethylene bottles with induction seals and child resistant caps at 30 count  per bottle. All 
study drug will be labeled according to applicab le local regulatory guidelines.  
The mavacamten active and placebo capsules must be stored at 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F) 
in the packaging supplied by MyoKardia. Study medication at the investi gational site will be 
stored in a secure area with access limited to authorized study personnel.  
7.2 Administration  and Schedule  of Study Drug  
Study drug  will be supplied to participant s via the IXRS i n 30- count high -density  
polyethylene  bottles that are appropriately l abeled. The participant s will be instructed to store 
their supply of  study drug capsules and bottles in a cool , dry place . 
Participants will take study drug as directed by the physician. Participants should be 
instructed to take the study dr ug under fasting conditions (≥  8 hours) at approximately the 
same time every day (±  4 hours). Study drug should be taken with approximately 8 ounces of 
water. If the dosing window is missed, the participant should not take study drug that day. 
Participants  should never take  2 doses of study drug within an 8- hour period. 
7.3 Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug will be monitored by capsule count  at Week s 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 
(Table 1) . Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details.  
7.4 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules  
Participant s with abnormal hepatic laboratory values ( eg, alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ], 
aspartate amino transferase [ AST ], alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ], total bilirubin [ TBL], or 
international normalized ratio) or signs/symptoms of hepatitis may meet the criteria for 
withholding of study medication  or other protocol -required therapies. Withholding is either 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 40  
 
 
permanent or conditional depending on the clinical circumstances discussed below (as 
specified in the U S FDA Guidance for Indus try: Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premar keting 
Clinical Evaluation, July  2009).  
7.4.1 Criteria for Permanent Withholding of Study Drug  Due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
Study drug  should be discontinued permanently and the participant  should be followed 
according to the recommendations in APPENDIX 3  for possible drug -induced  liver injury 
(DILI)  if all the criteria below are met: 
• TBL >  2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or  international normalized ratio  > 1.5 
• AND i ncreased AST or ALT if the baseline value was < UL N and AST or ALT elevation 
is > 3 × ULN  
• AND no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnorm alities is immediately 
apparent. I mportant potential causes for  abnormal AST/ALT or TBL values include, but 
are not limited to , the fo llowing:  
◦ Obstructive gallbladder  or bile duct disease  
◦ Viral or alcoholic hepatitis ( eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus, 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella)  
◦ Hypoxic or ischemic hepatopathy or congestive hepatopathy in association with 
significant right -sided  heart failure  
◦ Concomitant administration of other hepatotoxins, including drugs that inhibit 
bilirubin glucuronidation ( eg, indinavir, atazanavir, irinotec an) or herbal or dietary 
supplements  
◦ Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation ( eg, Gilbert syndrome); 
α-1 antitrypsin deficiency 
◦ Autoimmune hepatitis  
◦ Nonalcoholic s teatohepatitis or other fatty liver disease  
 
If an alternative cause for hepatot oxicity is identified or less stringent conditions developed 
than what is noted above, the investigator will determine whether study drug  and other 
protocol -required therapies should be permanently or temporarily discontinued based on 
participant  population and/or severity of the hepatotoxicity or event, as deemed appropriate 
for the safety of the participant . 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 41  
 
 
7.4.2 Criteria for Conditional Withholding of Study Drug  Due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
For participant s who do not meet the criteria for permanent withholding of study medication  
outlined above, study drug  should be withheld if ANY of the following criteria are met, and 
the participant  should be evaluated for DILI:  
• Elevation of either AST or ALT, regardles s of baseline AST or ALT value, if:  
◦ > 8 × ULN at any time  
◦ > 5 × ULN and < 8 × ULN for ≥  2 weeks  
◦ > 5 × ULN and < 8 × ULN and unable to adhere to enhanced monitoring schedule  
• OR: clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the investigator, consistent with 
hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, vomiting, j aundice, 
rash or eosinophilia >  5%). If such signs or symptoms are coupl ed with ALT or AST 
elevations > 3 ×  ULN, study medication  should be withheld 
• OR: TBL >  3 × ULN at any time  
• OR: ALP >  8 × ULN at any time  
 
Study drug  should be withheld pending an investigation into alternative causes of DILI. If 
study medication  is withheld, the participant  should be followed according to 
recommendations in APPENDIX 3 for possible DILI. Rechallenge may be considered if an 
alternative cause, such as acute hepatitis  B infection, is discovered and the laboratory 
abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline (Section  7.4.3).  
7.4.3 Criteria for Rechallenge of Study Drug  After Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the participant  should be discussed and unanimously agreed by 
the investigator, I DMC , and Sponsor . 
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then study drug  will be permanently 
discontinued. Participant s who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as 
described in Section  7.4.1) should never be rechallenged.  
7.5 Guidelines for the Management of Exaggerated Pharmacologic  Effect  
(Systolic D ysfunction) , Higher T han E xpected Plasma C oncentration , or 
Excessive QT P rolongation  
If during the treatment period a participant has a resting LVEF  ≤ 45% , plasma drug 
concentration ≥  1000 ng/mL, or QTcF  ≥ 500 ms  (as determined  by the echocardiography 
central laboratory , PK a nalysis l aboratory , or ECG c ore laboratory , respectively ), it will be 
communi cated  to the investigator  and Sponsor  that a stopping criterion has been met. Upon 
receipt of this inform ation, the study site/investigator will contact the participant by 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 42  
 
 
telephone and  instruct the participant to discontinue study drug and return for the next 
scheduled onsite study visit or within 2 weeks, whichever is earlier.  After the participant 
discontinues study drug, the participant will be encouraged to undergo early termination ( ET) 
and EOS assessments  (see Section  10.1.4) . To maintain the s tudy blind, a  participant in either 
of the other 2 treatment groups may  be randomly selected via the IXRS to similarly 
discontinue study drug.  
If a participant  experiences heart failure related to systolic dysfunction, no further study drug 
should be administered and administration of therapeutic doses of a β-adrenergic agonist 
(eg, 5 to 10 µg/kg/min dobutamine infusion) should be considered. Additional supportive 
measures, eg,  intravenous volume supplementation and/or the use of arterial vasoconstrictor 
agents (α -adrenergic agonists) could complement the use of a β -adrenergic agonist. Aside 
from this specific advice regarding the role of a β-adrenergic agonist, appropriate care will be 
determined by the treating medical personnel.  
New or worsening heart failure associated with systolic dysfunction is one of the criteria for 
permanent treatment discontinuation ( Section  10.1.3) and should be subsequently managed 
as described in Section  10.1.2 and Section  10.1.4. 
7.5.1 Management of Double -blind Treatment in the Case of LVEF  ≤ 30% at 
Study Site  
Results of TTE performed by study site sonographers at each scheduled visit following 
randomization should be kept blinded to the investigator and other study site personnel. An 
exception may occur if LVEF  ≤ 30% is measured at the site. Under these circumstances, the 
sonographer should review and re -measure the findings with at least one other nonstudy 
professional qualified in echocardiography assessment who is not the investigator 
(eg, echo cardiography  laboratory director, other experienced sonographer , or nonstudy 
cardiologist). If the result is confirmed (LVEF  ≤ 30%), then the investigator will be 
immediately notified and study drug will be discontinued.  
LVEF ≤ 30%, as measured by local site  sonography , is one of the criteria for permanent 
treatment discontinuation ( Section  10.1.3) . As this finding will lead to the investigator being 
unblinded, i t should be subsequently managed as described in Section  10.1.2 and 
Section  10.1.4. 
7.6 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as taking more capsules of study drug than directed. An overdose 
may be suspected by the investigator or spontaneously reported by the participant. An 
overdose may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  
In the event of suspected overdose, the investigator should contact the medical monitor. N o 
further study drug  should be administered. The participant should be closely monitored 
clinically  for AEs/SAEs,  with supportive measures undertaken as clinically indicated . If 
necessary, corrective measures such as initiation of inotropic support with adrenergic agents,

8 RISKS AND PRECAUTIONS  
8.1 General  
Based on nonclinical data and the available clinical data, the most likely risks are those 
associated with higher exposures potentially resulting in an excessive decrease in LVEF. 
This could result in the development or worsening of signs or symptoms of sy stolic heart 
failure  or reduced cardiac output. 
Safety testing in other mammalian species has demonstrated that dose -limiting  toxicity is 
related to exaggerated pharmacologic effect and not to off -target adverse effects. For 
overdose, see Section 7.6 . 
8.2 Pregnancy  
8.2.1 Avoidance of Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential must use appropriate methods of birth control as listed in 
Section  8.2.3. Women of nonchildbearing potential are defined as women  who are 
permanently (surgically) sterilized or are postmenopausal. Permanent sterilization includes 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorecto my, and bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation at least 
6 months prior. Women are considered postmenopausal if they have had amenorrhea for at 
least 2  years or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and 
follicle-stimulating hormone  levels are in the postmenopausal range.  
8.2.2 Restrictions for Male Participants  
Male participant s with sexual partners  should use condoms  for the duration of the study and 
for 3  months after the last dose of study drug  in order to prevent passing mavacamten  to the 
partner in the ejaculate.  
Male participant s should be advised not to donate sperm for 3 months after the last dose of 
study drug . 
8.2.3 Acceptable Forms of Contraception  
Highly effective methods of birth control are  defined as those that result in a low failure rate 
(< 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. From the time of Screening through 
3 months after the last dose of study drug , participant s should practice true abstinence or use 
effective means of contraception as follows:  
• Double -barrier method ( eg, male using a condom  and female using a diaphragm or 
cervical cap)  
• Barrier (eg, male using a condom) plus  nonhormonal contraception (female using a  
nonhormonal IUD or IUS ) 
• Female is surgically sterile or postmenopausal as defined in Section  8.2.1.  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 45  
 
 
 
8.2.4 Reporting and Follow -up of Pregnancies  
All pregnancies in female participant s and female partners of male participant s receiving at 
least 1  dose of study drug  will be reported if they occur anytime from first  dose to 3 months 
after the last dose of study drug. The investigator is responsible for informing MyoKardia  
within 24 hours  of knowledge of the pregnancy  even if no AE  has occurred . The participant  
will be asked to provide information on the outcome of the pregnancy, including premature 
termination. Spontaneous miscarriage and congenital abnor malities will be reported as SAE s.

 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 50  
 
 
9.3.1 Medical History  
A complete medical history will be recorded at the Screening visit, which will include 
evaluation (past or present) of the following: general, head and neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
chest/respiratory, heart/cardio vascular, gastrointestinal/liver, gynecological/urogenital, 
musculoskeletal/extremities, skin, neurological/psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic, 
hematologic/lymphatic, allergies/drug sensitivities, past surgeries, substance abuse , or any 
other diseases or dis orders as well as participation in clinical studies (study medication 
and/or device or other therapy ). 
9.3.2 Physical Examination  
At selected visits , a complete physical examination will be conducted including  a 
neurological  examination  (gross motor and deep tendon reflexes) , height (Screening only) 
and weight , and assessment of the following: general appearance, skin, head and neck, 
mouth, lymph nodes, thyroid, abdomen, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular , neurological, and 
respiratory syst ems. At all other visits, an abbreviated cardiopulmonary physical examination 
will be conducted, with other systems assessed as directed by interval history.  
Height (cm) and body weight (kg) will be measured at Screening , and body mass index  
(kg/m2) will b e calculated. Participant s will be required to remove their shoes and wear 
clothing as specified by the clinical site.  Weight will also be collected at all subsequent onsite 
visits.  
9.3.3 12-lead ECG  
Twelve- lead ECG evaluations will be performed after 10 minutes of rest at Screening and at 
all onsite study visits  except  the Week 6 visit . All ECG data will be sent to a  central cardiac 
labora tory. 
On Day  1, ECG will be performed predose  
The investigator will ju dge the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal with clinical 
significance. The investigator will review the ECG and correlate abnormal findings with any 
other clinical findings, participant ’s medical history , and laboratory data to determine the 
clinical importance of the finding.  
The investigator may add extra 12- lead ECG safety assessments if there are any abnormal 
findings or if the investigator considers it is required for any other safety reason. These 
assessments should be recorded as an unscheduled assessment.  
9.3.4 Cardiac Monitoring Skin Patch  
At 2 time points during the study, participants will wear a small device to collect HR and 
rhythm data ( Table 1 ). The self -contained device attaches to the skin using medical adhesive 
and contains surface electrodes, internal electronics to capture a continuous single lead ECG 
waveform, an accelerometer to capture physical activity, sufficient solid state  memory to 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 51  
 
 
store data over multiple days , and a battery to power the device. Two sequential patches will 
be worn for approximately 7 days (14 days total). Following a period of data collection, the 
device will be transported to a core laboratory where the continuous ECG waveforms and 
activity record stored on the device will be uploaded for analysis. The analysis will provide 
full disclosure capabilities for HR, heart rhythm, and physical activity over the period during 
which the device was properly applied and functioning. The device will be used to explore 
the pattern of HR and heart rhythm before  and during treatment with study drug.  
9.3.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs , including  temperature, HR, respiratory rate, and blood pressure ( BP), will be 
obtained at Screenin g, ET (if applicable), Week 16 (end of treatment), and Week 24 (EOS). 
At all other onsite visits  except Week 6 , only HR and BP are required. If P K sampling is 
conducted at a visit, vital signs should be collected before PK sampling. Vital signs should be 
taken  with the participant  in the same position  at all visits.  BP should be t aken via an 
automated recorder  after the participant rests for at least 5  minutes . 
Vital signs will b e taken  prior to dosing . Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional 
details.  
9.3.6 Other Safety Assessments  
Refer to Section  11.2.2 for information on AE assessment and Section 7.7.2  for concomitant 
therapy assessments.  
Safety laboratory results will be assessed in an on going manner. A central safety laboratory 
will be used. Laboratory parameters are provided in  APPENDIX 1 . 
9.4 Participant  Restrictions D uring t his Study  
The following restrictions apply for the specified times during the study period. If a 
participant  does not comply with these restrictions or tests positive in any laboratory tests 
(eg, pregnancy), he or she  may be excluded or withdrawn from the study.  
• Starting 72  hours prior to the first dose until the final follow -up visit, participant s should 
not engage in unaccustomed intensive exercise except during pr otocol -specified exercise 
tests 
• Starting at Screening, participant s will be required to abstain from blood or plasma 
donation until 3 months after the final study visit 
• Starting on Day  1 until the final follow -up visit, participant s will be asked to abstain from  
grapefruit or grapefruit juice, Seville oranges,  and quinine ( eg, tonic water)  
• Contraception requirements are discussed in Section  8.2 
 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 52  
 
 
9.5 Study Procedures by Visit  
Study procedures are presented by visit in  Table 1. Every effort should be made to avoid 
protocol deviations. 
At the investigator’s discretion, unscheduled visits may be conducted for the  assessment of 
AEs, physical examinations,  vital signs,  laboratory tests, ECGs, and/or TTEs . All 
information collected from unscheduled visits will be recorded on the eCRF  and included in 
the clinical database.  
9.6 Visit  Scheduling  
All visits should occur within the visit window  (± 7 day s). If an evaluation is missed, 
reschedule and perform it as close as  possible to the original date.  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 53  
 
 
10 TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL  FROM 
STUDY 
In general, every effort should be made to keep a participant on double -blind treatment for as 
long as possible during the stud y unless a safety concern arises. Treatment discontinuation 
may either be temporary or permanent , and if treatment discontinuation is permanent, the 
degree to which a study participant withdraws can vary  (see Section  10.1.4) . Each of these 
circumstances is  described below. 
10.1 Treatment Discontinuation  
10.1.1 Temporary Treatment Discontinuation  
Temporary treatment discontinuation  may be considered by the investigator in the case of an 
AE/SAE or for another reason.  
As a general rule, any discontinuation of study drug should be initially considered temporary 
unless permanent treatment discontinuation is mandated by the protocol (see Section  10.1.3).  
In the case of discontinuation for an AE/SAE, the investigator should make a best effort to 
resume study drug as soon as practically possible, assuming there are no safety concerns 
(ie, the investigator is satisfied that in his or her medical judgment, the study drug is unlikely 
to be responsible for the event concerned).  
All temporary treatment interruptions should be recorded in the eCRF.  
10.1.2 Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  
After a temporary treatment discontinuation, if a safety concern has not resolved or stabilized 
or the investigator suspects that study drug is responsible, the investigator may consider a 
treatment discontinuation as permanent. The investigator should make a best effort to contact 
the monitoring team before considering any treatment discontinuation as permanent. 
Permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered a last resort. Every effort should 
be made to collect important safety data if feasible and the study participant agrees.  
In all cases, participants should be encouraged to discuss stopping study drug with the 
investigator or the investigator’s designee so that questions can be addressed, concomitant 
therapy can be adjusted if needed, and a follow -up assessment be arranged.  
Any permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF.  
10.1.3 Criteria for Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  
The following reasons will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation:  
• Safety threshold being met (see Section 7.5)  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 54  
 
 
• Pregnancy  
• New or worsening heart failure associated with systolic dysfunction  
• Any breaking of the study blind requested by the investigator  
• Continued administration of study drug is considered by the investigator to be detrimental 
to the participant’s safety or well -being  
• If all the criteria are met for possible DILI (see Section  7.4.1)  
• The participant requests to discontinue study drug 
• The Sponsor requests that the participant permanently discontinues study drug 
 
10.1.4 Management of Participants After Permanent Treatment Discontin uation  
If a participant permanently discontinues treatment prior to Week 16 (end of treatment ), the 
participant will be asked to undergo an ET visit as soon as possible after stopping study drug, 
undergoing  the procedure s normally planned for the Week 16 visit, including CPET. 
Subsequently, every effort will be made to have the participant return to the site at the times 
corresponding to his or her remaining scheduled visits (ie, until  the end of the study  at 
Week  24), or through the recovery or stabilizati on of any AE to be followed as specified in 
this protocol, whichever comes last. 
Under circumstances of permanent treatment discontinuation, study participants can:  
• Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and agree to participate 
in the ET and EOS  visits  
• Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and agree to participate 
in the ET visit  
• Withdraw from treatment (permanent treatment discontinuation) and all follow -up (see 
Section  10.2)  
 
In case of difficulties to comply and return for all study visits through  Week 24 , every effort 
should be made to have the participant return for as many study visits as possible, especially 
the Week 16 visit with CPET.  
For participants who do not withdraw consent for ongoing study participation but fail to 
return to the site, the investigator should make every effort to contact the participant 
(eg, contacting participant’ s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, particularly vital status. 
Attempts to contact such participants must be documented in the participant’s records 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 55  
 
 
(eg, number of  attempts and dates of attempted telephone contact and receipt for sending a 
registered letter).  
10.2 Withdrawal from Study  
10.2.1 Withdrawal of Consent for Ongoing Study Participation  
Participants may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at 
any time and for any reason. Withdrawal of consent for treatment (permanent treatment 
discontinuation) described above should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for 
ongoing study participation with scheduled visits and from withdrawal of  consent for 
non-participant contact follow -up (eg, medical records check).  
Participants who withdraw from the study should be explicitly asked about the reason and the 
contribution of any possible AE(s) that led to their decision, and any AE information e licited 
should be documented. The participant may withdraw consent verbally or in writing. If the 
consent is withdrawn verbally, the site should document it appropriately. Preferably the 
participant should withdraw consent in writing and, if the participant or the participant’s 
representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the 
reason for the participant’s failure to withdraw consent in writing.  
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the investigator in the appropriate eCRF and in 
the participant’s medical records when considered as confirmed. The date of the withdrawal 
and the reason should be documented.  
The statistical analysis p lan (SAP) will specify how these participants lost to follow -up will 
be considered for their primary endpoints. 
Participants who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re -randomized (treated) in the 
study. Their inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.  
10.2.2 Replacement of Participants Who Withdraw from the Study  
Participants who w ithdraw from the study after receiving an initial dose of treatment will not 
be replaced. If a participant withdraws after randomization and before dosing, that participant 
may be replaced. The replacement participant will undergo the same stratification p rocedure 
as a new participant; no special replacement randomization schedule is necessary.

11 EVALUATION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence or the deterioration of a pre -existing medical 
condition (other than the condition that is being treated by the study) associated with the use 
of a study medication in humans, whether or not it is considered related to the study 
medication. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can ther efore  be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver, clinically important 
abnormal laboratory result or diagnostic procedure), participant -reported symptom 
(eg, nausea, chest pain), or evidence of any disease activity temporally associated with the 
use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. 
In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time 
after the participant  has signed informed consent, including run -in or washout periods, even 
if no specific treatment has been administered.  
Preexisting medical conditions (other than natural progression of the disease being studied) 
judged by the investigator or participant  to have worsened in severity or frequency or 
changed in character during the protocol -specified AE reporting period will be reported as 
AEs or SAEs as appropriate.  
Imaging -based assessments of a decrease in contractility are not considered AEs unless 
associated with symptoms or signs of clinical concern on the part of the investigator. Such 
events should be categorized as an AE defined in terms of those symptoms or signs.  
An AE or SAE can also be a complication that occurs as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures ( eg, invasive procedures such as biopsies). 
For MyoKardia to collect additional information about clinically important laboratory results 
or diagnostic tests ( eg, blood, ECG, imaging), at a minimum, the following abnormalities 
should be captured on the AE eCRF:  
• Any test result that meets the definition of an SAE  (see Section  11.1.2)  
• Any clinically important test abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity is 
worsening  or is new ( eg, > 3 × deviation from the upper or lower limit of the analyzing 
laboratory reference range, or as otherwise specified in the protocol)  
• Any test abnormality that require s the participant  to have study medication discontinued 
or interrupted in the clinic al judgment of the investigator  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 57  
 
 
• Any test abnormality that requires  the participant  to receive specific corrective therapy, 
close observation, m ore frequent follow -up assessment, or f urther diagnostic 
investigation  
 
The term AE is used generally to includ e any AE whether serious or nonserious. 
11.1.1.1 Events That Do Not Meet the Definition of Adverse Event  
Events that do not meet the definition of AE include the following:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s co ndition 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy, devic e implantation): the 
condition that leads to the procedure is the AE  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condi tion(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE that fulfil ls one or more of the following criteria in the opinion of the 
investigator or MyoKardia:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threat ening (places the participant  at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred)  
• Requires in -participant  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 58  
 
 
judgment, it may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above  
 
11.2 Adverse Event Reporting and Descriptions  
11.2.1 Reporting Period and Follow -up 
11.2.1.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be assessed from the time the part icipant  provides informed consent through the 
duration of the study. Pre existing medical conditions that increase in severity from the first 
dose of study medication will be reported as AEs. Preexisting medical conditions that 
increase in severity after pr oviding informed consent but before the first dose of study 
medication will be reported as medical history.  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant ’s last visit in the study will be  followed by the 
investigator until resolved or stabilized and are considered irreversible, or the participant  has 
died. 
MyoKardia retains the right to request additional information for any participant with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study,  if judged necessary.  
11.2.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs occurring during the treatment -emergent period (defined as the period from the 
first administration of study drug to 56 days [ 8 weeks ] after the last administration of study 
drug) regardless of causality will be reported by the investigator or designee to MyoKardia or 
its designee within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. All follow -up information for 
previously reported SAEs will also be reported to MyoKardia or its designee within 24 hours 
of knowledge. SAEs occurring after informed consent is signed but before the first  dose of 
study drug is administered will be reported as SAEs only if they are considered related to the 
protocol or study procedure.  
SAE reporting instructions are provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
11.2.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Overdos e, pregnan cy, and LVEF  ≤ 30%  (as determined by local site−read echocardiogram) 
are considered adverse events of special interest (AESIs). Pregnancy includes the pregnancy 
of a female participant or the pregnancy of a partner of a male participant during the study up  
to 3 months after the last dose of study drug.  
If an AESI  occurs, this event must be reported to MyoKardia within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the event. A pregnancy will be followed until the final outcome, and a live birth will be 
followed for 6 months after the birth.  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 59  
 
 
11.2.2 Recording and Assessing Adverse Events  
11.2.2.1 Descri ption  
All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open 
question from the study personnel  “Have you had any health problems since you were last 
asked?”, or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eC RF. 
When collecting AEs the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms ( eg, anemia, not low hemoglobin). However, if a diagnosis is 
known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the 
diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
Death is an outcome and not the name of the event. In this situation, the event that led to the 
death is the name of the event. If the cause of death is unknown, “found de ad” is an 
acceptable description.  
11.2.2.2 Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator should assess causality by answering either “yes” or “no” to the question “I s 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational 
medic inal product [ IMP]/study medication?”  
The following factors can be used in consideration of causality assessment:  
• Challenge/rechallenge: Did the event abate after study medication was reduced or 
interrupted? Did the event reappear after study medication wa s reintroduced?  
• Temporal relationship and time to onset plausibility  
• Confounding risk factors  
• Amount and duration of study drug exposure  
• Concomitant medications  
 
11.2.2.3 Severity  
Severity can be assessed as follows : 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily t olerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
• Life-threatening (urgent intervention indicated)  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 60  
 
 
• Fatal (event led to death)  
 
It is important to distinguish between category (AE vs SAE) and intensity (mild, 
moderate , or severe) of AEs.  
Severity is a measure of intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in  
Section  11.1.2. 
An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea 
that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE. On the other 
hand, a  stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild 
stroke but would be an SAE.  
11.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  
SUSARs  are SAEs that qualify for mandatory expedited reporting to regulatory authoritie s 
where the SAE is suspected to be caused by the study treatment and is considered unexpected 
(ie, not defined as expected in the current IB, clinical protocol , or approved labeling for 
marketed products). In this case, MyoKardia or its designee may be req uired per regulatory 
require ments to unblind the participant to determine treatment assignment. Only specified 
MyoKardia pharmacovigilance staff members or designees will have access to the unblinded 
information in order to meet regulatory requirements and report to the relevant regulatory 
authority(ies). A blinded report describing the SUSAR will be sent to all investigators. Each 
investigator must then notify his /her ethic committee (EC) of the blinded SUSAR as required 
by local regulatory authorities and  in accordance with their  EC policy.

12.3.8.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be mapped to system organ classes and preferred terms using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AEs will be monitored during the study and 
the data analyzed with respect to overall incidence as well as severity  and potential 
relationship of AEs to study medication. AEs with onset during the treatment -emergent  
period or with an onset before the first dose of study medication that increase s in severity or 
becomes  serious during the treatment -emergent period, will be  cons idered 
treatment -emergent.  
Adverse event incidence tables will present the number (n) and percentage (%) of 
participant s experiencing at least one treatment- emergent AE ( TEAE ) by system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT). Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same 
participan t will be counted only once in the tables. The denominator for computation of 
percentages is the safety populati on within each treatment group.  
Adverse event incidence tables  will be provided by treatment group for all types of TEAEs: 
all TEAEs, all treatment -emergent  SAEs and all TEAEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. 
Potential drug- induced liver injury  
The incidence of liver -related AEs will be summarized by treatment group. The selection of 
PTs will be based on standardized MedDRA  query hepatic disorder.  
Deaths  
The following deaths summaries will be generated: 
• Number and percent  of participant s who died by study period (TEAE, on- study) 
summarized on the safety p opulation by treatment received  
• Death in non- randomized participant s or randomized and not treated participant s 
• TEAE leading to death (death as an outcome on the AE eCRF page as reported by the 
investigator) by prima ry SOC  and PT showing number and percent  of participan ts 
 
Pregnancy  
The following pregnancy summaries will be generated:  
• Number of participant s or partners of participant s who became pregnant summarized by 
treatment received  
• Outcomes of the pregnancies and analy sis of the outcomes  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 66  
 
 
• TEAE experienced during the pregnancy by primary SOC  and PT showing the number 
and percent  of participan ts 
 
Overdose  
The following summaries for  reports of overdose will be generated:  
• Number of participant s who experienced overdose summ arized by treatment received  
• Analysis of the cause and occurrence of the overdose  
• TEAE experienced during the overdose by primary SOC, high -level group term , 
high-level  term , and PT showing the number and percent  of participant s 
 
12.3.8.2 12-lead Electrocardiogram  
The RR, PR, QRS , and QT intervals will be measured  and read by a central laboratory . HR 
will be calculated as 60/(RR  × 1000) (with RR expressed in msec) and rounded to the nearest 
integer.  
Correction for Heart Rate  
Corrected QT interval ( QTc) will be calcu lated using the manually over -read QT values. 
Each individual ECG QT value will be corrected for HR. The measured QT data will be 
corrected for HR using QTcF  as per the following formulae/method (with QT, RR and QTc 
expressed in msec):  
Fridericia’s Correction:  
 
ECG Numeric Variables  
HR, PR, QRS, and QTcF will be summarized using descript ive statistics. The change from 
baseline of these ECG parameters at each time point will be listed for each participant . For 
each time point of measurement, the chan ges from baseline will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
Categorical Analysis  
The incidence count and percentage of participant s with any post dose QTcF values of 
> 450 msec, >  480 msec,  and >  500 msec will be tabulated for all participant s. Participant s 
with QTc values > 500 msec will be listed with corresponding baseline values, ∆ QTcF , and

baseline and treatment HR. The incidence count and percentage of participant s with ∆ QTcF 
increase from baseline of >  30 msec and > 60 msec will be tabulated.  
Morphology Findings  
New ECG morphologies for each participant  not present on any ECG at  baseline for that 
participant  will be summarized for all observation time points combined. 
The number and percentage of participant s having T -wave morphology changes and/or the 
occurrence of abnormal U -waves that represent the appearance or worsening of the 
morphological abnormality from baseline will be reported.  
Concentration- QTc Analyses  
A concentration -QTc regression analysis, based on data collected from t he ECG recordings 
after drug administration and concentration values for each participant  at each matching time 
point , will be performed. The concentration- ECG relationship will be first evaluated by some 
descriptive plots to investigate any potential dela yed or sustained effects and explore the 
shape of the rel ationship. Then, linear or nonlinear models will be implemented to estimate 
the slope and 95% CI  of the relationship. Predictions at selected concentration values will be 
computed within the model. 
12.3.8.3 Laboratory D ata 
The summary statistics (including number, mean, median, SD , minimum and maximum) of 
all laboratory variables (laboratory va lues and changes from baseline)  may  be calculated for 
each visit (baseline and post -baseline time points) an d presented by treatment group.  
Listings of participant s with laboratory values that are out of the reference range will be 
produced. Shift tables reflecting changes  from baseline may be presented in lieu of 
descriptive statistics of changes from baseline.  
Potential drug- induced liver injury  
The liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, ALP , and TBL , are used to assess possibl e 
drug- induced liver toxicity.  
A graph of distribution  of peak values of ALT versus peak values of TBL will be presented. 
Note that the AL T and TB L values are presented on a logarithmic scale. The graph will be 
divided into 4 quadrants with a vertical line corresponding to 3 ×  ULN for ALT and a 
horizontal line corresponding to 2 ×  ULN for TB L. 
The normalization (to ≤  1 × ULN or r eturn to bas eline if baseline  > ULN) of elevated liver 
function tests will be summarized by categories of elevation (3  × ULN, 5  × ULN, 10 ×  ULN, 
20 × ULN for ALT and AST, 1.5 ×  ULN for ALP , and 1.5 ×  ULN and 2 × ULN for T BL), 
with the following categories of normalization: never normalized, normalized after 
permanent discontinuation of study drug. Note that a participant  will be counted only under

 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 73  
 
 
14.1.5 Study Monitoring  
MyoKardia will monitor this clinical study through remote data checks and monitoring visits 
to check the adequacy of clinical site staff and facilities,  and to ensure adherence to the 
protocol, study procedures , and applicable regulations. The clinical site monitor will also 
assess proper eCRF completion and source document retention. The investigator (s) and 
clinical site staff are expected to provide adequate space for monitoring visits and to allocate 
sufficien t time to permit adequate review of the study’s progress. The investigator (s) will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, EC review , and regulatory inspection(s), providing 
direct access to source data/documents and study -related facilities ( eg, pharmacy , diagnostic 
laboratories).  
14.1.6 Study Auditing and Inspecting  
MyoKardia may audit the study conduct, compliance with the protocol , and accuracy of the 
data in 1  or more clinical sites.  
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study -related monitoring, au dits and inspections 
by MyoKardia, EC, government regulatory authority( ies), and MyoKardia’s quality 
assurance personnel or its designees by providing direct access to source data/documents 
after appropriate notification from MyoKardia.  
14.2 Investigator’s Responsibilities  
14.2.1 Screening Log  
The investigator must keep a record that lists all participant s who signed an informed consent 
and the reason for noninclusion if the potential participant  does  not ultimately enroll and 
receive IMP . 
14.2.2 Study Drug  Accountability  
The investigator must ensure that the study drug  at the investigational site is  kept secured and 
accounted for with access limited to only those individuals authorized by the investigator. 
The investigator, his/her designee , or pharmacist must also mainta in adequate records of 
distribution, dispensing , and destruction of  all study  drug at the end of the study. The study 
drug records must be readily available for inspection by the site monitor and/or auditor. Only 
those sites with institutional, local, stat e, or federal restrictions in the destruction of material 
will be allowed to return study drug to the depot. No study drug  can be destroyed or returned 
to depot  until the clinical site monitor has verified the accuracy of the study drug  records at 
the clinical site . 
14.2.3 Reporting and Recording of Study Data 
Data will be captured and compiled using procedures developed by MyoKardia or designee. 
Electronic data capture (EDC) technology will be used for this study. Clearly  record all 
requested study data on the eCRF and other forms as required. Whenever possible, record the 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 74  
 
 
reason for missing data in the source document. Only individuals who are identified on the 
study personnel responsibility/signature log and who have received appropriate trai ning on 
the EDC system may enter or correct data in the eCRF. Incomplete or inconsistent data on 
the eCRF will result in data queries that require resolution by the investigator or designee. 
Corrections to the eCRF, including the reason for the change, wil l be automatically 
documented through the EDC system’s audit trail.  
Participant  source data must be maintained as original records or a certified copy ( ie, copy  of 
original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact 
copy having all of the same attributes and information as the original). The investigator and 
affiliated institution should take measures to prevent the accidental or premature destruction 
of documents. Data collected on the eCRF must match the source documents.  
An eCRF must be completed for each participant  who signs an ICF . All entries into the eCRF 
are ultimately the responsibility of the investigator before approving them via an electronic 
signature. The investigator is responsible for ensuring accurate , authentic and complete 
records for each participant . 
An electronic copy of the e CRF casebooks will be sent to the clinical site for retention with 
other study documents after full completion of the study.  
14.2.4 Source Data and Source Documents  
The nature and l ocation of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources 
of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the company and clinical site 
staff. The source documents are to be accessible for verification by the clinical site m onitor. 
Source documents should at minimum include the following information for each participant : 
• Participant  identification and contact information (name, date of birth, sex, address, 
phone)  
• Documentation verifying participant  eligibility ( ie, medical hi story, physical 
examination)  
• Informed consent process documentation and ICF 
• Record of all visits and other contacts  
• Record of all AEs  and other safety parameters and all event attributes  
• Record of all concomitant therapy (including start/stop dates, indica tion for use, dose)  
• Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable  
 
The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable as well as the date of 
the entry. Direct access to source documentation (medical records ) must be allowed for the 
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 75  
 
 
purpose of verifying that the data recorded in the eCRF are consistent with the original 
source data. The investigator will provide certified copies of the participant’s medical records 
in the event that clinical site’s policy doe s not permit direct access to the electronic medical 
records.  
14.2.5 Participant  Identification Information  
To permit easy identification of the individual participant  during and after the study, the 
investigator is responsible for keeping an updated log that contains the participant  
identification information. This document will be reviewed by the clinical site monitor for 
completeness. However, to ensure the participa nt’s confidentiality, the document will be 
maintained at the clinical site and no copy will be made.  
14.2.6 Records Retention  
MyoKardia will inform the investigator in writing when it is acceptable to dispose of any 
study records. To enable evaluation and/or audi ts from regulatory authorities or MyoKardia, 
the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participant s 
(eg, participant  identification code list and all source documents), all original signed ICFs, 
copies of all eCRFs, original la boratory reports, detailed records of study medication 
disposition, and all essential documents for the conduct of a clinical study. To comply with 
international regulations, the records should be retained by the investigator for at last 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing application in an ICH region, or until at least 2 years 
have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. How ever, 
the investigator may need to retain these documents for a longer period if require d by the 
local regulatory requirements or by an agreement with MyoKardia.  
14.2.7 Protocol Deviations  
Unless there is a safety concern, there should be no deviations from  the study protocol. In the 
event of a safety concern, the investigator or designee must document and explain the reason 
for any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation 
from, or a change to, the protocol to eliminat e an immediate hazard to participant s without 
prior EC approval. Immediately after the implemented deviation or change, the investigator 
must submit a report explaining the reasons for the protocol deviation to the EC and 
MyoKardia, if required. The medica l monitor will notify the study monitor of the decision.  
14.2.8 Blood Sample Collection/Storage  
Blood samples that are collected as part of routine medical care or as part of protocol 
procedures may be stored and analyzed for PK or PD analyses.  
After the study, s amples may be used for additional investigation to help identify factors that 
may influence response to therapy. Such samples will be used in compliance with guidelines 
defined by  US FDA Guidance on Informed Consent for In  Vitro  Diagn ostic Device Studies 
Using Leftover Human Specime ns That A re Not Individually Identifiable (issued 
 MyoKardia, Inc.

25Apr2006) and European Medicines Agency ’s Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenomic 
Samples, Testing and Data Handling.  
14.3 Clinical Trial Insurance 
Clinical trial insurance has been undertaken according to the laws of the countries where the 
study will be conducted. An insurance certificate will be made available to the participating 
clinical sites upon request. 
14.4 Protocol Amendmen ts and Study Administrative Letters  
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the investigator and 
MyoKardia.  
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol a mendment and, where required, in a new version of the 
study protocol.  
The amendment should be approved by the EC and the appropriate regulatory authority( ies), 
before implementation, as appropriate. Local requirements should be followed for revised 
protocols.  
If a protocol amendment requires a change to the ICF, the EC will need to approve the 
revised ICF before the revised form is used.  
If there are nonsubstantial changes such as clarification of statement or corrections to 
obvious errors/typos/inconsistencies in the protocol, or change to logistical or administrative 
aspects, then MyoKardia may issue an Administrative Letter. If local re gulations  require  any 
administrative change , it will be communicated to or approved by the EC.

APPENDIX 3  POTENTIAL D RUG -INDUCED LIVER  INJURY REPORTING  
AND ADDITIONAL  ASSESSMENTS  REPORTING  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of  drug- induced liver injury  (DILI ), cases of 
concurrent aspartate/alanine  aminotransferase (AST/ALT ) and total bilirubin ( TBL ) elevation 
according to the criteria specified  in Section  7.4 (3  × upper limit of normal [ ULN ] for 
AST/ALT and 2  × ULN for TBL in participant s with no underlying liver disease and 
eligibility criteria requiring normal liver function at baseline) require the following:  
• The event is to  be reported to MyoKardia as a  serious adverse event  (SAE ) within 
24 hours of discovery or notification of the event ( ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded).  
• The appropriate e CRF ( eg, Adverse Event e CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment- emergent liver abnormalities are to  be completed 
and sent to MyoKardia.  
 
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to  be reported as SAEs if they meet the 
criteria for an SAE defined in Section  11.1.2. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All participant s for whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI or who experience 
AST/ALT elevations >  3 × ULN are to  undergo a period of “close observation” until 
abnormalities return to normal or to the participant ’s baseline levels. Assessments that are to  
be performed during this period include the following:  
• Repeat liver chemistries within 24 -48 hours  (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ], 
TBL); in cases of TBL >  2 × ULN or AST/ALT much greater than 3 × ULN, retesting is 
to be performed within 24 hours. 
◦ For participant s that are far away from the trial site, it may be difficult for the 
participant s to return to the trial site promptly. In this case, the participant s should be 
retested locally, but normal laboratory ranges should be recorded, results should be 
made available to trial investigators immediately, and the data should be included in 
the case reports.  
◦ Participant s are to  be monitored at least twice weekly; testing frequency may decrease 
to once per week or less if laboratory abnormalities stabilize or the investigational 
product(s) or protocol -required therapies have been discontinued AND the participant  
is asymptomatic.  
• Obtain prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, fractionated bilirubin, and any 
other potentially relevant laboratory evaluations of liver function or disease. 
• Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophilia.  
 MyoKardia, Inc.  
MYK- 461 Protocol: MYK -461-006  Page 86  
 
 
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis if it has not already 
been collected.  
• Obtain a more detailed history of the following:  
◦ Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
◦ Exposure to environmental and/or industrial  chemical agents  
◦ Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, hypersensitivity -type 
reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fever  
◦ Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs, and special diets  
◦ Concomitant medications (including nonprescription medicines and herbal and 
dietary supplements)  
• Initiate full viral and autoimmune hepatitis evaluation (serologies for hepatitis A, B, C, 
D, E, Epstein- Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, etc.); evaluate for other potential causes of 
DILI, including but not limited to non- alcoholic steatohepatitis , hypoxic/ischemic 
hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtain gastroenterology or hepatology consult.  
• Perform appropriate liver imaging or biopsy if clinically ind icated; strongly consider 
these tests in cases of concurrent transaminase and TBL elevation as specified in 
Section  7.4. 
• Follow the participant  until all laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal. The 
“close observation period” is to  continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after investigational 
product(s) or protocol -required therapies discontinuation. 
 
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding eCRFs.

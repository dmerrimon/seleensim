CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 9 Global  
Description of 
Change  Brief Rationale  Section # and Name  
The purpose of this 
amendment is to 
permanently discontinue 
all patients in the Year 2 
Treatment Period from 
study drug and to complete 
the End of Treatment study 
visit for impacted patients.  
These patients will be 
encouraged to complete all 
remaining study visits and 
procedures in the follow -
up period and the end of 
study phone call.  On 11Aug ust 2020, the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) for the 
fasinumab phase 2/3 program recommended 
termination of the program. The 
recommendation was based on a review of 
the totality of evidence, including the 
emerging unblinded data. Based on the 
independent DMC recommendation, the 
sponsor discontinued dosing wit h 
fasinumab as of 17 Aug ust 2020. The only 
patients impacted were the patients 
participating in the optional Year 2 portion 
of the R475 -OA-1611 study. These patients 
will be encouraged to enter the safety 
follow -up period for Ye ar 2.  Protocol Synopsis: St udy Design

parallel phase 3 study that became fully 
apparent only after unblinding that study, 
and the concern that the same irregularities 
would be present in data from similar sites 
in this study, the primary and secondary 
efficacy analyses will be performed on a

Year 2 to stop enrollment.  The objective of the Year 2 Extension is to 
collect safety data on patients chronically 
exposed to fasinumab over a 2 -year period.  
The on -going COVID -19 pandemic is 
currently limiting patient travel to si tes for 
the receipt of study drug.  Therefore, these 
patients will not be chronically exposed to 
fasinumab and, consequently, we are 
stopping enrollment of new patients into 
Year 2.   Protocol Synopsis: Study Design

Secondary efficacy 
objectives and endpoints at 
week 52 have been 
changed to week 44.  Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and its 
associated impact on limiting patient travel 
and site operations, it is likely that the 
missing data for the week 52 efficacy 
endpoint will exceed the original 
assumptions as described in Section 
10.2.   Transitioning to  week 44 was chosen 
because the number of patients having 
completed the week 44 visit is estimated to 
be the best option to provide the most

Changes and Rationale  Sections Changed  
Main Change:  
The study design has been modified to include a second 
year of treatment with fasinumab or naproxen. The purpose 
of this modification is to obtain longer -term safety data to 
further elucidate the safety profile of fasinumab.   
The initial 52 -week treatment  period is referred to as Year 1 
and the second 52 -week treatment period is referred to as 
Year 2.   
At the end of the 52 -week treatment period of Year 1, 
patients who are eligible and willing to participate in Year 2 
will continue in the study for a secon d 52-week treatment 
period and will then enter the 20 -week follow up period. 
Patients who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but 
unwilling to enter Year 2, will enter directly into the 
20-week follow -up period at the completion of Year 1.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Objectives,

The purpose of this amendment is to update the exclusion criteria to improve patient safety and to 
include an additional fasinumab dose group of 1 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W).  Additional change s 
were made to ensure consistency across the fasinumab program, improve clarity, and to make 
minor corrections.  The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected 
sections:  
Changes and Rationale  Sections Changed  
Main changes to improve patient safety:  
The exclusion criterion #22 regarding adverse cardiac 
events within the past 12 months prior to the screening 
visit has been updated to exclude patients with a 
history  of adverse cardiac events.  In addition, acute 
coronary syndrome has been removed from this 
criterion because this is covered by exclusion criterion 
#10. Section 6.2.2 Exclusion Criteria, #22  
In exclusion criterion #10 regarding history of 
naproxen intol erance or existence of a medical 
condition that is high risk for naproxen -associated 
complications, the general statement regarding the use 
of concomitant medications for which naproxen is 
contraindicated has been removed.  Specific 
medications that are no t to be taken concomitantly with 
naproxen are listed in the Prohibited Medications 
section.  In addition, patients with conditions requiring 
use of antiplatelet therapy have been added to this 
criterion.  Section 6.2.2 Exclusion Criteria, #10  
A new exclusi on criterion has been added to exclude 
patients at the highest risk of renal complications due 
to non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, 
as follows:  
‘Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors/ARBs and 
diuretics, or presence of an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) <30 mL/minute/1.73m2’ Section 6.2.2 Exclusion Criteria, #40  
The reasons for permanent discontinuation of study 
drug have been updated to ensure that patients enrolled 
under an earlier version of the protocol are 
immediatel y discontinued from study drug and moved 
to the follow -up period if they meet either of the 
updated exclusion criteria #22 and #40 described 
above, or are taking the newly added prohibited 
medications described above (combination therapy of 
diuretics with either an ACE inhibitor or ARB).  Section 7.3.2.1 Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation

and because methotrexate clearance can be 
decreased with concurrent NSAIDs, leading to 
potential increases in methotrexate levels;  
• To include anticoagulants and antiplatelet 
therapy ( eg, warfarin, heparins, factor Xa 
inhibitors, thrombin inhibitors, 
aspirin/5 -aminosalicylic acid (aspirin/5 -ASA)

Amendment 4 Global  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to incorporate an urgent safety measure, which 
requires discontinuing the 3 mg ever y 4 weeks (Q4W) and 6 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) dose 
regimens. The recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to 
discontinue these dose regimens was made following a review of unblinded data from an ongoing 
study in the fasinumab phase 3 osteoarthritis program (R475 -PN-1523) and was based on an 
imbalance in clinically relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral 
edema, arthralgia and a trend towards early fractures in the 6 mg Q8W group.  Based on the 
independent DMC review, study of lower dose levels (eg, 1 mg Q4W) may continue to be 
evaluated in this population.  With this amendment, patients randomized to the 3  mg Q4W or 6  mg 
Q8W dose regimens will be permanently discontinued from study drug but encoura ged to 
otherwise complete all remaining study visits and study procedures in the follow up period and the 
end of study phone call.  
Amendment 3 Global (obsolete)  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to update the exclusion criteria to improve patient 
safety. Additional changes were made to ensure consistency across the fasinumab program, 
improve clarity and to make minor corrections. This amendment was not implemented.  
Amendment 2VHP  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate health authority fee dback, ensure consistency 
across the program, improve clarity, remove redundant text and correct typos.  These changes 
brought Amendment 2VHP in line with Amendment 1.  
Amendment 1VHP  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate health authority feedbac k. 
Amendment 1  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate health authority feedback, ensure consistency 
across the program, improve clarity, remove redundant text and correct typos.

CONFIDENTIAL  Exploratory Objectives  
To evaluate additional patient reported outcome measures in patients with 
pain due to OA of the knee or hip  treated for up to 44 weeks with fasinumab, 
compared with placebo or naproxen.  
To evaluate the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores as well 
as additional patient reported outcome (PRO) measures in patients wit h pain 
due to OA of the knee or hip treated for an additional 52 weeks with 
fasinumab, compared with naproxen pro re nata (prn).   
To evaluate the use of rescue medication in patients with pain due to OA of 
the knee or hip  treated for up to 44 weeks with fasinumab, compared with 
placebo or naproxen.  
To evaluate the use of rescue medication in patients with pain due to OA of 
the knee of hip treated for an additional 52 weeks with fasinumab, compared 
with naproxen prn.  
Study  Design  This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo - and naproxen -controlled 
study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasinumab in patients 
with OA of the knee or hip who have a history of inadequate pain relief with 
acetaminophen/parace tamol and a history of intolerance to or inadequate 
pain relief with opioids (or are unwilling to take opioids or have lack of 
access to opioids).  
All randomized patients in this study will participate in Year 1, which is 
intended to provide efficacy and safety data for OA patients exposed for up 
to 52 weeks to fasinumab, a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
comparator (naproxen), or placebo.  At the end of the 52 -week treatment 
period of Year 1, patients who are eligible and willing to participa te in Year 
2 will continue in the study for a second 52 -week treatment period and will 
then enter the 20 -week follow -up period.  Note: As of 26 March 2020, all 
enrollment into Year 2 has been terminated due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
Any patients currently  enrolled in Year 2 are to remain in the study.  Patients 
who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but unwilling to enter Year 2, 
will enter directly into the 20 -week follow -up period at the completion of 
Year 1.  
Year 2 is intended to provide safety  data for OA patients exposed to 
fasinumab or naproxen for up to 104 weeks (52 weeks in Year 1 and a further 
52 weeks in Year 2).  Note that no patients will receive placebo only in Year 
2 (see Treatment Period for Year 2 below).  Efficacy will be assessed  during 
Year 2 to monitor the risk -benefit profile of fasinumab but, as Year 2 is not 
powered for a formal efficacy analysis, efficacy results will be summarized 
descriptively.  
The overall study period for patients in Year 1 who do not participate in 
Year 2 will be up to approximately 105  weeks including screening and 
pre-randomization.  For these patients, the study consists of a screening 
period of up to 30 days, a 7 to 10 day pre -randomization/washout period 
(7 days with a +3 day window), a 52 -week treat ment period, a 20 -week 
follow -up period, and an end of study phone contact at 52 weeks following 
the last subcutaneous (SC) dose of study drug.  Eligible patients who choose 
to participate in Year 2 will receive treatment for a total of 104 weeks and 
will then enter a 20 -week follow -up period, followed by the final phone call 
approximately 52 weeks after the last dose of SC study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL  Note: As of 17Aug ust 2020, all patients on treatment have been permanently 
discontinued from study drug and will complete t he End of Treatment visit. 
This impacts only patients in the Year 2 treatment period as treatment in 
Year 1 has ended. All patients will be encouraged to complete all remaining 
study visits and procedures in the follow -up period and the end of study 
phone call. 
Screening and Pre -Randomization  
At the screening visit, patients will consent to all study assessments planned 
for Year 1 and will be informed that they could potentially continue in the 
study for the second year if eligible.  Eligibility and consent  for Year 2 will 
be conducted at the end of Year 1.  A pproximately 4 weeks prior to 
randomization, patients will undergo screening procedures, including X -ray 
of the shoulders, hips, and knees, and m agnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
of the index and contrala teral joints must be performed and assessed by the 
central imaging vendor.  In addition, any knee or hip joint with a 
Kellgren -Lawrence (K -L) score of ≥3 will have MRI completed during the 
screening period.  During the screening period, all patients will c ontinue to 
take their current treatment regimen for OA pain, which must include  use of 
an oral NSAID on a regular basis, defined as approximately 4 days per week 
over the last 4 weeks.  
Patients eligible for the study will complete a 7 to 10 day pre -randomi zation 
period, during which patients will discontinue and/or undergo a washout of 
their standard -of-care pain medications for OA. All pain medications, 
except for the study -provided rescue medication 
(acetaminophen/paracetamol), will be discontinued.  
Rand omization  
At the baseline visit of Year 1, patients will be randomized 3:3:3:1 to the 
following treatment groups as follows:  
• Fasinumab 1  mg SC once every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 
naproxen -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
• Fasinumab 1  mg SC once every 8 weeks (Q8 W) and 
naproxen -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
• Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and naproxen 500  mg oral, 
twice daily  
• Fasinumab -matching placebo, SC, Q4W and naproxen -matching 
placebo oral, twice daily  
Randomization will be stratified according to the  affected index joint (hip 
or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3 or 4) at the screening visit, and geographical 
region.  
Treatment Period for Year 1 (Baseline to Week 52)  
During the treatment period of Year 1 (day  1 through week  52), patients will 
be permitted to  use only acetaminophen/paracetamol  as rescue medication.  
Patients will record their use of acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary.  
The study visits during the treatment period will include 1 phone visit on 
day 8 (±1  day).  
Safety and efficacy assessments wi ll be performed and potential events of 
adjudicated arthropathy (AA) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction 
will be monitored.

participate in Year 2 will continue in the study  for a second 52 -week 
treatment period.  Patients who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but 
unwilling to enter Year 2, will enter directly into the 20 -week follow -up 
period.  
Treatment Period for Year 2 (Week 52E to Week 104E)  
Study weeks during Ye ar 2 will be denoted with an E to represent study 
weeks during the extension (eg, week 52E) and to differentiate them from 
study weeks with the same numbers in the follow -up period for patients who 
only participate in Year 1.   
Eligible patients who choose  to participate in Year 2 will not be

Naproxen (and naproxen -matching placebo) will be administered as needed 
(ie, prn) in Year 2 instead of twice daily as in Year 1, due to  the known 
safety profile a ssociated with chronic NSAID use.  
A fasinumab -matching placebo/naproxen -matching placebo group will not 
be included in Year 2 so as not to have patients who are experiencing 
moderate -to-severe pain due to their OA go for an entire 2 -year period with 
only rescue medication of acetaminophen/paracetamol available to them for 
pain control.  Patients who were randomized to fasinumab -matching 
placebo/naproxen -matching placebo in Year 1 will be switched to 
fasinumab -matching placebo/naproxen 500 mg prn for the se cond year of 
treatment to ensure they have access to some form of pain medication in 
addition to acetaminophen/paracetamol.  
During the treatment period of Year 2 (week  52E through week 104E), 
rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) will continue to b e 
permitted for all patients and use will be recorded in a diary.  
Safety and efficacy assessments will continue through Year 2.

CONFIDENTIAL  Follow -up 
At the end of the treatment period (week 52 for patients participating in Year 
1 only, or week 104E for patients parti cipating in Year 1 and Year 2), 
follow -up of patients will continue for an additional 20 weeks .  Safety and 
efficacy assessments will be performed similarly to those of the treatment 
period . 
If a patient must undergo joint replacement surgery during the st udy, he or 
she will be asked to complete pre -operative imaging and to undergo 
post-surgery follow -up. 
A phone contact questionnaire will be conducted approximately 52  weeks 
after administration of the last SC dose of study drug to document patient 
status w ith regard to joint replacement surgery (if patient underwent, is 
scheduled for, or is on a wait list for joint replacement surgery). Patients 
who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the affected joint(s).  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for patients who participate in Year 1 only is up 
to approximately 105 weeks, including the screening and pre -randomization 
periods.  The duration of the study for patients who participate in Year 1 and 
Year 2 is up to approximate ly 157 weeks, including the screening and pre -
randomization periods.  Patients who discontinue study drug will be 
requested to return for all scheduled study visits and to complete all planned 
assessments, including phone contacts.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Enrollment of approximately 2845 patients is planned for this study, which 
includes a total of 285 patients who were enrolled in the fasinumab 3 mg 
SC Q4W and 6 mg SC Q8W groups under earlier versions of the protocol 
before dosing was discontinued du e to the urgent safety measure, and a total 
of approximately 2560 patients who will be randomized to fasinumab 1 mg 
SC Q4W, 1 mg SC Q8W, naproxen, and placebo.  
Approximately 840 patients will be randomized to the fasinumab 1 mg 
SC Q4W group, 840 patients to the naproxen -only group, and 280 patients

Safety:  Safety endpoints for Year 1 (all randomized and treated patients)  
Safety endpoints for Year 1 (through week 52) will include:  
• Incidence of adjudicated arthropathy (AA) (as confirmed by 
independent adjudication)  
• Incidence of destructive arthropathy (DA) (as confirmed by 
independent adjudication)  
• Incidenc e of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Incidence of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction (as 
diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as 
a neurologist and/or cardiologist)  
• Incidence of peripheral sensory AEs that require  a neurology or 
other specialty consultation  
• Incidence of all -cause joint replacements (JRs)  
The incidence of JRs at the telephone survey 52 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug (week 100) will also be evaluated.  
Safety endpoints for Year 2 (all randomized and treated patients 
proceeding into Year 2)  
The safety endpoints listed above for Year 1 will be evaluated for Year 2 
from the first dose of study drug given in Year 2 through week 104E (end 
of treatment), as well as for the periods of Year 1 a nd Year 2 from day 1 
through week 104E.   
The incidence of JRs at the telephone survey approximately 52 weeks after 
the last dose of study drug (week 152E) will also be evaluated.  
Procedures and Assessments  At the screening visit, patients will provide informed consent, medical 
history, and medication history.  Determination of the K -L score of the knee 
or hip will be performed to establish a diagnosis of OA based on the 
American College of Rheumatology criteria using a K -L score cutoff of ≥2.  
Patients will be assessed for childbearing potential and complete a 
self-reported assessment of peripheral or central pain.  
Efficacy in Year 1 will be assessed by the change from baseline in the 
WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores, the PGA, the Numeric  
Rating Scale of the average walking index joint pain, the EuroQoL 5 
Dimensions 5 Level Questionnaire, the 36-item Short Form Survey , the 
Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire, the Work Productivity and 
Activity Impairment -Osteoarthritis questionna ire, and the Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication.  The WOMAC total and stiffness 
scores will also be evaluated.  Efficacy in Year 2 will be assessed by the 
change from baseline in the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale 
scores, the Eu roQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level Questionnaire and the Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment -Osteoarthritis questionnaire.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit and upon 
occurrence of any joint adverse events (AEs) .  Potential events of AA  will 
be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain during 
the study and adjudication of pre -operative imaging for patients who

of sympathetic nervous syste m dysfunction will be monitored throughout 
the study through physical examination, AE reporting, assessment of 
orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of Autonomic Symptoms.  
After the end -of-study visit and approximately 52 weeks after 
administration of th e last dose of SC study drug, a phone contact 
questionnaire will be conducted to document patient status with regard to 
JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is on a wait list for JR 
surgery). Patients who had an AA will have an MRI perfor med of the 
affected joint(s).  
Statistical Plan  Statistical Hypothesis  
There are 29 hypotheses for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The 
primary endpoint comparison of study drug with placebo for the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscale scores will be declared superior only if 
the comparisons are significant for both WOMAC pain and physical 
function subscale scores.  A graphical testing procedure will be applied to 
control for multiplicity and to maintain study -wise Type I error rate at a  two-
sided 0.05 level for the hypotheses (H 1,i, i=1,…,16 for fasinumab 1 mg 
Q4W, and H 2,i, i=1,…,13 for fasinumab 1 mg Q8W) for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. If a hypothesis is rejected, the alpha level for that 
hypothesis will be reallocated to  other hypotheses according to the 
pre-specified procedure.  
Justification of FAS and mFAS Sample Size  
The planned sample size was expected to provide adequate power for the 
comparisons between fasinumab doses and naproxen at week 16 for the 
WOMAC pain and physical function scores and the PGA score and provide 
long term data for safety assessment.  
The sample size for the full analysis set (FAS) population was based on 
results of the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores and the 
PGA from the R475 -PN-1227 study.  The calculation of sample size 
assumed a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up to week 
16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52.  Enrollment of 840 patients in the 
fasinumab 1 mg Q4W group and 280 patients in the placebo grou p would 
have provided at least 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.46 in the 
WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores at week 16 and week 
52.  This sample size would have provided 99% power to detect an effect 
size of 0.36 in PGA for an absolut e treatment difference of 0.4 with a 
standard deviation (SD) of 1.1 at week 16, and 98% power at week 52 for 
the FAS.  
For the fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group, the 600 patients in the FAS population 
were to be compared to approximately 200 patients in the placebo  group 
who were enrolled under amendment 5 global. For such comparisons, a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up to week 16, and a 
30% dropout rate up to week 52, were assumed. Additionally, the effect size 
for such comparisons was assumed  to be 80% of the effect size for the 
comparison between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W group and the placebo group. 
Under these assumptions, enrollment of 600 patients in the fasinumab 1 mg 
Q8W group and 200 patients from the placebo group would have provided 
97% pow er to detect an effect size of 0.368 (=0.46*80%) in the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscale scores at week 16 and 93% power at 
week 52.  This sample size would have provided 84% power to detect an

patients in the fasinumab 1 mg Q4W group and the naproxen group would 
have provided at least 97% power to detect an effect size of 0.22 in the 
WOMAC pain subscale at week 16 and 93 % power at week 52 for the FAS.  
This sample size would have provided 98% power to detect an effect size of 
0.24 in WOMAC physical function subscale (ie, absolute treatment 
difference of 0.50 with a SD of 2.1) at week 16 and 96% power at week 52 
for the FA S.  This sample size would have provided 87% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.18 in PGA at week 16 between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and 
naproxen for the FAS.  
Due to regional irregularities noted in a parallel phase 3 study that became 
fully apparent only aft er unblinding that study, and the concern that the same 
irregularities would be present in data from similar sites in this study, the 
population for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses was changed in 
Protocol Amendment 8 to be based on a modified f ull analysis set (mFAS) 
that excludes the randomization stratum for that region.  Based on the 
assumptions above, it is estimated that this mFAS will provide:  
• 99.9% power to detect a significant difference between the 
1 mg Q4W group and the placebo group i n the WOMAC pain 
and physical function subscales at an alpha level of 0.05  
• 42% and 46% power to detect a significant difference between 
the 1 mg Q8W group and the placebo group in WOMAC pain 
and physical function subscales, respectively, at an alpha level 
of 0.01  
• 99.9% power to detect a significant difference between the 
1 mg Q4W group and the naproxen group in the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscales at an alpha level of 0.04  
Statistical Methods  
Baseline demographic disease characteristics, including  medical history  and 
exposure to study drug, will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical or 
ordinal data, frequen cies and percentages will be displayed for each 
category.  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using multiple imputation 
approach with a mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based 
on the mFAS with adjustment for missing data due to lac k of efficacy, death 
or AEs assuming the WOMAC scores would on average return to baseline 
values. The imputed data for patients discontinued from the study treatment 
due to lack of efficacy, death or AEs will be centered at the mean baseline 
value. The mis sing data for patients who discontinued treatment due to other 
reasons will be imputed under missing -at-random assumption. Sensitivity 
analysis using tipping point approach with multiple imputation will be 
performed to assess the robustness of the results due to treatment 
discontinuation.

CONFIDENTIAL  For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints at fixed timepoints (ie, week 
16 and week 44), the analysis method will be the same as that used for the 
primary efficacy endpoints. For the analysis of secondary endpoints 
involving the averaging over several visits, analysis will be performed using 
a multiple imputation approach with an ANCOVA model based on the 
mFAS with adjustment for missing data performed in the same manner as 
was done for the primary endpoint.  For analy sis of secondary endpoints that 
are categorical variables, eg, proportions of patients with ≥30% 
improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 16, the Cochran 
Mantel Haenszel approach will be used based on the mFAS, stratifying by 
the randomization  strata.  
For Year 2 analysis, the efficacy and patient -reported outcome (PRO) 
endpoints collected will be summarized descriptively.  
The summary of safety results will be presented for Year 1, Year 2, and the 
combined treatment period of Year 1 and Year 2.   
Safety data including TEAEs  and treatment emergent adverse events of 
special interest, vital signs, physical exams, laboratory tests, 
electrocardiograms, and anti -drug antibody formation will be listed and 
summarized by treatment group.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION   
1.1. Background  
Chronic musculoskeletal pain affects a large portion of the global population.  A significant cause 
of chronic musculoskeletal pain is due to osteoarthritis (OA).  Osteoarthritis is a progressive, 
chronic disease caused by the breakdown and loss of cartilage of th e joints, which leads to pain in 
the hips, knees, hands, feet, and spine.  It is characterized by focal areas of loss of articular cartilage 
in synovial joints accompanied by subchondral bone changes, osteophyte formation at the joint 
margins, thickening o f the joint capsule and mild synovitis.  Symptoms and disability increase 
with increasing age.  The prevalence of OA in patients aged 65 and older is 60% in men and 70% 
in women, and continually rising ( Sarzi -Puttini  2005 ). 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment in patients with 
mild-to-moderate OA.  The efficacy of NSAIDs is well -documented, albeit modest, but their use 
is associated with a number of risks ( Bingham  2007 ) (Bjordal  2004 ) (Makarowski  2002 ) 
(Silverstein  2000 ).  The risks associated with long -term therapy with NSAIDs, in particular, have 
been well -characterized and include gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and increased risk of 
cardiovascular events ( Lanas  2011 ) (Trelle  2011 ).  Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs have 
limited efficacy in many OA patients; those with advanced OA typically try several NSAIDs and 
must often move to other therapies such as opioids . 
Treatment guidelines for OA suggest that opioids may be used in OA only if management with 
NSAIDs is ineffective, intolerable, or otherwise contraindicated.  However, the use of opioids is 
limited by cent ral nervous system effects, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and potential for 
abuse and dependence.  In addition, opioid use may be associated with both acute and chronic side 
effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, gastrointestinal intolerability , mo tor imbalance, 
respiratory depression, and even death.  Opioid use must be closely monitored in patients who are 
vulnerable or are potentially vulnerable to abuse or addiction.  Moreover, there is no evidence to 
support superiority of opioids over other av ailable pain medications.  While the efficacy of opioids 
in treating pain over a short duration is supported by research data, long -term efficacy has not been 
evaluated.  
Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for alternative treatment options to opioids  that have 
a more effective analgesic effect, particularly since there are a significant number of patients who 
are intolerant to or do not get adequate pain relief from the currently available treatment options.  
Inadequate pain relief has a profound impa ct on the quality of life for millions of people worldwide 
with an associated substantial cost to society, including healthcare cost ( Salmon  2016 ) and loss of 
productivity ( Dibonaventura  2011 ). 
Neurotrophins are a family of peptide growth factors that play a role in the development, 
differentiation, survival and death of neuronal and non -neuronal cells ( Chao  2006 ).  Nerve growth 
factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and 
survival of both peripheral and central neurons during the development of the nervous system is 
well characterized ( Crowley  1994 ) (Smeyne  1994 ).  In the adult, NGF is not required as a survival 
factor but acts as a pain mediator that sensitizes neurons ( Pezet  2006 ).  Nerve growth factor activity 
is mediated through 2 different membrane -bound receptors, the high -affinity tyrosine kinase type 
1 (TrkA) and the low -affinity p75 neurotrophin receptors.

CONFIDENTIAL  By acting upstream of several relevant molecular pathways, the NGF/TrkA system appears to play 
a major role in the control of pain.  Administration of NGF has been shown to provoke pain in 
both rodents ( Lewin  1994 ) and humans ( McArthur  2000 ), while NGF antagonists have been 
shown to prevent hyperalgesia and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic and chronic 
inflammatory pain ( Ramer  1999 ).  Humans with mutations in TrkA (hereditary sensory and 
autonomic neuropathy IV) or NGF (hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy V) have been 
identified with a loss of deep pain percep tion ( Einarsdottir  2004 ) (Indo 1996 ).  In addition, NGF 
is known to be elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other types 
of arthritis ( Aloe  1992 ) (Halliday  1998 ), and to be up -regulated in injured and inflamed tissues in 
conditions such as cysti tis, prostatitis, and chronic headache ( Lowe  1997 ) (Miller  2002 ) 
(Sarchielli  2001 ). 
Fasinumab (also known as REGN475) is a fully -human high -affinity monoclonal antibody 
directed against NGF.  By selectively blocking NGF, fasinumab has the potential to be effective 
in modulating NGF -associated pain without some of the adverse side effect s of other analgesic 
medications, such as opioids and NSAIDs.  Following an evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
of the antibody in a single -ascending -dose first -in-human study (study  R475 -PN-0817), a 
proof -of-concept study evaluating the effect of fa sinumab on pain in 217  patients with OA of the 
knee was completed (study R475 -PN-0901, see current version of the Fasinumab Investigator’s 
Brochure).  Three intravenous (IV) doses of fasinumab were evaluated (0.03,  0.1, 0.3  mg/kg every 
8 weeks [Q8W]).  All  three doses, compared with placebo, were associated with statistically 
significant improvement in pain as evaluated by walking knee pain, the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Patient’s Global Impression of Change 
question naire.  Additionally, the R475 -PN-1227 study in patients with OA revealed significant 
efficacy in the WOMAC pain subscale score for each of the doses of fasinumab evaluated (1 mg, 
3 mg, 6  mg, and 9  mg given every 4 weeks [Q4W]) compared with placebo (see c urrent version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure).   Results from recent clinical studies with other anti -NGF 
antibodies, tanezumab (Pfizer) and fulranumab (Janssen), also support the role of NGF in pain 
modulation in patients with pain due to OA of the knee a nd hip ( Brown  2012 ) (Hefti  2006 ) 
(Lane  2010 ) and in patients with chronic low back  pain ( Katz  2011 ) (Kivitz  2013 ). 
In all clinical studies completed to date, fasinumab was generally well tolerated.  Arthralgia, joint 
swell ing, peripheral edema, hypoesthesia, and myalgia were more frequently reported in 
fasinumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients.  In neurological evaluations, 
abnormalities in vibration sense were more frequent in the fasinumab patients than in the placebo 
patients.  These adverse events (AEs) or physical examination abnormalities associated with 
fasinumab were generally mild to moderate in intensity and were transient (see current version of 
the Investigator’s Brochure).  
Data from studies of tanezumab and fulranumab demonstrated these molecules were associated 
with an increased risk of destructive arthropathy (DA), a unique clinical form of rapidly 
progressive arthropathy over and above that seen in the normal progression of osteoarthritis.  
Analyses of the tanezumab data by its sponsor, defined by anatomic pathological criteria on 
specimens obtained on joint replacement (JR), revealed that the risk of DA increases with 
tanezumab dose and is further increased with the concomitant use of chronic  NSAIDs (>90  days) 
(Lane  2010 ).  Most cases of DA occurred in joints with a documented history of OA.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.    Page 37 of 130 
CONFIDENTIAL  Based on the potential risk of DA identified in tanezumab and fulranumab, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) placed this class of anti -NGF antibodies on clinical hold in 2010.  Following 
a review of anti -NGF antibody clinical data in March 2012, the FDA determined that clinical 
studies of anti -NGF therapies could resume if mitigation strategie s are implemented to minimize 
the risk of DA.  To address concerns about potential events of DA, a risk -mitigation approach is 
also being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  9.6.1.1 .  This approach 
includes sensitive, prospective, and rigorous radiologic screening and monitoring for select 
changes in joint structure.  The patients who develop these changes, which are ref erred to 
throughout this document as adjudicated arthropathy (AA), are required to discontinue study 
therapy.  
Since the removal of the FDA clinical hold, Regeneron has conducted or initiated several clinical 
trials of fasinumab.  In all clinical studies t o date, fasinumab was associated with a low rate of 
discontinuations due to adverse events.  Patients treated with fasinumab generally had more 
frequent events than did placebo -treated patients of arthralgia, joint swelling, peripheral edema, 
altered perip heral sensation (eg, paresthesia, dysesthesia), and myalgia.  
In 2012, studies of other anti -NGF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified adverse changes in 
the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals of several species (rat and non -human primate).  
These effects include a reversible decrease in neuron volume.  To date, no statistically significant 
or consistent effects of fasinumab on the sympathetic nervous system have been detected in animal 
studies with up to 6 -months of treatment.  Nonetheless, base d on the potential risk of sympathetic 
nervous system toxicity associated with these other anti -NGF mAbs in animal studies, a risk 
mitigation approach is being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  9.6.1.2 . 
In the phase 2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the knee or hip 
(R475 -PN-1227), 26 AA events occurred in 24  patients.  There was an increase in AA even ts that 
appeared to be related to greater fasinumab dose.  Although these events were milder than the 
severe DA events presented at the 2012 FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, in consideration of 
the lack of an observed dose response for efficacy in OA, the  benefit -risk ratio was deemed 
unfavorable for the fasinumab 6  mg Q4W and 9  mg Q4W doses in patients with OA, in comparison 
to the other fasinumab doses that were studied (ie, 1 mg Q4W and 3 mg Q4W). The dose regimens 
that were being evaluated in the phase  3 studies for OA pain in the knee or hip included 1 mg 
Q8W, 1 mg Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6  mg Q8W. In April 2018, the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) recommended discontinuing 6 mg Q8W and 3 mg Q4W (expected to have 
similar exposure to 6 mg Q8W) ba sed on a review of unblinded data in an ongoing study in the 
fasinumab phase 3 OA program (R475 -PN-1523). Subsequently, a small Regeneron team 
reviewed the data and agreed with this recommendation.  The DMC noted imbalances in clinically 
relevant adverse e vents including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and 
a trend towards early fractures.  The phase 3 program for OA pain in the hip or knee continue d to 
evaluate fasinumab 1 mg with the highest dose regimen of 1 mg Q4W. In August  2020, the 
independent DMC recommended termination of the fasinumab program.  The recommendation 
was based on a review of the totality of evidence, including the emerging unblinded data. Based 
on the independent DMC recommendation, the sponsor has disconti nued dosing with fasinumab.  
At the time of this recommendation and amendment, the only patients to be impacted are the 
patients participating in the optional Year 2 portion of the R475 -OA-1611 study.  These patients 
will be encouraged to enter the Year 2 safety follow -up period.

CONFIDENTIAL  Fasinumab is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 trial (R475 -PN-1523) designed to assess the 
long-term safety and efficacy of multiple doses of fasinumab in patients with OA.  The phase 3 
study described here, R475 -OA-1611, is d esigned to compare the efficacy and safety of fasinumab 
with those of placebo and of naproxen, a standard -of-care NSAID for moderate -to-severe pain due 
to OA.  
Additional background information on fasinumab and the development program may be found in 
the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.2. Summary of Risks and Benefits to Patients Participating in this 
Study  
As discussed above in Section  1.1, there are potential risks and benefits to patients participating in 
the study. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure and informed consent form (ICF) for 
additional detailed information and analysis of the potential risks and benefits associated  with 
fasinumab administration.  Pain due to OA is a condition that results in significant morbidity and 
disability as well as marked loss of productivity. There is a significant unmet medical need for 
treatments with this condition. In Study R475 -OA-1611,  patients with pain due to OA will be 
randomized to fasinumab, naproxen or placebo; each of these treatment groups presents potential 
benefits and risks to patients as described below.  
• Fasinumab  
Fasinumab represents a potentially effective therapy that may  be beneficial to patients who do not 
achieve adequate pain relief, are unable to tolerate existing therapies, or have absolute or relative 
contraindications to existing therapies for OA pain of the hip or knee.  Previous fasinumab study 
(R475 -PN-1227) res ults have further confirmed earlier efficacy observations and demonstrate that 
fasinumab provides significant pain relief compared to placebo in OA patients across all doses 
administered.  Some common side effects seen in patients treated with fasinumab ar e joint -related 
events such as joint pain, joint/limb swelling, joint damage, new or worsening OA and occurrence 
of joint replacement surgery, and upper respiratory tract infection.  The joint damage that has been 
observed usually occurred in a knee or hip  and sometimes in multiple joints. The joint damage 
occurred with or without increased joint pain and, at times, was more rapid and more severe than 
what is normally seen with OA.  Some patients treated with fasinumab who develop this joint 
damage have had  a higher chance of undergoing joint replacement surgery.  In addition, this higher 
risk of joint replacement surgery has also been noted in fasinumab -treated patients who did not 
develop joint damage.  Further, this joint damage occurred more frequently i n patients who 
received NSAIDs along with drugs of the group of anti -NGF and, therefore, concomitant 
administration of fasinumab and NSAIDs, apart from low dose aspirin, is prohibited in this study. 
Other adverse effects that have been seen in patients tak ing fasinumab include a risk of bone 
fracture and altered peripheral sensation, including hypoesthesia and paraesthesia.  Some patients 
had pain, numbness, or tingling in their wrist/hand and found to have carpal tunnel syndrome, 
which was sometimes treate d with a surgical procedure. Finally, events associated with 
sympathetic nervous system dysfunction are being closely monitored due to findings from animal 
studies, although to date, this hasn’t been observed in patients treated with fasinumab.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.    Page 39 of 130 
CONFIDENTIAL  Throughout the entire fasinumab clinical development program, the potential risks noted above 
are being mitigated by implementing close monitoring of patients via extensive clinical and 
radiologic assessments. These mitigation activities are described in detail in Se ction  9.6.1 .  
Based on review of the totality of evidence from ongoing data across the fasinumab program as of 
August 2020, the independent DMC recom mended that the fasinumab program be stopped.  The 
Sponsor has discontinue d dosing with fasinumab. The only patients impacted were  the patients 
participating in the optional Year 2 portion of the R475 -OA-1611 study. The Sponsor believes it 
is important to continue off -treatment follow -up for all active patients in the study to complete 
safety follow -up. This safety follow -up is important to understand the benefit/risk for fasinumab.  
• Naproxen  
The benefits and risks of naproxen, an NSAID, at the recommended d osage are well documented. 
NSAIDs are efficacious and are the mainstay of treatment in patients with mild -to-moderate OA. 
The most frequently reported side effects of naproxen include cardiovascular events (eg, edema), 
gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdomi nal pain, nausea, and constipation), dermatological events 
(pruritus, skin eruptions), central nervous system (headache, dizziness, drowsiness) and dyspnea. 
Additional side effects include abnormal renal function, anemia, anaphylactoid reactions, 
gastroint estinal bleeding, hyper - and hypoglycemia, and renal failure.  
The overall benefit risk profile for naproxen is favorable.  
• Placebo  
The main potential risks associated with placebo are the lack of, or inadequate pain relief.  
Measures taken to minimize the risks associated with placebo use are as follows:  
• Availability of rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol).  
• Patients can withdraw from the study at any time if pain persists despite the use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol at the recommended dosage.  
Please refer to Section  3.2 for additional information on the rationale for including a placebo 
group.  
Patient Considerations in Response to COVID -19 
Measures to account for the COVID -19 pandemic that minimize the risks to the patients in the 
study as well as healthcare providers have been put in place (see Section  8.1 for details ).

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE   
3.1. Hypothesis  
Based on results from previous clinical studies of fasinumab in patients with OA, fasinumab is 
expected to provide effective pain relief based on  an improvement in the WOMAC pain sub -scale 
score and improved functionality based on the WOMAC physical function sub -scale.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
The present study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo - and naproxen -controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasinumab in patients with OA of the knee or hip who have a 
history of inadequate pain relief from acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to 
or inadequate pain relief from opioids (or are unwilling to take opioids) for OA pain management.   
The target study population was chosen because they currently have unmet medical needs with 
respect to incomplete pain control , despite the availability of NSAIDs.  The study will be 
conducted with appropriate eligibility criteria to exclude patients who may be at risk for events of 
joint damage and sympathetic nervous system effects.  
Year 1  
All randomized patients in this study wi ll participate in Year 1, which is intended to provide 
efficacy and safety data for OA patients exposed for up to 52 weeks to fasinumab, an NSAID 
comparator (naproxen), or placebo.  At the end of the 52 -week treatment period of Year 1, patients 
who are eli gible and willing to participate in a second 52 -week treatment period will enter Year 2 
(see below).  Patients who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but unwilling to enter Year 2, 
will enter directly into a 20 -week follow -up period at the completi on of Year 1 and thereby only 
participate in the Year 1 portion of the study.  
At the screening visit, patients will consent to all study assessments planned for Year 1 and will 
be informed that they could potentially continue in the study for the second ye ar if eligible.  
Eligibility and consent for Year 2 will be conducted at the end of Year 1.  Note: As of 26 March 
2020, e nrollment into Year 2 has been terminated due to the COVID -19 pandemic and, therefore, 
Year 1 patients reaching week 52 will move direc tly into the Year 1 follow -up period.   
This study will enroll patients who have failed or are intolerant to opioids and have inadequate 
pain relief from acetaminophen/paracetamol.  As there are currently a limited number of 
therapeutic options available f or these patients, enrollment of this study population supports 
equipoise with respect to randomization of patients to fasinumab or to placebo.   
The patients will be stratified by the affected index joint (hip or knee), by Kellgren -Lawrence 
(K-L) score (2  to 3, or 4), and by geographic region to enable analysis of efficacy and safety (as 
defined in Section  5.1).  The K -L stratification scheme is used here to ensure that there is an equal 
distribution of patients with the most severe OA at baseline across the dosing groups.  
The inclusion of a placebo treatment group in Year 1 is important to accurately determine t he 
efficacy of fasinumab.  Non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs are the most common medications 
used to treat pain due to OA.  Therefore, comparison of fasinumab to the NSAIDs treatment group 
will aid in determining the efficacy of fasinumab compared to a  frequently used and effective 
standard of care class of medications for OA, but that have associated clinically significant AEs.  
As naproxen is a commonly used and highly effective NSAID ( Ong 2007 ), it has been selected as 
the com parator drug for this study.  
Inclusion of both the placebo group and the active treatment comparator group in Year 1 will be 
important to accurately estimate the risk of AEs, including the AEs of special interest of

CONFIDENTIAL  adjudicated arthropathy, sympathetic ne rvous system dysfunction, and altered peripheral 
sensation.  Specific questionnaires and physical examinations will be employed to monitor for 
these AEs of special interest.  All patients included in the study will have regular study visits and 
receive dia gnostic procedures (ie, X -rays, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to evaluate their 
ongoing OA.  Adverse event monitoring will be ongoing throughout the trial.  Patients and 
investigators can choose to end participation at any time.   
Acetaminophen/paracet amol will be made available as rescue treatment for any patient as 
appropriate.  Therefore, the use of a placebo group is justified, as placebo -treated patients will not 
be placed at significant risk.   
Year 2  
Year 2 is intended to provide safety data for OA patients exposed to fasinumab or naproxen for up 
to 104 weeks (52 weeks in Year 1 and a further 52 weeks in Year 2).  Efficacy during Year 2 will 
be assessed via WOMAC to monitor the risk -benefit profile of fasinumab.  However, since Year 
2 of the study  is not powered for formal efficacy assessments, efficacy results will be summarized 
descriptively.  Eligible patients must consent to participate in Year 2 at the end of their Year 1 
participation.  As of 26 March 2020, enrollment into Year 2 has been ter minated due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic and therefore enrollment for any patients still eligible to enroll into Year 2 
as of this date is no longer an available option.  All patients currently enrolled into Year 2 as of 
this date are to remain in the study. A s of 17 Aug ust 2020, all patients on treatment have been 
permanently discontinued from study drug and will complete the End of Treatment visit . This 
impact s only patients in the Year 2 treatment period as treatment in Year 1 ha s ended. All patients 
will be  encouraged to complete all remaining study visits and procedures in the follow -up period 
and the end of study phone call.  
Patients who were randomized to fasinumab in Year 1 will continue treatment with the same 
fasinumab dose regimen in Year 2.  Patients  who were randomized to a fixed dose of naproxen in 
Year 1 will receive naproxen pro re nata (prn) in Year 2.  To maintain the study blind, patients on 
fasinumab will receive naproxen -matching placebo prn and patients on naproxen will receive 
fasinumab -matching placebo Q4W.  
A fasinumab -matching placebo/naproxen -matching placebo group will not be included in Year 2 
so as not to have patients who are experiencing moderate -to-severe pain due to their OA go for an 
entire 2 -year period with only rescue medicatio n of acetaminophen/paracetamol available to them 
for pain control.  Patients who were randomized to fasinumab -matching placebo/naproxen -
matching placebo in Year 1 will be switched to naproxen prn (and fasinumab -matching placebo 
Q4W) for the second year of treatment to ensure they have access to some form of pain medication 
in addition to acetaminophen/paracetamol.  
As in Year 1, all patients in Year 2 will have regular study visits and receive diagnostic procedures 
(ie, X -rays, MRI) to evaluate their ongoing  OA.  Adverse event monitoring will be ongoing 
throughout the trial.  Patients and investigators can choose to end participation at any time.   
Acetaminophen/paracetamol will be made available as rescue treatment during Year 2 for any 
patient as appropriat e.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Previous versions of this protocol randomized patients to receive fixed -dose, subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of 1  mg of fasinumab Q4W, 3  mg fasinumab Q4W, 6  mg fasinumab Q8W (with 
alternating placebo injections at the month ly visits where fasinumab will not be given, to maintain 
the blind), naproxen active comparator, or matching placebo. Based on April 2018 
recommendations from the independent DMC for this study that reviewed unblinded data from a 
different ongoing phase 3 study of fasinumab (R475 -PN-1523), the decision was made to 
discontinue further evaluation of fasinumab at 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W in the phase 3 program. 
This recommendation was based on an imbalance in clinically relevant adverse events including 
time to to tal joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and a trend towards fractures.  Under 
amendment 4 global, all patients previously randomized to 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W under an 
earlier version of the protocol were discontinued from study drug, but encouraged to otherwise 
continue all protocol visits and study procedures in the follow -up period and the end of study phone 
call. Based on the independent DMC review, study of lower dose levels (eg,1 mg Q4W) may 
continue to be evaluated in the OA populati on.  Given the discontinuation of the 3 mg and 6  mg 
doses, greater exposure to the fasinumab 1 mg dose is required to increase the size of the fasinumab 
safety database for potentially clinically relevant doses. Under this amendment, exposure to the 
fasinu mab 1 mg dose will be increased by continuing to enroll patients into the 1  mg Q4W group 
as planned, and adding a 1 mg Q8W group to increase exposure to the 1  mg dose and to replicate 
the efficacy profile of this dose regimen, which was first evaluated in R475 -PN-1523.  
Clinical trial data, including PK data, that support selection of these fasinumab doses include those 
from the phase  1 studies in healthy volunteers (R475 -PN-0817 and TDU -11480), the 
R475 -PN-0901 phase 2 proof -of-concept study in patients wi th pain due to OA of the knee, the 
R475 -PN-1227  phase 2/3 study in patients with OA of the hip or knee, the R475 -PN-0908 
single -dose, proof -of concept study in patients with sciatic pain.  
Single subcutaneous (SC) doses of fasinumab of up to 30  mg were wel l-tolerated in healthy male 
and female subjects in the TDU -11480 study.  All single IV doses of fasinumab in the 
R475 -PN-0817 study in healthy male and female subjects were generally well tolerated at all but 
the highest IV dose (1  mg/kg).  The occurrence of neurosensory AEs, which were transient and 
non-severe, led to the decision to refrain from escalating above the 1  mg/kg IV dose and instead, 
to expand enrollment of the 1  mg/kg IV cohort.  
In the R475 -PN-0901 phase  2 proof -of-concept study of fasinumab i n patients with pain due to 
OA of the knee, multiple IV doses of up to 0.3  mg/kg administered Q8W demonstrated efficacy 
with regard to pain relief and were well tolerated in Caucasian subjects.  All 3  doses of fasinumab 
(0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/k g IV Q8W) were associated with greater improvement 
compared with placebo in walking index knee pain, standardized total WOMAC score, WOMAC 
subscales (pain, function, and stiffness) and Patient’s Global Impression of Change.  However, it 
was noted that pain  relief had the slowest onset with the lowest (0.03  mg/kg) dose.   
In the R475 -PN-1227 phase  2 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the hip or 
knee, all SC doses (1  mg, 3  mg, 6 mg, and 9  mg Q4W) demonstrated efficacy in pain relief and 
physical function measures, based upon WOMAC pain and physical function scales assessed after 
16 weeks of treatment.  Considering the relative lack of an observed dose response for efficacy 
and increased risk of AA with both the 9  mg and 6  mg Q4W doses, the l atter doses are no longer

CONFIDENTIAL  being studied for the treatment of pain due to OA.  Neuromuscular AEs, such as arthralgia and 
paresthesia, were reported more frequently in fasinumab treated patients than in placebo -treated 
patients, though these events were typi cally mild or moderate in intensity. The efficacy and safety 
data from the 1 mg and 3 mg Q4W dose regimens in R475 -PN-1227 supported the previous dose 
selection of 1 mg and 3 mg Q4W and 6 mg Q8W for the present study. Now, with the removal of 
the 3 mg Q4W and 6 mg Q8W dose regimens due to emerging safety information, the 1 mg Q4W 
dose regimen will continue to be evaluated in this study and is deemed to have a favorable 
benefit -risk profile.  The addition of the 1 mg Q8W dose regimen will aid in the determin ation of 
a minimally efficacious dose.  Note, with this amendment all dose regimens of study drug have 
been discontinued.  
All randomized patients in Year 1 will receive orally administered naproxen (500 mg twice daily) 
or matching placebo.  The 500  mg twice daily naproxen dose is a standard, approved dose for pain 
associated with OA.   
All patients who choose to enter Year 2 will take 500 mg naproxen as needed (ie, prn), which is 
considered standard -of-care for pain associated with OA, or naproxen -matching placebo prn.  The 
prn dosing schedule was chosen considering the known safety profile associated with chronic 
NSAID use.  In general, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration taking 
into consideration the patient’s medical history , concomitant medications, comorbidities, and age.  
The maximum dose allowed will be no more than the amount allowed during Year 1 (ie, 500 mg 
twice daily).

This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo - and naproxen -controlled study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasinumab in patients with OA of the knee or hip who have a 
history of inadequate pain relief with acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to 
or inadequate pain relief from opioids (or are unwilling to take opioids or have lack of access to 
opioids).   
The overall study period for patients  in Year 1 who do not participate in Year 2 will be up to 
approximately 105  weeks including screening and pre -randomization.  For these patients, the study 
consists of a screening period of up to 30 days, a 7 to 10 -day pre -randomization/washout period 
(7 days with a +3 day window), a 52 -week treatment period, a 20 -week follow -up period, and a 
final phone call approximately 52 weeks after the last dose of SC study drug ( Figure  1).  At the 
end of the Year 1 treatment period, eligible patients can choose to consent to Year 2 and undergo 
a second year of treatment instead of entering the 20 -week follow -up period.  Note: As of 26 March 
2020, all enrollment int o Year 2 has been terminated due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Any patients 
currently enrolled in Year 2 are to remain in the study. Patients who participate in Year 2 will

CONFIDENTIAL  5.1.1.  Screening and Pre -Randomization  
At the screening visit, patients will consent to all study assessments planned for Year 1 and will 
be informed that they could potentially continue in the study fo r a second year if they meet 
eligibility requirements for Year 2.  Eligibility and consent for Year 2 will be conducted at the end 
of Year 1.  
Prior to randomization, patients will undergo screening procedures, including X -ray of the 
shoulders, hips, and kn ees.  M agnetic resonance imaging of the index and contralateral joints must 
be performed at screening and the results assessed by the central imaging vendor.  In addition, an 
MRI will be performed on any knee or hip joint with a K -L score of ≥3.  Randomiza tion visits 
cannot occur until there is confirmation from the central imaging vendor that there are no 
exclusionary findings on the X -rays and any required MRIs.   During the screening period, all 
patients will continue to take their current treatment regim en for OA pain, which must include  use 
of an oral NSAID on a regular basis, defined as approximately 4 days per week over the last 4 
weeks.   
Patients eligible for the study will complete a pre -randomization period, during which all pain 
medication, except  for the study -provided rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol), will 
be discontinued.  The pre -randomization visit will be 7  to 10  days (7 days with a +3 day window) 
before the randomization visit.  Patients will discontinue and/or undergo a washout  of, their 
standard -of-care pain medications for OA during the pre -randomization period.  As needed, 
patients may take acetaminophen/paracetamol for pain relief according to the regional 
standard -of-care (see Section  7.2 for details).  Acetaminophen/paracetamol must not be taken 
within 24 hours prior to the randomization visit.  
5.1.2.  Rescreening  
Re-testing During Screening or Pre -randomization  
An assessment that fails to meet eligibility criteria may be repeated once within the screening or 
pre-randomization period when approved by the Sponsor or designated Medical Monitor under 
either of the following conditions: 1) the failure is believed by the investigato r to be due to a 
condition that would resolve or could be treated, or 2) a laboratory value minimally exceeds the 
cut-off value and is not clinically relevant. Only the assessments that did not meet the eligibility 
criteria require repetition, if done with in the screening period or pre -randomization period. Patients 
may not repeat any assessments if they do not meet the WOMAC criteria or have orthostatic 
hypotension (defined in Section  8.2.3.4 ) during the screening or pre -randomization visit.  
Rescreening Due to Screen Failure  
Rescreening can be completed for patients who fail to meet the screening visit window 
requirements or who are unable to complete all imaging assessments within the specified screening 
period.  Patients who are rescreened after the pre -randomization window must be declared screen 
failures, be registered in the IVRS as a new patient with a new identification number, and then 
repeat al l screening procedures, with the exception of imaging assessments. Any imaging 
assessments would need to be repeated only if they were taken more than 60 days from completion 
of the previous screening X -rays and MRI assessments. Patients cannot rescreen if  they have

Section  8.2.3.4 ) during the screening or pre-randomization visit.  
5.1.3.  Randomization  
Enrollment of approximately 2845 patients is planned for this study, which includes a total of 
285 patients who were enrolled in the fasinumab 3 mg SC Q4W and 6 mg SC Q8W groups under 
earlier versions of the protocol before dosing was discontinued due to the urgent safety measure, 
and a total of approximately 2560 patients who will be randomized to fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W, 
1 mg SC Q8W, naproxen, and placebo.  
At the baseline visit of Year 1, patients will be randomized 3 :3:3:1 to the following treatment 
groups as follows:  
• Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W  
• Fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W  
• Naproxen 500  mg oral, twice daily  
• Placebo  
Prior to amendment 5 global, it is estimated that approximately 560 patients were randomized as 
follows: 240 pati ents to the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W group, 240 patients to the naproxen -only 
group and 80 patients to the placebo group. Under amendment 5 global, a further 2000 patients 
were planned to be randomized as follows: 600 patients to the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W gro up, 
600 patients to the naproxen -only group, 200 patients to the placebo group, and 600 patients to the 
newly added fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W group.  Thus, overall, this study will enroll approximately 
2560  patients as follows: 840 patients to the fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W group, 600 patients to the 
1 mg SC Q8W group, 840 patients to the naproxen group, and 280 patients to the placebo group.  
Prior to amendment 5 global, approximately 285 patients were enrolled in the fasinumab 3  mg SC 
Q4W and fasinumab 6 mg SC Q8W groups. However, dosing in these patients was discontinued, 
as recommended by the independent DMC in April  2018.   
Patients will receive treatment as described in Section  7.1. Randomization will be stratified 
according to the affected index joint (hip or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3 or 4) at the screening visit, 
and geographical region.   
Eligible patients who choose to participate in Year 2 will not be re -randomized at week 52.  See 
Section  7.1 for treatment assignments in Year 2.  
5.1.4.  Treatment Period for Year 1  
During the treatment period (day  1 through week  52), patients will be permitted to use only 
acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication. The study visits during the treatment period will 
include 1 phone visit on day  8 (±1  day). Patients will record thei r use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary. Patients should discontinue use of acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol at least 24 hours prior to the start of each study visit in order to minimize the 
confounding effects of the rescue medication on efficacy measurem ents.

CONFIDENTIAL  Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the WOMAC pain and physical function 
subscale scores, the PGA, the 36 -item Short Form Survey (SF -36), the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 
5 Level Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L), the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of the average walking index 
joint pain, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment -Osteoarthritis (WPAI -OA), the 
Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) questionnaire, and the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM).  The WOMAC total and stiffness scores will also be 
evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during treatment period, as outlined in 
Table  1. 
At the end of the treatment period, patients will either enter the 20 -week follow -up period or will 
be offered by their investigator to enter Year 2, if eligible.  
5.1.5.  Treatment Period for Year 2  
During the treatment period of Year 2 (week  52E through week 104E ), patients will be permitted 
to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication.  Patients will record their use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary.  Patients should discontinue use of 
acetaminophen/  paracetamol at least 24 hours prior to the  start of each study visit in order to 
minimize the confounding effects of the rescue medication on efficacy measurements.  
Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the WOMAC pain and physical function 
subscale scores, the EQ -5D-5L and the WPAI -OA.  The WOMAC total and stiffness scores will 
also be evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during treatment period, as outlined in 
Table  2. 
5.1.6.  Follow -Up Period  
At the end of the treatment period (week 52 for patients participating in Year 1 only, or week 104E 
for patients participating in Year 1 and Year 2), follow -up of patients will continue for an 
additional 20 weeks .  Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed according to the schedule 
outlined in Table  1 (for patients participating in Year 1 only) or Table  2 (for patients participating 
in Year 1 and Year 2) . 
If a patient must undergo JR surgery during the study, he or she will be asked to complete 
pre-operative imaging and to undergo post -surgery follow -up as outlined in Table  3. 
5.1.7.  End of Study Phone Contact  
The end of study phone contact will be at week 100 for patients participating in Year 1 only or 
week 152E for patients participating in Year 1 and Year 2.  
A phone contact questionnaire will be conducted at approximately 52 weeks after administration 
of the last dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching p lacebo to document patient status with 
regard to JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is on a wait list for JR surgery).  
Patients who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the affected joint(s).  If the affected joint 
has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.1.8.  Study Stopping Rules  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor unblinded data on an ongoing 
basis to assess the risk/benefit profile of fasinumab.  Based on these reviews, in the context of the 
totality of evidence, if the DMC has significant concerns at any time regarding a meaningful 
imbalance between treatment groups in joint -related AEs, sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction, neurosensory disturbances, or any other safety issues, the DMC may mak e a 
recommendation to temporarily halt, alter, or terminate:  
• individual dose groups within the study or across studies  
• the full study (screening, randomization, dosing of study drug)  
• the fasinumab program  
for additional review and communication to regulatory authorities.  Based on the outcome of the 
review and discussions with the appropriate regulatory authorities, the study may be suspended, 
restarted, or terminated.  
Formal program wide statistical study stopping criteria for clinical studies invo lving fasinumab 
may be added to the DMC charter as deemed necessary by the sponsor, DMC and/or Health 
Authorities.  
5.1.9.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the last phone contact of the last patient in this study.  
5.2. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis of efficacy data from Year 1 will be conducted prior to collection of all data 
necessary for the primary and secondary analysis.   
A first -step analysis of all available efficacy and safety data for Year 1 and select analysis of 
availabl e Year 2 safety data will be performed when all data for Year 1 Treatment Period (baseline 
through week  52) have been collected and validated for all randomized patients (see Section  10.5 
for statistical details of this analysis).   
Another analysis will be performed for regulatory purposes on the remaining Year  1 WOMAC 
and PRO assessments and safety data (collected during the Year 1 follow -up period) a nd any Year 
2 efficacy and safety data available at the time of the data cut -off for the second analysis.  
Additional analyses of other efficacy and safety data may be performed for regulatory purposes as 
needed.  
Individuals unblinded to patient -level data for the first -step or any of the subsequent analyses will 
no longer be involved in the day -to-day conduct of the ongoing study.  Patient -level results will 
not be released to any site -facing personnel or anyone who is directly involved in the conduct of 
the study.

duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and post -ovulation methods),  withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  Female condom and male condom should not be 
used together.  
6.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient  has the right  to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the pat ient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal o f patients should be avoided.  
Patient s who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  8.1.4 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in 
Section  7.3.2 . 
6.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patients  prematurely withdrawn from the study or study drug will not be replaced .

All patients will receive SC injections of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo.  All SC 
injections will be in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.  Patients will be observed in the clinic for 
approximately 1 hour after study drug is administered.  Patien ts randomized to earlier versions of 
the protocol with 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W fasinumab were discontinued from study drug for the 
remainder of the study and moved directly into the follow -up period.  
Naproxen 500  mg or naproxen -matching placebo will be admini stered orally, twice daily.  A 
proton pump inhibitor or other gastric protective medication may be prescribed if deemed 
medically necessary by the investigator or sub -investigator.  
Doses of SC study drug must be given within ±7 days from the scheduled dose  date.  If the window 
is missed, the SC dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo should not be administered, 
however the oral dose of naproxen or naproxen -matching placebo will be dispensed.   The next SC 
dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching place bo should be administered at the next scheduled 
dosing date.

CONFIDENTIAL  Administrat ion of SC study drug will be performed as stated above for Year 1.  
Naproxen 500  mg or naproxen -matching placebo will be administered prn.  A proton pump 
inhibitor or other gastric protective medication may be prescribed if deemed medically necessary 
by th e investigator or sub -investigator.  
7.2. Rescue Treatment(s)  
During the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods, acetaminophen/paracetamol will be the only 
study -provided rescue medication.  In the event that pain relief for OA pain is inadequate, or in 
the event o f other pain (eg, headache) or fever, 1 to 2 tablets/capsules of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken no less than 4 hours apart, as needed, according to local 
standard of care.  The maximum daily dose during the treatment and follow -up periods is 2500  mg 
(500 mg x 5 tablets/capsules) in countries where 500  mg strength tablets/capsules are available, or 
2600  mg (325  mg x 8 tablets/capsules) in countries where 325  mg strength tablets/capsules are 
available (eg, North America).  Where 500  mg strength tablet s/capsules are available, the highest 
individual single dose is 1 gram. Where 325 mg tablets/capsules are available, the highest 
individual single dose is 650  mg.  
In order to prevent severe liver damage, patients should be cautioned to avoid consumption o f 
alcoholic beverages while on acetaminophen/paracetamol. Patients should also be cautioned not 
to take rescue medication at intervals of fewer than 4 hours and to take no more than the maximum 
allowable single dose (1 to 2 tablets/capsules) or maximum all owable total daily dose.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol must not be taken within 24 hours prior to scheduled study visits 
during the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods in order to minimize the confounding effects of 
rescue medication on efficacy assessments. Use of acetaminophen/paracetamol as study -provided 
rescue medication during the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods will be reported daily by patients 
using e -diaries. During the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods, the acetaminophen/paracetamol 
will be so urced by the study sites and dispensed to the patient at each visit where SC study drug is 
administered. Acetaminophen/paracetamol accountability will be conducted at each study visit, 
starting at the baseline visit and continuing through the end of the tr eatment period.   
During the 20 -week follow -up period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will not be provided by the 
sites to the patients.  If acetaminophen/paracetamol is used, dosing instructions will be the same 
as during the treatment period including the max imum allowed daily dose. Use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol will be captured as a concomitant medication.  
7.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.3.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient  is not allowed.  
7.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study drug may be temporarily or permanently discontinued due to medical need, as determined 
by the investigator or the Sponsor and according to the study stopping rules ( Section  5.1.8 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug will be encouraged to remain in the study 
and to complete all study procedures and assessments including completion of the diary, the only 
exceptio n being not receiving study drug (oral and SC) .  Patients must continue to adhere to the 
prohibited medication list as per Section  7.7.1 .  Patients who agree and thus do not withdraw from 
the study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per Table  1. 
Patient s who permane ntly discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete early termination study assessments, per Table  1. 
Patients who discontinue from study drug prior to study completion due to an AA (see 
Section  9.6.1.1 ) should return to the clinic for all remaining stud y visits per the visit schedule.  
In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the treatment or follow -up periods, 
he/she will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return to the study site for a pre -operative 
visit and for follow -up safety evaluations (as described in Section  8.2.3.10 ) 4 and 20  weeks after 
surgery.  Pre -operative imaging (X -ray and MRI) will be obtained and submitted to the 
independent adjudication committee for review to ensure that an AA event is not in occurrence.  
Instructions for the submission process are provided in the study manual.  
7.3.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
As of 17 Aug ust 2020, all patients in the Year 2 Treatment Period must be immediately 
discontinued from study drug, u ndergo all End of Treatment visit assessments, and move directly 
into the 20 -week safety follow -up period.  
Prior to 17 Aug ust 2020, study drug dosing was to be permanently stopped in the event of any of 
the following : 
• A patient who is currently enrolled under an earlier version of this protocol must be 
immediately discontinued from study drug, undergo all end of treatment visit 
assessments, and move directly into the 20 -week safety follow -up period under this 
version of the protocol, if they meet any of t he following conditions that were excluded 
after re -evaluating the safety profile of NSAIDs:  
− They have a known medical history (at any time) of peripheral vascular disease, 
transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, 
unstabl e angina, or documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; or  
− They have a known GFR <30 mL/minute/1.73m2 or, 
− They are currently taking combination therapy of a diuretic with either an ACE 
inhibitor or ARB  (Note: Patients may remain in the study if the y are willing and 
able to change their antihypertensive regimen such that they are no longer on a 
combination of a diuretic with either an angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)  
• A patient who was randomized unde r an earlier version of the protocol to 3  mg Q4W 
or 6 mg Q8W fasinumab

CONFIDENTIAL  7.3.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug may be temporarily discontinued due to medical need, as determined by the 
investigator.  Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo) will be 
temporarily  withheld while awaiting imaging adjudication for worsening joint pain or when 
routine imaging suggests adjudicated arthropathy and prompts the need for additional imaging (see 
Section  9.6.1.1 ), or for patients who are determined to have orthostatic hypotension or determined 
to have new or worsening symptoms suggestive of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction while 
awaiting evaluation by a specialist  (see Section  9.6.1.2 ).  Patients may continue to take naproxen 
or naproxen -matching placebo during this time.  Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or  
fasinumab -matching placebo) should not be re -started until the next study visit unless 
imaging/evaluation results are available within the current visit window.  If oral study drug is 
temporarily discontinued by the investigator, patients may continue to take SC study drug during 
this time.  
7.4. Management of Acute Reactions  
7.4.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use for injections performed at the study site.  All  injection reactions must be 
reported as AEs (as defined in Section  9.3.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in 
Section  9.5.1 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  injection of study drug SC should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to  typical clinical practice.  
7.4.2.  Local Injection Site Reactions  
Local injection site reactions must be reported as AEs and graded according to Section  9.5.1 . 
7.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
At the baseline visit of Year 1, patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to receive fasinumab 
(1 mg SC Q4W, 1 mg SC Q8W), naproxen, or placebo according to a central randomization 
scheme provided by an interacti ve voice response system (IVRS) / interactive web response system 
(IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). Randomization will be 
stratified according to the affected index joint (hip or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3 or 4) at the 
screening visit, and geographical region.  
Prior to Amendment 5 global, patients were randomized 3:3:3:3:1 to receive fasinumab 
(1 mg Q4W, 3  mg Q4W, 6  mg Q8W), naproxen, or placebo.  
Patients participating in Year 2 will receive treatment as described in Sect ion 7.1.  No 
re-randomization will occur at the time of entry into Year 2.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.5.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site pe rsonnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study.  The Regeneron study medical director, study 
monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research organization (CRO) personnel who are in 
regular contact with the study si te will remain blinded to all patient randomization assignments.  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a drug numbering system will be used.  In order to maintain 
the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individu als 
involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody results will not be communicated to the sites before the end of the study, and 
the sponsor operational team will not have access to results associated with patient identification 
until after the final datab ase lock.  
No study personnel involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study will have access to unblinded 
data before the database is locked for this study.  
7.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a me dical emergency 
or any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
If unblinding  is required:  
• Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment  
• Only the affected patient will be unblinded  
• The designated study pharmacis t(s)/designee at the study site will provide the treatment 
assignment to the investigator.  If there is no study pharmacist, the investigator for the 
site will unblind the patient  
• The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the patient  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency.  In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
7.5.3.  Unblinding for Regulatory Reporting Purposes  
Treatment assignments for certain patients may be unblinded to Pharmacovigil ance and Risk 
Management personnel for the purpose of regulatory reporting of suspected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs).  
7.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
7.6.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
A drug numbering system will be used to label blinded  study drug.  Lists linking drug numbers 
with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or companies) responsible for study

drug will be stored at 20°C to 25°C ; storage instructions will be provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.6.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Subcutaneous a nd oral study drugs will be shipped to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study.  At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconci liation and documentation 
by the site monitor, study drug will be destroyed or returned to the sponsor or designee. Refer to 
the pharmacy manual for instructions.  
7.6.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigat or must be able to account for all opened and unopened study drug.  These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study drug that is:  
• dispensed to each patient,  
• returned from each patient (if applicable), or  
• returned to the sponsor or designee.  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by the sponsor and regulatory 
agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.  
7.6.4.  Treatment Compliance  
All study drug compliance records must be kept c urrent and made available for inspection by the 
sponsor and regulatory agency inspectors.  
7.7. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Any treatment administered and/or procedures performed from screening  to the end of the 
follow -up period will be considered con comitant medication and/or procedures, respectively.  This 
includes medications and/or procedures that were started before the study and are ongoing during 
the study.  
7.7.1.  Prohibited Medications  
Patients will be required to discontinue all non -study pain medic ation (oral or topical; except up 
to 150 mg/day of aspirin/5 -aminosalicylic acid [5 -ASA], which is permitted for cardiac 
prophylaxis, per local guidelines ) and opioid analgesic medications, starting at the 
pre-randomization visit and through the Year 1 and  Year 2 treatment periods.  
Opioid analgesic medications (including tramadol) are prohibited during the Year 1 and Year 2 
treatment periods.  Patients will be directed not to take concomitant medications that contain 
NSAIDs (oral or topical, except up to 150 mg/day of aspirin/5 -ASA, which is permitted for cardiac 
prophylaxis) until at least 16  weeks after the last SC study drug injection.  A list of medications

Acetaminophen/paracetamol taken acutely for treatment of non -OA pain is also permitted; 
however, the total daily dosage limits cannot be exceeded, regardless of the reason for 
acetaminophen/paracetamol use.  During the pre -randomization and the Year 1 and Year 2 
treatment periods, acetaminophen/paracetamol use will  be captured in the diary; use for relief of 
pain other than pain due to OA will be reported in the diary as “other”. During the screening and

Study assessments and procedures are presented by study period and visit in Table  1, Table  2 and 
Table  3. 
In light of the public health emergency related to COVID -19, the continuity of clinical study 
conduct and oversight may require implementation  of temporary or alternative 
mechanisms.  Examples of such mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, any of the 
following:   phone contact, virtual visits, telemedicine visits, online meetings, non -invasive remote 
monitoring devices, use of local clin ic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled 
staff.  Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 will 
be granted. All temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures are 
to be documented as being related to COVID -19 and will remain in effect only for the duration of 
the public health emergency.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table  1 (Year 1)  
1. Patients who discontinue study drug before week 52 will be encouraged to follow the visit schedule  
through the remainder of the study.  If a patient chooses to end study participation, he/she will be 
asked to return to the clinic as soon as possible for an early termination visit. Imaging assessments 
need to be repeated if it has been >30 days since th e joints were last imaged. If it has been ≤30 days 
since imaging assessments were completed, imaging assessments may be completed at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
2. HIV and/or hepatitis testing will be performed on a country -by-country basis, according  to local 
guidelines if required by regulatory authorities or ethics boards  
3. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics sub -study.  The 
sample should be collected at the day 1 (baseline/randomization) visit, but may be collected at any 
visit during the study after a patient has been randomized.  
4. At the screening and pre -randomization visits, study staff will review the “Participating in a 
Research Study: What You Need to Know” brochure and the “Reporting Your Pain” brochu re with 
patients to ensure they understand what a clinical study is and how to report their pain accurately. 
At subsequent visits, patients will be asked to review the “Reporting Your Pain” brochure 
themselves.  At any time during the conduct of the study,  patients may require retraining by study 
staff.  
5. Subcutaneous study drug administration will be the last procedure at each dosing visit and will be 
administered after all laboratory, PK, ADA and research samples have been collected and all study 
related activities have been performed. Patients will be observed in the clinic for approximately 1 
hour after SC study drug is administered.  
6. Use of study -provided rescue medication will be recorded daily in patient diaries.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol use will be reported from pre -randomization visit to week  52. 
7. Patients will complete the WOMAC pain subscale for both hips and knees at the screening visit.  
Then, the WOMAC Full Survey will be completed only for the index joint at the subsequent visits.  
8. Walking index  joint pain NRS score will be recorded by the patient each day using their diary, 
starting during the pre -randomization period through week 52. Walking index joint pain NRS score 
will be recorded by the patient at the site at the week 52 visit.  
9. If the puls e is less than 45 bpm, an ECG with rhythm strip will be obtained to confirm the heart 
rate and rhythm.  
10. Blood pressure measurements to assess orthostatic hypotension may be discontinued following 
regulatory approval if the safety database does not reveal an  imbalance for the fasinumab treated 
patients.  
11. If screening radiographs are inconclusive for potential joint related findings, an MRI must be 
performed.  Confirmation from the central reader that there are no exclusionary findings on the 
MRI must be receiv ed before a patient can be randomized.  
12. An MRI will be performed on the index and contralateral joints at screening for all patients.  In 
addition, an MRI will be performed on any knee or hip with a K -L of ≥3.

CONFIDENTIAL  13. Imaging (X -ray and possible MRI) will be perf ormed at the investigator’s discretion on any joint 
with worsening or exacerbation of pain beyond the fluctuations in pain typical for that patient’s 
OA. This imaging will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
14. In the event that a patient m ust undergo JR surgery during the study, the patient must complete the 
pre-operative study visit (early termination assessments, as applicable) and the procedures outlined 
in the schedule of events for JR follow -up (Table  3).  This will include a Knee Society Score 
questionnaire for knee replacements or Harris Hip Score questionnaire for hip replacements.  The 
pre-operative visit must be completed before  the JR surgery. Pre -operative images will be 
submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
15. Samples will be analyzed by the central laboratory and results evaluated by the investigator.  
16. Assessment o f follicle -stimulating hormone ( FSH) and estradiol l evels are only to be performed if 
assessment of postmenopausal status is required (ie, for female patients ≤59  years of age).  
17. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test result, the patient should have a serum pregnancy 
test with a negative result in o rder to continue study drug.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, 
the patient should be withdrawn from study drug and should be asked to return to the clinic for all 
remaining study visits per the visit schedule (see  Section  8.2.3.11 ). 
18. Collection of samples for PK, ADA, high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs-CRP) and research are 
mandatory at the time points specified above.  In addition, PK, ADA, hs -CRP and research samples 
may be drawn at any scheduled visit or unscheduled visit if a patient experiences a treatment -related 
safety TEAE.  Samples should be  collected prior to SC study drug administration on SC study drug 
dosing days.  
19. Research samples should be collected after an overnight (minimum 8 hours) fast.  
20. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics sub -study.  The  
sample should be collected at the baseline visit but may be collected at any subsequent visit during 
the study.   
21. The purpose of this phone contact is to ask the patient if they have had or are scheduled (or on a 
waiting list) to have a JR.  Pre -operative images should be submitted to the central reader for 
adjudication, if available.  
22. If the affected joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted from an MRI.  
23. Patient -reported outcome measures should be completed first at a study visit, prior to any clin ical 
assessments and procedures (eg, blood draws, ECGs, study drug administration).  
24. Patients who end treatment early but agree to follow/continue to attend regular study visits do not 
complete the assessments associated with EOT/week 52 at the time they end treatment.  Instead, 
they complete assessments associated with the study visit they are attending a t the time they end 
treatment early.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.2.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table  2 (Year 2)  
1. Patients who discontinue study drug before week 104 will be encouraged to follow the visit 
schedul e through the remainder of the study.  If a patient chooses to end study participation, he/she 
will be asked to return to the clinic as soon as possible for an early termination visit.  Imaging 
assessments need to be repeated if it has been >30 days since the joints were last imaged.  If it has 
been ≤30 days since imaging assessments were completed, imaging assessments may be completed 
at the discretion of the investigator.  
2. Subcutaneous study drug administration will be the last procedure at each dosing vis it and will be 
administered after all laboratory, PK, ADA, and research samples have been collected and all study -
related activities have been performed.  Patients will be observed in the clinic for approximately 1 
hour after SC study drug is administered.  
3. Use of study -provided rescue medication will be recorded daily in patient diaries.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol use will be reported from pre -randomization visit to week  104. 
4. Patient -reported outcome measures should be completed prior to any clinical assess ments (eg, 
blood draws, ECGs, study drug administration).  
5. The WOMAC Full Survey will be completed for the index joint.  
6. If the pulse is less than 45 bpm, an ECG with rhythm strip will be obtained to confirm the heart 
rate and rhythm.  
7. Blood pressure measurem ents to assess orthostatic hypotension may be discontinued following 
regulatory approval if the safety database does not reveal an imbalance for the fasinumab -treated 
patients.  
8. Imaging (X -ray and possible MRI) will be performed at the investigator’s discre tion on any joint 
with worsening or exacerbation of pain beyond the fluctuations in pain typical for that patient’s 
OA.  This imaging will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
9. In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the  study, the patient must complete the 
pre-operative study visit (early termination assessments, as applicable) and the procedures outlined 
in the schedule of events for JR follow -up (Table  3).  This will include a Knee Society Score 
questionnaire for knee replacements or Harris Hip Score questionnaire for hip replacements.  The 
pre-operative visit must be completed before the JR surgery.  Pre -operative im ages will be 
submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
10. Samples will be analyzed by the central laboratory and results evaluated by the investigator.  
11. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test result, the patient should have a serum pregnancy  
test with a negative result in order to continue study drug.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, 
the patient should be withdrawn from study drug and should be asked to return to the clinic for all 
remaining study visits per the visit schedule (see  Section  8.2.3.11 ). 
12. Collection of samples for PK, ADA, high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), and research are 
mandatory at the time points specified above.  In addition, PK, ADA, hs -CRP, and research samples 
may be drawn at any scheduled visit or unscheduled visit if a patient experiences a treatment -related

dosing days.  
13. Research samples should be collected after an overnight (minimum 8 hours) fast.  
14. The purpose of this pho ne contact is to ask the patient if they have had or are scheduled (or  on a 
waiting list) to have a JR.  Pre -operative images should be submitted to the central reader for 
adjudication, if available.  
15. Patients who end treatment early but agree to follow/con tinue to attend regular study visits do not 
complete the assessments associated with EOT/week 104E at the time they end treatment.  Instead, 
they complete assessments associated with the study visit they are attending at the time they end 
treatment early.  
16. If the affected joint has undergone JR, an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
17. The week 52E Year 2 visit should occur on the same day as the week 52 Year 1 visit, but could 
occur at any time during the visit window.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.3.  Footnotes for Table  3 - Follow -up Period for Patients Undergoing Joint 
Replacement Surgery  
1. All available information for patients who undergo JR surgery must be collected, including 
placement of the prosthesis, healing of the surgical wound and the results of the 
histopathologic examination.  
2. If it is not possible to obtain orthostatic blood pressure following JR then blood pressure 
and pulse should be recorded.  
3. A Knee Society Score questionnaire for knee replacem ents or Harris Hip Score 
questionnaire for hip replacements.  
4. In the event of more than 1 JR, imaging assessments should be repeated if it has been 
>60 days since the joints were last imaged.  If it has been ≤60 days since imaging 
assessments were completed , imaging assessments may be completed at the discretion of 
the investigator.  An MRI may be requested by the imaging vendor after review of the X -
rays.  
5. Imaging will be done at week 4 if not done pre -operatively  
6. Imaging may be performed on any joint follow ing a report of clinically significant 
worsening or exacerbation of pain in that joint.  
8.1.4.  Early Termination Visit  
Patients who are permanently withdrawn from study drug early should be encouraged to continue 
in the study and complete all other study assessme nts without receiving study drug.  If a patient 
decides to completely withdraw consent from the study, every attempt should be made to have the 
patient complete an early termination visit (as outlined in Table  1 or Table  2, as applicable ).  
Imaging assessments need to be repeated if it has been >30 da ys since the joints were last imaged. 
If it has been ≤30 days since imaging assessments were completed, imaging assessments may be 
completed at the discretion of the investigator.  
8.1.5.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study  schedule.  Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
8.2. Study Procedures  
8.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following p rocedures will be performed at the screening visit for the sole purpose of 
determining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline population:

8.2.1.5.  Determination of Osteoarthritis  
Diagnosis of OA of the knee or hip will be based on the American College of Rheumatology 
criteria with radiologic evidence of OA (K-L score ≥2)  
In addition, diagnosis of OA of the hip and knee will use the following criteria:  
Hip 
The American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for  the diagnosis of OA 
of the hip ( Altman  1991 ) should be used to confirm a diagnosis of OA of the hip, as applicable, at 
screening.  The criteria consist of the following combinations:  
• Hip pain, and  
• At least 2 of the following  3 features:  
− Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <20 mm/hour  
− Radiographic femoral or acetabular osteophytes  
− Radiographic joint space narrowing (superior, axial, and/or medial)  
Additional information is provided in the study ref erence manual.  
Knee  
The American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for the diagnosis of OA 
of the knee ( Altman  1986 ) should be used to confirm a diagnosis of OA of the knee,  as applicable, 
at screening.  The criteria consist of the following combinations:  
• Knee pain  
• Osteophytes on radiograph  
• At least 1 of the following 3 features :

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.1.6.  Assessment of Childbearing Potential  
Each female patient should be evaluated for childbearing potential.  
Women will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal, or have 
had a tubal ligation, a bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or complete hysterectomy.  
For women ≥60 years of age, postmenopausal is defined as at least 12 continuous months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea.  In women ≤59 years of age, postmenopausal is defined as at least 
12 continuous months of spontaneous amenorrhea, with serum FSH levels >40  IU/L 
(>40  mIU/mL) and serum estradiol levels <5 ng/dL (<184 pm ol/L)  (Section  8.2.3.11 ). 
8.2.1.7.  Assessment of Peripheral or Central Pain  
Patients will complete a self -reported survey to evaluate the peripheral versus ce ntral nature of 
their pain at time points indicated in Section  8.1. 
A copy of the survey is provided in the study reference manual.  
8.2.1.8.  Instructions fo r Use of Diary  
At the pre -randomization and baseline visits, patients will be instructed on the use of the NRS for 
scoring their walking index joint pain. Patients will be trained on the use of the diary to report their 
walking index joint pain NRS score a nd their daily acetaminophen/paracetamol use for OA and 
other non -OA-related reasons. Retraining should occur as needed throughout the conduct of the 
study.  
8.2.1.9.  Patient Education Brochures  
At the screening and pre -randomization visits, study staff will review the “Participating in a 
Research Study: What You Need to Know” brochure and the “Reporting Your Pain” brochure 
with patients to ensure they understand what a clinical study is and how to report their pain 
accurately. At subsequent visits, patients will be asked to review the ‘Reporting Your Pain’ 
brochure themselves.  At any time during the conduct of the study, patients may require retraining 
by study staff.  
8.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
All the measures in this section are patient -reported outcome measures and sho uld be completed 
before any clinical assessments.  
8.2.2.1.  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  
The WOMAC index is used to assess patients with OA of the hip or knee using 24  parameters, and 
reported using a numerical rating scale.  This index can be used to monitor the course of a disease 
or to determine effectiveness of study drugs.  Patients will complete the WOMAC Full Survey at 
the time points indicated in  Table  1 and Table  2.  If possible, the assessment should be 
administered and entered by the same person throughout the study.  
A copy of WOMAC assessments will be provided in the study reference manual.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.2.2.  Patient Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis  
The Patient Global Assessment of OA is a patient -rated assessment of their current disease state 
on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 = very good ; 2 = good; 3 = fair; 4 = poor; and 5  = very poor).  Patients 
will complete the assessment scale at the time points indicated in Table  1. 
A copy of the assessment is provided in the study reference manual.  
8.2.2.3.  Walking Index Joint Pain Numeric Rating Score  
Walking index joint pain intensity (scored using the NRS) will be reported by the patient each day 
in his or her diary , starting during the pre -randomizatio n period through week  52.  Once initial 
eligibility criteria are confirmed during the screening period, the investigator or designee will 
review the NRS with the patient at the baseline visit.  
A copy of the assessment is provided in the study reference man ual. 
8.2.2.4.  EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level Questionnaire  
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group to 
provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.  The EQ-5D-5L, 
as a measure of healt h-related quality of life, defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  
Each dimension has 5 ordinal levels of severity: “no problems” (1), “slight problems” (2), 
“moderate proble ms” (3), “severe problems” (4), and “unable to” (5). Overall health state is 
defined as a 5 -digit number. Health states defined by the 5 -dimensional classification can be 
converted into corresponding index scores that quantify health status, which ranges f rom <0 for 
states worse than dead to 1 (full health), anchoring dead at 0.  Patients will complete the 
questionnaire at time points indicated in Table  1 and Table  2. 
A copy of the assessment is provided in the study reference manual.  
8.2.2.5.  36-Item Short Form Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Version 2  
The SF -36 version 2 standard is a health status measure with a 4 -week recall period.  The SF -36 
measures eight concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, 
general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, r ole limitations due to emotional problems, 
and general mental health.  Two summary measures of physical and mental health are constructed 
from the eight scales.  Patients will complete the questionnaire at time points indicated in Table  1.  
Higher scores on the scales and summary measures indicate better health status.  
A copy of the assessment is provided in the study reference manual  
8.2.2.6.  Healthcare Resource  Utilization Questionnaire  
The Healthcare Resource Utilization questionnaire is a tool designed to capture, over a preceding 
three -month period, healthcare utilization events that are not collected as part of the safety 
assessments in the current study.  E xamples of these types of events include a patient's use of 
walking aid, emergency room visits, and physician office visits.  Sites will complete the 
questionnaire at time points indicated in Table  1.  The overall healthcare resource use will be

8.2.3.8.  Imaging  
Radiographs of th e large joints (knees, hips, and shoulders) will be taken using a standard approach 
at the time points indicated in Table  1 and Table  2.  An MRI of the index and contralateral joints 
must be performed at screening.  MRIs will also be performed on any hip or knee joint with a K˗L  
score of ≥3.  Radiographs and an MRI  must be performed on any joint following a report of 
clinically significant worsening or exacerbation of pain in that joint.  An X˗ray and an MRI should 
also be performed pre -operatively if a patient is to have a JR du ring the study.  Event based and 
pre-operative images will be submitted for adjudication.  Detailed procedures will be provided in 
a separate manual provided by the central imaging center.  Radiograph or MRI will be sent to a 
central reader, where the imag es will be digitized.  
Radiographs  
Weight -bearing (standing) posterior -anterior radiographs of both knees in the semi -flexed 
position, and anterior -posterior radiographs of both hips and both shoulders, will be conducted at 
these visits.  Additional instruc tions for positioning of joints are provided in the study reference 
manual.  
Radiographs of the knees, hips, and shoulders will be sent to a central reader and evaluated to 
confirm no evidence of AA such as rapidly progressive osteoarthritis type 1 or 2, subchondral 
insufficiency fracture, or osteonecrosis.  
MRI  
During screening, MRIs of the index and contralateral joints as well as joints with a K -L score ≥3 
will be sent to a central reader to confirm that there is no evidence of an exclusionary features.  
Confirmation that there are no exclusionary findings on MRI must be received before a patient can 
be randomized.  An MRI of any joint will be considered if radiographs taken after randomization 
suggest the presence of an abnormal process inconsistent with n ormal progression of OA, as 
determined by the investigator or central reader.  
At the end of study phone contact, patients who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the 
affected joint(s). If the affect joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted fo r an MRI.  
Refer to the supplemental imaging manuals for data collection and management procedures.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.3.9.  End of Study Phone Contact  
An end of study phone contact will be conducted at 52 weeks following the last dose of SC study 
drug. Patients will be asked wheth er they underwent JR surgery following the last in -clinic visit 
of the follow -up period or whether they are scheduled (or on a waiting list) for JR surgery.  Patients 
who had JR surgery will also be asked to submit pre -operative imaging (X -ray and MRI, if 
available) for adjudication. Patients who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the affected 
joint(s). If the affected joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
8.2.3.10.  Procedures to be Performed Only in the Event of a Joint Replacement Sur gery  
In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the treatment or follow -up periods, the 
patient will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return for a pre -operative visit. The 
pre-operative visit should be completed before JR surge ry if possible and pre -operative images 
will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review. Following the JR surgery, the patient 
will complete follow -up safety evaluations at 4 weeks, and 20 weeks after surgery ( Table  3). 
In the event that the pre -operative visit is not performed, standard -of-care pre -operative images of 
the joint with JR must be obtained and submitted to the central imaging vend or's adjudication 
committee for review.   Imaging of all other joints per the pre -operative visit procedures will be 
done post -operatively at the first JR follow -up study visit (4 weeks after surgery) if not done before 
surgery.

expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in an expedited manne r all SAEs that are expected and at least 
reasonably related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IRBs/ECs as appropriate.  
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a study drug, which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not it is considered related to the 
study drug.  
An AE also includ es any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dos e: 
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admis sion to a hospital or an emergency room 
for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a 
hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged 
due to the development of a new AE as de termined by the investigator or treating 
physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above.  
Examples of these include intensi ve treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special i nterest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might w arrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature of the 
event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted (Section  9.4.3 ). 
Adverse events of special interest are described in Section  9.4.3 .  
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the patient completes  the follow -up period, ie, week 72/early termination for those 
patients not proceeding into Year 2, or week 124E/early termination for those patients proceeding 
into Year 2.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
Informatio n on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.6 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Sectio n 9.4.5 . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or design ee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to 
be followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical reco rds and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the follow -up period, 
ie, week 72/early termination for those patients not proceeding into Year 2, or week 124E/early 
termination for those patients proceeding into Year 2, the following will apply:  
• SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of the follow -up period - the SAE will be 
reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
• SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of follow -up period - only 
SAEs deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs will be reported to the 
sponsor.  The inv estigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up information on 
the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
• SAE reported by the patient at the end of the study phone call and deemed by the 
investigator to be  drug related will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should 
make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related 
SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.

of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study dr ug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female  study subject during the study or within 20 
weeks of the last dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting a 
female study subject and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must 
be reported as an SAE.  Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the 
sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:   All AESI, serious and non -serious, must be reported 
within 24 hours of identification using the same reporting process as for SAE 
report ing per Section  9.4.  Monitoring of AESIs is described in Section  9.6.1 .  
Events considered AESIs are:  
• Adjudicated arthropathy (as confirmed by adjudication)  
• Joint replacement surgery (refer to Section  9.6.1.4  for when to report as an AESI)

CONFIDENTIAL  Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should 
be reported as an AE, although it does not mee t any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of la boratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected unti l the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
• Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the pati ent. 
• Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
• Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
defin ite hazard to the subject ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site React ions 
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade:  
• Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of 
erythema or indurati on that does not interfere with activity.  
• Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with ac tivity.  
• Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily 
activity; significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily 
activity; requires ER visit or hospitalization; necrosis or exfoliative der matitis.

9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study pa tient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments 
(eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  Safet y 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.6.1.  Monitoring Adverse Events of Special Interest  
9.6.1.1.  Adjudicated Arthropathy  
Adjudicated arthropathy is an umbrella term that encompasses the following conditions:  
• Rapidly progressive OA type 1 and 2  
• Subchondral insufficiency fractures  
• Primary osteonecrosis  
In addition, AAs will be evaluated to determine if they meet the criteria for destructive arthropathy.  
Potential events of AA will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain 
during the course of the study (eg, by applying adverse experiences, the joint pain questionnaire 
and imaging) as well as scheduled imaging and pre -operative imaging, if a patient requires a joint 
replacement during the study.  
Clinically significant worsening of joint pain during the course of this study is characterized as a 
worsening of pain in any joint that occurs in spite of treatment with analgesics, is in the opinion of 
the investigator inconsistent with the normal progression of OA, and is at least 2 weeks duration 
(or less than 2 weeks if deemed clinically significant at the discretion of the investigator).  
If a patient reports an increase in pain as described above, study d rug administration will be 
withheld while imaging of the affected joint , as well as any additional imaging deemed appropriate 
to understand the cause of the worsening pain, is performed ( Section  8.2.3.8 ).  A decision to 
perform imaging after patient reporting of worsening joint pain will be documented in the 
respective case report form (CRF) page.  Images, along with any other radiographic evaluation,  
will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review ( Section  5.3.2 ).  The investigator may 
consider aspiration of synovial fluid for further  analysis such as cell count and crystal analysis.  
If routine imaging suggests the presence of one of the types of AA, study drug administration will 
be withheld.  Any additional imaging deemed appropriate will be obtained.  The images, along 
with results of any other radiographic evaluation, will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee 
for review ( Section  5.3.2 ). 
If the adjudication does not confir m the presence of AA, according to the adjudication criteria, 
study drug may be restarted.  
Study drug dosing will be terminated for patients with findings that suggest AA, and the patients 
will be referred for orthopedic consultation .  If presence of AA is  confirmed by the adjudication 
committee, the case must be reported as an AESI (Section  9.3.3  and Section  9.4.3 ).  
Any patient whose study drug is discontinued due to an AA should be encouraged to return to the 
clinic for all remaining study visits.   Prior to the scheduled JR, the patient should complete the 
pre-operative study visit (Section  8.2.3.10 ) and, after the JR, should complete the wee k 4 and 
week  20 post -operative study visits ( Table  3).  Pre -operative images, along with any other 
radiographic evaluation will be submitted to the Adju dication Committee for review 
(Section  5.3.2 ). 
Details of data collection for adjudication of events will be provided in the adjudication charter.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.6.1.2.  Sympathetic Nervous System Dysfunction  
Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be monitored throughout the study through physical 
examination, AE reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of Autonomic 
Symptoms ( Section  8.2.3.6 ).  New onset or worsening of signs and symptoms of autonomic 
dysfunction will be evaluated by the investigator.  Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction  will 
only be diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a neurologist and/or 
cardiologist.  
In cases where new or worsening symptoms consistent with sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction are moderate to severe or are clinically s ignificant and do not resolve or return to 
baseline in 2  weeks (or less at the discretion of the investigator), study drug will be withheld and 
the patient will be referred to a specialist.  If the evaluation by the appropriate specialist does not 
suggest sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, study drug may be restarted.  If the specialist’s 
evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunction then study drug will be 
permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI ( Section  9.4.3 ). 
Orthostatic hypotension may be a manifestation of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.  If a 
patient is determined to have orthostatic hypotension, st udy drug should be withheld and the AE 
should be entered in the electronic CRF (eCRF.).  The following procedures should be followed:  
• If the patient is symptomatic and a clinical explanation for orthostatic hypotension is 
identified (such as a new medicati on or dehydration due to exercise or illness or 
excessive heat exposure), study drug will be withheld, and the patient should return to 
the study site for an unscheduled visit in 1 to 10 days for an unscheduled assessment 
of orthostatic hypotension.  
− If the  orthostatic hypotension has resolved, study drug may be restarted.  
− If the orthostatic hypotension has not resolved, then study drug will be withheld, 
and the patient will be referred to a specialist (neurologist or a cardiologist) for 
evaluation of sympat hetic nervous system dysfunction.  
− If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new onset sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction, including symptoms of bradycardia (lightheadedness), orthostatic 
hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of sweating in 
conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the specialist’s evaluation 
identifies an alternative cause, such as initiation of a new medication known to 
cause orthostasis, then study drug may be given at the next visit.  
− If the special ist’s evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, 
then study drug will be permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI 
(Section  9.4.3 ). 
• If the patient has asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension, study drug will be withheld, 
and the patient should return to the study site for an unscheduled visit in 1 to 10 days 
for an unscheduled assessment of orthostatic hypotension.  
− If the unscheduled assessment does not reveal orthostatic hypotension then study 
drug may be continued.

CONFIDENTIAL  − If the unscheduled assessment demonstrates orthostatic hypotension then study 
drug will continue to be withheld until the patient has been evaluated by a s pecialist 
(neurologist or a cardiologist) for evidence of sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction.  
− If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction including symptoms of bradycardia (lightheadedness), orthostatic 
hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of sweating in 
conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the specialist’s evaluation 
identifies an alternative cause such as initiation of a new medication known to cause 
orthostasis, then s tudy drug may be restarted.  
− If the specialist’s evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunction 
then study drug will be permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI 
(Section  9.4.3 ). 
9.6.1.3.  Peripheral Sensory Adverse Events  
Altered peripheral sensation (eg, paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia) is an important identified risk 
with fasinumab (see Investigator’s Brochure) and other anti -NGF  compounds.  Any peripheral 
sensory AE that, per the investigator’s judgment, requires a neurology or other specialty 
consultation must be reported as an AESI.  If any peripheral sensory event persists for 2 months 
the patient must be referred for a neurol ogy or other specialty consultation and the event must be 
reported as an AESI (Section  9.4.3 ). 
9.6.1.4.  Joint Replacement Surgery  
An end of study phone conta ct will be conducted at 52 weeks following the last dose of study drug 
to evaluate the number of patients who have undergone or are scheduled for JR surgery as 
described in Section  8.2.3.9 . Any elective JR surgery planned before completion of the ICF would 
be part of the exclusion criteria and would not be considered an AE.  
After signing of the ICF, report JR surgery as an AESI if the JR surgery is an  elective event that is 
not associated with a new/worsening AE.  
Do not report JR surgery as an AE/AESI if the JR surgery is for the treatment of a new or worsening 
AE. In this case, the new or worsening AE should be the reported AE/AESI term.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporti ng (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN   
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis pla n (SAP) for the study.  The SAP may

analyses.  The final SAP will  be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  1. 
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
There are 29 hypotheses for the primary  and key secondary endpoints.  The primary treatment 
comparison for the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores is declared superior only 
if the comparisons are significant for both WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores.  
The graphical testing procedure ( Bretz  2009 ) will be applied to control for multiplicity and to 
maintain study -wise Type I error rate at two -sided 0.05 level for the two sets of hypotheses (H 1,i, 
i=1,…,16 for fas inumab 1 mg Q4W, and H 2,i, i=1,…,13 for fasinumab 1  mg Q8W) for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints.  If a hypothesis is rejected, the alpha level for that hypothesis will 
be reallocated to other hypothesis according to a pre -specified procedure.  The testing will stop 
when no hypothesis can be rejected at any step.  Details will be provided a priori in the SAP.

10.2. Justification of FAS and mFAS Sample Sizes  
In this study , approximately 2560 patients were to be randomized to fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W 
(840), fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W (600), naproxen (840), or placebo (280) (see Section  5.1.3 ).  This 
sample size was expected to provide adequate power for the comparisons between fasinumab and 
naproxen at week 16 for the WOMAC pain and physical function scores and the PGA score and 
provide long term data for safety assessment.

CONFIDENTIAL  The sample size for the full analysis set (FAS) population was based on results of the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscale scores and the PGA from the R475 -PN-1227 study.  The 
calculation of sample size assumed a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up to 
week 16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52.  Enrollment of 840 patients in the fasinumab 1  mg 
Q4W group and 280 patients in the placebo group would have provided at least 99% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.46 in the WOMAC pain and  physical function subscale scores (ie, an 
absolute treatment difference of 1.1 between fasinumab and placebo and a standard deviation [SD] 
of 2.4 at week 16 and 52 for the FAS).  This sample size would have provided 99% power to detect 
an effect size of 0 .36 in PGA for an absolute treatment difference of 0.4 with an SD of 1.1  at week 
16, and 98% power at week 52 for the FAS.  
For the fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group, the 600 patients in the FAS population were to be compared 
to approximately 200  patients in the pl acebo group who were enrolled after amendment 5 global 
was implemented.  For such comparisons, 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up 
to week 16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week 52 were assumed. Additionally, the effect size for 
such compa risons was assumed to be 80% of the effect size for the comparison between fasinumab 
1 mg Q4W group and the placebo group. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 600 patients in 
the fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group and 200 patients from the placebo group would hav e provided 
97% power to detect an effect size of 0.368 (=0.46*80%) in the WOMAC pain and physical 
function subscale scores at week 16 and 93% power at week 52.  This sample size would have 
provided 84% power to detect an effect size of 0.288 (=0.36*80%) in  PGA at week 16, and 75% 
power at week 52 for the FAS.  
The sample size calculation was also based on previously reported results of the WOMAC pain 
subscale and physical function subscale and the PGA for naproxen (Ekman  2014 ) 
(Schnitzer  2015 ).  Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout  rate up to week  16 
and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52, an enrollment of 840 patients in the fasinumab 1  mg Q4W 
group and the naproxen group would have provided at least 97% power to detect an effect size of 
0.22 in the WOMAC pain subscale (ie, an absolute treatment difference of 0.51 with an SD of 2.3) 
at week 16, and 92% power at week 52 for FAS.  This sample size would have provided 98% 
power to detect an effec t size of 0.24 in WOMAC physical function subscale (ie, absolute 
treatment difference of 0.50 with an SD of 2.1) at week 16, and 96% power at week 52 for FAS.  
This sample size would have provided 87% power to detect an effect size of 0.18 in PGA at week 
16 between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and naproxen for the FAS.  
Due to regional irregularities noted in a parallel phase 3 study that became fully apparent only after 
unblinding that study, and the concern that the same irregularities would be present in data from  
similar sites in this study, the population for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses was 
changed in Protocol Amendment 8 to be based on a modified full analysis set (mFAS) that excludes 
the randomization stratum for that region.  Based on the assum ptions above, it is estimated that 
this mFAS will provide:  
• 99.9% power to detect a significant difference between the 1 mg Q4W group and the 
placebo group in the WOMAC pain and physical function subscales at an alpha level 
of 0.05

10.3. Analysis Sets  
In accordance with guidance from the International Conference of Harmonization of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)  guideline ICH E9 
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ICH, 1998), the following populations of analysis will be 
used for all statistical analysis:  
10.3.1.  Full Analysis Set  
The FAS includes all randomized patients excluding patients affected by the urgent  safety measure 
in May 2018 (ie, patients randomized to the 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W doses) and is based on the 
treatment allocated (as randomized).  Efficacy and patient reported outcome endpoints for Year 1 
will be analyzed using the FAS including patients r andomized to fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, fasinumab 
1 mg Q8W, naproxen and placebo.  For the analyses of fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group comparing to 
the control groups, only patients concurrently randomized (ie, after Protocol R475 -OA-1611 
Amendment 5 Global was implemen ted) will be included.  
10.3.2.  Modified Full Analysis Set  
Due to regional irregularities noted in a parallel phase 3 study that became fully apparent only after 
unblinding that study, and the concern that the same irregularities would be present in data from 
similar sites from the same region in this study, the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will 
be performed on an mFAS.  This  mFAS is comprised of the FAS excluding patients from the 
region of concern (Rest of the World stratum).  Efficacy and patient -reported outcome endpoints 
will be analyzed using the mFAS including patients randomized to fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, 
fasinumab 1  mg Q8W, naproxen, and placebo.  For the analysis of fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group 
comparing to the control groups, only the subset of patien ts concurrently randomized (ie, after 
Protocol R475 -OA-1611 Amendment 5 Global was implemented) will be included.   
10.3.3.  Per-Protocol Set (PPS)  
The per protocol set (PPS) includes all randomized patients from the mFAS who received all 
protocol -required doses du ring the 16 -week treatment period for the week 16 analysis and who do 
not have to be excluded due to relevant protocol violations.  The PPS will be used to perform 
sensitivity analyses for the primary and selected secondary endpoints.  A list of protocol v iolations 
which lead to exclusion from the PPS and corresponding protocol deviation identification number 
(PDID) will be included in the SAP.  For the analysis of fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group comparing 
to the control groups, only patients concurrently randomiz ed (ie, after Protocol R475 -OA-1611 
Amendment 5 Global was implemented) will be included .

CONFIDENTIAL  A PPS using the entire FAS is defined analogously to the above and will be used for performing 
sensitivity analysis on the entire FAS.  
10.3.4.  Safety Analysis Set  
The Year 1 safety analysis set (SAF - Year 1) includes all randomized patients from the FAS who 
received any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treated).  Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables for Year 1 w ill be analyzed using the 
SAF - Year 1 including patients randomized to fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, fasinumab 1 mg Q8W, 
naproxen, and placebo.  
The Year 2 safety analysis set (SAF  - Year 2 ) includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of 
the Year 2 study dru g; it is based on the treatment received during Year 2 (as treated).  Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables for Year 2 will be analyzed using this 
SAF – Year 2.  
10.3.5.  Urgent Safety Measure Set  
The urgent safety measure set (USMS) will include all patients randomized to fasinumab 3 mg 
Q4W or 6 mg Q8W and is based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).  The USMS will be 
utilized for all analyses of data collected from its included patients.  
10.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  
The PK a nalysis set includes all treated patients who had at least 1 non -missing drug concentration 
result following the first dose of study drug.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment 
actually received (as treated).  
10.3.7.  Anti -Drug Antibody Analysis Set  
The ADA analysis set includes all treated patients who received any study drug and had at least 
1 non-missing ADA result following the first dose of study drug.  Patients will be analyzed 
according to the treatment actually received (as treated).  
10.3.8.  The Neu tralizing Antibody Set  
The NAb analysis set includes all patients who received any study drug and who are negative in 
the fasinumab ADA assay or with at least 1 non -missing result in the fasinumab NAb assay 
following the first dose of the study drug. Patie nts who are ADA negative are set to negative in 
the NAb analysis set. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received (as 
treated).

CONFIDENTIAL  • The total number of randomized patients:  received a randomization number  
• The total number of patients in each analysis set  
• The total number of patients who discontinued the study, and the reasons for 
discontinuation  
• A listing of patients treated but not randomized, patients randomized but not treated, 
and patients randomized but not treated as randomized  
• A listing of patients prematurely discontinued from tre atment, along with reasons for 
discontinuation  
10.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline demographic, disease characteristics including medical history , and exposure to study 
drug will be summarized descriptively by treatment group using descriptive  statistics.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized with mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical 
or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each category.  
Details of the statistical methods will be provided in the  SAP.  
10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
10.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using  multiple imputation approach with a 
mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on the mFAS with adjustment for 
missing data due to lack of eff icacy, death or AEs assuming the WOMAC scores would on average 
return to baseline values. A m onotone missing data structure will be achieved using the MCMC 
option of PROC MI. Data collected after discontinuing treatment up to week 16 will not be used 
in th e primary efficacy analysis, but used in a treatment policy sensitivity analysis.  Multiple 
imputation for the remaining data will be based on the monotone missing data structure of the 
change from baseline scores using the regression imputation option in PROC MI.  The missing 
data for patients who discontinued treatment due to other reasons will be imputed under missing -
at-random assumption.  The imputed data for patients discontinued from the study treatment due 
to lack of efficacy, death or AEs will be c entered at the mean baseline value.   
Missing data will be imputed 50 times to generate 50 complete data sets. Each imputed data set 
will be analyzed using the MMRM with terms for baseline score corresponding to the efficacy 
variable being analyzed, random ization strata (K -L category [2 to 3, or 4], index joint [knee, hip], 
and geographical region [North America, Europe]), treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit 
interaction.  The MMRM will be performed using the MIXED procedure in Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) with an unstructured covariance matrix to model the within -patient errors. 
Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Kenward -Roger’s approximation. The 
results from the 50  analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formulae (PROC MIANALY ZE). 
The least -squares mean estimates for the mean change from baseline to week 16, as well as the 
differences of the estimates between fasinumab and placebo, and between fasinumab and 
naproxen, with their corresponding standard errors, p  values and associ ated 95% confidence 
intervals, will be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL  Sensitivity analysis of the treatment policy estimand for the co -primary endpoints will be 
performed using similar analysis method as the primary efficacy analysis including data collected 
after discontinui ng treatment up to week 16.  Sensitivity analysis using a tipping point approach 
with multiple imputation will be performed to assess the robustness of the results due to data that 
may be missing not -at-random (MNAR). After each imputation, a fasinumab pat ient's imputed 
data will subtract  from the imputed score at each corresponding time point.  By progressively 
increasing , the sensitivity analysis will explore the tipping point, ie, the δ value when the p -value 
for a treatment comparison is above 0.05.  Additional analyses will be performed for the primary 
and secondary endpoints using the FAS.  Additional sensitivity anal ysis will be performed for the 
primary and select secondary endpoints using the PPS.  
10.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints at fixed timepoints (ie, week 16 and week 44), the 
analysis method will be the same as that use d for the primary variables. For the analysis of 
secondary endpoints involving the averaging over several visits (see endpoints 12 to 15 in 
Section  4.2.2 ), analysis will be performed using a multiple imputation approach with an ANCOVA 
model based on the mFAS with adjustment for missing data performed in the same manner as was 
done for the primary endpoint.  For analysis of categorical variables in secon dary endpoints, eg, 
proportions of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 16, 
the Cochran Mantel Haenszel approach will be used based on the mFAS, stratifiying by the 
randomization strata (K -L category [2 to 3, or 4], inde x joint [knee, hip], and geographical region 
[North America, Europe]).  Missing data will be considered as non -response.  
For Year 2 analysis, the efficacy and PRO endpoints collected will be summarized descriptively.  
10.4.4.  Safety Analysis  
The summary of safety results will be presented for Year 1, Year 2, and the combined Year 1 and 
Year 2 treatment periods.  
Safety data including TEAEs  and treatment emergent AESIs, vital signs, physical exams, 
laboratory tests, ECGs, and ADA formation will be listed and summari zed by treatment group.  
Thresholds for potentially clinically significant values (PCSVs) in laboratory parameters and vital 
signs will be defined by the sponsor and be in effect at the time of final SAP approval.  
The time interval to detect any AEs, includ ing AESIs (except JRs identified at the End of Study 
Phone Calls)  is between the first dose of Year 1 study drug injection and the end of Follow -up 
Period, (either the week 72/Early Termination for those patients not proceeding into Year 2, the 
week 124E/E arly Termination E for those patients proceeding into Year 2, or the Post -Op Joint 
Replacement Follow -up Visit 2), as well as study drug -related SAEs occurring between the end of 
Follow -up Period and the End of Study.  
For safety variables, the following  observation periods are defined:  
• The Pretreatment Period is defined as the time from signing the ICF to before the first 
dose of study drug in Year 1.  
• The Year 1 On -Treatment Period is defined as the day from first dose of Year 1 study

Potentially clinically significant  value at any post -randomization time point will be summarized 
for each clinical laboratory test.  
Shift tables based on baseline normal/abnormal and other tabular and graphical methods may be 
used to present the results for laboratory tests of interest.  
Listings will be provided with flags indicating the out of laboratory range values.  
10.4.4.3.  Treatment Exposure  
Because of the half -life of the biologic being studied, the duration of SC study drug exposure for 
the Year 1 and Year 2 On -Treatment Periods will be pres ented by treatment group and calculated 
as: 
= (Date of last SC injection of study drug in the respective on -treatment period – date of 
the first SC injection of study drug) + 28  
The number and percentage of patients exposed to SC study drug will be presented by specific 
time intervals for each treatment group for the Year 1 and Year 2 On -Treatment Periods 
respectively.  The time intervals of interest will be specified in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  The total n umber of actual doses of fasinumab will be summarized for the Year 1 and Year 2 
On-Treatment Periods respectively.  
Overall treatment compliance to oral study drug is defined as the total oral dose actually taken 
divided by the expected total oral dose of t reatment during the treatment exposure period for Year 
1 up to treatment discontinuation for Year 1.  It is calculated according to the following formula:

Since the oral study drug for Year 2 is naproxen prn, treatment compliance for oral study drug in 
Year 2 is not applicable and will not be summarized.  
10.4.5.  Analysis of Drug Concentration Data  
Summaries of serum concentrations of functional fasinumab will be presented by nominal time 
point and dose. Plots of individual concentration over t ime will be presented by actual day (linear 
and log scales). Plots of mean or median concentrations of functional fasinumab will be presented 
by nominal day (linear and log scales).  
No formal statistical analysis will be performed.  
10.4.6.  Analysis of Immunogenici ty 
Immunogenicity will be characterized by the ADA response observed:  
• Pre-existing immunoreactivity, defined as a positive ADA assay response at baseline, 
with all post -dose ADA results negative, or a positive assay response at baseline, with 
all post -dose ADA assay responses less than 9 -fold over baseline titer levels  
• Treatment -emergent ADA response, defined as any post -dose positive ADA assay 
response when the baseline results are negative  
• Treatment -boosted ADA response, defined as any post -dose positive ADA assay 
response that is 9 -fold over baseline titer levels when baseline is positive in the ADA 
assay  
• Maximum ADA Titer values  
− Low (titer <1,000)  
− Moderate (1,000≤titer ≤10,000)  
− High (titer >10,000)  
• NAb status - samples testing positive in the ADA assay w ill also be tested in the NAb 
assay and reported as positive or negative.  
Listings of ADA positivity, ADA titers, and NAb positivity presented by patient, time point, and 
dose group will be provided.  Incidence of treatment -emergent ADA will be assessed a s absolute 
occurrence (N) and percent of patients (%), grouped by study cohorts and ADA titer level for each 
of the main 52 -week treatment and long -term safety extension studies respectively.  
The influence of ADAs on drug concentrations will be evaluated.  Assessment of impact of ADAs 
on safety and efficacy may be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.5. Interim Analysis  
The first -step analysis will consist of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses and will be 
conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and all data for Y ear 1 (baseline through 
week 52) have been collected and validated.  This will consist of the analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints at week 16 and/or week 44.  Safety analysis will also be performed 
on the safety data for Year 1 and sele ct safety data for Year 2.  
No alpha adjustment is necessary, as the efficacy analyses for Year 1 will be the final primary and 
secondary efficacy analysis for efficacy and the efficacy analyses for Year 2 will only be 
descriptive and exploratory.  The resu lts of the analysis for Year 1 will not be used to change the 
conduct of the ongoing Year 2 period in any aspect.  
Another analysis will be performed for regulatory purposes on the remaining Year  1 WOMAC 
and PRO assessments and safety data (collected durin g the Year 1 follow -up period) and any Year 
2 efficacy and safety data available at the time of the data cut -off for interim analysis.   
Additional analyses of other efficacy and safety data may be performed for regulatory purposes as 
needed.  
As the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will have been completed in the first -step analysis, 
no adjustments due to multiplicity will be necessary for any subsequent analysis of the data.  
Individuals unblinded to patient -level data for the first -step or any  of the subsequent analyses will 
no longer be involved in the day -to-day conduct of the ongoing study.  Patient -level results will 
not be released to any site -facing personnel or anyone who is directly involved in the conduct of 
the study.   
10.6. Additional Sta tistical Data Handling Conventions  
The following analysis and data conventions will be followed:  
General rules for handling missing data:  
• Rules for handling missing data for efficacy assessments due to missing individual item 
data will follow each questio nnaire’s instrument manual.  
• If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incomplete or missing, it will

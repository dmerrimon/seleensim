3. Greater percentage of subjects in the Oxabact arm than in the placebo arm achieving  
near-normalization of total plasma oxalate  concentration  (< 10 μmol/L) at least twice 
during weeks 24 to 52 of treatment.  
 
 
Methodology:  
This double-blind, randomized  international multi -center study will evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of OC5 in patients  with PH. The study will enrol subjects  with maintained renal function 
but with an eGFR below the lower limit of the normal ranges (<90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and a total 
plasma oxalate concentration ≥ 10 μmol/L.  
During the screening/ baseline period of up to 8 weeks, in total 3 visits will be made. Visit 1 will 
be the screening visit.  Information on historical renal function (including eGFR, serum 
creatinine and equation used to calculate historic eGFR)  and kidney stone events (prior to 
informed consent) will be collected at the screening visit.  For subjects under 18 years of age and 
subjects  that were <18 years up to 3 years prior to screening (i.e. for all subjects under 21 years 
at screening ), height used to calculate historic eGFR will also be collecte d. During the baseline 
period, s amples will be taken for analysis of plasma oxalate, serum creatinine and serum 
cystatine C. Serum will also be analysed for magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, 
glycolate, ALP, bicarbonate, CRP, WBC and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).  
During the baseline period, two echocardiography (Speckle Tracking and trad itional) 
examinations will be done as well as one ultrasound of the kidney . Patient  Quality of Life will 
be evaluated using a questionnaire. Two 24-hour urine samples will be taken for determination of magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, glycolate, urea, creatinine, calcium oxalate 
crystals, pH, osmolality, urinary volume and oxalate excretion and one stool sample will be analysed for number of O. formigenes . The urine and stool samples will be taken at the 
subjects ´s home during the baseline period. Information on stone events and related symptoms 
will be collected during visits 2 and 3 of the baseline period. 
After the baseline period (at visit 3), eligible subjects will be randomized to start on twice daily 
dosing of Oxabact or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified in a first step in an attempt 
to evenly distribute PH type 2/type 3 patients , if the subject  is not PH type 2 or PH type 3, the 
subject  will be stratified for baseline urinary oxalate excretion above or below or equal to 
1.87 mmol/24h/1.73 m2 (based on the mean of the two values from screening/baseline).  
Randomized subjects  will have visits to the clinic at week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52. Plasma 
sample will be collected at week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52. Subjects  will be asked to provide 
24-hour urine collections at week 8, 24, 40 and 52 and faecal samples at weeks 24, 40 and 52. Echocardiography will be performed at week 24 and 48 and ultrasound of the kidney at week 
48. Safety evaluation will include physical examination and safety labs at week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52. Patient  Quality of Life will be evaluated using a questionnaire at week 8, 24, 
40 and 52. After the treatment phase, subjec ts will be followed for safety for 2 weeks or until 
the day before first dose date in the follow-up study OC5- OL-02, whichever occurs first.

 Adverse events and concomitant medication will be monitored throughout the study. 
Information on kidney stone events and related symptoms occurring between signature of the 
informed consent form and the end of study will be captured. In the case of an acute kidney injury (AKI) /kidney stone event occurring close to a scheduled 
visit, the visit will be rescheduled afte r resolution of the AKI/stone event.

Statistical Methods:  
 Sample Size Calculation  
In a previous OxThera study OC3- DB-02, with a total of 11 subjects  (7 on active treatment, 4 
on placebo) having a baseline eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m
2, a mean difference from baseline 
(screening) in total plasma oxalate concentration of - 4.964 (SD=5.219) μmol/L between active treatment versus placebo was observed after 24 week s of treatment. Furthermore, 
OxThera study OC5 -DB-01 showed a mean difference in total plasma oxalate of -5.299 
(SD=3.235) after 8 weeks of treatment in a total of 9 subjects  (7 active, 2 placebo) in subjects 
with baseline eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m
2. 
 Since f or study OC5- DB-02 multiple plasma oxalate measurements will be taken at visits 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, the most appropriate statistical model for the primary endpoint is a mixed effect  repeated measures  model (MRM M). It is expected that at week 52 the difference 
may be larger than what has been observed in the previous study OC5- DB-01 at 8 weeks. 
Therefore, for the calculation a conservative mean difference of -5.50 with SD of 4.00 is 
assumed. Using the MRMM model in a two -sided approach with α=5%, β=10% (and thus 
power=90%), a 1:1 allocation ratio and assuming a within subject  correlation of 0.70, the 
sample size is assessed at 9 subjects  for each group. With this sample size, a difference of -
6.00 with an SD of 4.50 may be considered to be stati stically significant (Oxabact vs. 
Placebo). Considering 18 completers are needed based on this calculation, an estimate of 22 subjects  will be randomized to account for possible drop-outs.

Key secondary endpoint eGFR 
Using  a MRMM model in a two- sided approach with α=5%, and a within subject correlation 
of 0.70, the sample size evaluated at 9 subjects for each group yields approximately 90% 
power to identify a difference (SD) of 4 (3) ml/min/1.73m2 in eGFR change from baseline at 
week 52 between the treatment arms.  
 
Primary Endpoint  
Change from baseline in total plasma oxalate concentration  will be calculated at each visit as 
the visit value minus the mean of the three measurements during baseline. Analysis of total 
plasma oxalate will be considered as the primary analysis. The primary s tatistical analysis 
will be performed using a mixed -effect  repeated -measures model analysis based on the full 
analysis set (FAS)  with a model that includes the following fixed effects: treatment grou p, 
baseline total plasma oxalate value, baseline stratum (PH type 2, PH type 3, not PH type 2 or 
3 and baseline urinary oxalate excretion ≤ 1.87 mmol/24h/1.73 m2, not PH type 2 or 3 and 
baseline urinary oxalate excretion > 1.87 mmol/24h/1.73 m2), week, and week -by-treatment 
interaction. The primary comparison will be between the Week 52 changes from baseline in OC5 and placebo. Unstructured covariance matrix will be used in the model. An autoregressive of order 1 (AR (1)) variance covariance matrix will be used for the within 
subject variation in the MRMM. In case there is a convergence problem, alternative variance 
covariance matrix structures will be used. 
 
Mean total plasma values over time for both treatment groups will be plotted in addition to a 
plot with the data over time presenting one line for each subject . Additionally, and for each 
subject  a plot presenting both total plasma oxalate and eGFR over time will be produced to 
illustrate how total plasma oxalate and eGFR change together.

 A sensitivity analysis will also be performed using multiple imputations (MI) prior to 
applying the MRMM. 
An additional sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis to possible 
deviations from the missing at random (MAR) assumption will be performed. A pattern-
mixture model (PMM) will be used to evaluate the possibility of the missing pattern being missing not at random (MNAR).  
Additional ly, a sec ond analytical method approach will be provided as supportive analyses 
(i.e. ANCOVA and/or AU C) and will be further defined in the SAP. 
Secondarily the same analysis will be produced based on the per protocol analysis (PP) set. 
Key Secondary E ndpoints  
Change from baseline in kidney function (i.e. eGFR  slope ) after 52 weeks of treatment will be 
analysed in the same way as the primary endpoint. Estimated GFR will be calculated for the 
primary analysis based on the 2009 creatinine -based “Schwartz  bedside” equation (for 
children below 18 years of age) and 2009 creatinine- based CKD -EPI equation for adults. 
Historical renal function will be assessed in the context of on -study renal function to 
determine the degree of progression of renal function decline (i.e. the slope) before and 
during the study.   
Kidney stone events after 52 weeks of treatment will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics. Incidence rates and 95% CIs of kidney stone events (defined as the number of 
events divided by the total person-years) will be calculated along with the number of stone 
events and the number of subjects  with a stone event. Treatment groups will be compared . 
Other Endpoints  
• Percent ch ange from baseline in total plasma oxalate concentration after 52 weeks 
of treatment  will be analy zed in the same way as the primary endpoint.  
• Subjects achieving ‘near -normalization’ of total plasma oxalate  concentration ( <10 
µmol/L ) at least twice during weeks 24 to 52 of treatment will be summarized . The 
treatment arms will be compared using the stratified generaliz ed Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test of general association including the appropriate stratification factors. 
Exact 95% CIs will be calculated for each treatment arm, and the common odds 
ratio across strata for the treatment arms.
 Wilson’s score method with continuity 
correction will be used to calculate a 95% CI for the difference in rates.  
• Change from baseline in myocardial function as measured by Speckle Tracking and 
traditional echocardiography will be summarized  descriptively  over time . 
• Change from baseline in free plasma oxalate after 52 weeks of treatment will be 
analysed in the same way as the primary endpoint.  
• Change from baseline in urinary oxalate excretion after 52 weeks of treatment will 
be analysed in the same way as the primary endpoint. 
• Change from baseline in grade of nephrocalcinosis as assessed by ultrasound will 
be summarized .

 • Change in number of O. formigen es in stool  will be based on number of O. 
formigenes  at week 52 compared to baseline in the active group versus placebo . 
• Association  between change in number of O . formigenes  in stool and change in 
total plasma oxalate concentration  will be evaluated .  
• Change from baseline in score of Quality of Life scores as measured by SF36V2 
or CHQ/PF50 questionnaires, depending on age, will be summarized  over time 
and compared descriptively between the two treatment groups  
• Change from baseline in markers for renal  function, renal tubular capacity and 
inflammation:  
Urine : magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, glycolate, creatinine, urea, 
calcium oxalate crystals, pH, osmolality and urinary volume.  
Blood: magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, glycolate,  BUN , ALP, 
bicarbonate, CRP, WBC, creatinine and cystatine C.  
 
Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses for total and free oxalate concentration, eGFR, urine oxalate, stone events, O. formigenes in stool, S peckle Tracking and traditional echocardiography) will be performed 
in the following subgroups of subjects , provided there is sufficient sample size: 
o Subjects  with a baseline urinary oxalate excretion above and equal to or 
below 1.87 mmol/L/24h/1.73 m
2 respectivel y (mean of the two values 
during screening/baseline). 
o Subjects  above or equal to and below 18 years of age at baseline.       
o Subjects  with a baseline eGFR above or equal to and below 60 
ml/min/1.73m2 respectively (mean of the obtained values during 
screening/baseline calculated by the 2009 creatinine- based “Schwartz 
bedside ” equation  for children (below 18 years of age) and the 2009 
creatinine -based CKD -EPI equation for adults). 
o Race.     
o Gender.  
o Progressors and non-progressors based on historic eGFR (i.e. eGFR prior 
to treatment start )  
o Use of v itamin B6  at baseline 
 
Statistical Method Safety:  
The safety will be summarized  using descriptive statistics based on frequency, seriousness, 
relationship and severity of treatment -emergent AEs. Clinically relevant changes in safety 
laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical examinations will also be summarized .

DUCTION 
4.1 Primary Hype roxaluria 
4.1.1 A etiology, C linical F eatures and E pidemiology 
Primary  hyperoxaluria  (PH)  type I, II and III are  rare autosomal  recessive  inborn  errors  of 
glyoxylate  metabolism.  PH type I is caused  by deficient  or absent  activity  o f liver specific 
peroxisomal alanine/glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). In some patients with PH type I , enz yme 
is present but mis -targeted to mitochondria where it is metabolically inactive. PH type II occurs as 
a resul
t of deficient  glyoxylate  reductase- hy droxypyruvate  reductase  (GRHPR)  enzyme  activity. 
Oxal
ate overproduction  in patients  with PH type III is caused  by loss-of-function  of the 
mitochondrial 4‑ hydroxy ‑2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA) enzyme ( Cochat  and Rumsby , 2013) . 
All 
types of PH are characterized by severe hyperoxaluria and hyperoxalemia . Oxal ate cannot be 
metabolized  by human  cells and is eliminated  through  the intestines  and t he kidneys  as an end 
product of metabolism. Oxalate is freely filtered at the glomerulus , reabsorbed in proximal tubules 
and secreted by the distal  tubules.  U rinary  oxalate  excretion  levels  in PH patients  ar e extremely 
high (>1.0 mmol/ day/1.73m2) as compared to normal levels (< 0.5 mmol /da y). Oxalate precipitates 
with
 calcium at µmolar  conc entrations,  and high oxalate  concentration  levels  damage  t he  renal 
parenchymal cells both as free oxalate and as calcium -oxalate crystals  (Cochat and Rumsby , 2013) . 
I
n addition to cal cium -oxalate deposition, chronic hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate crystals are 
associated  with parenchymal  inf lammation and inter stitial  fibrosis  (Cocha t and Rumsby , 2013 ; 
Hoppe et al ., 2009) . 
In PH, marked hyperoxaluria is present from birth. There is however a marked interfamilial as well 
as intrafamilial heterogeneity of disease expression. The individual hepatic oxalate production and 
tim
e for exposure to high oxalate (age) are important factors for progression of the disease (Zhao 
e
t al., 2016). The majority of patients are symptomatic during childhood and i n most cases  before 
10 yea
rs of age. Some patients suffer from the severe infantile oxalosis and reach end -stage  renal 
disease (ESRD) before one year of age. In som e cases, however, the disease may go unrecognized 
until patients reach 30-50 
years of age. Overall, approximately 30% of PH patients have reached 
ESRD by age of 15 ( Rare Kidney Stone Consortium, 2013). Untreated, PH1 leads to death in 
most patients, but even with currently available treatments average life expectancy is shorter than 
in the 
general population ( Cochat et al., 1995; Hoppe et al., 2009; Van der Hoeven et al., 2012).  
PH is an ultra- rare disease with a  prevalence for PH type I of 1-3 per million and an incidence rate 
of a pprox imately 1 per 120 000 births in Europe. PH type I is the most severe and the most common 
va
riant, accounting for 70-80% of all known cases. Available prevalence and incidence rates may 
howe
ver b
e underestimated  because  of the diagnosis  being  delayed  or overlooked  (Cochat  and 
Rumsby , 2013 ). Early  diagnosis,  molecular  subtyping  and prompt  initiation  of conservative 
treatment are of vital importance for PH patients.  
The clinical  hallmark  of the disease  is recurrent  calcium -oxalate  urol ithiasis  and/or 
nephr
ocalcinosis with progressive decline in renal function. PH type 1 p atients with ESR D receive 
dialysis while waiting for com bined liver and kidney transplantation. So far dialysis has not been 
shown  to overcome  the problems  caused by ongoing  oxalate  production  and deposition  at extra-
renal  sites.  Even the most intensified  dialysis  reg imen is not able to cope  with the increas ing 
oxalosis  that often  leads  to multiple  organ  dysfunction  including  ischemic  ulcers  of the skin,

 metabolic bone disease, refractory anaemia, cardiomyopathy and cardiac conduction system 
abnormalities causing severe morbidity and mortality  (Cochat and Rumsby , 2013; Hoppe, 2012).  
PH type 2 is a less severe disease, and these patients reach ESRD later in life, around age 40 -50 
years. PH type 3 is the mildest form of the disease with severe recurrent kidney stones, but as of today no known patients with ESRD. 
4.1.2 Unmet Medical Need 
PH is a seriously debilitating and life -threatening disease with a high unmet medical need. There 
is currently no approved pharmaceutical therapy for PH  available on the market . Eventually the 
only curative therapy for PH type 1 is a combined kidney and liver transplantation at ESRD. For 
type 2 and 3, recurrent kidney transplantation is the only temporary treatment. 
A medical treatment, which  can enhance or contribute to t he removal of oxalate could be of 
immense importance in management of these patients.  
4.2 Oxabact  
The active study drug Oxabact  consists of lyophilized Oxalobacter formigenes  strain HC -1 in an 
enteric- coated capsule for oral administration . Oxabact comprises O. formigenes  derived from a 
human strain HC-1. 
O. formigenes  is a strict anaerobe that relies exclusively on oxalate as a substrate to obtain energy 
for its survival and growth. Three proteins involved in oxalate degradation have been purified, their 
gene s isolated and expressed to understand the physiological significance of this bacterium  
(Stewart et al., 2004). It is currently believed to be the most efficient oxalate degrading enzymatic 
system that operates at neutral pH . O. formigenes  is a part of the normal intestinal flora in humans; 
it is non -pathogenic and has never been isolated systemically as a pathogen. O. formigenes  is also 
hypothesized to interact with the oxalate transporter proteins in the intestinal wall enh ancing the 
transport of oxalate from plasma to the intestinal lumen.  
4.3 Oxabact  Treatment for PH Patients  
Oxalobacter formigenes , given orally, has the potential to modify the course of PH by enhancing 
enteric elimination of oxalate  (transfer of oxalate from plasma to the intestine) , thereby potentially 
mobilizing the oxalate stores and decreasing total body burden and serum levels of oxalate.  This 
then could have significant benefit on the heart, the joints and the kidney, especially on the tubular 
function, as well as other affected organs such as skin, skeleton and eyes. 
Although kidneys are believed to be the principal route for oxalate excretion, considerable 
intestinal excretion of oxalate has been shown in animal models . Colonic secretion of oxalate is an 
extra- renal route for oxalate elimination in rats with hyperoxalemia with or without chronic renal 
failure, which is also a clinical feature seen in patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria  (Hatch and 
Freel , 2005). Administration of the bacteria O. formigenes  is proven to create a trans -epithelial 
gradient for oxalate flux from the blood stream over to the small intestines, to increase degradation 
of oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, thus promoting enteric elimination of oxalate. The bacteria 
have also been shown to actively promote enteric elimination of oxalate through its secretion of a 
signal to epithelial cells to transport oxalate from plasma to intestines in animal models  (Hatch et 
al., 2011)

 Incremental secretion of oxalate into the gut can also be maintained by constantly degrading the 
secreted oxalate with the help of O. formigenes  in the gastrointestinal (GI)  tract. Thus 
O. formigenes  treatment is a potential therapy to promote the removal of endogenously produced 
plasma oxalate by enteric elimination , thereby lowering the body burden of oxalate in PH patients.  
It is also possible,  that O. formigenes , can act to dissolve and remove oxalate deposits in the body. 
By enhancing transport of free oxalate from plasma to the gastrointestinal tract, O. formigenes  can 
shift the equilibrium between solid and free oxalate in plasma and start a dissolution proces s, 
thereby releasing free oxalate from systemic deposits. In the long -term this will reduce systemic 
and tubular deposits in the patients and should result in a significant clinical benefit for all patients 
in all affected organs and tissues.  
4.4 Clinical Experience with Oxabact  
Five clinical studies in PH have been performed with older Oxabact  products (OC2 and OC3):  two 
phase I/II studies and two phase II/III studies, plus an open- label extension study following the first 
phase II/III study,  see Table 3.  
In addition, a recent placebo -controlled, double blind randomized Phase I/II study (OC5 -DB-01: 
EudraCT No. 2012-005606- 22) has been performed with the new OC5 product in 8 clinical sites 
in Europe. This study enrolled 28 PH patients with maintained renal function and evaluated the efficacy and safety of Oxabact OC5 to reduce urinary oxalate and plasma oxalate in patients  with 
PH. OC5 -DB-01 started in December 2013 and the study ended in Jan 2015.  
An open-label phase II study with OC5 (OC5- OL-01, EudraCT No. 2013- 004368-74) to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of Oxabact  (OC5) to reduce plasma oxalate levels in patients who are on 
dialysis  was completed in January 2020, see further Table 3.

 4.4.1 Clinical Experience in PH Patients  
 
4.4.1.1 CTIx.002 
The first phase I/II study (CTIx.0002) was conducted in 9 subjects using a frozen cell paste 
formulatio n of O. formigenes  (OC2 ). Subjects  were given two doses of OC2 per day for four 
weeks. Six subjects  with serum creatinine <1 mg/dL (inclusion criteria) and three PH I patients  
in ESRD who were undergoing dialysis were included in this study ( Hoppe et al ., 2006). 
This study showed that NLT 1E+10 CFU administered twice a day for 4 weeks resulted in a 20% (range 6 -43%) reduction in 24- hour urinary oxalate excretion in six subjects  with 
measureable urine (p=0.0313, Wilcoxon rank- sum test). Overall, the median reduction in 
plasma oxalate levels was 47% (p=0.0195). The decrease in plasma oxalate was substantial (>30 μmol/L) in 2 of the 3 subjects  with end- stage renal disease. OC2 treatment was well 
tolerated in all subject s in the study. 
Figure 1 shows the c hange in plasma oxalate in the  subjects  in ESRD . Pre -dialysis plasma 
oxalate measurements were made once a week. A substantial decrease in plasma oxalate was observed in two of the  subjects  in ESRD and no safety concerns were observed ( Hoppe et al., 
2006).
 In one of the subjects (Female 21 years on HD) the treatment was prolonged to 5 weeks 
since the therapeutic effect was quite significant and this subject  also reported amelioration of 
clinical symptoms under therapy with less pain due to oxalate osteopathy.

 4.4.1.2 CTIx.002 Amendments 2 and 3 
The second phase I/II study was a single arm, single centre study conducted under an 
amendment of the same protocol (CTIx.002 A2- 3) and enrolled 9 subjects . In this study, O. 
formigenes  was lyophilized  and administered as an enteric- coated capsule (OC3a active 
ingredient). The dose was NLT 1E+07 CFU given twice a day for 4 weeks. In eight subjects 
with measureable urine, there was a reduction in 24 -hour urinary oxalate excretion by a median 
58% (p =0.0078, Wilcoxon rank- sum test), ranging from 4% to 95%. Plasma oxalate decreased 
overall by a median 26% and the reduction ranged from 22% to 84% in 6 of these subjects . 
The plasma oxalate decreased by 26 μmol/L in the subjects  with end- stage renal disease. OC3a 
treatment was well tolerated.  
4.4.1.3 OC3 -DB-01 
Based upon results from the phase I/II studies, OxThera transferred and scaled up the manufacturing of OC3 (OC3b active ingredient). The third study was a phase II/III randomized, 
double blind, placebo- controlled study that investigated the safety and efficacy of lyophilized 
O. formigenes  administered as an enteric- coated capsule. In contrast to the preceding single 
center studies, this study was conducted at 9 sites in France, the Netherlands, United Ki ngdom, 
Germany, and the United States. Of the 42 subjects enrolled, 19 were randomized  to receive 
NLT 1E+07 CFU OC3b and 23 to placebo. Study drug was administered twice daily for 24 weeks. It should be noted that this study was the first large internation al study to evaluate a 
new therapy in subjects with PH in a randomized and placebo -controlled fashion.  
Analysis of the prospectively defined primary endpoint change in urinary oxalate excretion 
showed no difference between the OC3b and placebo treatment groups on percentage change from baseline to Week 24 in urinary oxalate  excretion . No treatment effect was seen in analyses 
of secondary endpoints.  
In an attempt to understand the lack of treatment effect in this larger study, an independent 
expert committee of clinicians was tasked to review the adequacy of the 24 -hour urine data. 
They determined that despite the detailed instructions provided to the  sites, the sites varied in 
quality of the urine collection, handling and shipping. Also, some subjects  had a large amount 
of variability in their 24 -hour urinary creatinine measurements across collections in the study 
indicating poor compliance. After the  data review, the expert committee established stricter 
eligibility criteria for valid urine samples, and developed rules for post hoc analyses.  
Results from the post hoc analyses showed that the mean percentage change in urinary oxalate 
to creatinine ratio (mmol/mol) was -21% (SD=23%) in subjects  given OC3b and -7% 
(SD=21%) in placebo, a difference of -14% (p=0.056, Student’s t -test). Analysis of data from 
the two largest sites (n=20), showed a mean percentage change of -37% (SD=17%) from  
baseline in subjects  treated with OC3b and -9% (SD=22%) in subjects  treated with placebo, 
corresponding to a difference of -28% (p=0.006). These two sites were also the most 
experienced in the conduct of clinical studies in this patient  group.  
OC3b was s afe and well tolerated with a similar distribution of adverse events (AE) in the 
active treatment and placebo groups. The most commonly reported individual AE were headache, nausea and vomiting. 
4.4.1.4 OC3 -OL-01 
This was an open- label extension, single -arm, 6 -month study evaluating the safety of OC3b 
with long term exposure in subjects  who had completed participation in the double -blind, 
placebo -controlled efficacy study (OC3- DB-01). Subjects  with less than 20% re duction in

 urinary oxalate levels at week 12 compared to time of screening in the OC3 -DB-01 study (i.e., 
at entry into the qualifying study OC3 -DB-01) were withdrawn from the study. 
A greater proportion of subjects  who received placebo in the OC3- DB-01 study [13 (65.0%)] 
experienced a stone event (renal stones and/or signs and symptoms of renal stones) compared 
with those who had received OC3b [5 (31.3%)]. The mean incidence of stone events, adjusted for a 48 -week study period, was 0.46 (SD: 0.89) and 0.84 (SD: 1.00) in subjects  who had 
previously received treatment with OC3 or placebo respectively. The validity of these differences should however be considered due to the inherent difficulties in defining a “new” stone event in this subject population, the r elatively short follow -up time and varying time of 
exposure to study drug. 
Overall, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not change during the study. Similar 
results were seen in subjects  with Stage II and Stage III chronic kidney disease. Changes in 
this parameter were not expected during this relatively short follow-up. 
Overall, there were no clinically relevant changes in free plasma oxalate during the study. 
The majority of subjects  [24 (85.7%) subjects ] did not show a ≥20% reduction in urina ry 
oxalate to creatinine ratio during this open- label (OL) study (i.e. did not meet responder 
criteria). Among the seven subjects  that were given OC3 for 48 weeks (DB and OL study 
combined) the mean reduction in urinary oxalate was 24%. At the end of study, 2 of these 
subjects  were non -responders and 5 remained responders. The corresponding reduction in 
urinary oxalate among the seven subjects , who received placebo for 24 weeks during the DB 
study followed by 24 weeks of OC3b treatment in this OL study, was  23%; however, the 
reduction during the preceding 24 weeks of placebo treatment was 19% for this subgroup of subjects . Three of these subjects  had an additional reduction of ≥20% during the OL study 
alone.  
Overall, OC3b was safe and well tolerated in the OL extension study with no unexpected safety issues raised and the adverse events reported were essentially evenly distributed between subjects  who had previously received OC3 treatment compared with those w ho had received 
placebo in terms of severity, seriousness and relationship. 
4.4.1.5 OC3 -DB-02 
In phase II/III OC3 -DB-02 the study medication was administered as OC3b lyophilized powder 
suspended in water together with a bicarbonate buffer (OC3b buffer), and admini stered 
concomitantly with 10- 20 mg esomeprazole (Nexium granules) taken with water once daily. 
The reason for using a buffer formulation was to increase the dose administrated, to have an 
earlier release of the bacteria in the GI tract, and to reduce the time to recovery of lyophilized 
bacteria.  
The primary efficacy analysis showed no reduction in urinary oxalate excretion following 
treatment with OC3 for 24 weeks compared to placebo. Both treatments showed a slight decrease in the urinary oxalate compared  to baseline. The reduction of the urinary oxalate was 
analyzed in several subsets of subjects , including subject populations based on disease 
characteristics, age and region. Decreases in urine oxalate were seen in the OC3b group as well as in the placebo  group. A significant treatment difference in favor of OC3b treatment was not 
found. OC3b treatment showed no effect on the overall proportion of responders following 24 weeks of treatment. The percentage responders in the OC3 and placebo group was 25% (5/20) and 42% (5/12), respectively.

 Overall, the day -to-day variability of urinary oxalate and creatinine measurements was much 
improved in this study as compared to OC3- DB-01. Results were basically similar when 
looking at oxalate per creatinine ratio or o xalate 24 -hour excretion, which indicates that the 
24-hour collections were of good quality. In addition to implementing urine acceptance criteria, 
the instructions to subjects  and study personnel were much improved in this study. 
OC3 treatment did not result in a clinically significant reduction of the plasma oxalate levels , 
although the active group had a decrease in plasma oxalate concentration of -12% whereas the 
placebo group had an increase of 7%.   
OC3b was safe and well tolerated with an AE profile similar to the placebo. AE were most 
frequently reported in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AE were infections and 
gastrointestinal disorders. The majority of AE s were of mild or moderate intensity and 
considered by the investigator to be not related to the OC3 treatment. Overall, treatment with OC3 was safe and well tolerated.  
4.4.1.6 Phase I/II Study of OC5 (OC5- DB-01) 
The OC5 -DB-01 study was a double -blind, randomized , placebo -controlled, multi -centre study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Oxabact OC5 in PH patients  with maintained renal 
function (i.e. eGFR or a creatinine clearance of ≥ 40 mL/min normalized  to 1.73m
2 body 
surface area).  The subjects were randomized to treatment with Oxabact or placebo, and were 
administered one capsule twic e a day for 8 - 10 weeks. Each dose of Oxabact corresponded to 
not less than 109 CFU O. formigenes  and not less than 100 mmol/19 h of oxalate degrading 
capacit y. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Oxabact drug 
product to reduce urinary oxalate excretion following 8 - 10 weeks of treatment.  
In total, 44 subjects from 8 sites in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom were screened 
for inclusion in the study. 28 of these were randomized; 14 were randomized to receive Oxabact 
and 14 randomized to receive placebo. All 28  subjects  fulfilled the FAS and Safety set criteria, 
received the treatment and completed the study.  
The primary analysis for the OC5 -DB-01 study did not identify a statistically significant 
difference between the OC5 treatment and placebo in terms of its effect on urinary oxalate 
excretion. After 8 weeks’ treatment, the change in urinary oxalate excretion appeared s lightly 
higher (0.182 mmol/24 h/1.73 m2) in the OC5 group than in the placebo group; this difference 
did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.22). OC5 treatment did lead to a statistically significant increase in the number of O. formigenes  cells in the faeces of subjects  compared 
with placebo (p=0.00023). In all other secondary and exploratory endpoints, no significant differences were observed between OC5 and placebo.  
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint based on baseline urinary oxalate excret ion, 
baseline eGFR, age or concomitant use of vitamin B6 therapy did not reveal any statistically 
significant differences between the treatment groups, but the magnitude of the least square difference between OC5 and placebo was larger in the eGFR<90 ml/min/ 1.73 m
2 subgroup 
than in the eGFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (0.356 vs 0.040 mmol/24  h/1.73 m2) and larger 
in the subgroup of subjects aged 18 years or older than in the subgroup of subjects  younger 
than 18 years (0.480 vs 0.039 mmol/24  h/1.73 m2). A Forest plot of difference in change in 
urinary oxalate excretion from baseline to Week 8 of treatment in different subgroups is shown in the figure below ( Figure 2).

Despite a stratification of the two treatment groups for urinary oxalate excretion (below  or 
equal to /above 1.5 mmol/24  h/1.73 m2), the subjects in the OC5 group had a more pronounced 
reduction in renal function than the placebo subjects  at baseline. Mean baseline eGFR was 
lower in the OC5 group than in the placebo group (97.5±38.7 versus 123.1±45.4  
mL/min/1.73 m2), and renal and urinary disorders were more common in the OC5 group 
(11 cases versus eight cases). M ost notably, four subjects  in the OC5 group had a history of 
chronic renal failure, whereas no subjects in the placebo group had been affected by this 
condition.   
There was a negative correlation between plasma oxalate and eGFR in the full population at 
baseline (r = -0.508, p< 0.007) indicating that plasma oxalate concentration gradually increases 
with a decreasing kidney function in PH patients .  
In light of the observed difference in renal function between the two groups, ad hoc analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between efficacy parameters and indicators of 
renal health.  
An analysis of the change in urinary oxalate excretion per urinary creatinine excretion showed 
a small (+5.4 mg oxalate/g creatinine), but statistically significan t increase of oxalate excretion

 Significant correlations were observed between renal function and the effect of OC5 treatment 
on urinary oxalate concentration. Overall, the OC5- induced increase in urinary oxalate 
excretion was larger in subjects  with reduced renal function. The analyses also demonstrated 
that plasma oxalate concentration decreased as the number of O. formigenes increased in the 
OC5 treated subjects , p=0.04 (at study week 10) . 
These findings  suggest  that the bacteria metabolise free oxalate that originates from plasma, 
thereby supporting that enteric elimination of oxalate has occurred.  
It is hypothesized that this reduction in free plasma oxalate shifts  the endogenous equilibrium 
between free plasma oxalate, plasma protein -associated  oxalate and tissue -deposited oxalate 
and forces a dissolution of oxalate deposits in plasma -proteins, vessels  and kidneys  which in 
turn leads to increased excretion of urinary oxalate. An analogous relationship between plasma 
urate levels and solid urate dissolution has been observed in patients with gout, where a 
reduction of serum uric acid to normal levels resulted in disappearance of urate crystals from 
synovial fluid ( Pascual and Sivera , 2007) . Because oxalate deposits are expected to be more 
pronounced in patients  with reduced renal function, this hypothesis also explains why the effect 
of OC5 treatment was greater in subjects  with more advanced kidney disease. The study also 
showed a  statistically significant decrease in urine output in the OC5 -treated subjects  which  
also suggest that O. formigenes  confers some beneficial effect on water reabsorption and urine 
concentrating -ability in the renal tubules of these subjects . 
4.4.1.7 Phase II Study of OC5 (OC5- OL-01) 
The OC5 -OL-01 study was a phase 2, open- label, multi- centre study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of Oxabact OC5 to reduce plasma oxalate in patients  with primary hyperoxaluria 
who are on dialysis. Subjects  were treated for 6 weeks with study drug, with 4 weeks of baseline 
measurements prior to initiation of study medication and 4 weeks of measurement after drug 
administration. In Germany , the protocol was amended to allow a 36-month treatment period 
after the first 14 weeks of the study  and in France a 12-month treatment period was approved. 
The study started in May 2014 and ended in January 2020. 
Fourteen subjects were screened and 12 subjects  were enrolled in the study and received study 
drug. Eight subjects  entered t he continued phase of the study . Six subjects completed 12 
months of treatment, 5 subjects completed 24 months of treatment and 3 subjects  completed 
36 months of treatment. A Mixed -effect Repeated Measures Model (MRMM) analysis  showed 
a statistically significant decline in total plasma oxalate through time. Results of traditional and 
Speckle- Tracking echocardiography (STE) indicated that cardiac function substantially 
improved in 2 subjects  who had impaired cardiac function at baseline, was stable within the 
normal range in the other subjects , and did not deteriorate in any subjects . Importantly, these 
observations occurred in the absence of clinically significant changes to the dialysis regimen. The safety profile was overall favourable, even in this severely ill study population.     
4.4.1.8 Compassionate U se 
Oxabact has also been evaluated during compassionate use in two 11-month- old girls with 
infantile oxalosis and ESRD  (see Figure 3 and Figure 4). T hey received OC3b (administered 
via a gastrostomy tube) twice a day up to 4 weeks during two treatment periods. Dialysis 
regimens were unchanged. Plasma oxalate levels decreased from >110 μmol/L before to 
72 μmol/L following treatment in patient 1 , and from >90 to 69 μmol/L (first treatment period) 
and to 50 μmol/L (second t reatment period) in patient 2  (Hoppe et al ., 2011).

Compassionate use of OC3b (broken capsules, 137- 276 mg, mixed with phosphate buffer, 
reconstituted with 50 -100 mL water and administered via gastric tube) twice a day up to 8 
weeks have been evaluated in two other patients  with infantile oxalosis at two other sites in the 
United States and the United Kingdom, without any reduction in plasma oxalate (unpublished 
data).  It has recently been concluded that the buffer used for administration of drug was sub-
optimal for survival of O. formigenes. 
OC3b and OC3 buffer were well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported during 
compassionate use.  
OC5 has been provided under named patient use to a female patient  with infantile oxalosis in 
Germany. She developed chronic kidney disease shortly after birth and was treated with daily

December 2017, w hen the child was 3 months old and c ontinued for 22 months, until 2 weeks 
after the patient  had undergone  a successful  combined  liver-kidney  transplantation.  Plasma 
oxalate was approximately 130 μmol/L at initiation of OC5 treatment, and overall a 35 % was 
seen (to around  80 μmol/L) after  16 months  of treatment.  Nephrocalcinosis  and macular  oxalate 
deposits did not deteriorate, and the disease progression was slowed down during the treatment 
period. The OC5 treatment was well -tolerated and no related adverse  events were reported.

Pape et al.; 2020). 
4.5 R
ationale for Current Phase  III Study 
4.5.1 Ove ral l Objective  
The overall  objective  of this study  is to evaluate  the efficacy  of long- term treatment with 
Oxabact  in PH  patients  with maintained  kidney  function but  with an eGFR  below  normal 
ranges (<90 ml/min/1.73 m2) at baseline  and a total plasma oxalate concentratio n ≥ 10 μmol/L. 
A comprehensive  review  of the data  from  the completed OC5-DB -01 study  revealed a clear 
difference between the OC5 and placebo groups, including some significant effects in kidney 
function for OC5 treated subjects . The study findings suggest that, as a result of O. formigenes 
metabolising GI oxalate and enhancing transport of plasma oxalate into the GI tract, systemic 
oxalate  deposits  in the body  start to dissolve  in the  OC5  treated  subjects . The O. formigenes 
mediated enteric  elimination process  would  then shift the equilibrium  between  crystallized  
and/or protein- associated oxalate and free oxalate towards the free oxalate in plasma, thereby 
releasing  free oxalate  from plasma  proteins  and from systemic  deposits  in the  body. 
Furthermore, a recent  publication  (Sivaguru  et al, 2018)  demonstrated that  calcium  oxalate 
stones undergo multiple events of dissolution as they crystallise and grow  within the kidney. 
Contrar y to the perception  that calcium  oxalate  stone s do not  dissolve,  these  findings  would 
support the hypothesis of in vivo  oxalate stone dissolution. 
When treated with Oxalobacter  formigenes , subjects  are expected to gradually deplete systemic 
oxalate deposits over time. The treatment duration needed for plasma oxalate levels to start to 
decrease w ould then depend on the amount of deposits a t baseline for e ach individual s ubject . 
It is expected that 52 weeks treatment would be needed to see a treatment effect in this patient 
population.  
In blood, a large portion of the plasma oxalate is associated to proteins and a number of proteins 
such as albumin  have  been  shown  to interact  with calcium  oxalate  during  crystal  formation 
(Hatch et al., 1977; A ggarwal  et al., 2013) . The  intricate  interplay  between biological 
molecules and calcium oxalate crystals is an emerging  research field, and may play  a role in 
tissue deposit formation in blood vessels, in the heart and in the kidneys.  
Available s tudy res ults from earlier Oxabact  studies obtained to date a lso d emonstrate that the 
patient population is extremely heterogeneous with subjects exhibiting high variability in their 
baseline characteristics  and their  stage  of disease  progression. Data  shows  that while kidney 
function is deteriorating in the subjects , plasma oxalate concentration and deposits in various 
organs  are building  up proportionally.  In the recent  OC5- DB-01 study  there  was a negative 
correlation between  plasma  oxalate  and eGFR  in the full  population  at baseline (r = -0.508, 
p< 0.007) .  
In the previous double- blind multicentre study OC3- DB-02, there was a statistically significant 
difference  in change in plasma  oxalate  between treated and placebo subjects  in the group  of 
subjects w ith a ba seline  eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m2 after 24 weeks of treatment with OC3.

 The rationale for this study is, based on these findings, to prove that with a longer treatment 
time with the new, more potent OC5 product, there is a decrease in plasma oxalate 
concen tration and calcium oxalate deposits over time in treated subjects . This outcome would 
prove the hypothesis that Oxabact is eliminating plasma oxalate via enteric elimination into the gut and is providing a clinical benefit by dissolution of calcium oxalat e crystals.   
4.5.2 OC5  Development  
OxThera has made significant improvements in the Oxabact formulation to develop the new 
OC5 product. 
Process development has resulted in improvements of the culture conditions, cell harvesting 
procedures and optimization of ex cipients used for the freeze- drying process to develop the 
new highly concentrated product OC5.  As compared to OC3b, the OC5 product has hundred-
fold higher concentration of viable cells and these cells show a significantly higher recovery 
rate than OC3b.  
OC5 is derived from the same cGMP Master Cell Bank as the earlier product. However, the 
cell bank has been sub -cloned to meet stringent requirements with regard to viable cell count 
and oxalate degrading activity. Furthermore, culture conditions and harv est criteria in the 
fermentation process have been refined such that the cells are harvested at exponential phase rather than at the stationary phase. Together with optimized  excipients and relative amounts of 
these and cells, the product is now also bette r protected in the lyophilization  process. A higher 
number of viable cells recover from OC5 lyophilized  powder than what was previously 
obtained from OC3b. 
In addition, product -related analytical methods have been refined since the previous production 
process. The viable cell count assay (CFU/g) has been improved to show the number of viable 
cells faster than previously. The oxalate degrading activity assay (moles oxalate degraded/g or 
CFU at 19h) has also been improved to measure activity at the recovered stage. One OC5 
capsule contains not less than 10
9 CFU and has the capacity to degrade not less than 100 mmol  
oxalate/capsule at 19h. 
The higher concentratio n of viable cells and higher oxalate degrading activity in OC5 allows 
for use of less lyophilized powder per dose. Thus, a smaller capsule, size 4 instead of size 2, is 
used for the OC5 product.  
OC5 is formulated as enteric- coated capsules designed to protect the O. formigenes  bacteria 
from gastric juice  and to deliver the active ingredient to its natural habitat and site of action, 
the small intestines. The disintegration time for the coated OC5 capsules is shortened in 
comparison to the OC3b  capsules  to better mimic the disintegration profile of a previous 
version of the product, OC3a capsules .  
As can be seen in Figure 5, the OC5 material begins replicating much quicker than does the 
OC3b material.   Hence, the new product show s superior activity. In essence, with an improved 
cell bank, improved harvesting technique and improved freeze- drying method, the quality of 
the product has been greatly improved.

 Figure 5: Oxalate Degrading A ctivity of OC5 Compared to OC3 
 
4.5.3 Dose Justification  
Based on toxicity studies it is within the NOAEL to administer up to 9 x 1011 CFU of OC5 
twice daily to human subjects. The OC5 -DB-02 study will administer a 109 CFU twice daily 
dose to all subjects . 
The oxalate degrading capacity  of Oxabact is limited by the availability of endogenous oxalate. 
The typical daily production of endogenous oxalate is 4–7 mmol/1.73m2 in PH 1 patients. The 
optimal (i.e. in vitro ) oxalate degrading capacity of the OC5 Oxabact capsules according to 
drug product specifications is approximately 15- 25 times higher than the daily endogenous 
production of oxalate in PH patients (i.e. ≥100 mmol/capsule/19h). However, the amount of 
available oxalate cannot support this capacity . Since endogenous oxalate is limited, no safety 
concerns or difference in safety is anticipated with varying oxalate degrading capacity.  
It is necessary to provide an exaggerated dose of Oxabact to ensure continuous delivery of 
sufficient viable O. formigenes  to the relevant par t of the gastrointestinal tract. The bacteria 
need to survive transit through the stomach and upper small intestine and withstand the dilution 
effect from the normal gut microbiota. It is a competitive environment particularly given that 
O. formigenes  are anaerobic and utilise only oxalate as an energy source.  The dosing strategy 
supports the use of the same dose across age groups.

 4.6 Overall Risk and Benefit A ssessment  
4.6.1 Burden  
Subjects  will attend clinical visits at ten times throughout the study. This will involve time 
travelling to the hospital and the time required to see the investigator/study nurse. Blood 
samples will be collected during the clinical visits for safety laboratory evaluations and for 
plasma oxalate analysis . Approximately 20 mL of blood will be needed for the safety lab 
sample and approximately 5 mL for the plasma oxalate sample. Echocardiography will be 
performed four times during the study. Subject s will have a n ultrasound of the kidneys taken 
two times during the study.  
Study medication will be administrated orally with breakfast and dinner as one capsule two 
times per day, for 52 weeks. The capsule size is quite small (size 4) and should be relatively 
easy to swallow even for younger subjects. The subjects will be asked to  record the intake of 
the first and last dose of study drug in a diary. 
Subjects  are requested to provide four faecal samples and s ix 24-hour urine samples during the 
study. Faecal and urine samples will be collected at subject s’ homes, a designated courier will 
pickup collections at times agreed with the subjects even during weekends if requested. 
Samples will be sent from the subject´s home directly to the central lab.  
4.6.2 Risk Threshold  
Detailed information on the anticipated adverse events of the OC5 -DB-02 study is outlined in 
Section  11.5. In brief these potential risks may include: 
• Displacement of indigenous O. formigenes  or changes in the normal gut microbiota 
• Infection risks 
• Elevated plasma formate  
• Gastrointestinal symptoms  
While the potential for these risks do es exist, non- clinical and clinical data to date has not 
indicated that the Oxabact product is associated with any changes in the gut microbiota, local 
or systemic infection or elevated plasma formate levels. Previous  studies with OC3 (OC3 -DB-
01, OC3 -DB-02) have also found that the OC3 product was safe and well tolerated with an 
adverse event profile similar to the placebo, even for gastrointestinal symptoms. While the 
OC5 product is more concentrated than the OC3 product, the safety profile has been shown to 
remain favourable, as supported by the pre -clinical and clinical studies to date.  
The bridging toxicology study  (DP-1002) , which included 28 consecutive days of twice daily 
oral administration by capsule of OC3 at  2 x 2E+08 CFU/day or OC5 at 2 x 9E+09 CFU/day 
to male and female rats was well tolerated with no test article -related changes or differences 
being noted between the two product formulations. The safety profile for OC5 was comparable to OC3, i.e. no changes observed on clinical observation, laboratory parameters, or 
histopathology considered specific to the treatment with OC5. 
Data collected to date for the completed OC5 -DB-01 study and the current OC5- OL-01 study 
indicate that the OC5 product is safe and w ell tolerated. No related severe or serious adverse 
events have been reported so far in these ongoing studies  for Oxabact, see Section  11.5. 
Analys is of potential change in microbiota due to treatment with OC5 during the OC5 -DB-01 
study showed that no change in the microbiota could be detected during treatment with OC5.   
Overall , the safety data accrued to date would suggest that the OC5 drug product is safe and 
well tolerated and appears to have a similar safety profile as the earlier OC3 drug product.

 In conclusion, the burden and risk threshold is deemed to be acceptable for the study and many 
efforts have been made to minimise burden and potential risks to the subjects . Furthermore, 
the subjects  will visit the clinic ten times during the s tudy for study specific vi sits in order to 
monitor adverse events and to make sure the subject is able to follow study procedures. 
4.6.3 Benefits  
PH is a devastating, life -threatening disease for which there are no approved pharmaceutical 
therapies  available on the market . It is particularly emotive since it primarily affects a paediatric 
population. Consequently , there is a significant unmet medical need in treating this disease. 
Oral administration of Oxalobacter formigenes  is a promising potential treatment for patients 
with PH. Clear beneficial effects of Oxalobacter formigenes  have been demonstrated in animal 
models of PH and in earlier Phase I/II clinical studies.  
Based  on analysis  of the non- clinical  and clinical safety  data generated  to date, Oxabact has   
been  well  tolerated.  The o lder OC2 and OC3 Oxabact products  have been given to more than 
80 subjects for time periods  of 4 weeks to 12 months (with the majority of subjects having been 
treated for 6 months ). In addition, the OC5 product has been administered to 14 subjects for 8 -
10 weeks in the OC5- DB-01 study and for up to 36 months to 12 subjects in the ongoing OC5 -
OL-01 study. Administration of O. formigenes as a frozen cell paste, capsule or buffered 
powder for suspension was well tolerated in subjects with Primary hyper oxaluria.  No SUSARs 
have been reported in any of these studies for Oxabact, and Oxabact has had a favourable safety 
profile.  
The OC5 -DB-02 study should provide valuable information on the ability of the improved OC5 
Oxabact  product to reduce calcium oxalat e deposits and eventually lower the level of plasma  
oxalate and confer clinical benefit in patients with PH. It will also generate further safety 
information on the product. The 52- week treatment time is expected to be enough to start to 
reduce the widespread oxalate deposits in the body and eventually  also decrease plasma oxalate 
levels.  
4.6.4 Benefit:  Risk Assessment  
There is an unmistaken need for additional therapeutic measures to treat patients with PH.  
These patients are at high risk for kidney damage due to over -production of oxalate and 
currently there are limited treatments available for this disease . The efficacy of Oxabact  in PH 
patients is still to be proven.  
All non- clinical and clinical safety data to date indicate that Oxabact has been well tolerated. 
There have been no SUSARs for Oxabact reported in any clinical study with O. formigenes . 
Older studies with OC2 and OC3 drug product have been performed in over 80 subjects with 
treatment times of 4 weeks to 12 months. The 2 larger placebo -controlled studies (OC3- DB-
01 and OC3- DB-02) found that the OC3 product was safe and well tolerated with an adverse 
event profile similar to the placebo. Safety data from the completed  blinded OC5- DB-01 study 
and the ongoing open- label OC5 -OL-01 study suggest that OC 5 has a favourable safety profile 
and would not be expected to differ from that of the earlier OC3 drug product. 
Thus, based on the knowledge with regard to the mechanism of action for OC5, a naturally 
occurring  and non- pathogenic bacteria that relies excl usively on oxalate for its metabolism 
within the gut, and the available non- clinical and clinical data, the Sponsor believes that the 
benefit/risk evaluation of conducting this Phase  III trial for treatment in patients with PH is 
considered favourable.

 All in all, the potential clinical benefit to the target population (and study participants in this

plasma oxalate,  if the results meet the following criteria:  
 
1. Statistically significant difference in change from baseline for total plasma oxalate 
concentration  between Oxabact and placebo in favor of Oxabact  after 52 weeks of 
treatment.  
AND  
2. Estimated difference of an absolute change from baseline for total plasma oxalate concentration  between Oxabact and placebo of ≥5 µmol/L after 52 weeks of 
treatment .  
OR  
Estimated difference in percent change from baseline for total plasma oxalate 
concent ration  between Oxabact and placebo of ≥30% after 52 weeks of treatment.   
AND

 6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
This study is a phase III, double -blind placebo -controlled , randomized, multi- centre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of OC5 ( O. formigenes ) to stabilise/reduce plasma oxalate  
concentration , to stabilise/improve kidney function and to reduce oxalate deposits in PH 
patients . Enrolled subjects will have a maintained kidney function but below normal range 
(eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and a total plasma oxalate concentration ≥ 10 μmol/L.  
It is hypothesized that daily administration of O. formigenes  facilitates the secretion of 
endogenously produced oxalate via the GI tract. The enteric elimination of oxalate may help 
to reduce the oxalate deposits and eventually decrease the plasma oxalate level . 
6.1 Background and R ationale  
A recent natural history study in PH patients included in the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium 
(RKSC) Registry  (Zhao et al., 2016) , studied the key determinants for renal outcome in this 
patient population. The patients included in the analysis ha d a mean eGFR of 
73 ml/min/1.73  m2. During a median follow -up of 3.9 years (1.0, 12.8), 20% of patients 
developed End -Stage -Renal -Disease (ESRD). The most important progression factors for 
kidney deterior ation in patients with Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) from this registry study  are 
detailed in  Table 4.

*Q4: Quartile 4 related to a urinary oxalate excretion of > 1.87 mmol/1.73 m2 per 24hr  
 
Univariate analyses showed that the most important parameters governing the progression to 
ESRD in PH -patients were type of PH, highly elevated urinary oxalate excretion (the highest  
quartile  Q4 with above 1.87 mmol/1.73 m2 per 24hr), age at diagnosis and eGFR at diagnosis.  
This protocol will include subjects with an eGFR below 90mL/min/1.73 m2 and a total plasma 
oxalate concentration of ≥ 10 μmol/L. The rationale for these inclusion criteria is based on 
available data from the previous studies with OC3 an d OC5 and the above referenced analysis 
of registry data for PH patients. The following key points have been considered in determining 
the selection of subjects.  
• eGFR at diagnosis  is statistically significantly inversely correlated  to risk for ESRD 
(Zhao et al., 2016). The lower the eGFR, the higher the risk for progression to ESRD.  
In the selected patient  population with an eGFR below 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 the natural 
disease progression is at a stage where a decline in kidney function (resulting in 
increased plasma oxalate) would be measurable over a 52 -week study. The endpoints 
are selected to determine whether Oxabact treatment could halt or delay the di sease 
Protocol OC5- DB-02 – Version 11   08 January  2021 
OxThera Intellectual Property AB  IND 015881  
 
Protocol rev 0 11                                      08 January 2021                                           Page 43 of 92 
 progression i.e. stabilise or reduce plasma oxalate and stabilise  or improve kidney 
function over time. 
• The selected patient  population would have increased levels of plasma oxalate at 
baseline, as a consequence of the declining eGFR, and thus it would be possible to study 
not only a stabilization , but also a decrease in plasma oxalate concentration during 52 
weeks treatment with Oxabact in these subjects.  
It is evident from current knowledge that baseline kidney function is an important factor 
deter mining the rate of disease progression and that there is a clear correlation between plasma 
oxalate concentration and kidney function. Conseque ntly, it is important to harmonis e the 
treatment groups considering these parameters.  
The following measures have been taken to prevent potential imbalances in the treatment arms:  
• Subjects  with an eGFR below 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and plasma oxalate ≥ 10 µmol/L 
will be included in the study, in order to harmonise the study population with regard to 
stage of disease.  
• Subjects  will be stratified at randomization firstly in an attempt to evenly distribute any 
PH type 2 /type 3 patients and secondly to evenly distribute PH1 patients with a baseline 
Urinary oxalate (Uox) excretion more or less than 1.87 mmol/1.73m2 per day  between 
the treatment groups. 
In order to further define the patient  population, the endpoints will be analysed for sub-groups 
of subjects  determined by the subject ´s baseline oxalate excretion (urinary oxalate excretion 
more or less than  (or equal to)  1.87 mmol/24hr/1.73m2), high and low age (greater (or equal 
to) or less than 18 years) and high and low eGFR (more  (or equal to)  or less than 60 
ml/min/1.73m2). Since these parameters seems to be the most important drivers of the disease 
progression, the subgroups of subjects  with a high baseline urinary oxalate excretion, high age 
and a low baseline eGFR would be expected to show a more pronounced treatment response  
over 12 months.  
6.2 Overall Study Design and Plan 
The study subjects  will be monitored for up to 8 weeks prior to initiation of study medication, 
in order to obtain a robust baseline for each subject. Subjects  will be treated for 52 weeks with 
OC5 or placebo. After the treatment phase, subjects will be followed for safety  for 2 weeks or 
until the day before first dose in the follow-up study OC5- OL-02, whichever occurs first .  
During the screening/ baseline period, three visits in total will be done. Information on historical 
renal function  (including eGFR, serum creatinine and the equation used to calculate historical 
eGFR) and kidney stone events (prior to informed consent) will be collected. For subjects under 
18 years of age and subjects  that were <18 years up to 3 years prior to screening  (i.e. for all 
subjects  under 21 years  at screening ), height used to calculate historic eGFR will also be 
collected.  
The impact of stone events on days work/school attendance will be documented. During each 
of the screening/baseline visits, blood samples will be taken for safety labs , plasma oxalate and 
kidney function analyses . Subjects  will have two Echocardiography examinations  (Speckle 
Tracking and traditional echocardiography) . Ultrasound of the kidney will be performed once 
during the baseline period. Subjects  will be asked to provide one f aecal and two 24-hour urine 
samples. These samples will be taken at the subject ´s home. Subjects  will be asked to complete 
a questionnaire evaluating their Q uality of Life once during the baseline period.

 Eligibility for plasma oxalate and eGFR will be based on the mean value of visit 1 and 2.  
For determination of eligibility, eGFR can be calculated using Schwartz or CKD -EPI equations 
that include serum creatinine and/or cystatin C. 
For the urinary oxalate excretion,  a mean v alue will be determined for visit 1 and  2 
(screening/baseline period)  and used for stratification/randomization.  
Following screening and baseline evaluations, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 
receive either OC5 or placebo twice daily for 52 weeks.  
During the treatment period, subjects  will visit the clinic at weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52. 
During these visits, blood sample for analyses of safety labs and plasma oxalate and kidney 
function will be taken  and patient  Quality of Life will be evaluated by a questionnaire during 
weeks 8, 24, 40 and 52. Speckle Tracking and traditional echocardiography will be done at two 
occasions during the treatment period, in weeks 24 and 48. Subjects  will be asked to provide 
stool at three time points (weeks  24, 40 and 52) and 24- hour urine samples at four time points  
(weeks 8, 24, 40 and 52). Ultrasound of the kidney will be done at the end of the study in week 
48. Information on kidney stone events and related symptoms occurring between signature of 
the informed consent form and the end of study will be captured ( Please see Figure 6 for details 
of the OC5- DB-02 study design).  
The subjects  s will be o ffered to continue in an open- label follow -up protocol (OC5 -OL-02, 
ePHex -OLE) with Oxabact treatment  directly after the 52 -weeks treatment period. A separate 
Clinical Trial Protocol and subsequent Clinical Trial Application will be issued for this study.

Monitoring of adverse events, concomitant medication and compliance with the admini stration 
of study drug will be performed at least at  each visit . Furthermore, questions on kidney stone 
events and related symptoms will also be asked throughout the study.  
After the intake  of the last dose of study treatment  (Last Dose Date; LDD), subjects will 
be followed for safety (see S ection 6.3.4.1 for details on the post-t reatment safety follow-up). 
The LDD is considered the End of Treatment (EOT); the end of the safety follow-up 
period is considered End of Study (EOS). Adverse events, including  kidney stone events 
and
 related symptoms, are recorded throughout the entire treatment phase and safety follow-
up, i.e. until E OS (Figure 7); AE recording is described in detail in Section 11.4.

 6.3.1 Screening  
Patient Information must be given and the Informed Consent form (ICF) must be signed prior 
to any study related procedures being performed . The investigator shall list all patients  who are 
considered for participation in the study and who have signed the ICF on a Screening and 
Inclusion log. Pre-screening activities may be conducted if required. The inclusion and  
exclusion criteria should be reviewed. Demographics and baseline data will be collected.   
These include:  
• Date of birth , height, weight. 
• Physical examination and Vital Signs . 
• PH medical history  (including diagnosis , renal function , kidney stone events). 
• Other relevant medical  history, including concurrent illnesses and symptoms. 
• Prior/ Concomitant medication  and any non- medication therapy (e .g. physiotherapy) 
used in the 60 days prior to ICF signature. Any historic al use of vitamin B6 and any 
other relevant medication , as judged by the investigator, should also be recorded.  
Subject demographic details collected will comply with local requirements regarding patient  
confidentiality in applicable countries. 
Historic r enal function parameters (e.g. serum creatinine, eGFR  inclu ding the equation used to 
calculate historic eGFR ), if available,  will be collected to determine the rate of renal function 
decline in years before participation in study OC5- DB-02. For subjects under 18 years of age 
and subjects  that were <18 years up to 3 years prior to screening  (i.e. all subjects  under 21 years  
at screening ), height used to calculate historic eGFR will also be collected.  Information on 
historical stone events and related symptoms for the past 3 years will also be collected  (visit 
1). The impact of stone events on days work/school attendance will be documented. 
A complete physical examination will be performed and will include assessment of: general 
appearance, gastrointestinal system, dermatological system, EENT (eyes, ear, nose, throat) , 
head and neck, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, musculo- skeletal system, peripheral 
nervous system. Additional examinations may be done at the Investigators discretion.  
Vital signs assessed on study  include temperature and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), 
heart rate and respiratory rate assessed after 5 minutes resting in a supine position. Weight will 
be measured using a calibrated scale with the subject  lightly clothed and shoes off. Height will 
be measured using a calibrated wall mou nted stadiometer.  Height should be measured at each 
visit for all subjects  where the Schwartz equation is used to determine eGFR. This would apply 
to children ( subjects  under 18 years of age) and to any subject who turn 18 during the study 
period. For subjects  who are adults at study start, height will only be recorded at screening .  
 The following samples should be taken and sent for analysis: 
• Haematology analyses , clinical chemistry analyses , FSH analysis for post-menopausal 
women . 
• Urine sample for ur inalysis .  
• Plasma sample.  
The subject  (and parents when applicable) will be instructed how to collect 24- hour urine  and 
faeces samples,  and dates for collection will be scheduled. See Section  6.4 for further

 information on collections  at subject ´s home . For the course of the study, the subject should be 
instructed to maintain their normal diet and fluid intake as prescribed under thei r standard 
clinical care. The subject will be  asked to avoid taking ascorbic acid preparations or 
multivitamin preparations during the study period. The subject will be scheduled for an 
additional two  visits during the baseline period.  
6.3.2 Baseline  
During the baseline period of up to 8 weeks, plasma oxalate sampling  will be done at 3 
occasions  (including the screening visit) . The blood sample will be processed at the clinical 
site and the acidified plasma will be shipped frozen to the central laboratory (Ac ademical 
Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands , AMC ) for determination of total oxalate using 
the Isotope dilution Gas Chromatography with mass selective detection (GC -MSD) . The mean 
of the two first plasma oxalate results (total plasma oxalate) durin g the baseline period will be 
reviewed for the eligibility criteria concerning plasma oxalate.  
For urinary oxalate excretion,  a mean v alue will be determined for visit 1 and  2 
(screening/baseline period) and used for stratification/randomization. 
A separate sample will be processed at the site with ultrafiltration, acidification and sent frozen 
to AMC, to be analysed for free plasma oxalate concentration with GC-MSD . 
Plasma samples will also be sent to central laboratory BARC ( BARC Europe , Ghent, B elgium  
for EU and Tunisia  sites; and BARC USA, NY, USA for North -American sites ) for analysis 
of serum creatinine for calculation of eGFR . Plasma samples will also be analysed for some of 
the exploratory analytes as specified in the lab manual .   
Patient  Quality of Life will be evaluated using a questionnaire once during the baseline period.  
Safety labs  will be taken at 3 occasions  during baseline (including the screening visit) and 
analysed at central lab  (BARC) . Safety urinalysis will be analysed locally . Pregnancy test for 
women of childbearing potential will be done at visit 3  at central lab (BARC) . Subjects  will 
have two Echocardiography examinations done  at visits 1 and 3. Ultrasound of the kidneys will 
be done once during baseline  (visit 3) . Informat ion on kidney stone events and their impact on 
days work/school attendance will be collected during baseline  (visit 2 and 3). Subjects  will also 
be asked to provide two 24-hour urine samples and one fa ecal sample.  
The faeces sample will be collected at the subject´s home and shipped for analysis at Institut 
fur Mikroökologie, Herborn, Germany. The 24 -hour urine sample will also be taken at the 
subject´s home and shipped to The Doctors Laboratory ( TDL ), London, United Kingdom.  
Any changes in concomitant medication will be recorded in the eCRF  during the baseline 
period. At visit 3 each subject’s eligibility will be reviewed to assure that no exclusionary 
conditions have developed since the screening visit. The mean result from the two eGFR values 
(visit 1  and 2)  calculated using the Schwartz/ CKD- EPI equations based on creatinine and/or 
cystatin C  will be reviewed for the eligibility criteria concerning eGFR at this point. If the 
eGFR values vary more than 50% between the two samplings, the subject  will be evaluated for 
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). If AKI is confirmed, the subject should not be randomized and 
needs to be stabilized  first. When the kidney status is stable (as confirmed by routine local 
measurements/investigator decision), the subject  may perform a new baselin e period to verify 
eligibility. If eligible, the subject  will be  randomized. If t he subject experiences  another AKI 
during the baseline period, the subject  should not be enrolled. A repeat baseline period may be 
performed only once.

Protocol rev 0 11         08 January 2021                 Page 50 of 92 For subjects
 who fail any of the inclusion or exclusion criteria, applicable parts of the eCRF 
should be com
pleted (inclusion/exclusion criteria including corresponding data, and reason for 
the subje
ct not being eligible). Subjects  deemed not e ligible for trea tment should be recorded 
as screen failures on the Screening and Inclusion log. However, at the discretion of the 
investig
ator, a subject  who fails screening may be re- evaluated ( re-screened) at a later 
timepoint.  
After verification of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the subject will be randomized and 
assigned  a randomization number.  Subjects  will be randomi zed 1: 1 to receive either OC5 or 
placebo tw
ice daily for 52 weeks.  
At the clinical visit 3, the subject and/or the parents will be instructed about the administration 
procedures for the study drug. S ee Section 8 regarding treatment of subjects.  
After  randomi
zation of the subj ect, study drug will be ordered and shipped to the site. 
Treatment will start as soon as the first shipment of study drug has been delivered to the subject. 
The followin
g visit dates , during the treatment period, will be calculated from the first day of 
treatment.  
6.3.3 T reatment Period  
During the 52-week treatment period, the subject  will be followed by visits  at week 8, 16, 24, 
32, 
40, 48 and 52 according t o T able 5. E nd of treatment (EOT) is defined as the day of last 
intake of study drug (Last dose date (LDD)). 
At the visits blood  samples for determination of plasma oxalat e, kidney function and safety 
labs will be taken. Subjects  will have a physical examination and vital signs will be taken. 
Patient  Quali
ty of L ife will be evaluated using a questionnaire  at weeks 8, 24, 40 and 52.  
At week 24 and 48, Echocardiography (Speckl e Tracking and  traditional echoc ardiograph y) 
will be  performed. Ultrasound of the kidneys will be  performed at week 48.  
Subjects  will
 be asked to provide four 24- hour urine  sam ples, at  weeks 8, 24, 40 and 52, and 
three  faecal  sample s, at weeks 24, 40 and 52, during the treatment period. These collections 
will be
 done at the subject ´s home and should be scheduled in connection with the visit  (+/- 3 
days) . 
The collections may be planned to occur during a weekend if preferred by the 
subject/parent
s. 
At each visit the subject will be assessed for the presence or absence of Adverse Events and 
any changes
 in concomitant medications. Information on the occurrence of any stone event and 
related symptoms will be collected at each visit (from the time of sig ned informed consent 
form until the end of the study). Days missed at school/work due to a stone event will also be 
documented. I
nformation on stone events will be captured by completing the Adverse Event 
eCRF. (P
lease note this is a data entry convention and does not replace the per protocol 
definition of
 an Adverse Event as defined in Section 11.1 .). 
Pregnancy te st will be  repeated a t the last study vi sit for women of chi ldbearing potential. 
The subject  will receive  shipment of study drug once every second week during  the treatment 
period. Remaining study drug and empty containers will be returned to the clinic  or site 
pha
rmacy  cont
inuously during the study at the clinic visits, as soon as new supply for the 
current tr
eatment weeks has been received. The final return of study drug/empty containers 
will be done at t he last clinic visit.  
In case an acute kidney injury/stone event should occur during the stud y treatment, the subject  
should be treated according to standard hospital care. The subject  should not attend a visit if

 they are experiencing an acute kidney injury/stone event since this may affect study values 
(particularly the eGFR value).  When the event has been resolved the subject  can be rescheduled 
to the study timetable.  
6.3.4 Follow Up   
The subject  will be offered to continue in an open- label follow -up protocol (ePHex -OLE , OC5 -
OL-02) with Oxabact treatment directly after the 52 -week treatment period . A separate Clinical 
Trial Protocol  has been  developed and Clinical Trial Application s have been or will be 
submitted/approved for this study. 
6.3.4.1 Post-Treatment Safety Follow-Up 
Previous clinical experience with Oxabact® suggests that the bacteria only transiently colonise 
the gastrointestinal tract and f aecal recovery generally drops below detectable levels 1-2 weeks 
after end of treatment (Hoppe et al. 2006). All  subjects who complete  study treatment in  ePHex , 
withdraw or were withdrawn from the study prematurely, will be followed for safety. 
This post- treatment safety follow-up period starts the day after LDD in ePHex and ends :  
• Fourteen days  after LDD  in ePHex, or  
• The day before the first dose of study drug in the extension study ePHex -OLE has 
been taken,  
whichever occurs first .  
The follow -up will be performed as a telephone call maximum three  working days after the 
end of the safety follow -up period. T he subject will be asked for any AEs (incl. kidney stone 
events) appearing after completion of ePHex study treatment (i.e. after LDD) . Additionally, 
any AEs that were present at the last completed study visit should be followed -up. Concomitant 
medication taken during the safety follow-up period should also be recorded.   Adverse Drug Reactions, which are unresolved at the time of the safety follow -up call , should 
be followed by the Investigator until the event has resolved or, if persistent, has been assessed 
as “chronic” or “stable”.
 
6.3.5 Electronic Patient Reported Outcom e 
A web -based interface for electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) will be used 
continuously during the study. Subjects  will record details on collections of urine and faeces , 
Quality of Life as well as the first and last dose of  study drug intake here . Subjects  will regularly 
receive reminders to record this data, and to follow study procedures with study drug and 
specimen collection.  
6.4 Specimen Collection at Subjects’  Homes   
The collections of faeces  and urine will be performed by the subjects in their home 
environment, and should be performed according to Table 5. The sponsor will provide 
collection kits and a Patient Handbook describing the collection procedure s. Collection kits 
will either be taken home from the clinic by the subject  or delivered to subject’s  home by a 
courier. P ick-up of collections  will be done by courier.  
6.5 Diet 
For the course of the study, the subjects will be instructed to maintain their normal diet and 
fluid intake as prescribed under their standard clinical care. They will be as ked to avoid making

7.3 Contraceptive Precautions  
The following requirements should be followed for women of childbearing potential.  
Protocol OC5- DB-02 – Version 11 08 January  2021 
OxThera Intellectual Property AB  IND 015881  
Protocol rev 0 11         08 January 2021                 Page 54 of 92 1.Females 
of childbearing  potential will be included if they are either sexually inactive
(sexually abstinent for 14 days prior to the first dose continuing through 28 days after the
last dose ), or using one of the following highly effective contraceptive methods (i.e. results
in <1% failure rate when used consistently and correctly) during this trial:
a. intrauterine device (IUD);
b.surgical sterilization of the partner (vasectomy for 6 months minimum);
c.combined (estrogen or progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associatedwith the inhibition of ovulation (either oral, intravaginal, or transdermal);
d.progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation(either oral, injectable, or implantable);
e.intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS);
f.bilatera l tubal occlusion.
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. In this trial abstinence is only acceptable if in line with the subjects preferred and usual lifestyle.  
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception.  As well, female condom and male condom should not be used together. 
2.Females of childbearing potential agree to remain sexually inactive or to keep the samebirth control method for at least 28 days following the last dose.
3.A female of non -childbearing potential must have undergone one of the following
sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to the first dose:
a.hysteroscopic sterilization;
b.bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy;
c. hysterectomy;
d. bilateral oophorectomy;or be postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to the first dose and 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status.   
Since
 the study drug consist of commensal bacteria, which are a natural part of the microbiota, 
the risk of excretion  via the semen  or any negative  effects  from  such excretion  is highly 
unlikely. Therefore, no requirements for contraception is applied for male subjects.  
Females of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test at baseline and at the end of the 
study at week 52. Additional information concerning participants becoming pregnant 
during the study can be found in Section 11.9.  
7.4 Subject Wit hdrawal Criteria 
If a subject fails to return for a scheduled stud y visit, the investigator will make a reasonable 
effort to  contact the subject and determine why the subject failed to return and to schedule a 
new study visit.  Any information obtained during this contact will be documented in the study 
records.

 A study  subject will be discontinued from study treatment if: 
• Any clinical ly significant adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, illness, or 
other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the 
study would not be in the best interest of the subject . 
• OxThera or the Principal Investigator in consultation with OxThera may discontinue the subject at any time for medical and/or administrative reasons . 
• The Principal Investigator in consultation with OxThera may discontinue the 
subject in case there is a major protocol violation. 
• The subject requires dialysis . 
Any subject who withdraws prematurely from study treatment will be asked to complete all 
study a ssessments described for the week 48 and week 52 clinical  visits (combined)  and will 
be followed for safety for two weeks after the last intake of study drug. 
Subjects who withdraw consent from participating in the study at any time, will end the study. 
They will not have any further assessment and no further study data will be collected . 
For any subject who has withdrawn, the date of withdrawal  and the reason for withdrawal from  
treatment and/or  from the study will be recorded in the source data and eCRF.  
A subject who fails screening may be re -evaluated (re- screened) at a later timepoint. 
Withdrawn subjects  should not be re -entered into the study. Subjects that are withdrawn due 
to major protocol violations will be summarized  in the clinical study report. Additional subjects  
may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor.

OF SUBJECTS 
8.1 Description of Study Treatm ent 
The study drug consists of OC5 as the active treatment and placebo with the same appearance. 
The study
 drug is  supplied as enteric- coa ted capsules. One capsule shall be administered orally 
with water twice daily with breakfast 
and dinner. The study product is described in more 
detail in Section 9 .  
8.2 Concomit
ant Medications 
Any me
dications including over -the- counter medications or herbal supplements will be 
record
ed 
as concomitant drug therapy on the case report form. Prior/concomitant medication 
used in the
 60 days prior to signing of the ICF will be recorded. Any historical use of vitamin 
B6 and any other relevant medication as judged by the investigator should also be recorded. 
Subjects  will
 continue any medications they are receiving at study entry for unde rlying medical 
conditions  and the m edications will be recorded at screening  a nd changes will be noted 
throughout the s
tudy, i .e. until EOS) .  
8.2.1 C oncomitant T reatment w ith Vitamin B 6 
Subjects  receiving
 vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine) prior to study entry must be on a s table dose for at 
least 3 months prior to t he screening visit. Subjects  who are not receiving vitamin B6  at study 
entry will not be allowed to initiate vitamin B6 during study participation. Subjects  will be 
encouraged not to change the dosing of vitamin B6 or discontinue  vitamin B6 during study 
participation except for any safety events considered related to vi tamin B6.  
8.2.2 P rohibited M edications 
Subjects are not allowed to receive any other investi gational therapies during or within 60 days 
prior to study pa rticipation.  
Other prohibited medications are: 
-Ascorbic acid preparations : Ascorbic acid preparations must not be used during the
study period (screening/baseline and treatment period) as it may affect  the measurement
of urinary oxalate.
-Long -term use of antibiotics: Subjects  that require long- term use (more than 3
consecutive weeks)  of antibiotics  to which O. formigenes  is sensitive during the
treatment period will discontinue study drug and be followed for safety.
-For subjects  that require short- term use of  antibiotics  during the treatment period, care
should be taken to primarily choose antibiotics to which O. formigenes  is resistant. In
case of repeated short- term use (more than one course) an evaluation will be made to
assess the risk for interference with the study drug treatment.
oO. formigenes  has shown resistance to antibiotics that affect the cell envelope,
such as ceftizoxime, imipenem, ampicillin, amoxicillin and penicillin.
oO. formigenes  has shown sensitivity  to antibiotics that are protein synthesis
inhibitors, such as chloramphenicol, doxycycline, erythromycin, and
tetracycline.

 8.3 Treatment C ompliance  
Subjects  will be provided with a diary to record the intak e of the first and last dose of study 
drug. Compliance to study treatment will also be checked with the subjects at each visit to the 
clinic . 
Unused medication will be returned to the clinic or site pharmacy at the next clinical visit, or 
the visit thereafter if new supply has not yet been received by the subject . Accountability will 
be done for the unused medication for an overall check of subject compliance.  
8.4 Randomization  and Blinding  
At the screening visit,  the subjects will be identified with a site -specific consecutive screening 
number consisting of site identification number and subject number . After completed screening 
procedures and eligibility check, the subjects will be assigned to blinded OC5 or plac ebo in a 
1:1 ratio  according to a randomization list created by an independent statistician. The 
randomiz ation list and treatment assignments will not be accessible until database -lock and 
unblinding . Subjects  will be stratified , prior to randomization, firstly  in an attempt to obtain an 
even distribution of PH type 2/type 3  patients and secondly to stratify the PH type 1 patient s 
for a baseline urinary oxalate excretion above or below (or equal to) 1.87 mmol/24h/ 1.73 m2 
(based on the mean of the two firs t visits during screening).  
Randomization will be performed via a centralized  procedure. 
If a subject discontinues the study, the subject number will not be re-used by another subject. 
Capsules with study medication will all have the same appearance to en able the double -blind 
study design.  
The following analytes /parameters  on treatment, which may reveal a treatment -induced effect, 
will be defined as blind data and will remain blind to both subjects  and sites until the study 
ends, the database is locked and the unblinding has occurred:  
• Plasma oxalate 
• Quantity of O. formigenes  in faeces  
• Urinary oxalate and urinary calcium  
• Echocardiography (Speckle Tracking and traditional echocardiography) and 
ultraso und: During image analysis, Echocardiography  and ultrasound central readers  
will also carry their assessments unaware of any clinical data from the study subjects.  
This data (except for quantity of O. formigenes  in faeces) will also remain blind to the study 
team but may be subject to blind data quality review at the earliest at LPLV.

 10 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
The efficacy parameters to be assessed are: 
Primary Endpoint:  
 Change from baseline in total plasma oxalate concentration  after 52 weeks of treatment.  
Key Secondary: 
 Change from baseline in kidney function after 52 weeks of treatment.  
 Frequency of kidney stones events after 52 weeks of treatment. S tone events are defined 
as:  
o Subject - or investigator reported symptoms, or  
o Stone passages or removals, or 
o Increase in number of stones assessed by ultrasound. 
Other Endpoints  
 Percent change from baseline in total plasma oxalate concentration after 52 weeks of 
treatment . 
 Subjects achieving ‘near -normalization ’ of total plasma oxalate  concentration ( <10 
µmol/L ) at least twice during weeks 24 to 52 of treatment.   
 Change from baseline in myocardial function as measured by Speckle Tracking and 
traditional echocardiography.  
 Change from baseline in free plasma oxalate concentration after 52 weeks of treatment.  
 Change from baseline in urinary oxalate excretion after 52  weeks of treatment.  
 Change from baseline in grade of nephrocalcinosis as assessed by Ultrasound  
 Change in number of O. formigenes  in stool. 
 Association  between change in number of O. formigenes  in stool and change in total 
plasma oxalate concentration.  
 Change from baseline in score of Quality of Life questionnaire. 
 Change from baseline in markers for renal  function, renal  tubular capacity and 
inflammation:  Urine : magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, glycolate, creatinine, urea, calcium 
oxalate crystals, pH, osmolality and urinary volume.  
Blood: magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, glycolate, BUN, ALP, bicarbonate, CRP, WBC, creatinine and cystatine C . 
10.1 Plasma Oxalate  
Samples for plasma oxalate will be collected during clinical visits, as specified in Table 5. The 
mean of the two values at Visit 1 and 2 will be the basis for eligibility criteria, whereas the mean of the three values obtained at Visit 1, 2 and 3 will be used as the mean baseline plasma 
oxalate value for statistical evaluation .

Protocol rev 0 11         08 January 2021                 Page 61 of 92 Samples
 for total plasma oxalate will be processed at the clinical site and analysed at Academic 
Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands  (AMC). Each site will be provided with kits and 
supplies  for collection,  processing  and shipping  of blood  samples  for determination  of total 
plasma oxalate. Complete instructions for the  collection, processing, storage and shipping of 
sample will be provided in the s ite manual. 
Total pl asma oxalate will be measured using isotope dilution g as chromatography with mass 
selective detection (GC -MSD) . The measurement  of plasma  oxalate  has analytical  and 
biological variability. The analytical variability for the total plasma oxalate assay  as performed 
by AMC is very low and the accuracy is within 1 µmol/L. The biological variability is higher 
and may be related to the actual hydration status for the subject. 
Ultrafiltered,  acidified plasma samples will also be analysed for free plasm a oxalate with GC-
MSD at AMC .  
The ratio between the two different results will be monitored throughout the study. 
Earlier studies on Oxabact used either an enzymatic assay for plasma oxalate where the oxalate 
available  for enzymatic  reaction is  measured, or  a standard plasma  oxalate Ion 
Chromatography ( IC) method where a 10 kDa ultra filtration step prior to acidification of the 
sample  separates  the protein -bound  oxalate  from  the sample.  Earlier  study  results  should 
therefore  be interpreted  with this  fact in mind.  In contrast,  since  the sample  preparation  for 
analysis of total plasma oxalate does not include an ultra filtration step prior to acidification, 
the method measures the total amount of plasma oxalate. Since the major portion of the plasma 
oxalate is  likely protein- associated (Hatch, 1990; H atch et al., 1977 ) both ultrafiltered samples 
and samples without ultrafiltration will be analysed in the OC5- DB-02 study, complementary 
to each other. By  using  both sample preparation  methods in the study  for analysis of plasma 
oxalate, the ratio between the change  in free plasma  oxalate  and the change  in total  plasma 
oxalate can be evaluated as an indicator of change in protein associated oxalate, as well as the 
two different parameters independently.  
A positive treatment effect on plasma oxalate would be a statistically significant difference in 
change  from  baseline in total  plasma  oxalate  concentration after  52 weeks  of treatment. The 
relationship between change in O. f ormigenes  and change in total plasma oxalate will also be 
evaluated.  
Change from baseline in t otal plasma oxalate concentration after 52 weeks treatment will also 
be evaluated in the sub-groups of subjects  with a urinary oxalate excretion above and below  or 
equal  to 1.87 mmol/L/24h/1.73  m2, age above  or equal  to and below  18 years  of age and an 
eGFR a bove or  equal to a nd below 60 m l/min/1.73 m2.  
10.2  K idney Funct ion P arameters 
Change from baseline in kidney function (eGFR) will be evaluated after 52 weeks treatment. 
The mean of the two values taken at visit 1 and 2 will be the basis for the eligibility  criteria . 
For determination of e ligibility  eGFR will be evaluated using Schwartz or CKD- EPI equat ions 
that include serum creatinine  and/or cystatin.  
Change in kidney function will be evaluated based on eGFR calculation using the 2009 
creatinine-based “Schwartz bedside” equation (for children below 18 years of age) (Schwartz 
et al., 2009) 
and 2009 crea tinine-b ased CKD-EPI equation for adults (Levey  et al., 
2009). Subjects who turn 18 during the study period will continuously be evaluated using the 
Schwartz equation, ie the equation used at baseline will be kept throughout the study.

 for eGFR calculations will be processed at the clinical site and analysed at  central lab 
(Cerba Research [previously called BARC ]). Each site will be provided with kits and supplies 
for collection, processing and shipping of blood samples for determination of serum  creatinine 
and cystatine C. Complete instructions for the collection, processing, storage and shipping of 
sample will be provided in the site manual. 
10.3 Kidney Stone Events  
Kidney stones are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidne ys. Most 
kidney stones (approximately 80%) are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate.  Stones can also be composed of struvite, uric acid or cystine. Stones vary in size and 
shape, ranging from a few mms up to 40mms. Patients can typically pass the smaller stones in the urine. However, larger stones  (e.g. > 10mm) may require lithotripsy and surgical or 
endoscopic removal. A kidney stone may not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney, passes into the ureter, bladder, or urethr a. 
Stone Events  
In this study, kidney stone events are defined as follows: 
•A stone event is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following symptoms
due to a kidney stone that may or may not require medical intervention:
oAbdominal, flank or groin pain, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting.
oMacroscopic hematuria (visible blood in the urine).
oUrinary tract infection (cloudy or foul -smelling urine, more frequent and/or painful
urination than normal, persistent need to urinate and/or urinating small amounts).
•Stone events may also be defined by subject- reported stone passage or by medical
procedures to remove identified kidney stones (e.g. lithotripsy, endoscopy, surgery).
•An increase in number of kidney stones as seen in a kidney ultrasound would also bedefined as a stone event.
Durati
on between stone events : if symptoms of a stone event occur simultaneously or close in 
time to another  kidney  stone  event  symptom,  the investigator  can decide  whether  or not this 
should be reported as the same s tone event or as a new, separate stone event. 
Assessments of stone 
events will be collected by ultrasound (renal imaging) (see Section 
10.6.2 below) as well as subject-reported stone events or symptoms of events (see definition 
above). Historical kidney stone events and related symptoms for the past three years 
preceding study entry will be asked at screening. During the baseline and treatment period, 
information will be collected concerning occurrence of self -reported kidney stone events 
and related sympto ms. This information will be  captured by  completing  the Adverse 
Event eCRF at
 each visit throughout the study. 
Frequ
ency of kidney stone events will be evaluated after 52 weeks of treatment.

4  Speckle Tracking and Traditiona l Echocardiography 
Speckle  Tracking  Echocardiography  (STE)  is currently  evaluated as  a method  to detect  and 
quantify  effects  of oxalate  deposits  in the heart  muscle  (Lagies  et al., 2013, 2019 ). STE is 
considered to be a feasible tool for discovering subtle changes of myocardial performance and 
identifying PH patients at risk for serious cardiac damage.

Protocol rev 0 11                                      08 January 2021                                           Page 63 of 92 
 Speckle Tracking and traditional e chocardiography will be performed twice during 
screening/baseline and at week 24 and 48 (+/ - 2 weeks) during the treatment period. The 
examination will be performed locally using specific equipment as detailed in the site manual. 
Images will be interpreted centrally in a blinded manner.  If the images  are not meeting the 
quality criteria, the examination will be repeated within 4 weeks of the initial examination. For 
the week 48 examination, a repeat examination, if needed, should be done before end of 
treatment in week 52.  
Complete instructions for the collection, processing, storag e and transfer of images will be 
provided in the imaging manual.   
STE results will be evaluated for changes in global longitudinal strain, including segmental 
changes, short -axis myocardial function, rotational displacement and apical sparing patterns. 
Traditional echo cardiographic parameters will also be evaluated ( e.g. Ejection Fraction, End 
Diastolic Volume, Medial to Lateral Diastolic Peak Velocity  (e/é), Early to Late Ventricular 
Filling Velocity  (e/a), Left Ventricular End Diastolic Dimension, Fractional shortening , 
Tricuspid Regurgitation by Doppler as an indicator of right ventricular/pulmonary pressure .). 
A positive treatment effect would be an improved myocardial function based on the above -
mentioned parameters, decreased global longit udinal strain,  improved rotational displacement 
and reduced/removed apical sparing pattern. The treatment effect on STE parameters will be 
compared to traditional echocardiography parameters of left and right ventricular  function to 
determine which assessment of  cardiac function is more sensitive in these subjects . 
10.5  Quality of Life Questionnaire  
A questionnaire will be used to evaluate the Quality of Life for the participating subjects . The 
SF36v2 questionnaire will be used for the adult subjects  and the CHQ/CHQ/ PF50 for subjects  
5-18 years and their parents. The questionnaire will be completed by the subjects /parents  
during screening/baseline and during the clinical visits at weeks 8, 24, 40 and 52. 
10.6  Other P aram eters for Evaluation of Treatment Effect 
The additional parameters described below will also be analysed for treatment effect.  
10.6.1 Quantification of O. formigenes  
The possibility to monitor the natural occurrence of O. formigenes  bacteria and the presence of 
the O. formigenes  drug before, during and after treatment with OC5 is an important tool for 
control of the pharmacodynamics of the drug. To date, two different genotypes of naturally 
occurring Oxalobacter formigenes  have been identified, genotype 1 and 2 (groups I and II). 
Oxabact, or OC5, is of the strain HC -1 of the Oxalobacter formigenes  genotype 1.  A real -time 
quantitative PCR assay will be used that permits determination of the numbers of both O. 
formigenes  genotype 1 and genotype 2 in faecal samples.  
Faecal samples will be collected at subject’s  home and shipped to central laboratory MVZ 
Institut für Mikroökologie GmbH, Herborn, Germany. 
A positive treatment effect on the result from analysis of number of O. formigenes  should show 
an increased number of O. formigenes  genotype 1 during treatment period. Earlier studies have 
shown that O. formigenes genotype 2  have increased in the OC5 treated group, but not in the 
placebo group indicating a transfer of oxalate from plasma to the intestine mediated by OC5 
treatment.  O. formigenes genotype 2  will also be monitored for this reason.

 The association  between change in O. formigenes  and change in total plasma oxalate will also 
be evaluated.  
 
10.6.2 Ultrasound 
Ultrasound of the kidneys will be done at the site hospital. Images will be sent for central 
reading in a blinded manner. The examination will be standard and described in detail in the 
imaging manual.   
Ultrasound images will be evaluated to determine the  grade of nephrocalcinosis and the amount 
of kidney stones.  
For nephrocalcinosis, the grading system using the ultrasound will be using 0- 3 grades ( Boyce 
et al., 2013) 
• grade 0: no echogenicity • grade 1: mild echogenicity a round medullary pyramid borders 
• grade 2: moderate echogenicity around and inside pyramids 
• grade 3: severe echogenicity of entire pyramids  
10.6.3 Twenty -Four-H our Urine Samples  
Twenty -four- hour urine samples for analysis of urinary oxalate, urinary calcium , urinary 
glycolate, urinary magnesium, urine citrate, urine urea, urine creatinine , urine phosphorus 
excretion , pH, osmolality and urine volume will be taken at subject ´s home and sent to central 
laboratory TDL,  London , UK. Urine calcium oxalate crystals a nd pH will also be analysed 
from this sample. Urinary oxalate will be analysed with a colorimetric enzymatic assay using 
oxalate oxidase, which oxidizes oxalate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. The analyses 
will be described in more detail in the lab manual.  
10.6.4 Plasma S ample  – Other Endpoints  
Plasma samples will also be analysed for magnesium, phosphorus, citrate, calcium, glycolate, 
BUN, ALP, bicarbonate, CRP, WBC , creatinine and cystatine C for evaluation of other 
endpoints. The details of sampling and analysis of these parameters will be outlined in the lab 
manual.

 11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
The safety parameters to be assessed are:  
• Adverse Events  
• Laboratory safety measurements  
• Vital signs  
• Physical examination  
11.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject  administered 
a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefo re be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs 
therefore include e.g. worsening of a pre -existing illness and any injury or accident. This refers 
also to symptoms due to a pre -existing allergy, e.g. if seasonal allergy symptoms are within 
what is normally experienced , they should not be recorded as adverse events. If the symptoms 
are worse than what is normally experienced, then they should be recorded as adverse events.  
An AE does not  include: 
• Symptoms of the underlying disease (with exception of kidney stone events) that might be 
reasonably anticipated  to come and go, or progress, given the nature and severity of the 
condition. However, if the progression of the disease  escalates,  result ing in hospitalization, is 
life-threatening, or is fatal, then progression of the disease should be reported as an AE  of 
serious nature; 
• Expected variations in severity of disease signs and symptoms that have previously been 
reported in the subject ’s medical history;  
• Pre -planned medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, tooth extraction, or transfusion) 
[Note: T he condition that leads to the procedure may be an AE]; 
• Overdose of study drug without any clinical signs or symptoms; or 
• Clinically significant laboratory values. If abnormal laboratory values are accompanied by abnormal signs or symptoms, the signs or symptoms are considered an AE and should be recorded as such. Abnormal laboratory values associated with the underlying disease are not 
an AE  unless the values unexpectedly worsen . Abnormal laboratory values will be recorded in 
the study database.  
Advers e Drug Reaction (ADR) 
An AE is defined as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) if further analyses prove that the AE is caused or partially caused by the investigational product. This includes interaction, overdosing, abuse and development of addiction. Expected ADRs are also possible events due to the 
substance class of the investigational drug, expected from analogue conclusions or theoretical considerations related to toxicological, pharmacological or kinetic characteristics.  
 
Protocol OC5- DB-02 – Version 11   08 January  2021 
OxThera Intellectual Property AB  IND 015881  
 
Protocol rev 0 11                                      08 January 2021                                           Page 66 of 92 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Ser ious Adverse Event (SAE) is one that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side 
effect or precaution that results in: 
• the subject ’s death  
• is life -threatening*  
• requires inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization  ** 
• persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• corresponds to an other important medical event as determined by the Investigator.  
*   Life threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as 
it occurred , or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the investigational product 
would result in the subject‘s death. Life threatening does not mean that had an AE occurred 
in a more severe form it might have caused death.  
** Hospital ization requires over -night stay at the hospital. Outpatient treatment in an 
emergency room is not itself a SAE. Hospital admission and/or operations planned before 
or during a study are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject 
was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is a suspected unexpected serious adver se reaction .  
In cases of doubt on this issue, it is suggested that there should be a predisposition to report rather than not to report (see S ection 11.3).  
11.2  Relationship to Study Drug 
The following relationships to study drug will be used in the study  (in accordance with the 
WHO- UMC Causality Categories, Table 7).  Events classified as certain, probable/likely or 
possible will be considered related to study drug.  
Table 7: WHO -UMC  Causality  Categories

• Information  on drug  withdrawal  may  be lacking  or unclear  
 
Unlikely  • Event  or laboratory  test abnormality,  with  a time  to drug  intake  
that  makes  a relationship  improbable  (but  not impossible)  
• Disease  or other  drugs  provide  plausible  explanations  
 
Conditional/  
Unclassified • Event  or laboratory  test abnormality  
• More  data  for proper  assessment  needed,  or 
• Additional  data  under  examination  
 
Unassessable/  
Unclassifiable  • Report  suggesting  an adverse  reaction  
• Cannot  be judged  because  information  is insufficient  or 
contradictory  
• Data  cannot  be supplemented  or verified  
 
11.3  Recording Adverse Events  
Each subject  will be questioned about AEs at each visit/ following initiation of treatment. The 
question asked will be "Since your last visit have you had any health problems?" The 
information can also be obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observed by the study personnel or spontaneous reports from the study subjects  or by lab 
results . 
The investigator is to record in the eCRFs all directly observed AEs, all AEs as a response of 
the open question and all AEs spontaneously reported by the subject  during the study.  
The investigator will record all AEs by:  
• Description of event (recorded in standard medical terminology and avoiding abbreviations), 
• Start and end date,  
• Intensity /grade *  
• Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition), 
• Causal relationship, (certain, probable/likely, possible, unlikely, conditional/unclassified, 
unassessable/unclassifiable)  
• Action taken, (none, treatment required, study drug interrupted, subject  withdrawn, other) 
• Outcome of the AE (recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, not recovered) 
The Sponsor or delegate will code all AEs and SAEs using MedDRA.

ted AE, the intensity (grade)  will be recorded. The following grades of
intensity are to be used  (CTCAE version 4.0):
Grade 1: Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations only;  
intervention  not indicated.  
Grade 2: Moderate;  minimal,  local  or noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiti ng age -

Grade 3: Severe  or medically  significant but not immediately  life-threatening; 
hospitaliz ation  or prolongation  of hospitali zation  indicated; disabling;  limiting  self 
care ADL**.  
Grade 4: Life -threatening  consequences; urgent intervention  indicated.  
Grade 5: Death  related  to AE. 
A Semi -colon  indicates  ‘or’ within  the description  of the grade.  
*Instrumental ADL  refer  to preparing meals,  shopping for groceries  or clothes, using the
telephone, managing money,  etc.
**Self  care ADL  refer to bathing,  dressing  and undressing, feeding  self, using the toilet,  
taking  medications,  and not bedridden. 
If the intensity /grade changes within 24 hours the maximum intensity should be recorded.  If 
the intensity changes over a longer period of time, the changes should be recorded in the eCRF.  
11.4 Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse Event reporting for each subject shall start at the initiation of study treatment , (i.e. 
from FDD). The reporting shall continue during the course of the study (i.e. until EOS) . 
Thus, reported AEs include: 
•all AEs that occur during the treatment phase
•all AEs that occur  during the safety follow-up period
Spontaneously 
reported events by study subjects  in between planned visits shall also be 
reported. AEs should be reported for all subjects , independent of treatme nt assignment. 
NON -SERIOUS AEs are to be reported in the e CRF. 
SAEs  are to be 
reported by the i nvestigator within 24 hours of awareness. The eCRF and the 
initial SAE 
form (provided in the Investigational Site File) are both to be completed within this 
time, and the latter submitted to ProductLife Department via fax (please see 
SAE report form 
for fax number) o r email (safety@productlife-group.com ).  
In 
case of
 any question related to SAE reporting please contact Drug Safety Physician/ Medical 
Monitor, see contact information in Table  1. All SAEs must be reported whether or not 
considered drug related. The site is required to send the available SAE information even if the 
data i s incomplete.  
After receipt of the initial report, ProducLife will forward the information to OxThera within 
24 hours. ProductLife Pharmacovigi lance Department will work with OxThera to review the 
information received and contact the site to request any missing information/amendments 
needed. When follow -up information is obtained by the investigator it should also be forwarded

 to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. The report should be marked “Follow -up report”. Any 
follow-up received should be treated in the same way as initial reports. 
The investigator will submit copies of SAE reports to the independent ethics committee 
concerned as required by local regulations. All serious and unexpected adverse events will be reported to the European authorities as per regulations.   
Adverse Drug Reactions, which are unresolved at the end of the  safety  follow -up period should 
be followed by the I nvestigator until the event has resolved or, if persistent, has been assessed 
as “chronic” or “stable”.  This data is not recorded in the eCRF.   
An Unexpected Adverse Reaction is any adverse reaction, of which the specificity or severity 
is not specified in the current Investigator’s Brochure for the study drug. A SUSAR is a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction .  All SUSARs that are 
possibly, probably or definitely related to OC5 are subject to expedited reporting to Regulatory 
Authorities, Ethic Committees and participating investigators in accordance with local 
requirements in force and the ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the EU 
Directive  2001/20/EC. ProductLife Pharmacovigilance Department will be responsible for 
ensuring expedited reporting of SUSARs. 
11.4.1 Emergency Unblinding  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that there are procedur es and expertise available to 
handle emergencies during the study. In the event the investigator considers it necessary to 
know the identity of the study substance to manage a specific serious adverse event, the 
treatment  may be un -blinded for that particular subject. The responsibility to break the 
treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator and the investigator 
has unrestricted and immediate access to emergency envelopes available at the s ite to break the 
treatment code. The investigator shall immediately inform the Medical Monitor if the treatment 
code is broken. 
11.5  Anticipated Adverse Events  
11.5.1 Review of Available D ata  
OC3 has been evaluated in several clinical studies in patients with PH; one 28-day phase I/II 
study (OC3a), one 24- week double blind placebo -controlled multicentre international phase 
II/III clinical study including a 24 -week open-label extension study (OC3b), and one 24- week 
double- blind placebo- controlled multicentre international phase II/III clinical study (OC3b 
buffer formulation). OC5 has been evaluated in one double -blind placebo -controlled 
multicentre international phase II study and one ongoing phase II open- label study,  see Table 3. 
In summary OC3 and OC5 have been evaluated in over 100 subjects  receiving a dose of up to 
109 CFU twice a day. The continuous exposure to study drug ranged from 4 weeks up to 3 
years . Both OC3  and OC5 were considered safe and well tolerated in all clinical studies.  
Review of the safety data from the complete studies indicate that subjects may experience 
headache and gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, constipation, nause a, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, and flatulence.  
No treatment related Serious A dverse Events for Oxabact were reported in patients with PH.  
In all studies, the majority of adverse events were reported as mild and unlikely related to the 
treatment. In the placebo -controlled studies, the adverse events were equally distributed 
between OC3 /OC5  and placebo.

 11.5.2 Safety Data for OC5- DB-01 S tudy  
Twenty -eight subjects  were randomized in the OC5- DB-01 trial, and half of them were treated 
with active drug. The first subject  was enrolled in December 2013 and the last patient last visit 
(LPLV) was in January 2015. No serious related adverse events were reported in the trial.  
The AEs are summarized  in Table 8 and Table 9. In general, the treatment groups appeared to 
be comparable, although som e slight differences could be noted. No SAE was reported in the 
placebo treatment group, whereas three subjects  in the OC5 treatment group reported a SAE. 
Slightly higher number of subjects  reported Renal and urinary disorders  in the OC5 treatment 
group (n=4) as compared to the placebo treatmen t group (n=0). Slightly higher number of 
subjects  reported Nervous system disorders  in the placebo treatment group (n=5, whereof all 
reported headache) as compared to the OC5 treatment group (n=1, reported both headache and 
dizziness).

Adverse  events  are coded  according  to MedDRA  version  16.1 
Percentage  is based  on number  of subjects  in safety  analysis  set 
Ten subjects  (71%) in the OC5 group experienced an AE, which was similar to the number in 
the Placebo group (12; 86%). A greater number of individual AEs were mentioned in the OC5 
group than in the Placebo group (41 versus 26). Four subjects in the OC5 group experience d 
renal and urinary disorders (seven mentions in total); no AEs in this system organ class were reported in the Placebo group. 
The occurrence of AEs was similar in the two groups. Although more renal and urinary 
disorders were experienced by subjects in th e OC5  group than in the Placebo group (four 
subjects  [29%] versus no subjects  [0%]), only one occurrence was considered related to the 
treatment (Subject SCR01 -0002; kidney pains, moderate, possibly related). The subjects  in the 
OC5 group had a more pronounced reduction in renal function than the placebo subjects at 
baseline. Mean baseline eGFR was lower in the OC5 group than in the placebo group 
(97.5±38.7 versus 123.1±45.4 mL/min/1.73 m
2), and renal and urinary disorders were more 
common in the OC5 group (11 cases versus eight cases). Most notably, four subjects  in the 
OC5 group had a history of chronic renal failure, whereas no subjects  in the placebo group had 
been affected by this condition.   
Two AEs were judged to be definitely related to treatment. Subject SCR01- 0001 (OC5) 
experienced a case of mild rumbling stomach, which began the day that treatment commenced 
and resolved the day after treatment ended. Subject SCR07- 0004 (Placebo) experienced a case 
of mild diarrhoea the day after treatment started.  
Four AEs were of at least moderate severity and judged to be possibly related to the treatment: a moderate case of gastroenteritis (OC5; SCR01 -0018), the aforementioned case of kidney 
pains (OC5; SCR01- 0002), a moderate case of increased bowel movements ( OC5; 
SCR03 -0005) and a case of severe headaches (Placebo; SCR07 -0004). No AEs required 
changes of dose.

 11.5.3 Safety Data for the OC5- OL-01 S tudy  
The OC5 -OL-01 study started in May 2014 and ended in January 2020. Fourteen subjects were 
screened and  12 subjects  were enrolled in the study and received study drug . This study 
included late-stage patients with ESRD who were on dialysis. Most of these subjects  were on 
a waiting list for transplantation . Eight subjects continued into the continued treatment phase 
of the study . There were  no severe nor serious related adverse events for Oxabact in this  study.  
Overall the safety data accrued to date would suggest that the OC5 drug product is safe and 
well tolerated and appears to have a similar safety profile as the earl ier OC3 drug product. 
Further safety information of the OC5- OL-01, OC5- DB-02 and OC5- OL-02 studies has been 
detailed in the current version of the Oxabact Investigator’s Brochure.  
11.5.4 Systemic Infections due to O. formigenes   
O. formigenes  is a commensal bacterium in the intestinal tract and is a strict anaerobe. 
Following an extensive search of the literature, there have been no reports of local or systemic infections where O. formigenes  have been isolated.  Preparations of O. formigenes  have been 
administered to rats, pigs and humans without any apparent toxicity or side effects including 
local or systemic infections. O. formigenes  is dependent on oxalate as carbon source and cannot 
use any other carbohydrate source. In the completed clinical studies, no subject experienced 
any infection due to O. formigenes .  
Any subject  who develops signs and symptoms of bacteremia requiring hospitalization  should 
be evaluated to identif y the source of infection (e.g. lung, GI tract, meningeal ). Evaluat ion for 
the source of bacterial infection should include clinical and laboratory tests and cultures for 
common pathogens. Empiric antibiotic treatment should include coverage for common 
pathogens. It is recommended that an Infectious Diseases Specialist be  consulted to assist in 
the assessment and management of the subject.  
O. formigenes  has shown sensitivity  to chloramphenicol, doxycycline, erythromycin, and 
tetracycline. In the event of unexpected infection caused by the study medication erythromycin is the recommended first line antibiotic therapy in children and adults, and tetracycline is the 
recommended second line antibiotic therapy in older children and adults. If common pathogens have been excluded or if the infection is not responding to erythromyc in or tetracycline the 
study medication should be stopped until further evaluation. 
11.5.5 Elevated Levels of Plasma F ormate  
Since Oxalobacter formigenes  converts oxalate to formate in the intestine , there may 
theoretically be a possibility of elevated plasma for mate levels following administration of high 
doses of OC5. However, formate is metabolized by a number of bacteria in the gut microbiota. 
Formate is a metabolite of methanol responsible for the toxicity observed with methanol poisoning. Typically , toxic effects require prolonged exposure to elevated plasma formate 
levels.  
The potential for elevated plasma formate levels following administration of OC5 is 
theoretically limited due to the limited availability of endogenous oxalate . Over 100 subjects  
have been exposed to date to Oxabact (OC3 and OC5) with doses up to NLT 10
9 CFU in studies 
up to 12 months. There have been no signs or symptoms of elevated formate plasma levels, 
metabolic acidosis or methanol poisoning. The main manifestations of methanol poisoning are metabolic acidosis and ocular toxicity. Any subject  who develops signs and symptoms of 
metabolic acidosis should be evaluated to identify the source (e.g. evaluation of serum bicarbonate, blood pH, anion gap, osmolality gap and plasma forma te).  
Protocol OC5- DB-02 – Version 11   08 January  2021

Protocol rev 0 11                                      08 January 2021                                           Page 73 of 92 
 Formate accumulation in plasma is the main reason for acidosis in early, uncomplicated stages 
of metabolic acidosis.  Metabolic acidosis is characterized  by low blood pH (arterial pH < 7.38 
or venous pH < 7.34) or low levels of serum bicarbonate, HCO 3-(< 18 mmol/L). Decreased 
levels of serum bicarbonate will serve as an indication of elevated levels of formate. The OC5 -
DB-02 study will investigate this early sign of elevated plasma formate as part of routine safety 
labs. Low levels of serum bicarbonate  should trigger determination of the anion gap and the 
osmotic gap in order to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis due to elevated 
formate levels.  
If metabolic acidosis is diagnosed, the acidosis should be corrected as quickly as possi ble and 
therapy provided, if appropriate. If a diagnosis due to elevated formate levels cannot be 
excluded or if the metabolic acidosis cannot be corrected by standard of care the study 
medication should be stopped until further evaluation. Further evaluation should then include levels of plasma formate and visual disturbance test. 
11.6  Laboratory Safety Measurements  
The laboratory safety tests include:  
• Haematology:  Erythrocytes, Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, 
Neutrophils, Basophils, Eosinophils, Platelets, Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, MCV, MCHC. 
 
• Chemistry :  Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), electrolytes (Na+, K+, Mg++, 
Ca++, HCO 3-, Cl), glucose, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, and total protein.  
• FSH for postmenopausal women (see Section 7.3 ) at the screening visit only.  
• Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential at baseline and week 52. 
• Random Urine (Urinalysis):  protein, glucose, pH. 
Laboratory parameters for safety assessment from haematology  and chemistry will be assessed 
at the central laboratory BARC. Urinalysis will be done at the local lab at each clinic. 
Laboratory safety tests will be performed as specified in Table 5.  
11.7  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements  on study  include temperature and blood pressure (systolic and 
diastolic), heart rate , respiratory rate (assessed after 5 minutes resting in a supine position) and 
weight . Weight will be measured using a calibrated scale with the subject lightly clothed and 
shoes off. Height will be measured using a calibrated wall mounted stadiometer. Height should be reported for all subjects in wh om the Schwartz equation is used to determine eGFR. This 
would apply to children ( subjects  under 18 years of age) and to any subject who turn 18 during 
the study period. For subjects  who are adults at study start, height will only be recorded at 
screening.  
11.8  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations include appearance, gastrointestinal system, dermatological system, EENT, head and neck, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, musculo- skeletal system, 
peripheral nervous system. Additional examinations may be done at the Investigators discretion.

 11.9  Pregnancy  
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the course of the study the subject  must immediately 
contact the Principal Investigator who should complete the pregnancy form and report the 
pregnancy within 24 h and send the form to ProductLife Limited. The administration of study 
medication should immediately be stopped, i.e. the subject  will be withdrawn from study  
treatment . The subject must be followed until birth and the birth outcome must be documented 
within  6 to 8 weeks on the pregnancy form (detailed instruction can be found in the Saf ety 
Management Plan). 
11.10  Data and Safety M onitoring B oard  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ) is the primary data and safety advisory group 
for the Sponsor  (OxThera) cons isting of independent clinical and statistical experts for study 
OC5 -DB-02. Treatment with Oxabact has been shown to be well tolerated with no particular 
safety concerns in six completed studies, and one ongoing interventional study.  
The DSMB  will periodi cally review safety data, evaluate excess adverse effects and judge 
whether the overall integrity and conduct of the trial remain acceptable, and make 
recommendations to the Sponsor . The DSMB will meet shortly after study start, and then have 
regular meeti ngs every 3 -4 months. During the meetings, the DSMB will review general safety 
data (reported AEs, SAEs, SUSARs, safety labs and other safety variables that may be applicable) and will not be unblinded to treatment assignment, unless specifically requested by 
the DSMB. The DSMB will discuss their findings in closed sessions and convey their recommendations to the Sponsor in an open session in which the sponsor attends to make necessary decisions from a safety perspective.  
The DSMB will be authorized to make  recommendations to the Sponsor regarding safety 
issues, study conduct, and modifications to or termination of the study in the event that significant safety concerns arise during the study conduct. There will be no pre -defined 
discontinuation rules or for mal statistical analyses performed as part of the DSMB to assess 
termination of the trial for efficacy or futility.  
The DSMB will be advisory to the clinical trial leadership group at the Sponsor. The Sponsor 
will be responsible for promptly reviewing the  DSMB recommendations, formulating 
decisions whether to continue or terminate the trial, and determine whether amendments to the 
protocol or changes in study conduct are required from a safety perspective.

 12 STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1  Study Populations  
The efficacy population (Full Analysis Set, FAS ) will include all randomized subjects who had 
at least baseline, one post -baseline assessment and received at least one dose of study 
medication.  
The evaluable population (Per Protocol Analysis Set) will include  all randomized subjects 
included in the FAS who have taken at least 80% of scheduled doses of study medication, as 
judged by dispensation and return of study drug, and who provide at least two eligible 
measurement s of plasma oxalate during treatment. Protocol deviations will be evaluated, and 
any further exclusions from PP will be decided prior to database lock and unblinding. 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the efficacy population as well 
as the evaluable population respectively  and as randomi zed. The efficacy population will be 
the primary population for efficacy analyses. 
The safety population will consist of all randomized  subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study drug. Safety analyses will be based on the safety population and as treated .   
12.2 Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels  
The mixed effect repeated measures model will be utilized to compare the treatment arms with 
respect to the primary endpoint with the null hypothesis that t here is no effect of treatment 
(active treatment versus placebo) and the alternative hypothesis that there is an effect of 
treatment (active treatment versus placebo) .  
H0: There is no effect of treatment (active versus placebo) on the 52-week change 
from baseline for total plasma oxalate.  
 
HA: There is an effect of of treatment (active versus placebo) on the 52 -week change 
from baseline for total plasma oxalate.  
Statistical analyses will be performed using a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  
A fixed sequence stepwise multiple testing procedure at the 0.05 level will be performed in the 
pre-specified order of 1) plasma oxalate, 2) eGFR and 3) kidney stone events. When the 
hypothesis tested for an endpoint is statistically significant at the 0.05 level then the subsequent test will be performed at the 0.05 level. When a hypothesis test is not rejected at the 0.05 level then the subsequent analyses will only be considered descriptive. 
12.3  Sample Size Calculation  
In a previous OxThera study OC3- DB-02, with a total of 11 subjects  (7 on active treatment, 4 
on placebo) having a baseline eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m2, a mean difference from baseline 
(screening) in total plasma oxalate concentration of - 4.964 (SD=5.219) μmol/L between active 
treatment versus placebo was observed after 24 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, OxThera 
study OC5 -DB-01 showed a mean difference in total plasma oxalate of -5.299 (SD=3.235) 
after 8 weeks of  treatment in a total of 9 subjects  (7 active, 2 placebo) in subjects  with baseline 
eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
Since for study OC5- DB-02 multiple plasma oxalate measurements will be taken at visits 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, the most appropriate statistical model for the primary endpoint is a 
mixed -effect  repeated  measures  model . It is expected that at week 52 the difference may be

n what has been observed in the previous study OC5- DB-01 at 8 weeks. Therefore, 
for the calculation a conservative mean difference of -5.50 with SD of 4.00 is assumed. Using 
the MRMM model in a two- sided approach with α=5%, β=10% (and thus power= 90%), a 1:1 
allocation ratio and assuming a within subject  correlation of 0.70, the sample size is assessed 
at 9 subjects for each group. With this sample size, a difference of -6.00 with an SD of 4.50 
may be considered to be statistically significant (Oxa bact vs. Placebo). Considering 18 
completers are needed based on this calculation, an estimate of 22 subjects  will be randomized 
to account for possible drop-outs. 
To account for the possiblity of higher than observed variability, please find below Table 10 
sample size estimates for various configurations.

Considering the anticipated 18 completers using a MRMM model in a two- sided approach with 
α=5%, and a within subject correlation of 0.70, the sample size evaluated at 9 subject s for each 
group yield approximately 90% power to identify a difference (SD) of 4 (3) ml/min/1.73m2 in 
eGFR 
change from baseline at week 52 between the treatment arms (Table 11 ).

Due to the l
imited number of patients  in this rare disease population, and the limited amount 
of historical data,  it is not possible to define the expected magnitude of change during the study 
period. Analysis of available data from the OC3- DB-02 study gives an indication of the change 
in the full population over six months treatment as indicated abov e, although the older less 
potent OC3 study drug was used in this study. Furthermore, t he PH population is very 
heterogeneous , and subjects will likely show an individual response to treatment.

Change from baseline  in total plasma oxalate concentration  will be calculated at each visit as 
the visit value minus the mean of the three measurements during baseline. The primary 
statistical analysis will be performed using MRMM analysis based on the FAS  with a model 
that includes the following fixed effects: tr eatment group, baseline plasma oxalate value, 
randomization stratum (PH type 2, PH type 3, not PH type 2 or 3 and baseline urinary oxalate 
excretion ≤ 1.87 mmol/24h/1.73 m2, not PH type 2 or 3 and baseline urinary oxalate excretion 
> 1.87 mmol/24h/1.73 m2), week, and week -by-treatment interaction. The primary comparison
will be between the Week 52 changes from baseline in OC5 and placebo. An autoregressive of
order 1 (AR (1)) variance covariance matrix  will be used for the within subject variation in the
MRMM model. In case there is a convergence problem the following variance covariance
matrix structures will be used in the order of 1) unstructured, 2) Toeplitz, and 3) compound
symmetry (CS). The first (co)variance structure which does not have convergenc e problem will
be the one used for the analysis. Comparisons at other weeks will also be performed
respectively.
Values and change from baseline over time will be summarized . Mean total plasma values over 
time for both treatment groups will be plotted in addition to a plot with the data over time 
presenting one line for each subject . Total plasma oxalate observed minimum and maximum 
post baseline values and change from baseline will also be summarized  and plotted. 
Additionally, and for each subject  a plot presenting both total plasma oxalate and eGFR over 
time will be produced to ilustrate how total plasma oxalate and eGFR change together.  
A sensitivity analysis will also be per formed using MI prior to applying the MRMM analysis.  
As both maximum likelihood (used in the MRMM) and MI assume at least MAR missing data 
will be evaluated and described (Ratitch et al., 2013) . To assess the robustness of the primary 
analysis to possible deviations from the MAR assumption a PMM will be used to support the evaluation of data with missingness mechanism not at random, MNAR. 
Additionally, a second analytical method approach will be provided as supportive analys es (i.e. 
ANCOVA and /or AUC)  and will be further defined in the SAP. 
Secondarily the same analysis will be produced based on the PP analysis set. 
12.5  Key Secondary Endpoint s 
•Change from baseline in kidney function (i.e. eGFR  slope)  after 52 weeks  of treatment  
will be analysed  in the same way  as th e primary end point. Estimated GFR will be 
calculated for the  primary analysis based on the 2009 creatinine-b ased “Schwartz  
bedside” equation (for children below 18 years of age) and the 2009 creatinine-b ased 
CKD-E PI equation for adults. For subjects between 18 and 23 years (both inclusive) of 
ag
e at screening visit 1,  eGFR will be calculated as the average of the eGFR values  
based on the pediatric and adult equations (Ng e t al., 2018). Th e mean  value of  the three  
values obtained at visit 1, 2 and 3 will be considered as the baseline eGFR value for the 
statistical evaluation. Subjects will continuously be evaluated using the same eGFR 
equation as when entering visit 1. Difference in slopes using the proposed time-b y-
treatment interaction will be presented as  well. LS means  will be determined for each 
visit. Supportive summaries will use
 alternative eGFR equations based on the Cystatin-
C based  CKiD/CKD-EPI 2012 equations without modification for subjects between 18 
and 23 years. Historical renal function will be assessed in the context of on-s tudy renal

after 52 weeks of treatment.  
Kidney stone events after 52 weeks of treatment will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics.  Incidence rates  and 95% CIs  of kidney stone events (defined as the number of events 
divided by the total pe rson-years) will be calculated along with the number of stone events and 
the number of subjects  with a stone event. Treatment groups will be compared.  
12.6 Other Endpoints  
• Percent change from baseline in total plasma oxalate concentration after 52 weeks of treatment will be  analyz ed in the same way as the primary endpoint.  
• Subjects achieving ‘near -normalization ’ of total plasma oxalate  concentration ( <10 
µmol/L ) at least twice during weeks 24 to 52 of treatment will be summarized . The 
treatment arms will be compared using the stratified gene ralized Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test of general association including the appropriate stratification factors.  
Exact 95% CIs will be calculated for each treatment arm, and the common odds ratio 
across strata for the treatment arms.
 Wilson’s score method with continuity correction 
will be used to calculate a 95% CI for the  difference in rates . 
• Change from baseline in myocardial function as measured by Speckle Tracking and traditional echocardiography will be  summarized  descriptively over time .  
• Change from baseline in free plasma oxalate after 52 weeks of treatment will be analysed in the same way as the primary endpoint. 
• Change from baseline in urinary oxalate excretion after 52 weeks of treatment.  
• Change from baseline in grade of nephocalcinosis as assessed by Ultrasound   
• Change in number of O. formigenes stool will be based on number of O. formigenes  at 
week 52 compared to baseline in the active group versus placebo. The measurement at week 24 will be used as supportive data. Remaining time -points during the study will 
be used descriptively.  Both O. formigenes  genotype 1 and genotype 2 will be analysed. 
 
• Association  between change in O. formigenes  in stool and change in total plasma 
oxalate concentration will be evaluated in the same way. The measurement at week 24 will be used as supportive data. The method of analysis will be the same as for the primary and secondary endpoints. Remaining time -points during the study will be 
presented descriptively.
 
• Change fro m baseline in score of Quality of Life scores as measured by SF36V2 or 
CHQ/PF50 questionnaires, depending on age, will be summarized  over time and 
compared descriptively between the two treatment groups.    
• Change from baseline in markers for renal  function, renal  tubular capacity  and 
inflammation in urine and plasma will be analysed as the difference between absolute 
change from baseline in the active group and absolute change from baseline in the

 placebo group. The analysis will be based on the week 52 value compared to the mean 
of the three values from baseline for plasma- based analysis and the two values from the 
baseline 24 h urine collections for the urinary based analysis. The measurement at week 
24 will be used as supportive data. The method of ana lysis will be the same as for the 
primary and secondary endpoints. Remaining time -points during the study will be 
presented descriptively.   
12.7  Subgroup A nalysis 
Aspects on Subgroup Analysis B ased  on Previous Studies  
A sub -group analysis has been made based on pooled historical data from treatment with OC3 
(OC3 -DB-02) and OC5 (OC5- DB-01) where the combined patient population was divided into 
sub-groups based on kidney function, plasma oxalate concentration and urinary oxalate 
excretion at baseline. The purpos e of the sub -group analysis was to see whether there were any 
detectable differences with regard to treatment response between the groups.   
Although the number of subjects  in each group is small, the analysis showed that:  
o subjects  with high Urinary oxalate excretion (above 1.87 mmol/24h per 1.73 
m2) 
o subjects  older than18 years 
o subjects  with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 
tend to show a more pronounced treatment response measured as change in plasma oxalate 
concentration and/or change in eGFR over time.  The primary and secondary endpoints will therefore be analysed also in these sub -groups of subjects . 
 
Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analyses of the following endpoints will be performed, total and free oxalate 
concentration, eGFR, urine oxalate, stone events, O. formigenes  in stool, S peckle-T racking 
and traditional echocardiography. The analyses will be based on the following subgroups  
provided there is sufficient sample size : 
• Subjects  with a baseline urinary oxalate excretion above and equal to or below 
1.87 mmol/L/24h/1.73 m
2 respectively (mean of the two values during 
screening/baseline).  
• Subjects  above or equal to and below 18 years of age at baseline.       
• Subjects  with a baseline eGFR above or equal to and below 60 ml/min/1.73m2 
respectively (mean of the obtained values during screening/baseline calculated 
by the Schwartz CKiD ( 2009 creatinine -based “bedside Schwartz” equ ation for 
children (below 18 years of age) and 2009 creatinine- based CKD -EPI equation 
for adults).  
• Race.     
• Gender.  
• Progressors and non-progressors based on historic eGFR (i.e. eGFR prior to treatment start ). 
• Use of  vitamin B6  at baseline.

 For the subgroup analyses , only the primary method of analysis will be used. Subgroups may 
also be analysed using  alternative eGFR equations.  No formal testing of subgroups will be 
performed due to small sample sizes.  
12.8 Safety  
The safety will be assessed through collection and analyses of adverse events (AEs), baseline 
medical conditions, laboratory tests, vital sign data  and physical examinations . Listings of AE’s 
and SAE’s will be provided along with narratives. Adverse events will be categorized  by SOC 
and Preferred Term from MedDRA. The focus of the adverse event summaries will be on treatment -emergent adverse events  defined as occurring from the first dose in ePHex  until;  
• up to 14 days after the last dose of double- blind treatment, or  
• the first day of open- label Oxabact treatment of ePHex -OLE,  
whichever occurs earlier. Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized using counts 
and percentages overall, serious, by severity, and by relationship to study product.  
Values over time and cha nges from baseline and shifts from baseline will be summarized by 
treatment group. Continuous parameters will be summarized by number of non- missing 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical 
parameters will be summar ized by count and percent.  
12.9  Randomization  
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled double -blind multi- centre study. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to OC5 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects  will be stratified firstly in an 
attempt to achieve an even distribution of PH type 2 /type 3 patients and secondly to stratify the 
PH type 1 patients for a baseline urinary oxalate excretion above or below or equal to 1.87 
mmol/24h/1.73 m2 (based on the mean of the first two visits  from screening /baseline).  
12.10  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics   
Demographic variables and other baseline characteristics will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum) for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. These summaries will be produced for the efficacy population, evaluable population and safety population. 
12.11  Statistical Analysis 
All statistical analyses will be further defined in a Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . Any 
deviations from the SAP will be described and justified in the Clinical Study Report.  
12.11.1 Data I mputation  
Both maximun likelihood, as used in MRMM, and MI are the preferred methods to address 
missing data considered at least missing at randon. MRMM is the preferred method and uses 
all available data to provide unbiased estimates and therefore no imputation is required. 
Additional sensitivity analys es will be performed based on MI prior to the MRMM analyses  
and PMM. The extent and reasons for missing data will be evaluated.

 13 DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
The investigator/institution should permit study -related monitoring, audits, IEC review and 
regulatory inspections, and should provide direct access to the source data/medical record. 
The m onitor should verify that each subject has consented in writing to direct access to the 
original medical record/source data (by the use of written patient information and signed 
informed consent). During the monitoring, the data recorded in the eCRFs by th e investigator 
will be checked for consistency with the source documents/medical record by the study monitor (source data verification). Any discrepancies of data should be documented and explained in the monitoring reports. 
For each subject, the medical r ecords should include the minimum following information: 
• subject number and study id 
• date for information given, signing informed consent, screening 
• treatments given, including investigational product(s) 
• visits to the clinic  
• AE/SAE, if any  
• concomitant medi cation  
• time and reason for discontinuation, if any 
There are data that are recorded only on the eCRF, which are associated with protocol -specific 
procedures and not with normal clinical care practice. For such clinical data the investigator 
would not be expected to duplicate the information. Source data location will then be specified 
in the Investigator file.

 14 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
14.1  Monitoring and Audits  
Monitoring of the study will be arranged by the sponsor according to GCP guidelines. 
Monitoring visits will be performed regularly to the study sites during the study, to ensure that 
all aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be review ed for verification of 
consistency with data recorded on the Case Report Forms and product accountability will be 
performed as a part of the monitoring visits.  
The study site may also be subject to quality assurance audits by the sponsor /CRO  as well as 
inspection by the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
It is important that the investigator and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits /inspections , that study related records are made available, 
and that sufficient time is devoted to the monitoring process. 
14.2  Site Personnel  
Investigators and other key personnel shall provide curriculum vitae or equivalent, that will 
confirm their suitability for the clinical study. All investigators and key personnel should be listed together with their responsibilities in the study on a signature and delegation log.

 15 ETHICS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
15.1  Ethics R eview  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written approval of the study protocol (incl. 
the patient information and informed consent) and subsequent protocol amendments from the 
IEC. The investigator should file all correspondence with the IEC, and a list of the IEC 
composition (names and position) should be filed in the Investigator File. A copy of the IEC approval should be forwarded to the sponsor.  
15.2  Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with the recommendations guiding physicians in 
biomedical research involving human subjects  adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly, 
Helsinki, Finland, 1964 and later revisions and applicable ICH GCP guidelines. 
The investigator is responsible for complying with all reporting procedures applicable to their 
IEC. 
15.3  Written I nformed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to give each subject, prior to inclusion in the study, full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the purpose and procedures of the 
study and the possible risks involved. The subjects must be informed about their right to 
withdraw from the study at any time, and that such withdrawal will not affect their future 
medical care, treatment or benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. The subjects 
should be informed that the results will be stored and analysed in a computer, maintaining confidentiality in accordanc e with local data protection laws.  
Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain signed informed consent from 
all subjects  prior to initiation of any study -related activity. As the study involves children, age 
specific patient informa tion sheets and parent information sheets should be prepared, and 
subject and/or parental consenting should depend on the age of the subject. The investigator or his/her designated representative, who gave the verbal and written information about the study  
to the subject, must also sign the informed consent form. A copy of the written patient 
information must be handed to each subject, to bring home. The investigator will confirm the 
receipt of informed consent from each subject by a recording in the eCRF. The signed Informed 
Consent forms should be filed by the Investigator in the Investigator File for possible future 
audits and inspections.  
The investigator must always use the current IEC approved Patient Information/Informed 
Consent Form and it must not be changed without prior discussion with the sponsor and approval from the IEC. 
15.4  Regulatory Requirements  
The study will be performed in compliance with national regulatory requirements. As with the 
IEC, clinical trial authorization from the appropriate Regulatory Authority(ies) must be sought 
and obtained (as applicable to local country regulations), prior to the start of the study. The investigational product for this study will not be shipped to a study site until a copy of the 
applicable Regulatory Authority approval has been received by the sponsor. In addition, the 
Regulatory Authority(ies) must approve amendments (as instructed by OxThera), receive

 16 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
16.1  Case Report Forms  
Study data for all subjects  will be collected in a confidential fashion using an electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF). All the information required by the protocol must be documented and 
any omissions explained. The investigator must review all eCRF entries for completeness and 
accurac y. Source documents, including all demographic and medical information, eCRFs and 
informed consent form for each subject  in the study must be maintained by the Inve stigator. 
All information in th e eCRFs must be traceable to the original source documents.  
The eCRF must be signed and dated by the investigator who takes responsibility for the 
accuracy, completeness and legibility of the data reported to the sponsor in the e CRFs.  
Medical history, concomitant medication and Adverse Events will be coded using standardized medical dictionaries  (medical dictionary for regulatory activities; MedDR A).  
16.2  Retention of Records  
All essential documents must be safely retained by the investigator for at least 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug, for the indication for which it is being 
investigated; or if no application is filed or if the app lication is not approved for such indication 
for 15 years after the investigation is discontinued and the regulatory authorities are notified.   
16.3  Protection of Personal Data 
The completion of the Study involves the collection and processing of Personal Data. All 
processing of Personal Data at the clinic and by the sponsor must be carried out in accordance 
with national legislation concerning the protection of Personal Data.  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s privacy is maintained. On the eCRF or other 
documents submitted to OxThera, subjects  will be identified by a subject ID number only. 
Documents that are not submitted to OxThera (e.g., signed informed consent form) should be kept in a strictly confidential file by the investigator.  
The investigator shall permit direct access to subjects’  records and source document for the 
purposes of monitoring, auditing, or inspection by OxThera, authorized representatives of 
OxThera, Regulatory Authorities and IECs. 
As part of the required content of the  informed consent, subjects  will be informed that their 
records may be reviewed by OxThera’s designee and by regulatory agencies. Should access to 
medical record require a separate waiver or authorization, it is the Investigator’s responsibility 
to obtain such permission from the subject in writing before the subject is entered into the study.

 17 FINANCING, INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE  
The Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) outlines the compensation and payment terms of the 
study. The CTA must be signed before the start of the study. If there are differences between 
the CTA and the Protocol regarding certain rights and obligations the CTA is the prevailing document. Indemnification is covered by the CTA between the sponsor and the Institution. 
OxThera has civil liability insurance, which covers this study in all participating countries.

 18 CONFIDENTIALITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND 
PUBLICATION POLICY 
Investigator’s, Institution’s and OxThera IP AB’s obligations regarding intellectual property, 
confidentiality and publication are described in detail in the Clinical Trial Agreement. They can be summarized  as follows;  
All information (whatever form) disclosed by OxThera to Institution, or generated pursuant to this study, shall be deemed to be confidential information. Except as required by applicable 
law, Institution shall not use or disclose to any party OxThera 's confidential information received pursuant to this study or otherwise, without the prior written consent of OxThera. All data generated or arising from the  performance of the study shall be the exclusive property of 
OxThera.  
It is intended to publish the results of the study as a whole once all subjects  have completed 
the study and the study has been analysed. If there is a publication, the Investigator that  has the 
highest number of treated subjects  will be the lead author, unless otherwise agreed. The 
investigator may not publish the results of their cohort of subjects  until the full study has been 
submitted for publication. The investigator may not submit for publication or present the results 
of this study without allowing OxThera 30 days in which to review and comment on the pre -
publication manuscript. The investigator may not submit the results of the study for publication 
without the prior consent of OxThera, unless the review period has passed and there has been no reaction from the sponsor.

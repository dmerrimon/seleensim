Study Title  
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled, Double -Blind Study of the Efficacy 
and Safety of Apremilast (CC -10004) in Subjec ts with Moderate to Severe Genital Psoriasis   
Indication  
The indication is moderate to severe genital psoriasis.  
Objectives  
Primary Objective  
 To evaluate the clinical efficacy of oral apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID), compared to 
placebo, in subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis during the 16 -week 
Placebo -controlled Phase.  
Secondary Objectives  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared with placebo, 
in subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis  
 To eva luate the effect of apremilast 30 mg BID compared with placebo on genital 
psoriasis symptoms  
 To evaluate the effect of apremilast 30 mg BID compared with placebo on Health -related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL)  
Study Design  
This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -10004) in subjects with moderate to severe 
genital psoriasis (modified Static Physician Global Assessment  of Gen italia (sPGA -G)  3, 
moderate or severe) . 
Approximately 286 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either apremilast 
30 mg BID or placebo for the first 16 weeks. Subjects will be randomized based on a permuted 
block randomization using a c entralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  
 Subjects randomized to the apremilast 30 mg BID treatment group will receive 
apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily for the first 16 weeks  
 Subjects randomized to the placebo treatment group will recei ve placebo tablets 
(identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally twice daily for the first 
16 weeks  
 All subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily after the Week  16 
Visit through the end of the Apremilast Extension Pha se of the study  
The study will consist of four phases:  
 Screening  Phase  – up to 35 days 
 Double -blind Placebo-controlled Phase  – Weeks  0 to 16

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  6 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021   Subjects will be rand omly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either apremilast 30 mg BID 
or placebo .   
 Apremilast Extension  Phase  – Weeks  16 to 32 
 All subjects will be sw itched to (or continue to) receive apremilast 30 mg BID.  
All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32.  
 Observational F ollow-up Phas e – 4 weeks  
 Four-week  Post-Treatment Observational  Follow-up Phase for all subjects who 
complete the study or discontinu e the study prematurely.  
After all subjects have completed the Week 16 Visit (or discontinued from the study), a Week  16 
data restriction will be performed; the primary data analysis will be con ducted and a Week  16 
Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be generated. However, unblinded data will only be made 
available to select Sponsor and Contract Research Organization (CRO) team members involved 
with analysis of the data and preparation of the Week 1 6 CSR. All other Sponsor, site, and CRO 
personnel directly involved with the conduct of the study, will remain blinded to treatment 
assignments until the final database lock at the conclusion of the study.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with Int ernational Council on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
Study Population  
Approximately  286 adult subject s  18 years of age with chronic moderate to severe genital 
psoriasis  (modified  sPGA -G 3 [moderate or severe]) wil l be randomized.  Only subjects who 
are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of topical therapies for the treatment of genital 
psoriasis will be eligible for the study.  
Length of Study  
The study is designed as a 32 -week study with a Four -week Post -treatment Observatio nal 
Follow -up Visit and consists of 4 phases as described above.  Please refer to Section  1.3.2  for 
details. 
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow -up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary and/or explorat ory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.  
Study Treatments  
The chemical name of apremilast (CC -10004) is acetamide, N -[2-[(1S) -1-(3-ethoxy -4- 
methoxyphenyl) -2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl] -2,3-dihydro -1,3-dioxo -1H-isoindol -4-yl]. 
From Weeks 0 to 16, subjects will be dispensed blister cards with 10, 20, or 30 mg apremilast 
tablets or identically appearing 10, 20, or 30 mg placebo tablets.  
Inves tigational product will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without 
restriction of food or drink.  As in prior Phase 3 studies, dose titration will be implemented in 
order to mitigate potential gastrointestinal -related adverse events (AEs).  During Week 0 
(Days 1-7), subjects will be dispensed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  7 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  apremilast tablets or identically appea ring placebo for the dose titration.  Start ing at Week 16, 
subjects originally randomized to apremilast will co ntinue with apremilast.  Subjects  originally  
randomized to placebo at Week 0 will be switched to apremilast at Week  16.  Dose titration 
blister cards will  be used for subjects switching fr om placebo to apremilast; dummy  titration 
blister cards (dosing at 30 mg BID directly) will be used for subjects ini tially randomized to 
receive apremilast 30 mg BID. Starting at the Week 20 Visit through Week 32, all subjects will 
receive open -label apremilast (APR) 30 mg BID tablets in hig h-densi ty polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles.  
Dose modifications are not permitted in this study.  
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments  
Primary Efficacy Assessment  
 Modified  Static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA -G) 
Additional Efficacy Assessments  
 Static Physician Global Assessme nt (sPGA)  
 Body Surface Area (BSA)  
 Genital Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS)  
 Genital Psoriasis Itch Numeric Rating Scale (GPI -NRS)  
 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
Overview of Key Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will include:  
 Adverse events  
 Vital signs  
 Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
 Clinical laboratory tests  
Statistical Methods  
It is assumed that modified  sPGA -G response will be similar to historic sPGA response. With a 
total of approximately 286 subjects and a randomization ratio of 1:1, Study PSOR -025 will 
randomize approximately 143 subjects to apremilast (APR) 30 BID and 143 subjects to placebo. 
This sample size will provide 85 power to detect a treatment difference of 15  at Week 16 
(25 for APR 30 BID and 10  for placebo) for the primary endpoint using a chi -square test at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 after adjusting for a 20  dropout rate.  
The analyses of efficacy endpoints will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, defined 
as all subjects who are randomized . Statistical comparisons will be made between APR 30  BID 
and placebo for the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16). All statistical tests will be at the 
2-sided 0.05 significance level  and the corresponding p -values will be reported.

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  8 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  The treatment difference for the primary endpoint will be compared betw een APR 30 BID and 
placebo using a Cochran Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratification factor. The 
2-sided p -values from the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the 
weighted average of the treatment differences a cross the stratification factor with the CMH 
weights, along with the associated 2 -sided 95 confidence intervals (CIs) using a normal 
approximation to the weighted average will be provided. Missing values at Week 16 will be 
imputed using multiple imputatio n (MI) as the primary method, with sensitivity analysis using 
the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method.  
The continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) as the primary method. The MMRM model will use the cha nge or percent change 
from baseline as the response variable and include treatment group, visit time, treatment -by-time 
interaction, and stratification factor as fixed effects, and the baseline value as a covariate. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will b e used to model the correlation among repeated 
measurements. The Kenward -Roger adjustment will be used with restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) to make proper statistical inference. Within -group least -squares (LS) means and the 
associated standard errors (SEs) and 2 -sided 95 CIs, treatment differences in LS means and the 
associated 2 -sided 95 CIs and 2 -sided p -values will be derived from the MMRM model. A 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatmen t and stratification factor as the fixed effects, the baseline value as the covariate and the 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) method to impute the missing data at Week 16.  
The other binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoi nt using the CMH 
test.  
To control the overall type I error rate, a fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used to test the 
primary and secondary endpoints in a predefined order. The test will be performed in sequence 
and significance of all preceding endpoints is required in order to proceed to the next one. The 
proposed sequence of testing for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints is specified in 
Section  9.6.1.3 . 
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all subjects who 
are randomized and receive at least one dose of inves tigational product. Safety will be assesse d 
by clinical review of all relevant parameters including treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs; no inferential testing for statistical significance will be 
performed.  
Adverse events will be classified using the Medic al Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class, 
preferred term, severity and relationship to investigational product. TEAEs leading to death or to 
discontinuation from treatment an d serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized and listed 
separately.  
Data from other safety assessments will be summarized descriptively. Shift tables for laboratory 
parameters showing the number of subjects with values low, normal, and high comparing  with 
the normal reference ranges pre -treatment versus post treatment will be provided.  
To account for the different exposure to the investigational product, AEs or marked laboratory 
abnormalities will also be summarized using the exposure adjusted inciden ce rate, in addition to 
the simple incidence rates.

1.1. Disease Background  
Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, immunological disease involving the skin and/or joints that may 
profoundly affect quality of life and result in a significant socioeconomic burden (World Health 
Organization [ WHO] Global Report on Psoriasis, 2016; Van Voorhees, 2016 ). Genital psoriasis, 
defined as psoriasis in the peri -vaginal region, penis, scrotum and perineum ( Menter, 2018 ) has 
been reported as the most stigmatizing form of psoriasis, regardless of overall disease severity 
(Schmid -Ott, 1999 ).  Genital involvement has been shown to have a profound impact on quality 
of life and sexua l health ( Meeuwis, 2011 ; Meeuwis, 2015 ; Ryan,  2015 ).  In addition, patients 
with genital psoriasis report high levels of itching, pain and discomfort ( Meeuwis, 2011 ; Ryan, 
2015 ). 
Involvement of genital skin has been reported to occur in 29 -46 of psoriasis patients 
(Meeuwis,  2015 ), but underreporting of genital skin involvement has been a concern.  In an 
observational, mu lticenter study of 354 consecutive psoriasis patients by Ryan (2015) , 63 of 
patients reported genital involvement currently and/or previously during the course of their 
disease.  
Genital psoriasis is characterized as plaque psoriasi s, although lesions may differ in appearance 
from those in other body areas.  Genital plaques are more likely to be thinner and less scaly than 
psoriatic plaques located elsewhere ( Menter, 2008 ; Papp, 2009 ; Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products 
Indicated for the Treatment of Psoriasis, 2005 ).   Local conditions in the genital area such as 
warmth, moisture and frictio n from clothing may lead to maceration, fissuring and chafing, and 
may impede both accurate diagnosis and treatment as well as healing ( Guglielmetti, 2012 ).   
1.2. Compound Background  
Apremilast (CC -10004) is a specific phosphodiesterase  type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under 
development for use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.  The PDE4 is one of the major 
phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocytes. PDE4 inhibition by apremilast elevates cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in  immune cells, which in turn down -regulates the 
inflammatory response by reducing the expression of pro -inflammatory mediators such as tumor 
necrosing factor (TNF) , interleukin (IL) -23, IL -17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and 
increasing the producti on of anti -inflammatory mediators.  
In completed Phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active 
psoriatic arthritis, treatment with apremilast was associated with statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvem ents in multiple efficacy measures. On the basis of these studies, 
apremilast (OTEZLA) is approved in approximately 50 countries  worldwide for the treatment 
of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and the treatment of adult  patients with moderat e 
to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Apremilast 
is also approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers 
associated with Behçet’s disease.

psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet’s disease  are also ongoing.

profile of the investigational product (IP).  
1.3. Rationale  
1.3.1.  Study Rationale and Purpose  
Topical therapies are the first line of treatment for genital psoriasis. However, topical treatment 
may be limited by short treatment durations, poor treatment compliance, limited efficacy and 
significant adverse effects such as tachyphylaxis, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and 
hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis suppression ( Chan, 2009 ; Kragballe, 2013 ).  
Evaluation of systemic therapies for the treatment of genital psoriasis has been limited 
(Guglielmetti,  2012 ; Meeuwis 2015 ).  To date only the IL -17 inhibitor ixekizumab has 
demonstrated both dermatologic and psychosocial improvements in patients with moderate to 
severe genital psoriasis ( Ryan, 2017 ; Cather, 2018 ).  Other systemic therapies used to treat 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have not been studied in moderate to severe genital psoriasis.  
Therefore, the benefit -risk profile of these agents in patients with genital psoriasis ha s not been 
well defined.  
There remains an unmet medical need for an effective, convenient treatment for moderate to 
severe genital psoriasis that is well tolerated compared to the currently available treatment 
options.   
Apremilast (APR, OTEZLA) is a dru g that is taken orally (by mouth [PO]).  Apremilast inhibits 
the enzyme PDE4, which is a cAMP -specific PDE and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells.  
By inhibiting PDE4, apremilast elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn modulates a 
network of pro- and anti -inflammatory mediators and reduces the inflammatory response.  
Evaluation of apremilast in a randomized clinical study of genital psoriasis will provide robust 
analysis of the benefit -risk of a systemic therapy in this difficult to treat popu lation. Apremilast 
may offer patients with moderate to severe genital psoriasis an effective oral therapy with a 
novel mechanism of action and a favorable safety profile.  
1.3.2.  Rationale for the Study Design  
This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo -control led, double -blind study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -10004) in subjects with moderate to severe 
genital psoriasis,  who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of topical therapy. The 
enrolled adult subjects will have a  modified  static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia 
(sPGA -G) score of  3 (moderate or severe) and evidence of plaque psoriasis (Body Surface 
Area [BSA]  1) in a non -genital region and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA)  3 
(moderate o r severe).  This is a 32 -week study comprised of a 16 -week Placebo -controlled Phase 
followed by a 16 -week Apremilast Extension Phase where all subjects will receive apremilast 
(APR) 30 twice daily (BID).  The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a modified  
Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  17 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  sPGA -G score of 0 (clear) or 1 ( almost clear ) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline  at 
Week 16.   
The efficacy and safety of apremilast in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have 
been demonstrated across multiple cl inical trials.  In the pivotal Phase 3 studies (PSOR -008 and 
PSOR -009), significant improvement in difficult to treat areas of psoriasis such as nail, scalp and 
palmoplantar were observed in subjects treated with apremilast, however, genital manifestations  
were not assessed in these trials.  Study PSOR -025 will be the first study to investigate use of 
apremilast in the treatment of moderate to severe genital psoriasis.   
The sample size estimation of approximately 286 subjects with a randomization ratio of 1:1 is 
based on extrapolation of results from Phase 3 and 4 studies with apremilast, where an sPGA 
treatment effect of  compared to placebo was demonstrated.  
Study PSOR -025 will enroll adult subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis of at least 6 months  
duration, and evidence of plaque psoriasis BSA  1 in a non -genital region and sPGA  3 
(moderate or severe) .  Subjects will have moderate or severe genital psoriasis with a  modified  
sPGA -G score of  3 (moderate or severe), who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of 
topical therapy.  Prior treatment for psoriasis will be stopped for specified durations before 
randomization as follows: Topical therapy at least 2 weeks, phototherapy and conve ntional 
systemic therapy at least 4 weeks,  biologic therapy with a TNF or IL -17 blocker at least 
12 weeks and anti -IL-12 or IL -23 monoclonal antibodies at least 24 weeks before randomization, 
and no concomitant psoriasis therapy (topical, photo or systemic ) will be permitted during the 
active treatment period of the study (except for a non -medicated moisturizer such as Eucerin or 
non-medicated shampoo).  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with a modified sPGA -G score of 0 
(clear) or 1 ( almost clear ) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline  at Week 16. Based on 
health authority feedback, the sPGA -G described by Merola has been modified from a 6 -point to 
a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).  The modified  sPGA -G score incorporates an 
assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque  
elevation at a given time point, and was developed as an efficacy outcome measure in the clinical 
assessment of the severity of genital psorias is, based on sPGA scales used in clinical studies 
(Merola, 2017 ; Menter, 2018 ).  Assessment of sPGA -G response was the primary endpoint in a 
recent ixekizumab genital psoriasis study ( Cather, 2018 ).  
In the proposed study population of subjects with a baseline of modified  sPGA -G of  3 
(moderate or severe), who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of topical therapy. 
Amgen  believes that achieving a modified  sPGA -G score of clear (0) or almost clear  (1) with at 
least a 2 -point reduction from baseline  at Week 16 will represent a clinically meaningful benefit 
in subjects with limited treatment options.   
Further supporting the decision to use modified sPGA -G, the CHMP Guidelines (2005 ) 
recognize that Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) has not been adapted for difficult to 
treat manifestations of psoriasis such as the scalp or in the genital region and recommend the use 
of a PGA to assess efficacy.  Similar to the development of a Scalp Physician Global Assessment 
(ScPGA), the modified sPGA -G serves as a clinical outcome measure of severity in genital 
psoriasis.  

Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  18 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  Study PSOR -025 will enroll subjects with total body plaque psoriasis ranging in  skin 
involvement (BSA  1).  Unlike the PASI scoring system, modified sPGA -G is not limited by 
a decrease in sensitivity in less extensive disease.  Stratification by psoriasis -affected BSA will 
be performed (BSA  10 or  10) and the strata with BSA  10 will take  40 of the 
total enrollment  to allow an assessment of efficacy in subjects with greater or lesser overall skin 
involvement.   
The first secondary endpoint will be proportion of subjects achieving an overall sPGA score of 
clear (0) or almos t clear  (1) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline .  
Other secondary endpoints of response will include the proportion of subjects with a 4 -point 
reduction (improvement) from baseline in the Genital Psoriasis Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
(GPI -NRS) sc ore at Week 16.  The GPI -NRS is one of eight components of the validated Genital 
Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS) which was developed to assess symptoms that are particularly 
burdensome to subjects with genital psoriasis ( Gottlieb, 20 18).  The GPSS was modeled after the 
Whole Body Itch numeric rating scale (NRS) instrument, which has been previously validated in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( Naegeli, 2015 ).  While all eight components 
of the GPSS and total symptoms score will be included as a secondary endpoint, the significant 
impact of itch on quality of life in subjects with genital psoriasis warrants additional attention.  
Pruritus is a common and frequently reported symptom of plaque psor iasis, occurring on a daily 
basis in 77  of subjects with extensive psoriasis ( Yosipovitch, 2000 ).  In an observational, 
multicenter study of 354 subjects with current and/or previous genital psoriasis, itch was reported 
by 86 of pa rticipants ( Ryan, 2015 ).  In study PSOR -025, assessment of genital itch will be 
conducted from baseline (Visit 2) through the Apremilast Extension Phase. In addition to 
GPI-NRS, change from baseline in affected BSA, change from basel ine in Dermatology Life 
Quality Index ( DLQI) total score, and change from baseline in GPSS total score and individual 
items scores will be assessed at Week 16.  
1.3.3.  Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection  
In a Phase 2 dose finding study (CC -10004 -PSOR-005), a clear dose response was demonstrated 
with statistically significant improvement in apremilast 30 mg BID, but not the apremilast 10  mg 
BID treatment groups, compared with placebo. The safety and tolerability profiles of the 
apremilast 30 mg BID t reatment group were acceptable with no clinically significant safety 
signals. The apremilast 30 mg BID dose was evaluated in two large pivotal Phase 3 studies 
(studies CC -10004 -PSOR -008 and CC -10004 -PSOR -009) and was subsequently approved for 
use in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy.   Since the outcome of apremilast treatment on genital psoriasis 
has not been evaluated previously, this study will directly investigate the safety an d efficacy of 
this dosing regimen in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis.  
1.3.4.  Rationale for Choice of Comparator Compounds  
A randomized, double -blind placebo -controlled design was chosen in order to measure the 
absolute treatment effect of apremilast 30 mg BID in moderate to severe genital psoriasis.  The 
placebo -controlled design also minimizes subject and investigator bias in evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of apremilast in the selected patient population (Food and D rug Administration [FDA] 
Guidance for Industry E10).

Confidential and Proprietary  19 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  1.3.5.  Rationale for Pharmacodynamics and Potential Predictive Biomarkers  
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is the predominant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -
selective phosphodiesterase that regulates intracell ular cAMP levels and gene expression in cells 
of the immune system. PDE4 is highly overexpressed in the peripheral blood of a subset of 
psoriasis subjects ( Schafer, 2016 ). Apremilast has been found to reduce Th17 and Th22 cytok ine 
expression in the lesional skin and peripheral blood of psoriasis subjects ( Gottlieb, 2013; 
Krueger, 2016 ). In subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis, treatment with apremilast is 
associated with significant reductions in plasma levels of interleukin (IL) -17F, IL -17A, IL -22, 
and tumor necrosis factor - (TNF -) compared with placebo as early as Week 4; decreases in 
cytokine levels were sustained with continued treatment. These in vitro and clinical data 
demonstrate that t he beneficial effects of apremilast on known inflammatory mediators are 
associated with its clinical efficacy. However, the efficacy of apremilast has not yet been tested 
in the moderate to severe genital psoriasis population, and predictors of clinical re sponse to 
apremilast have not yet been identified.  
 
 These data will define the mechanism of action o f apremilast in subjects with moderate to 
severe genital psoriasis and may inform on the subset of subjects who are responding well to 
apremilast treatment.  
Psoriasis is driven in part by genetic factors, including HLA -Cw6, TNF -, LCE3B/3C, IL12B, 
IL23A, I L23R, LCE, TNIP1, IFHIH1, and NFKBIA. Apremilast has been shown to inhibit the 
expression of some of these genes, including TNF -, IL12B, and IL23A ( Gottlieb, 2013 ). 
Therefore, clinical response to apremilast may be dependent upon the underlying genetic drivers 
in some psoriasis subjects.

3.1. Study Design  
This Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast over 32 weeks of tre atment in approximately 
286 subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis ( modified  sPGA -G  3, moderate or 
severe).  Subjects will be randomized 1:1 based on a permuted block randomization using a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Ra ndomization to apremilast arm or placebo 
arm will be stratified by baseline psoriasis -involved body surface area (BSA) (  10 or  10). 
No more  than 60 of subjects with BSA  10 will be enrolled.  
 Subjects randomized to the apremilast 30 mg BID treatmen t group will receive 
apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily for the first 16 weeks  
 Subjects randomized to the placebo treatment group will receive placebo tablets 
(identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally twice daily for the first 
16 weeks  
 All subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily after the Week  16 
Visit through the end of the Apremilast Extension Phase of the study  
The study will consist of four phases ( Figure 1): 
 Screening  Phase  – up to 35 days 
 Double -blind Placebo-controlled Phase  – Weeks  0 to 16 
 Subjects will be rand omly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either apremilast 30 mg BID 
or placebo .   
 Apremilast Extension Phase  – Weeks  16 to 32 
 All subjects will be sw itched to (or continue to) receive apremilast 30 mg BID.  
All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32.  
 Observational F ollow-up Phas e – 4 weeks  
 Four-week  Post-Treatment Observational  Follow-up Phase for all subjects who 
complete the study or discontinu e the study early  
The blind should be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study. 
Blinded persons may include but are not limited to: Clinical Research Physician, Clinical 
Research Scientist, Clinical Trial Manager, Study Statistician, Data Manager, Programmers, and 
Clinical Research Associates.  
After all subjects have completed the Week 16 Visit (or discontinued from the study), a Week  16 
data restriction will be performed; the primary data analysis will be conducted and a Week  16 
Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be generated. However, unblinded data will only be m ade 
available to select Sponsor and Contract Research Organization (CRO) team members involved 
with analysis of the data and preparation of the Week 16 CSR. All other Sponsor, site, and CRO 
personnel directly involved with the conduct of the study, will re main blinded to treatment 
assignments until the final database lock at the conclusion of the study.

The following administrative/demographic procedures will be conducted as outlined in the 
Table  of Events, Table 3. 
Informed Consent  
An informed consent form (ICF) must be signed by the subject before any study -related 
assessments are performed.  For study -related assessments that are optional, additional  ICFs will 
also be signed before these are performed. Details of the informed consent process may be found 
in Section  13.3. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria (Section  4.2) and must not have any of the conditions 
specified in the exclusion criteria (Section  4.3) to qualify f or participation in the study.  The 
subject’s source documents must support his/her qualifications for the study (eg, if a female 
subject does not require pregnancy testing and birth control because of a hysterectomy, the date 
of the hysterectomy must be i ncluded in the medical history).  
Medical and Disease History  
Relevant medical history, as defined in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) Completion 
Guidelines, should be recorded, including smoking and alcohol history, as well as previous 
relevant surge ries (please refer to the eCRF Completion Guidelines for further details).  Disease 
history includes history of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  
Prior/Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
All medications and therapies being taken/used by the subject at the time of consent or at any 
time during the study should be recorded.  Other key medications and therapies, such as previous 
treatment for TB or relevant diseases, should be recorded.  Please refer to the eCRF Completion 
Guidelines for additional instruc tions and for further details.  
All medications and therapies for psoriasis, including topicals (used within the last 5 years prior 
to randomization), systemics, and all medications and therapies for psoriatic arthritis, should be 
recorded.  The stop dates for all medications and therapies prohibited in the study should be 
recorded.  Responses to prior psoriasis therapies should also be recorded.  Please refer to the 
eCRF Completion Guidelines for additional instructions.  
6.1. Screening Period  
Screening evaluations will be performed for all subjects to determine study eligibility. These 
evaluations must be completed within 35 days of screening unless noted otherwise below.  
Waivers to the protocol will not be granted during the conduct of this t rial, under any

serious adverse events ( SAEs) made known to the investigator at any time following the 
protocol -required reporting period or end of study -, as described in Section 10.1. 
The following evaluations will be performed at the Follow -up Visit as specified in the Table of 
Events, Table 3. 
 Concomitant medications or therapies evaluation  
 Weight  
 Adverse event evaluation  
6.4. Efficacy Assessments   
 Modified static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA -G) 
The modified sPG A-G is the assessment by the investigator of the subject’s psoriasis 
lesions’ overall severity in the genital area (labia majora, labia minora, and perineum 
in females; penis, scrotum, and perineum in males) at the time of evaluation. The 
modified sPGA -G is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), 
incorporating an assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: 
erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling. It is not necessary that all 3 criteria be 
fulfilled. The sPGA of Genitalia score is based on a combina tion of erythema and the 
second ary features (plaque elevation and/o r scale).  Since  erythema is the most robust 
finding, it should be the dominant feature influencing the sPGA of Genitalia rating in 
the majori ty of cases ( Merola, 2017 ). See Appendix  A for grading criteria.  
 static Physician Global Assessm ent (sPGA)  
The sPGA is the assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the 
time of evaluation.  The sPGA is a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), 
incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs o f the disease: 
erythema, scaling and plaque elevation.  When making the assessment of overall 
severity, the investigator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, 
have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity 
of each sign is averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  35 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the 
predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.  
See (Appendix  B) for grading criteria .  
 Body Surface Area (BSA)  
Body surface area is a measuremen t of involved skin over the whole body.  The 
overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the subject’s 
hand.  The surface area of the whole body is made up of approximately 100 palms or 
“handprints” (each entire palmar surface or “handprint” equates to approximately 1  
of total body surface area).  
6.5. Safety Assessments  
 Contraception Education  
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time.  
Results of animal and in vitro studies can be found i n the current IB.  
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved 
contraceptive options as described in Section 4.2 while on IP and for at least 28 days 
after administration of the last dose of the IP.  The female subject’s chosen form of 
contraception must be effective by the time the female subject is ra ndomized into the 
study (for example, hormonal contraception should be initiated at least 28 days before 
randomization).  
At screening and at baseline, and at any time during the study when a female subject 
of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures  or ability to become pregnant 
changes, the investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and 
correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy.  
 Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential 
(FCBP)  
A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of  25 mIU/mL will be required for FCBP 
subjects at screening and at the Early Termination Visit or Visit 10.  In addition, a 
local urine pregnancy test kit will be pro vided by the central laboratory and will be 
performed at the site on all FCBP subjects at the Baseline Visit, prior to dosing. An 
unscheduled serum pregnancy test should be performed if the FCBP subject has 
missed a menstrual period or has a positive urine  dipstick test.  
 Hepatitis B and C  
Hepatitis testing will include hepatitis B surface antigen and anti -hepatitis C antibody.  
 Vital Signs, Height, and Weight  
Vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be taken 
during the visit s indicated in Table 3.  Height will be measured and recorded at 
Screening; weight will also be measured a nd recorded at screening and then as 
indicated in Table 3. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated at Scre ening.

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  36 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021   Complete Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination includes evaluations of skin, nasal cavities, eyes, 
ears, lymph nodes, and respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and 
musculoskeletal systems.  The complete physical  examination is done at screening 
and at the Early Termination or Last Treatment Visit (Visit 10).  
 Psychiatric Evaluation  
Apremilast prescriber information (eg, Summary of Product Characteristics, Package 
Insert) includes a warning regarding depression and  suicidal thoughts. Patients with 
chronic diseases may be prone to depression. The risks and benefits of starting or 
continuing treatment with apremilast should be carefully assessed if patients report 
previous or existing psychiatric symptoms or if concom itant treatment with other 
medicinal products likely to cause psychiatric events is intended. At any time during 
the study (post -randomization), subjects who have suicidal thoughts or behavior 
should be evaluated.  If the psychiatrist deems the subject not  to be a risk for suicide, 
the subject may remain in the study, but if a risk of suicide is confirmed, the subject 
must be discontinued from the study.   If the subject is discontinued, the subject 
should return for the Observational Follow -up Visit.  
A copy  of the psychiatric evaluation report must be in the subject’s source 
documentation, especially if the subject is confirmed not to be at risk for suicide and 
is continuing in the study.  
 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory and as 
indicated in Table 3.  Clinical laboratory evaluations include complete blood count 
(red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count 
and differential, absolute WBC counts, platelet count); serum chemistries (total 
protein, albumin, calcium, phosphor ous, glucose, total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides, 
high-density lipoprotein [HDL], high -density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C], 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL -C], uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase [AS T; serum glutamic -oxaloacetic 
transaminase, SGOT], alanine aminotransferase [ ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic 
transaminase, SGPT ], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate [carbon dioxide, 
CO 2], blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] , and 
magnesium); as well as dipstick urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, 
protein, blood, bilirubin, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and urobilinogen).  Dipstick 
urinalysis will be performed by the central laboratory; microscopic urinalysis 
(epithel ial cells, RBC, WBC, and casts) will be performed only if the dipstick 
urinalysis is abnormal.  
Fasting is not required.  However, if significant elevation of serum lipid(s) is 
observed, a fasting retest should be requested to determine whether or not eleva tion 
was caused by eating.

Psoriasis flare represents an atypical or unusual worsening of disease during 
treatment ( Carey, 2006 ).  It is defined as a sudden intensification of psoriasis 
requiring m edical intervention or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, 
inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis.  A more typical, gradual worsening of plaque 
psoriasis would not be recorded as an AE.

6.7.1.  Genital Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS)  
The GPSS is a patien t-administered assessment of  8 symptoms:  itch, pain, 
discomfort, stinging, burning,  redness , scalin g, and cracking.  Respondents are asked 
to answer the questions based on their psoriasis sympto ms in the genital area.   
Numeric rating  scales (NRS)  are used to assess the sel f-reported overall severi ty of 
each of the 8  sympto ms individually  in the genital area on  an 11-point horizonta l 
scale  anchored  at 0 (no) and 10 (worst  imaginable ).  The overal l severi ty for each 
individual symptom from  patient's genita l psoriasis is indicated by  selec ting the 
number  from 0 to 10 that best describes the worst level of  each sympto m in the genital  
area in the past 24 hours. The symptom severi ty scores, ranging fr om 0 to 10, are the 
values of the selected numbe rs indicated by  the pat ient on the instrument’s horizontal 
scale.  Each of the  8 individual items will receive a score of 0 to 10 and will be 
reported as  item score s for itch, pain, discomfort, stinging, burning, redness, scaling, 
and cracking.  In addi tion, a total score ranging  from 0 (no genital psoriasis 
symptoms) to 80 (worst imaginable genital psoriasis symptoms) will be reported 
(Gottlieb, 2018 ). See (Appendix  D). 
6.7.2.  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The DLQI was developed as a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in 
a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related t o the impact of skin 
disease ( Finlay, 1994 ).  The instrument contains 10 items dealing with the subject’s 
skin.  With the exception of Item Number 7, the subject responds on a four -point 
scale, ranging from “Very Much” to “Not at All.”  Item Number 7 is a multi -part 
item, the first part of which ascertains whether the subject’s skin prevented them from 
working or studying (Yes or No), and if “No,” then the subject is asked how much of 
a problem the skin has been at work or study  over the past week, with response 
alternatives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all.”   
The DLQI total score has a possible range from 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the 
worst health -related quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best score.  The 
developers suggest that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and 
feelings; daily activities; leisure; work/school; personal relationships; and treatment.  
Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisu re, and

(work/school and treatment) range from 0 to 3.  Higher scores correspond to poorer 
health -related quality of life.  See Appendix  C. 
6.8. Photography  
Photographic assessments will be done at selected sites to provide supportive 
evidence of efficacy as scheduled in Table 3.  The procedure for taking the 
photographs and processing and shipping photographs will be described in a separate 
procedure manual distributed to investigational sites performing photographic 
assessments.  
Photographic assessments are an optional part of this study.  Subjects enrolled at the 
selected photography sites will be asked to provide separate consent prior to being 
photographed.

7.1. Description of Investigational Product(s)  
The chemical name of apremilast (CC -10004) is acetamide, N -[2-[(1S) -1-(3-ethoxy -4-
methoxyphenyl) -2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl] -2,3-dihydro -1,3-dioxo -1H-isoindol -4-yl]. 
Apremilast will be supplied by the Sponsor, Amgen Inc., and labeled appropriately as 
investigational product for this study.   
Apremilast will be provided as 10, 20, or 30 mg tablets in blister cards through Week 20.  
Placebo will be provided as identically appearing 10, 20, or 30 mg tablets in blister cards. 
Beginning at Week 20, apremilast will be provided as 30 mg tablets in hi gh-densi ty polyethylene 
(HDPE) bottles with chil d-resistant caps.  
Apremilast, the investigational product (IP), will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 
12 hours apart, without restriction of food or drink.  To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (G I) 
side effects, dose titration will be implemented in the first week of this study (see Table  4). 
During Week 0 (Days 1 -7), subjects will be dispensed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, and 
30 mg apremilast tablets or identically appearing placebo tablets.  The blister cards will contain 
all IP required for 4 weeks of treatment, with the first 7 days c ontaining the titration supplies or 
matching placebo (see Table  4 Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Vi sit 2 [Week 0] which 
details the titration supplies from Day 1 to Day 7).  
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block 
randomization in parallel 1:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo, using  a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  Randomization to apremilast arm or 
placebo arm will be stratified by baseline psoriasis -involved body surface area (BSA) (  10 or

Confidential and Proprietary  43 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule  
Investigational product will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without 
restriction of food or drink.  To mitigate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration 
will be implemented in this study.  During Week 0 (Days 1-7) and Week 16 (when placebo 
subjects are switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID), subjects will be dispensed blister cards 
with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets or identically appearing placebo for the dose titration.  
The treatment schema for dos e titration at baseline and Week 16 is shown in Table  4 and 
Table  5.  Blister card configurations are pictured in Appendix  E, Appendix  F and Appendix  G. 
At Week 20 through Week 32, all subjects will receive apremilast  30 mg tablets in open-label 
HDP E bottles with child -resistant caps.  
7.3. Overdose  
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol -required dosing of the investigational 
product(s) only.  Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose definition it must be both 
required and an  investigational drug.  In this study, the only required and investigational drug is 
apremilast and the control arm drug (ie, placebo); hence, overdose definition will apply to only 
apremilast (or matching placebo).  Other required or optional non -IP inten ded for prophylaxis of 
certain side effects, etc., are excluded from this definition.  
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of 4 or more 30 mg 
apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24 -hour period whether by acci dent or 
intentionally. On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4 
times during any 24 -hour period.  
7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block 
randomization in parallel 1:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo, using a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  Randomization to apremilast arm or 
placebo arm will be stratified by baseline psoriasis -involved body surface  area (BSA) (  10 or 
 10). No more than 60 of subjects with BSA  10 will be enrolled.  Designated research 
personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned password protected, coded identification 
numbers, which gives them authorization to enter the IRT to randomize subjects.   
The system will present a menu of questions by which the  research center personnel will identify 
the subject and confirm eligibility. When all questions have been answered and the subject 
deemed eligible, the IRT will assign a randomization identification number.   
Confirmation of the randomization will be sent  to the investigational site, Amgen , and/or its 
representative. The confirmation reports should be maintained as source documents.  During the 
study visits, the pharmacy or authorized study personnel at the investigational site will dispense 
coded IP kits in accordance with the randomization number assigned by the IRT.  
7.5. Packaging and Labeling  
The label(s) for IP will include Sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol 
number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per  container, lot 
Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  44 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or regulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be included on the  label as applicable per local 
regulations.  
All IP tablets, including apremilast and identically -appearing placebo, will be supplied by 
Amgen . Investigational product for dose titration at Baseline and at Week 16 will be supplied in 
blister cards. Investig ational product tablets at Week 20 and through Week 32 will be supplied in 
open -label HDPE bottles with child -resistant caps.  
7.6. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal  
The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP t hat is issued to and 
returned by the subject during the course of the study.  
The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP 
received, and comparing it with the accompanying IP accountability form.  The inve stigator(s) or 
Pharmacist(s) will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, retain a 
copy in the study file, and record a copy in the IRT. At the study site, all IP will be stored in a 
locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized a ccess.  
The IP should be stored as directed on the package label.  
Amgen  (or designee) will review with the investigator and relevant site personnel the process for 
investigational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for t he site 
versus Amgen  (or designee).  
7.7. Investigational Product Compliance  
Study personnel will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subjects prior 
to dispensing the IP.  Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events, 
Table 3.  The subjects will be instructed to return the IP containers, including any unused 
medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet counts and reconciliation as indicated in the 
Table of Events, Table 3.  Subjects will be asked whether they have taken their IP as instructed at 
each study visit.  Any problems with IP compliance will be reviewed with the subject.  If a 
subject misses 4 or more consecutive days of dosing, Amgen  should be contacted to decide 
whether dosing should resume or whether the subject should be terminated from the Treatment 
Phase of the study and enter into the Observational Follow -up Phase.  
Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive day s of dosing or taking less 
than 75 of the doses between study visits) are protocol deviations and should be discussed with 
Amgen .  Overall compliance with the study treatment regimen is defined as taking between 75  
and 120 of the expected doses during a  subject’s participation while in the treatment phases 
(Placebo -controlled Phase and Apremilast Extension Phases) of the study.

Over the course of this study, additional medications may be required to manage aspects o f the 
disease state of the subjects, including side effects from trial treatments. Supportive care may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
For information regarding other drugs that may interact with IP and affect its metabolism, 
pharma cokinetics, or excretion, please see the Investigators Brochure and/or local package insert.  
8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Subjects may take any medication that is not restricted by the protocol and would not be 
expected to interfere wit h the conduct of the study or affect assessments.  Chronic medication 
should be dosed on a stable regimen.  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription), treatments and therapies taken by the 
subject from screening throughout their entire participati on in the study, including those initiated 
prior to the start of the study, must be recorded on the subject’s source document and on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF.  The dose, unit, frequency, route, indication, the date the 
medication was started and th e date the medication was stopped (if not ongoing) must be 
recorded.  The recording of any permitted topical medications taken for psoriasis should also 
include the area of the body to which they are applied and the frequency of application.  
The following topical therapies will be permitted during the study:  
 For body and genital lesions: unmedicated emollients  
 For scalp lesions: non -medicated shampoos  
8.2. Concomitant Medications Not Recommended  
Co-administration of the strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme  inducer, rifampicin, 
resulted in a reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy 
of apremilast. Therefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (eg, rifampicin, 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. Joh n’s Wort) with apremilast is not 
recommended during the study.  
8.3. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
The following psoriasis medications cannot be administered for the duration of the study:  
 Topical therapy  
 Topical therapy, including, but not limited to, topical corticosteroids, retinoids or 
vitamin D analog preparations, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, or anthralin/dithranol 
for body lesions; coal tar, salicylic acid preparations, or medicated shampoos for 
scalp lesions, or as specified in Section  8.1.

9.1. Overview  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter , randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study of the 
efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -10004) in subjects with moderate to severe genital 
psoriasis (modified sPGA -G  3, moderate or severe) . Treatment assignment will be stratified by 
baseline psoriasis -involved body surface area (BSA) (  10 or  10). No more than 60 of 
subjects with BSA   10 will be enrolled.  
The objective of the statistical analysis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg 
BID versus placebo for 16 weeks, and to evaluate the effects of apremilast 30 mg BID as a 
treatment for up to 32 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis.  
After all subjects have completed the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the primary 
analysis will be perfor med.  At the study completion, ie, when all subjects have also completed 
the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) and the Observational Follow -up Phase, the 
final analysis will be performed. To maintain the blind at the site and subject level, the i ndividual 
subject treatment assignments will not be revealed to the investigators until after the final 
database lock following the study completion.  
9.2. Study Population Definitions  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are ran domized. Subjects 
will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized.  
The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of IP.  Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually 
receive.  
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects included in the ITT population who 
receive at least one dose of IP, have both baseline and at least one post -treatment modified  
sPGA -G evaluation, and have no important protocol deviations which may affect analyses in the 
Placebo -controlled Phase.  
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
With a 
total of approximately 286 subjects and a randomization ratio of 1:1, Study PSOR -025 will 
randomize approximately 143 subjects to APR 30 BID and 143 subjects to placebo. This sample 
size will provide 85 power to detect a minimum treatment difference of 15  at Week 16 (25  
for APR 30 BID and 10  for placebo) for the primary endpoint using a chi -square test at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 after adjusting for a 20  dropout rate. The sample size 
calculation was done using nQuery.

Subject’s age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations.  Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term.  
9.5. Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition (analysis population allocation, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment 
and follow -up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol 
deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations . 
9.6. Efficacy Analysis  
9.6.1.  Efficacy Evaluation for the P lacebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16)  
For the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 -16), the analyses for efficacy endpoints will be based 
on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who are randomized . Statistical 
comparisons will be ma de between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo. All statistical tests will 
be at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level  and the corresponding p -values and 95  confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be reported.  
9.6.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the prop ortions of subjects who achieve modified  sPGA -G response at 
Week 16 (defined as modified  sPGA -G score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 
2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16). It will be analyzed using the ITT population. A 
sensitivity analysis will be performed using the PP population.   
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the CMH (Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel) test 
adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization. The 2 -sided p -values from the CMH test, 
the adjusted treatment  difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment 
differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated 2 -sided 95 CIs 
using a normal approximation to the weighted average will be provided.  
Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method (SAS 
Institute Inc., 2011 ) based on similar subjects who remained in the study as the primary method. 
Details of the MI method will be provided  in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Sensitivity 
analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the non -responder imputation (NRI) 
method. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will only be used for the 
exploratory purpose.  
9.6.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the ITT population. The 2 -sided 
p-values and 2 -sided 95 confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported for treatment difference 
between apremilast and placebo arms. Mult iplicity adjustment will be specified in the next 
section.

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  49 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  The continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) as the primary method. The MMRM model will use the change or percent change 
from baseline as the re sponse variable and include treatment group, visit time, treatment -by-time 
interaction, and stratification factor as fixed effects, and the baseline value as a covariate. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlation among repeate d 
measurements. The Kenward -Roger adjustment will be used with restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) to make proper statistical inference. Within -group least -squares (LS) means and the 
associated SEs and 2 -sided 95 CIs, treatment differences in LS means an d the associated 
2-sided 95 CIs and 2 -sided p -values will be derived from the MMRM model. A sensitivity 
analysis will be conducted using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
and stratification factor as the fixed effects, the baseline value as the covariate and the LOCF 
method to impute the missing data.  
The binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint using the CMH test 
adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization. The 2 -sided p -values from the CMH te st, 
the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment 
differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated 2 -sided 95 CIs 
using a normal approximation to the weighted average will be provi ded. Missing values at 
Week  16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method  (SAS Institute Inc., 2011 ) 
based on similar subjects who remained in the study as the primary method. Sensitivity analysis 
will be conducted to account for missing data using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method and the non -responder imputation (NRI) method.  
9.6.1.3.  Multiplic ity Adjustment  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be hierarchically ranked for testing in order 
to control the overall type I error rate in claiming statistical significance at the 2 -sided 0.05 
significance level. Specifically, for the prima ry efficacy endpoint ( modified  sPGA -G response at 
Week 16), if the 2 -sided p -value from the comparison between apremilast arm and placebo arm 
is below 0.05, the outcome will be considered statistically significant and apremilast will be 
declared effective.  For any secondary endpoint, statistical significance will be claimed only if its 
2-sided p -value is below 0.05 and tests for the primary endpoint and all previous secondary 
endpoints are significant at the 2 -sided 0.05 level. The proposed test sequence fo r the primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints is listed as the following:  
 Proportion of subjects with modified  sPGA -G score of clear (0) or almost clear  (1) 
with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline at Week 16  
 Proportion of subjects achieving an ove rall sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) 
with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline at Week 16  
 Proportion of subjects with at least a 4 -point improvement in GPI -NRS item score 
within the GPSS for subjects with a baseline score of  4 at Week 1 6 
 Change from baseline in affected BSA at Week 16  
 Change from baseline in DLQI total score at Week 16  
 Change from baseline in GPSS total score and individual items scores at Week 16

9.6.2.  Efficacy Evaluation – Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32)  
Efficacy endpoints for time points beyond Week 16 will be summarized according to the 
treatment assigned at randomization. For all subjects, changes in measurements will be 
calculated relative to measurements obtained at baseline (Week 0). Descripti ve summary 
statistics or proportion of subjects achieving specified criteria will be summarized by treatment 
group.  For continuous variables, descriptive statistics for baseline and changes or percent 
changes from baseline will be provided. Categorical var iables will be summarized with 
frequency tabulations.  Two -sided 95 confidence intervals will be provided for changes or 
percent changes and response rates.  
9.7. Safety Analysis  
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all subjects who 
are randomized and receive at least one dose of investigational product. Safety will be assessed 
by clinical review of all relevant parameters including treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs; no inferenti al testing for statistical significance will be 
performed. Data from safety assessments will be summarized descriptively for the Placebo -
controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Exposure Period when subjects receive 
apremilast treatment. For saf ety analyses in the Placebo -controlled Phase, baseline will be 
relative to the first dose date following randomization at Week 0. For safety analyses in 
Apremilast Exposure Period, baseline will be relative to the first apremilast dose date at Week  0 
for subjects initially randomized to apremilast or Week 16 for subjects initially randomized to 
placebo and switched to apremilast in the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 -32). 
Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Act ivities 
(MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class, 
preferred term, severity and relationship to investigational product. TEAEs leading to death or to 
discontinuation from treatment and serious adverse events will be  summarized and listed 
separately.  
Data from other safety assessments will be summarized descriptively. Shift tables for laboratory 
parameters showing the number of subjects with values low, normal, and high comparing with 
the normal reference ranges pre -treatment versus post treatment will be provided.  
To account for the different exposure to the investigational product, adverse events or marked 
laboratory abnormalities will also be summarized using the exposure adjusted incidence rate, in 
addition to the simple incidence rates.

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the sub ject’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre -
existing condition) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE/SAE page of the case report  form (CRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of 
the diagnosis or syndrome.  
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE.  Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associa ted with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose CRF.   (See Section  7.3 for the definition of overdose. )  Any sequela of 
an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product which meets the definition of 
an adverse event, should be reported as an AE on the CRF. If the sequela of an overdose meets 
serious criteria, then it must be marked as se rious on the CRF and the paper SAE report form. 
The overdose itself should not be reported as an AE.  
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific an tidote for apremilast overdose. 
Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience of the treating physician.  
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring  
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.  
All AEs will be recorded by the invest igator from the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 28 days after the last dose of IP as well as all SAEs made known to the investigator at any 
time following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  All adverse events 
(serious/non -serious) will be recorded on the CRF, the paper SAE report form (for SAEs) and in 
the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety 
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by recording on  the CRF and 
submitting the SAE information using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form by 
facsimile/email directly to Amgen Global Patient Safety.   
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events  
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
10.2.1.  Serio usness  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:  
 Results in death;  
Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  53 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021   Is life -threatening (ie, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospi talization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);  
 Is a congenita l anomaly/birth defect;  
 Constitutes an important medical event.  
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered  serious.  
Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospitalizations  for: 
 a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.  
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not a ssociated with any 
deterioration in condition.  
 the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportabl e SAE.  
 a procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a repo rtable 
SAE.  
 hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.  
 a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and t he CRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.  
 an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre -existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline.  
 emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.  
All SAEs must be reported to Amgen  Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event by re cording them on the CRF and submitting  the SAE information 
using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form by facsimile/email directly to Amgen 
Global Patient Safety .

Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  54 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  For each AE, the investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop date s, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.  
10.2.2.  Severity/Intensity  
For all AEs, the investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event.  
Mild  
 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only  
 Intervention not indicated  
 Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected  
 No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required  
Moderate  
 Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort  
 Local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
 More than minimal interferen ce with ADLs but able to carry out daily social and 
functional activities.  
 Drug therapy may be required  
Severe (could be non -serious or serious)  
 Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain  
 Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention  
 Interferenc e with ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional 
activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest)  
 Drug therapy is required  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myoca rdial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pos e a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.

Confidential and Proprietary  55 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  10.2.3.  Causality  
The investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:  
Not suspected:  a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficien t 
explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected:  there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and 
the adverse event.  
Causality should be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.  
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a  comparator, ancillary or additional 
non-IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Amgen , please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.  
10.2.4.  Duration  
For each AE, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event.  
10.2.5.  Action Taken  
The investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of each AE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose modification, as appropriate) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were giv en for the event.  
10.2.6.  Outcome  
The investigator will report the outcome of the event for each AE.  
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovere d with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ). 
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
 results in discontinuation from the study;  
 requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any o ther therapeutic 
intervention; or  
Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -025  Amgen  Inc. 
Confidential and Proprietary  56 CC-10004 -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021   is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition.  
Regardless of severity grade, only laborat ory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded as the AE on the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of a 
diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, re cord thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).  
10.4. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in females of childbearing potential are 
immediately reportable events .   
10.4.1.  Females of Childbearing Potential – Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated -subunit of human chorionic 
gonadotropin [ -hCG] or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential 
regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 28 days  of the subject ’s 
last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events.  Investigational product is to be 
discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the 
investigator. The preg nancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to 
Amgen Global Patient  Safety immediately by email or facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
using the Pregnancy Notification Form or approved equivalent form (refer to Appendix  I).  The 
Pregnancy Notification Form must be submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours 
of learning of a subject ’s pregnancy. (Note:  Sites are not required to provide any information on 
the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or  regions local privacy laws).  
After obtaining the female subject ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant health 
information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete 
the pregnancy questionnaire for an y female subject who becomes pregnant while taking IP 
through 28 days of the subject ’s last dose of IP. This information will be forwarded to Amgen 
Global Patient Safety. Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted 12 months after the birth of 
the child (if applicable).  
The investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy and must 
notify Amgen  Global Patient Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome).  
If the outcome of the pregna ncy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Amgen  Global Patient Safety by facsimile, email or 
other  appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the 
paper SAE Report Form .

causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant dea th after 28 days that the investigator suspects is 
related to the in -utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Amgen  Global Patient Safety 
by facsimile, email, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge 
of the ev ent using the paper SAE Report Form.  
10.4.2.  Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant  
In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 28 days after 
discontinuing IP, the information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Noti fication Form (refer to 
Appendix  I). The form must be submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety with 24 hours of the 
investigator’s/site’s awareness of the pregnancy (Note:  Sites are not required to provide any 
information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local 
privacy laws).  
The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant 
health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain additional pregnancy 
information.    
After obtaining the female partner ’s signed consent for  release of pregnancy and infant health 
information the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant health information on the 
pregnant partner and her baby and complete the pregnancy questionnaires. This information will 
be forwarded to Amgen Gl obal Patient Safety.  
Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the child (if 
applicable).  
Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absen ce of anomalies) or indication for procedure.    
10.4.3.  Collection of Lactation Information  
 Investigator will collect lactation information on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking IP through 28 days post last dose of IP.   
 Information will be recorded  on the Lactation Notification Form (refer to Appendix  J) 
and submitted by facsimile or email to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s knowledge of event.   
 Study treatment will be discontinued if female subject breastfeeds during the study.  
With the female subjects signed consent for release of mother and infant health information, the 
investigator will collect  mother and infant health information and  complete the lactation 
questionnaire on any female subject who breastfeeds while taking IP through 28 days after 
discontinuing IP.   
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE req uires the completion of the relevant CRFs and 
the paper SAE report form. All SAEs must be reported to Amgen  Global Patient Safety by 
recording them on the CRF and sending the SAE data/information using the paper SAE report 
Apremilast

the initial reporting of an SAE as well as reporting any follow -up information.  
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.   
This requirem ent applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP) and all 
SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time following the protocol -required reporting 
period or after end of study.   Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing 
the ICF) will be collected/recorded and reported.   
Where required by local legislation, the investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant 
initial and follow -up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
source documents and all correspondence with the IRB/EC . 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting transmitted via paper Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form:  
 Facsimile transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form is the preferred 
method to transmit this information. If facsimile is unavailable, the email method to 
transmit this information is acceptable (refer to Appendix  H).  
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, this form may be sent 
via email, or notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form in English language sent by overnight mail or courier service.  
 Initial notification via telepho ne does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated 
reporting timeframes.   
 Once the study has ended, serious adverse events (regardless of causality) should be 
reported to Amge n Global Patient Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them and 
may use the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form (refer to Appendix  H). 
10.5.1.  Safety Queries  
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated/generated from Amgen Global Patient Safety 
to the site via Amgen’s safety query paper process  or other appropriate method.

11.1. Treatment Discontinuation  
The following even ts are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
investigational product(s):  
 Adverse Event  
 Lack of efficacy  
 Withdrawal by subject  
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Non-compliance with IP  
 Protocol deviation  
 Pregnancy  
 Physician decision  
 Study terminated by Sponsor  
 Other (to be specified on the CRF)  
The reason for discontinuation of treatment should be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
documents.  
When a subject is discontinued from treatment, the investigator should make every attempt 
possib le to have the subject evaluated at the Early Termination Visit within 4 days of the last 
intake of IP.  
The decision to discontinue a subject from treatment remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the S ponsor.  However, prior to discontinuing 
a subject, the investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting 
documents for review and discussion.

12.1. Emergency Contact  
In emergency situations, the investigator should use their medical judgement to provide 
appropriate medical care of clinical trial subjects.   The Invest igator may also contact the 
responsible Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by telephone at the 
number(s) listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page).  
In the unlikely event that the Clinical Resea rch Physician/Medical Monitor or designee cannot be 
reached, the investigator may also contact the Amgen Medical Information number at 1 - 800-77-
AMGEN (1 800-772-6436) . The representatives are responsible for obtaining your call -back 
information and contac ting the on -call Amgen/contract research organization Medical Monitor, 
who will then contact you promptly.  
12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products  
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinion of the 
investigator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject.  If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily  discontinued if, in the opinion of 
the investigator, continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.    
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not  be delayed or refused by the Sponsor.  However, the investigator may 
contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the 
interest of the subject.  
The investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol.   The 
investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the investigator in the 
subject’s source documentation.  
Emer gency unblinding should only be performed by the investigator through the IRT by using an 
emergency unblinding personal identification number (PIN), and the investigator should call IRT 
for unblinded dose information.

in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The investigator wi ll conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with 
applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Pract ice and in 
the local regulations.  Amgen  staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all 
investigators who in turn will select their staff.  
The investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed  
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study -related duties and functions, 
including obligations of confidentiality of Amgen  information. The investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study -related duties.  
The investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening m ust have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.  
The investigator, or a designated member of the investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records ( eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study -related charts) for source data 
verification.  The investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.  
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with th e exception of the 
information provided by Amgen  on public registry websites) is considered Amgen  confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by Amgen  on a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by the investigator or its institution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Amgen  protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the investigator’s or their institution’s website) without express written 
approval from Amg en.  Information proposed for posting on the investigator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to Amgen  for review and approval, providing at least 5 
business days for review.  
At the time results of this study are made available to the public , Amgen  will provide

The investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.  
Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the i nformed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The original ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person 
consenting the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the study,  must be maintained 
in the investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study w hen the amended protocol is implemented must be re -
consented with the revised version of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by the study 
subject and by the person consenting the study subject must be maintained in the investigator’s 
study files and  a copy given to the study subject.  
13.4. Confidentiality  
Amgen  affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Amgen  requires 
the investigator to p ermit Amgen  's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or auth orization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual.  
13.5. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Amgen  Clinical R esearch 
Physician/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically re ference the investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/EC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/EC for 
information purposes.  
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their 
dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is 
sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with

All aspects of  the study will be carefully monitored by Amgen  or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs.  
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification  
Amgen  ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrollin g subjects into the study, an 
Amgen  representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on -site visits with the investigator and  his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspect ed/reviewed by the Amgen  representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.  
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation .  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed co nsents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study -specific monitoring plan.  
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
In addition to the routine mon itoring procedures, a Quality, Compliance & Audit, Learning & 
Performance unit exists within Amgen.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of 
clinical research activities in accordance with Amgen  SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good 
Clinical Pr actice guidelines and regulations.  
The investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/ ECs, regulatory authorities (eg, FDA, European Medicines 
Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  The investigator 
should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If the investigator is 
contacted by  any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Amgen  
immediately.  
15.3. Product Complaint  
A product complaint (PC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability,  reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug, combination product or device after they are released for distribution to 
market or clinic by either Amgen or by distributors, and partners with whom Amgen 
manufactures the material.  This incl udes any drugs, devices, or combination products 
provisioned and/or repackaged/modified by Amgen.  Drugs or devices include investigational

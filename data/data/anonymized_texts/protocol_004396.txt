Title:  Targeting pancreatic cancer with sodium glucose transporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhibition  
Study Description:  This is a first -in-human, pilot study of the feasibility and safety of 
dapagliflozin (in addition to standard of care treatment) for the 
treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma.   Our primary hypothesis is that dapagliflozin is 
well-tolerated and safe to use in this patient population.  We also 
hypothesize that dapagliflozin will be efficacious as an adjunct to 
front -line chemotherapy assessed by decreased tumor markers 
mediated by its pleiotropic metabolic effects.  
Objectives : Primary Objective : To assess tolerability and determine the optimal 
dosage of dapagliflozin added to standard of care front -line 
chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.  
 
Secondary Objective : To explore the effects of dapagliflozin on 
metabolic and tumor response in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma.  
Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint : Toxicity by CTCAE v 5.0.  
 
Secondary Endpoints : Changes in clinical laboratory metabolic 
parameters (plasma glucose, ketones, HbA1c), CT -based body 
composition (visceral fat), and tumor markers (plasma CA19-9) and 
CT-quantified tumor size and tumor necrosis  from pre -therapy to 
post-8 weeks of therapy.  
Study Population:  Up to e ighteen patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma undergoing treatment with nab- paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine in the frontline setting  will be enrolled in this study.   
Additionally, retrospective data will be accessed  for up to 16 
matched controls who have received nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine 
SOC chemo therapy.  
Phase:  Ib 
Description of Sites  / 
Facilities Enrolling:  This study will be open to enrollment at the Siteman Cancer Center 
at Washington University School of  Medicine.  
Description of Study 
Intervention:  Dapaglifozin is an oral medication taken once daily.  
Study Duration:  6.5 mo/subject ; total time for enrollment and follow -up of all patients 
~ 13 mo. 
Participant Duration:  The intervention is an 8 -week cours e of treatment.

Version 04/07/22   page 10 of 55 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Study Rationale 
 
Dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitor ( SGLT2i ), is FDA -approved and 
has been used in numerous worldwide clinical trials. Much data exists regarding 
pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug as well as  safety and dosing profiles in diabetic 
patients and those with heart failure.2, 3 However, to our knowledge, this drug has not been 
studied in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) patient population. PDAC 
patients may be deconditioned with decreased oral intake and altered nutritional profiles. Moreover, the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in pancreatic cancer cases may be as high as 80%, and reports have linked molecular mediators from PDAC tumors to the development of insulin resistance in these patients.
4 Insulin deficiency is 
common due to local mass effects and pancreatic resection.4 Therefore, studies need to be 
performed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SGLT2i in PDAC patients who are receiving chemotherapy. This study will evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin dosing on 
tolerability, safety and side effects in PDAC patients. As part of an innovative component to this proposal, we will utilize quantitative ketone breathalyzers to monitor side effects remotely and with real -time result transmission to the study team that will be used 
alongside conventional measurement methods for ketones.  
 
1.2 Background 
 
1.2.1 Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma  
 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is invariably lethal. Not including 
COVID -19, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States.5 
Pancreatic cancer has the 7th highest incidence with an estimated 57,600 diagnoses 
this year. However, pancreatic cancer has the 4th highest mortality of all cancers.5 
PDAC is a histologic subtype of pancreatic cancer that accounts for more than 90% 
of all pancreatic cancers6 and is an invariably lethal cancer with a 5 year mortality 
of 91%.5 Unfortunately, mortality due to pancreatic cancer has been relatively 
unchanged despite advances in cancer treatments.5 Because of the lethal 
progression of this disease and the inability to achieve significant increases in 
survival, new avenues need to be explored that delve into mechanisms that underlie 
disease progression, but even more importantly, mechanisms that are targeted by 
currently FDA -approved drugs that can be rapidly repurposed for pancreatic cancer. 
Metabolism is one avenue that meets all of these criteria.  
 
1.2.2 Enhanced Glycolysis in PDAC  
 
Glucose metabolism is a rational target for PDAC treatment. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the prognostic potential of glucose utilization in pancreatic cancer. FDG -PET has been demonstrated as a highly sensitive modality 
for pancreatic cancer detection with a pooled sensitivity of 90%.
7, 8 Enhanced  
glycolysis is one of the most, if not the most, critical metabolic alteration in 
Version 04/07/22   page 11 of 55 pancreatic cancer that is driven by the KRAS  mutation. Enhanced glycolysis has 
also been recognized as an important metabolic alteration in PDAC metastasis that 
involves the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and subsequent seeding of cancer cells in distant organs.
9, 10 One mechanism for this phenomenon 
involves the uptake of glucose and its conversion to lactate to recycle NAD and 
generate 2 ATP for the rapid energy generation required for cell viability (Warburg Effect).
11 However, tumor growth also requires anabolic metabolism, or the ability 
to synthesize building blocks such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) uses glucose carbons to synthesize nucleotides, aromatic 
amino acids and generate the reducing equivalent NADPH, pathways that other cancer nutrients, such as glutamine, cannot supply.
12 This has clinical implications, 
as the presence of diabetes and increased serum glucose increases the risk of PDAC.
13 To further underscore the significance of this finding, we obtained 
metabolic data from a cohort of over 200 early stage PDAC patients from Siteman. We identified that patients with a rando m serum glucose over  112 mg/dL at 
diagnosis had a significantly shorter median OS (15 months) than patients under that glucose level (29 months; p=0.004; Figure 1 ). Collectively, these data suggest 
that reducing PDAC tumor access to glucose may have therapeutic benefit.  
 
1.2.3 SGLT2i  in PDAC Glucose Metabolism  
 
Sodium Glucose Transport Protein 2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors impact both systemic and PDAC glucose metabolism. Metformin, an anti -
diabetic drug, has been evaluated in patients with PDAC. Although metformin was initially found to increase survival in diabetic PDAC patients, recent data suggest that there is no correlation between metformin and PDAC patient survival.
9 Of note, 
metformin is believed to target mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with indirect effects on glucose uptake and metabolism. Although this works in non- cancerous 
cells with intact mitochondria and central carbon metaboli sm, metformin 
may not necessarily work with the same efficacy in PDAC tumor cells with dysfunctional mitochondria that may help explain the clinical results. Therefore, drugs that interfere directly  with tumor glucose uptake or metabolism may have 
more efficacious results.  
 In our search for novel metabolic therapeutics for pancreatic cancer, we have uncovered exciting new data showing mechanistic plausibility and preliminary 
Figure 1. Higher random serum 
glucose at diagnosis is associated 
with shorter median OS (15 months 
vs 29 months) in Siteman PDAC 
patients.  Threshold identified with an

Version 04/07/22   page 12 of 55 effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)  for the treatment of PDAC. SGLT2i 
are a class of glucose -lowering drugs that inhibit renal glucose reabsorption and 
reduce serum glucose and increase urinary glucose as a result. They are not only 
FDA -approved for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but they 
are currently showing significant potential in preventing heart failure decompensation and lowering cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM.
14  
 
SGLT2i has three key benefits for PDAC therapy. First and foremost , expression 
of the glucose transporter SGLT2 is distinct from conventional glucose transporter (GLUT) expression in PDAC. SGLT2 immunohistochemistry successfully 
localizes SGLT2 expression to neoplastic duct cells, not the surrounding stroma or inflammatory cells
1 (Figure 2A ). Second , functional expression of SGLT2 in 
clinical PDAC specimens has been demonstrated with the SGLT2 -specific positron 
emission tomography (PET) tracer, [18F] Me-4DG.1 Thus, SGLT2 transporter 
quantification in tumors can be measured non- invasively and be used to predict 
response to therapy, as already has been done in humans  with brain tumors.15 
Third , SGLT2i modulates systemic metabolism and therefore, tumor access to 
glucose is reduced, which leads to increased tumor cell death ( Figure 2B ). Lastly , 
SGLT2i  has pleiotropic metabolic effects that decreases serum glucose, increases 
mild ketonemia, and reduces visceral obesity,14, 16 -22 all of which improve can 
survival in patients with cancer, particularly PDAC ( Figure 3 ).23-27 
 1.2.4 SGLT2i in the Treatment of Other Diseases  
 
SGLT2i therapy has been shown to be generally safe and effective for type 2 diabetes and for heart failure.  Tens of thousands of patients have been studied in 
randomized, placebo -controlled trials including the DECLARE study
28 and EMPA -
REG study.29 In the EMPA -REG trial of 7,020 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 
patients receiving empagliflozin had a lower rate  of all -cause  death or a composite 
of major cardiovascular events. In the recent DECLARE study (N=17,160), not only was there was a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure with dapagliflozin, but there was also a low incidence of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse even ts (SAEs). In fact, there were fewer SAEs in the dapagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group (p<0.001). There were fewer major hypoglycemic 
events (p=0.02), acute kidney injury events (p=0.002), and fewer  bladder cancers 
Figure 2. SGLT2 is a therapeutic target in  PDAC. A. Tumor cell -

treatment of a PDAC xenograft results in increasd tumor necrosis 
(red margin) . Data from ref.1 

Version 04/07/22   page 13 of 55 (p=0.02). The risk of death from any cause was 7% less in the dapagliflozin group, 
but it did not reach statistical significance. “The rates of amputation, fracture, 
volume depletion, hypersensitivity, and urinary tract infections were balanced between the groups.”
28 However, there were more genital infections in the 
dapagliflozin -treated groups (<0.001). Note that s ubjects in our trial will be 
monitored carefully for infections and will be given instructions on infection prevention. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), though rare, was also higher in the SGLT2i treated group (0.3%) than in the placebo group (0.1%). Greater than 80% of these with DKA were patients with insulin -requiring diabetes.
28 For t his reason, 
PDAC patients in this trial will not have insulin -requiring diabetes.  
 
The promise of SGLT2i -mediated 
metabolic modulation of cancer has yet to be extensively addressed in the literature and will be the focus of this proposal. As of now, only one clinical trial exists 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) that tests the efficacy of SGLT2i i n conjunction with PI -3K 
inhibitors in advanced solid tumors. The 
ability to simultaneously decrease serum 
glucose and inhibit tumor glucose uptake 
is a very appealing property of SGLT2i 
and not present in the vast majority of 
diabetic medications.  Here, w e will 
combine the SGLT2i dapagliflozin with conventional chemotherapy to assess tolerability and metabolic effects in PDAC patients. This feasibility study 
will set the stage for larger, more comprehensive trials in pancreatic cancer that will integrate m etabolism, imaging, and therapeutics. In summary, identification of 
metabolic features that influence patient outcomes and are targetable with current clinical imaging and therapeutic workflows is highly innovative and represents a significant unmet need for patients with PDAC.  
 
1.3 Study Design  
 
This is a longitudinal, dose -finding, open label safety and tolerability phase Ib treatment 
study.   The study hypothesis is that dapagliflozin will be well- tolerated by PDAC patients 
on chemotherapy as assessed by tolerability and side effect profiles.   The dose escalation 
scheme will consist of 5 mg of dapagliflozin once per day for 2 weeks, followed by 
escalation to 10 mg once per day for 6 weeks if the 5 mg dose is tolerated.

Version 04/07/22   page 14 of 55 1.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
1.4.1 Known Potential Risks 
 
The most common side effects of dapagliflozin include: (i) vaginal yeast infections and yeast infections of the penis, (2) stuffy or runny nose and sore throat, (3) changes in urination, including urgent need to urinate more often, in larger amounts, or at night.   Less likely  risks include intravascular volume depletion which may manifest as 
symptomatic hypotension or acute transi ent changes in creatinin e. Patients with 
impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m
2), elderly patients, or patients 
on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion.  To mitigate against this, subjects will be educated and given handouts regarding the importance of staying hydrated and holding dapagliflozin therapy if they are not taking p.o. well. Other less likely risks are urinary tract infections, hypoglycemia (when coadministered with insulin and insulin secretagogues ; to mitigate against this, 
subjects will be meet with an endocrinologist and be educated regarding this possibility. Patients with diabetes will be required to monitor their glucose throughout the study using home glucometers ), genital mycotic infections (see 
Appendix C) . 
 Rare risks include acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization and dialysis , 
ketoacidosis in diabetes mellitus ( to mitigate against this, subjects will be educated 
and tested at screening. Subjects will be followed by an endocrinologist and will have home monitoring systems for ketosis. Conventional urine ketone monitoring 
using dipsticks will be provided to patients and will be measured weekly (see testing schedule). This will be supplemented with Q D ketone breath monitoring as 
an investigational to ol (see Appendi ces A and B ) that will allow for frequent 
monitoring of abnormally high levels of ketones that  will be report ed to the clinical 
research assistant and investigators .  
 Note: In the DECLARE -TIMI 58  trial
28, “key safety results ” are provided in Table 
2 and in Table S3 in the Suppleme ntary Material28,. Fewer patients in the 
dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group discontinued the assigned regimen 
during the course of the trial, and fewer patients in the dapagliflozin group reported a serious adverse event or had major hypoglycemia (see the Supplementary Material
28,), acute kidney injury, or bladder cancer. The rates of amputation, 
fracture, volume depletion, and hypersensitivity were balanced between the groups. Diabetic ketoacidosis was more common in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group (0.3% vs. 0.1%; hazard ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.10 to 4.30; P=0.02). 
More than 80% of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis were using insulin at baseline. 
Genital infections that led to discontinuation of the trial regimen or were considered to be serious adverse events were more common in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group (0.9% vs. 0.1%; hazard ratio, 8.36; 95% CI, 4.19 to 16.68; P<0.001), both in men and in women, although genital infections reported as 
Version 04/07/22   page 15 of 55 serious adverse events were rare (two events in each group). Six cases of Fournier ’s 
gangrene were re- ported, one in the dapagliflozin group and five in the placebo 
group.”   
 
In addition, “In a pool of 12 placebo- controlled studies, the most common adverse 
reactions (≥5%) associated with FARXIGA 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo respectively 
were female genital mycotic infections (8.4% vs 6.9% vs 1.5%), nasopharyngitis 
(6.6% vs 6.3% vs 6.2%), and urinary tract infections (5.7% vs 4.3% vs 3.7%).”

• An FDA -approved indication for patients with heart failure (NYHA class II -
IV) with reduced ejection fraction, to reduce the risk of CV death and 
hospitalization for heart failure  
• An FDA -approved indication in patients with type 2 diabetes  with evident 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk factors to red uce the risk of 
hospitalization for heart failure.  
• An FDA -approved indication to improve glycemic control in patients with type 
2 diabetes.  
• Decrease in weight (DECLARE -TIMI 58 study) 
• Decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
• Significantly less like ly (HR 0.53; CI 0.43- 0.66) to have a 40% decrease in 
eGFR, ESRD, or renal death. (DECLARE- TIMI 58 study).  
 
Additionally, known benefits of dapagliflozin in animal models  include: 
• Mild ketonemia (which can have anti- tumor effects)  
• Increased PDAC tumor necro sis 
• Decreased growth of PDAC cells  
• Impairment of PDAC cells to take up glucose 
 
1.4.3. Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits   
 
PDAC is a lethal disease. The overall 5 -year survival rate is only 9%, and the 
survival rate for those with distant metastases is a dismal 3%. Clearly, there is an 
urgent need for new treatments that will extend survival in patients with this 
disease. Dapagliflozin is a generally safe, well -tolerated medication that is FDA -
approved for both diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. 
Dapagliflozin and other SGLT2i’s are taken by tens of thousands of patients in the US and around the glob e. The risk of severe adverse events (SAEs) and adverse 
events  (AEs) is relatively low, especially when compared with placebo in trials.  
This low rate of potential SAEs and AEs can be made even lower by education of the subjects  and following them  closely in our clinical trial by our trial team (see 
mitigating steps outlined above). This low rate of potential SAEs and AEs is 
outweighed by the possibility  of discovering and bringing to the clinic  a new, oral, 
Version 04/07/22   page 16 of 55 once-a- day, well -tolerated, effective medication in the fight against this lethal 
disease – PDAC.   
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  Justification for 
Endpoints  
Primary  
To assess tolerability and 
determine the optimal dosage of dapagliflozin added to standard of care front- line 
chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma.  Toxicity by CTCAE v 5.0.    This is a phase Ib clinical 
trial and as such, safety and tolerability are a primary objective.  
Secondary  
To explore the effects of 
dapagliflozin on metabolic and tumor response in patients with 
metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.  Changes in clinical laboratory 
metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, ketones, HbA1c), CT-based body composition (visceral fat), and tumor markers (plasma CA19 -9) and CT-
quantified tumor size and tumor necrosis from pre- therapy to 
post-8 weeks of therapy.  The proposed beneficial 
effects of dapagliflozin are thought to be due to its metabolic effects  on the 
tumor. Thus, several biomarkers of metabolism are included as secondary endpoints in addition to measures of efficacy such as tumor size changes 
and/or necrosis.

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Study Intervention Description  
 
Dapagliflozin is a commercially available  medication indicated as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, to reduce the 
risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular dis ease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, and to reduce the 
risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with NY HA class 
Version 04/07/22   page 20 of 55 II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.   By inhibiting sodium glucose 
cotransporter 2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal 
threshold for glucose, thereby increasing urina ry glucose excretion.   It is available as a 
tablet for oral administration.  
 In this study, dapagliflozin will be co -administered with standard of care IV chemotherapy 
(nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine) for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma.  The chemotherapy is not being given as part of this study ; it is being 
given as part of patients’ routine care and dosing  is not dictated by this protocol.  Routine 
doses of gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel are 1000 mg/m
2 and 125 mg/m2, respectively, and 
can be modified for the patient at the oncologist’s discretion.   
5.2 Study Intervention Administration  
 
Dapagliflozin is an oral drug which will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Dosing 
will start at 5 mg QD and will increase to 10 mg QD  after 2 weeks  (after consultation with 
a study endocrinologist)  if the patient is tolerating the 5 mg dose . Dapagliflozin will be 
given for a total of 8 weeks (2 weeks at 5 mg and 6 weeks at 10 mg). Following 8 weeks, 
all patients will come off of the study, regardless of treatment response.   Dapagliflozin will 
be continued regardless of holds or modifications to standard of care chemotherap y.  
 Patients should take dapagliflozin  at approximately the same time every day, with or 
without food.  If a patient misses a dose  (has not taken it within 6 hours of the regular time ), 
s/he should be instructed not to take or make up that dose and to resume dosing with the 
next scheduled dose.  Patients will be instructed to bring all unused tablets  and their 
medication diary (Appendix F ) to each study visit for assessment of compliance.   
 Treatment with dapagliflozin will be initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 of standard of care chemotherapy.   
 During treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of dapagliflozin, AEs will be monitored weekly, either during regular office visits or phone calls, whi le patient is taking 
dapagliflozin, and after completion of therapy, follow -up will be biweekly for first month. 
Severe AEs that require immediate medical attention (i.e., DKA, hypoglycemia) will be reviewed promptly  by an oncologist and endocrinologist .  . This will be reinforced with 
regularly  scheduled visits with the endocrinologist at screening, C1D1, C1D15, and then 
as clinically indicated  that will be targeted to coincide the same day as the oncologist visit.  
 
5.3 BIOSENSE Meters  
 
BIOSENSE meters are inv estigational devices utilized in this trial to evaluate utility for 
assessing breath ketones in a non -invasive manner and therefore are being used under an 
IDE exemption (Appendix A). The BIOSENSE meters are provided by Readout Health. They are to be used once daily, preferably prior to breakfast, and Appendix B includes use instructions to be provided to the patient. Patients should be instructed to enter the BIOSENSE results on the diary in Appendix F.  
Version 04/07/22   page 21 of 55  
5.4 Definitions of Evaluability 
 
All patients who receive any study treatment are evaluable for toxicity.  Patients are 
evaluated from first receiving study treatment until a 30 -day follow up after the conclusion 
of treatment or death.  
 All patients are evaluable for disease response unless they discontinue treatment  prior to 
completion of 8 weeks of treatment  and have not had any disease assessment.  
 Patients who miss more than 4 doses of dapagliflozin in any one week will be considered not evaluable for treatment response  and will need to be replaced.  
 
5.5 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
See Appendix. If patients think that they have any side effect or just are feeling worse during the trial, they are to let the study team know.  
 There are very few drug interactions with dapagliflozin. They are detailed in the package insert. The main ones are mefenamic acid (an NSAID), rifampin, and valsartan.  
 
5.5.1 Alcohol (Ethanol) ↔ dapagliflozin  
 
Participants will be instructed to talk to the study  doctor before using ethanol 
together with dapagliflozin. Alcohol may affect blood glucose levels in patients 
with diabetes. Both hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur. Participants will be advised to  avoid using alcohol if thei r 
diabetes is not well controlled or if they h ave high triglycerides, neuropathy (nerve 
damage), or pancreatitis.  
 
5.6 Women of Childbearing Potential 
 
Women of childbearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses , women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding, and women who have had a tubal ligation) are required to 
have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose of dapagliflozin .   
 Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 1 month following the last dose of dapagliflozin.   If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, dapagliflozin should be immediately discontinued, 
as will be the chemotherapy . Because   In addition, a positive urine test must be confirmed 
by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume dosing.  
Version 04/07/22   page 22 of 55 If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy or 
within 1 month after the last dose of  dapagliflozin , the investigator must be notified in 
order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.7 Duratio n of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  8 
weeks  or until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression 
• Death  
• Adverse event( s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unable to 
receive further treatment in the judgment of t he investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy 
• Serious noncompliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will still be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar  for patient follow -up. 
 
5.8 Duration of Follow- up 
 
Following the end of study treatment, participants will be followed in person or by phone  
on a bi weekly basis for the first month.  Following that, chart -based follow -up Q4W  will 
be obtained for an additional 3 months.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable 
adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
5.9 Lost to Follow- Up 
 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for 2 scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study team. 
 The following actions must be taken if the participant fails to return to clinic for a required study visit: 
o The study team will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit within 2 weeks and counsel the participant on the importance of maintain ing 
Version 04/07/22   page 23 of 55 the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study. 
o Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will 
make every effor t to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address).  These contact attemp ts should be documented in the participant’s medical 
record or study file.  
o Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
  
6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose modifications for nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine will follow standard of care guidelines and 
will be made at the discretion of the treating oncologist.  Dosing with dapagliflozin will continue even if there are interruptions or modifications to nab- paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine.  
 If estimated glomerular filtration ate (eGFR) falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2 and/or the patient is 
diagnosed with end-stage renal disease or require dialysis, dapagliflozin must be discontinued.  Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels  (laboratory studies with plasma glucose 
of 250 mg/dL or greater and associated severe clinical symptoms such as increased urination, increased thirst and unintentional weight loss; neurologic changes such as confusion or drowsiness; metabolic acidosis with serum bicarbonate 15- 18 mEq/L with elevated anion gap as 
well as elevated ketones. Of note, ketones may already be elevated as a result of dapagliflozin administration; thus, any of the above associated signs or symptoms suggestive of possible DKA in the  setting of elevated ketones should be discussed with a study investigator immediately.  If 
ketoacidosis is suspected, dapagliflozin should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted.  Because reports of nec rotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene)  have been identified 
in patients receiving dapagliflozin, patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be  assessed and 
discontinue dapagliflozin immediately.  
 Other holds and modifications to dapagliflozin may be made at the discretion of the investigator.   
7.0 REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the  protocol require reporting as 
outlined below.  Please refer to Appendix G for definitions and Appendix H for a grid of reporting 
timelines.  
 
Version 04/07/22   page 24 of 55 AEs that require immediate medical attention (i.e., DKA, hypoglycemia) will be reviewed 
promptly an oncologist and endocrinologist.  All AE s (i.e. chemotherapy -related  AEs and 
dapagliflozin -related  AEs) will be recorded from time of initiation of treatment, through the 8 -
week treatment period, and for 30 days after discontinuation of dapagliflozin. This will allow the  
study team to determine if dapagliflozin impacts the frequency and/or severity of the 
chemotherapy -related AE s. All adverse events must be recorded on the toxicity tracking case 
report form (CRF) with the exception of: 
• Baseline adverse events, which shall  be recorded on the medical history CRF.

8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
8.1 Dapagliflozin (Farxiga)  
 
8.1.1 Dapagliflozin  Description  
 
Dapagliflozin is described chemically as D -glucitol, 1,5-anhydro-1-C- [4-chloro-3-
[(4ethoxyphenyl)methyl]phenyl]- , (1S)-, compounded with (2S)-1,2-propanediol, 
hydrate (1:1:1). The empirical formula is C 21H25ClO 6•C3H8O2•H2O and the 
molecular weight is 502.98. The structural formula is: 
 
 
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacolo gy 
 
Sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, 
is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal 
threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion. Dapagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influen ce several physiological functions 
including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre -and afterload of the heart and 
downregulation of sympathetic activity. 
 
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Following oral administration of dapagliflozin, the maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) is usually attained within 2 hours under fasting state. The Cmax and AUC values increase dose proportionally with increase in dapagliflozin dose in the therapeutic dose range. The absolute oral bioavailability of dapagliflozin following 

Version 04/07/22   page 27 of 55 the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Administration of dapagliflozin with a 
high-fat meal decreases its Cmax by up to 50% and prolongs Tmax by 
approximately 1 hour, but does not  alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. 
These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful and dapagliflozin can 
be administered with or without food.  The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily mediated by UGT1A9; CYP -
mediated metabolism is a minor clearance pathway in humans. Dapagliflozin is exten sively metabolized, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3 -O-glucuronide, which 
is an inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3 -O-glucuronide accounted for 61% of a 
50 mg [
14C]-dapagliflozin dose and is the predominant drug -related component in 
human plasma.  Dapag liflozin and related metabolites are primarily eliminated via the renal 
pathway. Following a single 50 mg dose of [
14C]-dapagliflozin, 75% and 21% total 
radioactivity is excreted in urine and feces, respectively. In urine, less than 2% of the dose is excreted as parent drug. In feces, approximately 15% of the dose is excreted as parent drug. The mean plasma terminal half -life (t
½) for dapagliflozin 
is approximately 12.9 hours following a single oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
 
8.1.4 Supplier  
 
Dapagliflozin will be provided for this trial. 
 
8.1.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Dapagliflozin is available as film-coated tablets at a dose of 5 mg and 10 mg. 
 
8.1.6 Storage and Stability  
 Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86° F). 
 
8.1.7 Administration  
 
Dapagliflozin should be taken by mouth once daily at the assigned dose.

9.1 Adverse Event Collection in the Case Report Forms  
 
All adverse events that occur beginning with start of treatment (minus exceptions defined 
in Section 7.0) must be captured in the Toxicity Form (Appendix I) .  Baseline AEs should 
be captured on the Medical History Form.  
Participant death due to disease progression should be reported on the Toxicity Form as 
grade 5 disease progression.  If death is due to an AE (e.g. cardiac disorders: cardiac ar rest), 
report as a grade 5 event under that AE.  Participant death must also be recorded on the Death Form.  
  
10.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
10.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients will be re -evaluated for response with standard of 
care computed tomography (CT /MRI ) imaging, 8 weeks after the initiation of study 
treatment . 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor s (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) 
30.  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
10.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension ( longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest 
x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be consi dered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
Version 04/07/22   page 29 of 55 thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by definition, simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are  to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions :  All o ther lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
10.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluat ions should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and report ed lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
Version 04/07/22   page 30 of 55 evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also  acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image q uality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and  site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe spec ific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed wi th breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  PET -CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.    Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and  measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT i n selected instances.  
 
Version 04/07/22   page 31 of 55 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
31-33.  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria 
which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in 
ovarian cancer 31. 
 Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological conf irmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particular ly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG- PET at basel ine and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT tha t is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  Th e use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to lim itations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Version 04/07/22   page 32 of 55 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
10.4 Response Criteria  
 
10.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if  that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
10.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non- target lesions and  
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target l esions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Version 04/07/22   page 33 of 55 10.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the be st response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

may be accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported a s “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Version 04/07/22   page 34 of 55 *  ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease 
since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in 
some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised  
  
10.4.4 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since th e treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
  
11.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSM B) will be specifically convened for this 
trial to review toxicity data .  A DSM B will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical 
investigators and a biostatistician.   DSMB members must be employed by Washington University,

12.0 Retrospective Review of Matched Controls  
Retrospective data will be accessed from EPIC for up to 16 matched controls who have received 
nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine SOC chemo therapy.  This data will be obtained under a waiver 
of consent.  All data will be deidentfied within the manuscript. Data from 2016 to present will be accessed. Only the neces sary data will be pulled from EPIC and will contain lab values, 
demographics (date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity), imaging, tumor stage, metastatic sites, prior treatment and best results, with an emphasis on the matched treatment times for the study.  
 
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The study will be defined as being feasible if up to 18 patients can be recruited within the next 
academic year and at least 80% of patients comply with the intervention as defined as achieving 80% of the targeted level of therapeutic action assessed from laboratory measures and 80% of the planned chemotherapy doses. Data analyses will be descriptive in nature. All data will be analyzed as observed without imputation. Variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics including  
mean, median, standard deviation, inter -quartile range, overall and by patient characteristics of 
interest (e.g., male and female patients). Hematological and non -hematological toxicities will be 
summarized by counts and percentages, overall and by patient characteristics. Effect of SGLT2i 
Version 04/07/22   page 36 of 55 as assessed by urine glucose, serum and breath ketones, visceral fat, tumor enhancement/necrosis 
(in various format: continuous, dichotomized by median, tertiles, quartiles) or other parameters on overall and progression  free survival (PFS) will be analyzed by Kaplan -Meier product limit 
method and log rank test or Cox regression model as appropriate.
 
 
13.1 Safety Analyses 
 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed using summary statistics as described above acquired during treatment . AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA ). Each AE will be counted once only for a given participant .  The 
severity, frequency, and relationship of AEs to SGLT2i therapy  will be presented by 
System Organ Class  (SOC). AE’s will be reported with the following information: start 
date, stop date, severity, relationship, expectedness, outcome, and duration. Adverse events 
leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious treatment -
emergent AEs will be  presented either in a table and are provided in the Data Safety 
Monitoring Plan.

If you think you may have an infection, call your oncology clinic team . 
 
Prevention of yeast infections in Women (from Mayo clinics)  
https:/ /www.mayoclinic.org/diseases -conditions/yeast- infection/symptoms -causes/syc-
20378999 ) 
 
To reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections, wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and 
doesn't fit too tightly.  
 
It might also help to avoid:  
•   Tight -fitting pantyhose  
• Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect 
you from infection  
•   Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons  
•   Hot tubs and very hot baths  
•   Unnecessary an tibiotic use, such as for colds or other viral infections  
•   Staying in wet clothes, such as swimsuits and workout attire, for long periods of time

https:/ /www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/184715#prevention   
 
To prevent infections, the head of the penis and the foreskin should be kept clean and dry. Daily washing, with particular attention to cleaning the penis, is essential.  
 
Here are some hygiene tips:  
•   The foreskin should be pulled back so that the glans is exposed.  
• The area should be washed thoroughly and gently with warm water. Soap may irritate, 
so it should be avoided. 
• An aqueous cream or some other neutral nonsoap cleanser may be used, but it should 
be completely rinsed off.  
•   Before replacing the foreskin, the glans should be completely dry. 
• Men who tend to develop balanitis after sex should wash their penis after 
engaging in sexual activity.  
 
Avoiding irritants  
 
If symptoms appear to be linked to substances present in condoms or lubricants, there are 
condoms available for sensitive skin.  
 
It is best to use non-biological washing powder for underwear and to make sure all the detergent is rinsed out. People who work with chemicals or have traces of potential irritants on their hands should wash them before using the bathroom.

Version 04/07/22   page 52 of 55 APPENDIX G : Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in  the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event  
Version 04/07/22   page 53 of 55 o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the  ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition:  Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

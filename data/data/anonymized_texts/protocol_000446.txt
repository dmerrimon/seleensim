a All subjects will be tested to assess CFTR genotype regardless of availability of a previous CFTR genotype laboratory 
report. Refer to the Laboratory Manual to determine the appropriate genotyping assay for each subject.   
b CFQ-R and  must be completed prior to the start of any other assessments scheduled at that vi sit. 
c Weight and height will be measured with shoes off.  
d An ophthalmologic examination will be conducted on subjects of all ages by an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologic 
examination does not need to be repeated if there is documentation of an examinati on that met the protocol criteria and 
that was conducted within 3 months before the Screening Period. Subjects who have documentation of bilateral lens removal do not need an ophthalmologic exam ( Section 11.7.8). Subjects with clinically significant cataracts, lens 
opacity, Y -suture, or lamellar rings  will be excluded.  
e FSH will be measured for any potentially postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous 
amenorrhea. Serum FSH levels must be ≥  40 mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal.  
f Any female subject who does not meet the criteria for non -childbearing potential is considered to be of childbearing 
potential and must have a serum pregnancy test.  
g A standard digital ECG will be performed after the subject has been supine for at least 5  minutes. 
h Vital signs and pulse oximetry will be collected after the subject has been at rest (seated or supine) for 5  minutes.  
i Spirometry may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator ( Section 11.6.1). Screening spirometry evaluation may be 
repeated, as specified in Section 8.1.1.1. 
j  A sweat chloride test must be performed if an eligible sweat chloride value is not available in the subject’s medical 
records. For subjects  using a sweat chloride value documented in their medical record to establish eligibility, the sweat 
chloride test at the Screening Visit is optional.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   In Table 3-2, all visits are scheduled relative to the Day  1 Visit (first dose of study drug). The 
Week 2 Visit occurs after 2 weeks of treatment have been completed (i.e., 
Day 15 [± 3] days). The Week  8 (± 5 days) Visit occurs after 8  weeks of study drug 
administration have been completed (i.e., Day  57 [± 5 days]).  
Similarly, during Treatment Period 2, the Day  113, Week 17 Visit is the first dose of s tudy 
drug for Treatment Period 2. The Week 18 Visit of Treatment Period 2 occurs after 2 weeks 
of treatment have been completed in Treatment Period  2 (i.e., Day 127 [± 3 days] of the 
study). The Week 24 (± 5 days) Visit occurs after 8 weeks of study drug administration have 
been completed in Treatment Period 2 (i.e., Day 169 [± 5 days]).

a The Washout Period starts the day after completion of the Week  8 Visit and continues for 8 weeks (+7 days). The Washout Period is considered to be complete when dosing 
has occurred at the Week 17 Visit.  
b All assessments will be performed before dosing unless noted otherwise. If study drug is not administered on the day of the visit (i.e., study drug interruption or premature 
discontinuation of study drug treatment), only 1 set of assessments will be collec ted. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will continue to complete all 
other scheduled study visits for assessments of efficacy (spirometry, sweat chloride, and CFQ -R) and  
 through the end of the Treatment Period in which discontinuation occurred, as  described in Section 8.1.6. 
c If the subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an ETT Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to terminate study treatment. Subjects 
who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will also be required to c omplete the Safety Follow -up Visit, approximately 28 (± 7) days after their last dose of study 
drug. If the ETT  Visit occurs 3  weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety 
Follow-up Visit will not be required. See Section 8.1.5 and 8.1.6.  
d The Safety Follow -up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Week  24 Visit and have enrolled in an extension study of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor 
within 28  days after the last dose of study drug.  
e In order to continue in Treatment Period 2, subjects must not have an acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 4 weeks before the Week 17 Visit (first dose of study drug in Treatment Period 2) and must not have any “non-CF-related” illness within 2 weeks before the Week 17 Visit. “Illness” is defined as an acute (serious or nonserious) condition (e.g., gastroente ritis). If the subjects do not meet these criteria, then 
the continuation of the subjects into Treatment Period 2 must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
f All questionnaires must be completed before the start of any other assessment scheduled for that visit. The CFQ -R must be completed first, f ollowed by the . Subjects 
will need to complete a CFQ -R and  at the ETT Visit ( Section 8.1.6).   
g Weight and height will be measured before dosing with shoes off. Height will be collected only for subjects 21 years of age or younger.

complete treatment but do not enroll in a separate extension study of VX -661/ivacaftor within 28  days after the last dose of study drug will have an ophthalmologic exam 
conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist (see Section 11.7.8). The exam may be completed at either the ETT or Safety Follow -up Visit, but must be completed by the date of 
the Safety Follow -up Visit. Subjects who have documented bilateral lens removal do no need an ophthalmologic exam.  
i In addition to the complete PEs indicated, symptom -targeted PEs will occur at any time during the study if triggered by AEs or if deemed necessary by the investigator.  
j Pregnancy tests will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential.  
k All standard digital ECGs will be performed before dosing and after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes. At the Week 1, Week 2, Week  17, and Week  18 Visits, 
ECGs will  be collected before dosing and at 1.5, 3, 4, and 6  hours after the morning dose. At the Week 1, Week 2, Week  17, and Week  18 visits the 4 -hour postdose ECG will 
be collected before the 4 -hour postdose spirometry assessment. The predose ECGs collected at the Week 1 (Day  1) visit will be performed in triplicate. If study drug is not 
administered on the day of the visit (i.e., because of study drug interruption or permanent discontinuation of study drug), only 1 ECG will be collected.  
l Vital signs and pulse oximetry will be collected before dosing and after the subject has been at rest (seated or supine) for at least 5  minutes. 
m At all visits, spirometry must be performed for all subjects before dosing and should be performed prebronchodilator ( Section 11.6.1). At Week  1, Week 2, Week 17, and 
Week 18, subjects < 18 years of age at the Screening Visit will have additional spirometry performed at 2  and 4 hours after the morning dose. If more than 1 spirometry 
assessment is required at a visit, bronchodilators will be withheld until completion of the last scheduled spirometry  assessment is completed.  
n  The Sweat collection on dosing visits should occur approximately 1 hour before the PK sample  collection and before the morning dose of the study drugs. Sweat collection 
will not overlap with any other study assessments ( Section 11.6.2).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 70,000 children and adults worldwide1 and is the 
most common fatal genetic disease in persons of European descent.2 Based on the size of the 
population, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.3,4 Despite progress in the treatment of CF with 
antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is in 
the mid-30s.2,5 Although the disease affects multiple organs, most morbidity and mortality 
are caused by progressive loss of lung function.6 
CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a defect in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epithelial chloride ion (Cl
−) channel 
activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate- dependent protein kinase A that is responsible 
for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues.2 This 
function is defective in patients with CF due to a loss of either cell surface expression and/or function. 
More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified.
7 Mutations in the CFTR 
gene have been classified based on the molecular and functional consequence of the mutation 
on the CFTR protein8,9,10 and can be generally considered to reduce the quantity of 
functional CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surface or reduce the function of CFTR protein located at the cell surface. CFTR gene mutations that affect the quantity of 
functional cell surface CFTR protein include defects that reduce CFTR protein synthesis and defects that impede the cellular processing and delivery of CFTR proteins to the cell surface.  
CFTR gene mutations assoc iated with minimal CFTR function include  
• mutations associated with severe defects in ability of the CFTR channel to open and 
close, known as defective channel gating or "gating mutations"; 
• severe defects in the cellular processing of CFTR and its delivery to the cell surface;  
• no (or minimal) CFTR synthesis; and  
• severe defects in channel conductance.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in -frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del- CFTR).
10 In the US, almost 87% 
of patients with CF have at least 1  copy of the F508del- CFTR mutation, and about 47% have 
2 copies.11 In the European Union (EU), approximately 83% of patients with CF have 1 or 
2 copies of the F508del- CFTR mutation, and approximately 38.7% of patients with CF in the 
United Kingdom have 2 copies.12 The F508del-CFTR mutation interferes with the ability of 
the CFTR protein to reach and remain at the cell surface, as well as to open and close, 
resulting in decreased Cl− transport.13,14 The combined effect is a marked reduction in 
F508del-CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion that impairs fluid regulation and promotes 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the airway. The mucus build-up obstructs the airways and predisposes the patient to chronic lung infections.
15  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 23 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Two complementary approaches to increase CFTR -mediated Cl− secretion in the airway 
epithelia have been studied.9 One approach is to treat with a compound that will modify the 
cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of f unctional 
CFTR at the cell surface. This kind of compound has been termed a CFTR corrector. Another 
approach is to treat with a compound that increases the channel gating activity of protein kinase A-activated CFTR at the cell surface to enhance ion transp ort. This kind of compound 
has been termed a potentiator. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both appr oaches may be required to ameliorate lung 
disease in patients with CF. A modest restoration of Cl
− secretion through the action of a 
potentiator and/or corrector could prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the apical surface of epithelial cells, allo wing proper maintenance of airway hydration. Adequate 
airway hydration could alleviate the cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation, which leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs and, eventually, respiratory failure for patients w ith CF. 
Residual function mutations are Class II through V mutations that have some residual chloride transport and result in a less severe clinical phenotype. Despite slower disease progression, patients with residual function mutations still develop chronic pulmonary disease, pulmonary exacerbations, and pancreatic insufficiency, and overall have a reduced lifespan. Ivacaftor (a potentiator) has been shown to increase the chloride transport in these mutations by increasing the open channel probability. Populations of patients with these mutations are both genotypically and phenotypically diverse, and it is anticipated that the second CFTR allele will have some responsiveness to a potentiator. Mutations were identified using 2 criteria: in vitro response to  ivacaftor and population- level clinical 
phenotype from epidemiologic data 
16 or published literature.17-24 
VX-661 is a compound developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex) that has 
been shown to have CFTR corrector properties. Several lines of in vitro evidence suggest that VX-661 works by promoting the proper cellular processing and trafficking of a fraction of F508del-CFTR protein during its biogenesis and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing it to exit the end oplasmic reticulum and traffic the cell surface.
25 When added for 
more than 24 hours to human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells isolated and cultured from lung explants obtained from donors with CF (CF-HBE cells) who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, a concentration- dependent increase in levels of mature (i.e.,  plasma 
membrane) F508del -CFTR was observed. The increased trafficking of F508del-CFTR to the 
cell surface resulted in a significant increase in Cl
− secretion.25 VX-661 did not correct the 
processing and localization of other misfolded or normally folded proteins other than CFTR, suggesting that the mechanism of VX -661 action is selective for CFTR (CF TR corrector).
26 
Ivacaftor (also known as VX-770) is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in patients with CF. Results from several Phase 3 studies showed that ivacaftor is effective in the treatment of patie nts with CF who have mutations 
that result in gating defects, as evidenced by sustained improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride concentration) and corresponding substantial, durable improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and weight gain. 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 24 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and reasons for premature 
discontinuation and results of safety assessments.  
As of July 2015, in the US, Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in patie nts age 
2 years and older who have one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene:  G551D, 
G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or  R117H. In the EU 
and in Israel, Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients age 6 years and older 
who have one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene:  G551D, G1244E, G1349D, 
G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or  S549R. In Canada, Kalydeco is indicated for the 
treatment of CF in patients age 6 years and older who have one of the following mutations in 
the CFTR gene:  G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, 
S549R, or  G970R. It is also indicated for the treatment of CF in patients age 18 years and 
older who have the R117H  mutation in the  CFTR gene. In Australia, Kalydeco  is indicated 
for the treatment of CF in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D  or other gating 
(class III) mutation in the  CFTR gene. In New Zealand, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, 
Kalydeco is currently indicated for the treatment of CF in patients 6 years of age and older who have the G551D  mutation.

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 28 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and 
completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study.  
8.1.1.2 Rescreening  
Subjects may only be rescreened with the approval of the Medical Monit or. If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR genotyping, 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was ≥40 mIU/mL during prior 
screening), sweat chloride, and ophthalmologic examination (if performed within the last 3 months). If a subject is rescreened, the screening window will begin once the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
8.1.1.3 Extension of the Screening Period Window  
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following 
reasons: 
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments ( Section 8.1.1.1) 
• Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to m eet the eligibility criteria  
• Additional time to conduct ophthalmologic examinations ( Section 11.7.8) 
8.1.2 Treatment Period 1 (8 Weeks)  
Treatment Period 1 will last approximately 8  weeks. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 
6 sequences, as shown in Section 8.1. 
For subjects who are on a stable regimen of inhaled cycling antibiotics, the Treatment 
Period 1 Day 1 Visit should be timed to occur at the end of an off-cycle but no less than 
14 days after the last dose of inhaled antibiotics in the previous on- cycle. The first dose of 
study drug will be administered on Treatment Period 1 Day 1. Dosing details are given in Section 10.2. The first dose of a new cycl e of inhaled cycling antibiotic should also occur on 
Treatment Period 1 Day 1.  
Study visits during the Treatment Period will occur as shown in Table 3-2. Subjects will be 
outpatients during the Treatment Period. All visits should occur within the windows 
specified.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during Treatment Period 1 will complete assessments through the Week 8 Visit as described in Section 8.1.6. 
8.1.3 Washout Period (8 Weeks)  
The Washout Period starts the day after completion of the Week 8 Visit. It has a duration of 8 weeks (+ 7 days) but may be extended with approval from the Medical Monitor. A safety evaluation visit will be conducted at Week 12 (± 5 days). 
8.1.4 Treatment Period 2 (8 Weeks)  
Treatment Period 2 will last approximately 8  weeks. In order to continue in Treatment 
Period 2, subjects must not have an acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary 
exacerbation, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 
4 weeks before the Week 17  Visit (first dose of study drug in Treatment Period 2 ) and must

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal 
of consent. 
8.1.7 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
The safety of administration of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor will be monitored by 
an external independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will conduct periodic reviews of safety data. Procedural details of the IDMC structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC Charter. The IDMC Charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
8.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
8.2.1 Study Design 
The present study is 1 of 4 pivotal, Phase 3 clinical studies designed to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of ivacaftor and VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor in subjects 
with CF. A r andomized, double-blind study design will prevent observer bias and reduce 
symptoms or outcomes arising from the subjects’ knowledge of treatment. The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 1 dose level of VX -661 (100 mg once daily [qd]) in 
combination with ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours [q12h]) as well as the efficacy and safety of 1 dose level of ivacaftor monotherapy (150 mg q12h). 
Subjects enrolled into this study will be heterozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation, a 
processing mutation anticipate d to respond to the combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor 
based on “proof-of-concept” Study VX-11-661-101 (Study 101). Results from Study 101, 
Group 7, in subjects heterozygous for F508del- CFTR and G551D- CFTR, suggest that 
clinically meaningful improvement in percent predicted  FEV
1 can be achieved with the 
combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor, even in the presence of a single F508del- CFTR allele 
when the second allele is also responsive to potentiator modulation.  
A crossover design with randomization to 6 tre atment sequences will enable within -subject 
comparison of the effects of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and ivacaftor 
monotherapy. This design enhances the power to detect treatment differences by reducing the inherent between -subject variability pre sent in a parallel -arm study. This is particularly 
important in studying the F508del-CFTR/residual function population, which has a low 
genotypic incidence (approximately 7% of the CF population worldwide). Furthermore, this population, as a whole, is hete rogeneous with regard to baseline disease as well as potential 
degree of response to corrector and potentiator therapies.  
There are no approved therapies for treatment of subjects with F508del- CFTR/residual 
function that target the underlying mechanism of the disease that could be used as an active 
comparator for VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor or ivacaftor monotherapy. Therefore, 
the use of placebo in this study is deemed ethical and necessary to adequately assess the 
benefit of treatment with VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor and treatment with ivacaftor 
monotherapy. All subjects enrolled in the study will continue their normal, stable treatment for CF symptoms throughout the study. 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 31 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   8.2.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration 
The dose regimen of VX-661 chosen for continued development in Phase 3 was studied in 
Study 101 in 2 CF populations: F508del- CFTR homozygous subjects (Group 4) and 
F508del-CFTR heterozygous subjects who had G551D- CFTR on the other allele (Group 7). 
The dose regimen of VX-661 100 mg qd in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg q12h provided clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in percent predicted  
FEV
1 in both populations as well as a signal of CFTR modulation as assessed by the change 
in sweat chloride.  
The dose regimen  of ivacaftor planned for this study (150 mg q12h) is the current labeled 
dose regimen for patients with CF with gating mutations who are aged 6  years and older. 
An 8-week period was selected as the duration for Treatment Periods 1 and 2. A significant 
response in FEV 1 is anticipated to be observed after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with VX-661 
in combination with ivacaftor. The primary endpoint, which is the absolute change in percent predicted FEV
1 from study baseline to the average of measurements at Weeks 4 and 8 in each 
Treatment Period, was selected in order to obtain a more robust assessment of the durability of response that is less affected by short- term variability in FEV
1. An 8-week period was 
selected as the duration for the Washout Period. Based on PK data collected in the healthy subjects (Study VX07-661-001 [Study 001]), the terminal half- life of VX -661 is 
approximately 116 hours.
27 For ivacaftor, the estimated terminal half -life is approximately 
12 hours. Thus, following an 8-week washout, negligible concentration of VX-661 and ivacaftor is expected to remain in study subjects. Based on preliminary efficacy data from Study VX11 -661-101 and efficacy data from previous ivacaftor studies, no residual effects of 
VX-661/ivacaftor combination therapy and ivacaftor monotherapy are expected by the end of the 8-week washout period. 
8.2.3 Rationale for Study Population 
The study population will be subjects with CF who are 12 years of age and older and are heterozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation and with a second CFTR mutation predicted to 
have residual function. Based on the results from Study 101 ( Section 8.2.1 ), subjects with the 
F508del-CFTR mutation on only 1 allele may respond to VX-661/ivacaftor treatment when 
the second allele is also responsive to potentiator modulation. The inclusion of subj ects with 
CF who are 12 to 17 years of age is justified based on severity of disease and allometric scaling. The overall disease status for the adolescent and adult populations to be enrolled in this study is anticipated to be similar based on the identical enrollment criteria, particularly the FEV
1 (i.e., FEV 1 ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and height at 
screening) and the requirement for clinical stability. Additionally, the expected maturity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in adolescents supports their inclusion. The dose regimen of ivacaftor planned for this study (150 mg q12h) is the current labeled dose regimen for patients with CF with gating mutations who are aged 6  years and older. Based on 
the historical data from the ivacafto r Phase 3 program and the US CF Foundation Registry on 
weight as a function of age in patients with CF, weights in the adolescent population are expected to be only slightly lower than those of the adult CF population.

9.3 Study Restrictions 
9.3.1 Additional Dietary Restrictions/Prohibited Medications  
Prohibited medications and certain foods are not allowed in this study (Screening Period through Safety Follow- up Visit) while subjects are receiving study drug ( Table 9-1). Both 
ivacaftor and VX -661 are metabolized at least in part via hepatic enzymatic pathway utilizing 
CYP 3A4, hence the need to restrict usage of known CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors. 
A nonexhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication will be 
provided in the Study Reference Manual.

discussed and approved by the Vertex Medical Monitor. Guidelines for stable medication regimens for CF are as follows:  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 38 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   o Subjects who are taking dai ly inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled 
antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who are on a stable cycled regimen of a single inhaled antibiotic should 
continue on this antibiotic throughout the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized described in Section 8.1.2 and Section 8.1.4. 
o Subjects who alternate 2 different antibiotics monthly should remain on the same schedule during the study. To reduce variability, the inhaled antibiotic treatment should be the same and at the same stage through the cycle at the start of each study drug Treatment Period. 
o Subjects may receive doses of prednisone up to 10 mg/day (chronically) or prednisone 60 mg qd for up to 5 days without prior approval of the Medical Monitor. 
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments 
performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.6.1. 
• Concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval should be used with 
caution during the study, as the effect of VX-661/ivacaftor on the QT interval has not 
been evaluated in  a thorough QT study. Consideration should be given to obtaining an 
ECG when concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval is administered.  
9.5 Removal of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject should continue to be followed as noted in Section 8.1.6, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT and/or Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (Section 8.1.5, Section 8.1.6), and follow up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved AEs. 
If the subject withdraws consent, no further evaluations will be performed, and no additional 
data will be collected. Vertex may retain an d continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.  
The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal of consent.  Subjects must return all unused study drug. A subject will be withdrawn from study drug treatment for any of the following reasons: 
• A female subject or a female partner of a male subject has a confirmed pregnancy.  
• A subject’s treatment is unblinded by the investigator. 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 39 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   A subject may be withdrawn from study drug treatment after a discussion between the 
investigator and the Medical Monitor for any of the following reasons: 
• A subject develops a medical condition that requires prolonged concomitant therapy with 
a prohibited medication or prolonged interruption of the study drug. 
• A subject develops a life- threatening AE or a serious adverse event (SAE) that places 
him/her at immediate risk, and discontinuation of study drug treatment and withdrawal 
from the study are deemed necessary.  
• A subject is noncompliant with study requirements. 
• A subject has an increas e in transaminases (ALT or AST) according to evaluations and 
management described in Section 11.7.7. 
• A subject has an increase in QTc according to evaluations and management described in 
Section 11.7.4. 
• A subject develops a cataract or lens opacity (see Section 11.7.8). 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should continue to return for assessments as noted in Section 8.1.6.  
9.6 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug Treatment Periods may be replaced at Vertex's discretion.

Study drug should be administered within 30  minutes after starting a meal with 
fat-containing food, such as a "standard CF" high-fat, high- calorie meal or snack, according 
to the following guidelines: 
1. Study drugs will be administered after the start and before the end of a mea l throughout 
each of the 2 Treatment Periods. It is recommended that the duration of each meal 
associated with study drug intake (i.e., breakfast and dinner/snack, as applicable) should not exceed 30  minutes. 
2. Study drug should be administered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses (morning and evening) of study drugs will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning dose could be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:00 every evening throughout the study. 
3. At the Day  1 Visit, all subjects will be observed for 6 hours after the morning dose of the 
study drug. 
4. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for 2 days before PK sample collection and on the days of PK sample collection.  
5. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. The meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of study drug.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 41 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   6. If a subject's scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
o If the dose in the clinic will be within 6  hours of the subject's scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug, and the morning 
dose will be administered in the clinic.  
o If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6  hours after the subject' s scheduled 
morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home, and the evening 
dose will be administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the evening dose.  
7. For visits after the Day  1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused 
study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 
8. At the Week 8 Visit, the morning dose of study drug will NOT be administered. The last dose of study drug will be the evening dose administered the day before the Week 8 Visit.  
9. At the Week 24 Visit, the morning dose of study drug will NOT be administered. The last dose of study drug will be the evening dose administered the day before the Week 24 Visit.  
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 204 subjects (34 per sequence) will be enrolled and stratified by age at the Screening Visit  (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), FEV
1 severity (determined at the Screening 
Visit; <70% versus ≥70% predicted), and type of residual function mutation on the second CFTR allele ( Class V non-canonical splice mutation versus Classes II to IV residual function 
mutation; see Section 16), and then randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to 1 of the 6 treatment 
sequences, as shown in Section 8.1. A minimum of 25% of enrolled subjects will carry a Class II to IV mutation on the second CFTR allele (see Section 16). Enrollment into the non-
canonical splice strata will be limited to no more than 75% of total enrollment.  
An IWRS will be us ed to assign subjects to treatment and to ensure enrollment of at least 
25% of subject with Class II to IV residual function mutations . Detailed instructions for 
randomization will be provided separately.  
10.4 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
The dosage of individual study drugs or the regimen cannot be altered, but the investigator 
can interrupt or stop treatment with all study drugs.  
10.5 Study Drug Interruption 
If study drug dosing must be interrupted for more than 72 hours, the Medical Monitor must be notified. In these instances, study drug dosing may only resume after approval by the Medical Monitor. Specific instructions for interruption for elevated LFT levels and elevated QTc levels are provided in Section 11.7.7 and Section 11.7.4, respectively.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 42 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   10.6 Missed Doses  
If a subject misses a dose and recalls the missed dose within 6 hours, the subject should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For example, 
• if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible. 
• if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and 
more than 6 hours have elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 
14:00), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00. 
10.7 Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug tablets will be supplied in blister cards by Vertex. Study drug cards will be provided and replaced via the IWRS. A detailed study drug dispensation plan will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Study drug labeling will be in compliance with applicable local and national regulations.

10.9 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated site staff will maintain records documenting the dates and 
amounts of  
• study drug received,  
• study drug dispensed to the subjects, and 
• study drug returned by the subjects.  
Subjects will be instructed to return all used, partially used, and full study drug blister cards 
to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee until inventoried by the study monitor. The study monitor will verify 
study drug records and inventory throughout the study. 
10.10 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug 
The site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the 
site monitor has performed drug accountability. At the end of the study, the study monitor 
will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the s tudy site, the investigator will ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented.  
Procedures f or the destruction or return of the study drug will be detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual. 
10.11 Compliance  
To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. 
If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing des pite educational 
efforts, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss discontinuation of the 
subject from the study treatment.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 44 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   10.12 Blinding and Unblinding 
This is a double-blind study.  
10.12.1 Blinding 
The subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study 
team, will be blinded with the exception of the following: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the 
subject in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and their fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations 
• Unblinded statistician preparing the final (production) randomization list who is not part 
of the study team 
• Vertex Clinical Operations IWRS management  
• Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
• IDMC 
• Vendor preparing the unblinded analysis for the IDMC 
• Vendor analyzing PK samples  
• Vertex or vendor conducting the population PK analysis 
• Vertex Medical Monitor may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual 
subjects at any time  
Vertex Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics laboratory personnel will not be involved in 
the conduct of the study and will be unblinded to the bioanalysis results but will remain blinded to subject number and treatment assignment. 
Spirometry Data Blinding  
Despite treatment blinding, knowledge of the spirometry results has the potential to suggest 
whether a subject has been administered active study drug or placebo. Therefore, during the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will have no access to the post-dose spirometry data. The vendor for central reading of the spirometry data will only send the blinded spirometry files (blinded treatment group, with real values for screening and baseline, but with dummy values for all the spirometry assessments after baseline) to Vertex to be used for developing the statistical programs. Furthermore, subjects and their caregiver should not be informed of their study- related spirometry results during the Treatment Period regardless of 
whether the subject has prematurely discontinued study drug treatment.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11 ASSESSMENTS 
11.1 Timing of Assessments  
The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2.  
The CFQ-R questionnaire must be performed before any other assessment at the clinic visits 
when it is required. For the remaining assessments, the following assessments must be 
performed in  the following order when more than 1 assessment is required at a particular 
time point:  
 
2. standard 12-lead ECG recordings  
3. vital signs and pulse oximetry  
4. spirometry  
5. sweat chloride  
6. safety laboratory assessments (including  blood draws) 
7. PK sampling 
Note: if study drug is not administered on the day of the visit (for any reason, including study drug interruption or premature discontinuation of study drug), only 1 set of assessments will be collected ( Table 3-2).  
11.1.1 Informed Consent/Assent  
Each subject of age of consent (per local requirements) must sign and date a study- specific 
ICF before any study -specific procedures can be performed. Subjects not of age of consent 
must assent, if applicable per local requirements, to participate in the study, and the subject's parent or legal guardian must sign and date a study- specific ICF before any study -specific 
procedures can be performed. The consent forms will comply with all applicable regulations governing the protection of human subjects. An ICF and Assent Form, approved by Vertex and the site's institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC), must be used. 
11.1.2 Assigning Subject Number  
Once a subject has sign ed an ICF or Assent Form, if applicable, a subject number will be 
assigned. The subject will retain this number for the entire study. Detailed instructions on 
assigning subject numbers will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. If a subject is rescreened, the subject retains the original subject number. 
11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics  
Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, 
height, and weight. 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject durin g screening. Based on the medical 
history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying medical conditions as specified in 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history shall include a complete review of systems, past medical and surgical histories, and any allergies.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 50 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • If, on Day 1 (Treatment Period 1), the subject does not withhold his/her dose of 
bronchodilator, spirometry should be performed postbronchodilator, and all subsequent 
spirometric measurements (according to the schedule of assessments detailed in Table 3-2) should be performed postbronchodilator. 
• For visits with postdose spirometry assessments (Weeks 1, 2, 17, and 18) , if the predose 
spirometry is performed postbronchodilator, the subject should withhold any further 
bronchodilator use until completion of the 4-hour postdose spirometry assessment on that day. 
• Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or 
postbronchodilator.  
All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry 
data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study- related spirometry 
results from Day  1 through Week 24, regardless of whether the subject prematurely 
discontinues treatment.  
The parameters listed below will be normalized using the standards of Wang et al
44 (for 
female subjects aged 12  to 15 years [inclusive] and male subjects aged 12 to 17 years 
[inclusive]) or Hankinson et al43 (for female subjects aged 16  years and older and male 
subjects aged 18 years and older):  
• FEV1 (L) 
• Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L)  
• FEV1/FVC (ratio)  
• Forced expiratory flow 25% to 75% (FEF 25%-75%) (L/s) 
11.6.2 Sweat Chloride Testing 
The sweat chloride test is a standard diagnostic tool for CF, serving as a biomarker of CFTR activity. Collection of sweat samples will be performed at visits specified in Table 3-1 and 
Table 3-2, using an approved collection device. Sweat samples will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Individual sweat chloride test results will not be disclosed to the study sites. Specific instructions for collection, handling, processing, and shipping of sweat chloride samples to the central laboratory will be provided se parately.  
The sweat collection on dosing visits should occur approximately 1 hour before the PK 
sample collection and before the morning dose of the study drugs. At each time point, 2 samples will be collected, 1 from each arm (left and right).   
Sweat collection must be performed at the Screening Visit if the sweat chloride value is not available in the subject’s medical record. For subjects using a sweat chloride value documented in their medical record to establish eligibility, the sweat chlorid e test at the 
Screening Visit is optional. Collection of sweat chloride will not overlap with any other study 
assessments.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 54 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.7.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory, with the exception of urine 
pregnancy tests, which will be performed and analyzed at the site. Blood samples requiring a 4-hour fast will be collected on Day 1, Week 8, Week 17, Week 24, and the ETT Visit. Fasting is not required at other time points unless specified in the assessment table. On Day  1 
and Week 17 Visit, blood samples will be collected before the first dose of the study drug. At all the other scheduled visits, these samples will be col lected at any time during the visit, 
relative to the order of assessments indicated in Section 11.1 and according to the schedule in 
Table 3-1 and Table 3-2.  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in 
Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. Laboratory test results th at are abnormal and considered clinically 
significant will be reported as AEs (see Section 13.1.1).  
The safety laboratory test panels are shown in Table 11-1.

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 56 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically app ropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be 
used. At the discretion of the local investigator, local laboratories may be used for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal 
and clinically significant, it should be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central labora tory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the 
investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 
11.7.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening a nd 
select study visits (see Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). At other visits, symptom- directed PEs and 
symptom- directed vital sign assessments can be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator or healthcare provider
. 
A PE includes a review of th e following systems: head/neck/thyroid, eyes/ears/nose/throat 
(EENT), respiratory, cardiovascular, lymph nodes, abdomen, skin, musculoskeletal, and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), oral temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed following a 5 -minute rest in the  seated or supine 
position.  
11.7.4 Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). A window of ± 15 minutes will be 
allowed around the nominal times for all postdose ECG assessments. Additional standard 12-lead ECG s will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated.  
The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine position for at least 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate (HR), 
such as blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening and Safety Follow -up 
Visits. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and 
maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring 
during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual a t the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from the 
baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs 
will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 57 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value 
(>45 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until 
QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall bel ow the threshold value that triggered the repeat 
measurement.  
If the QTcF value remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 3 predose values on Day 1 or ≥500 msec) on repeated measurement or is noted on 
>2 occasions with no identified alternative etiology for the increased QTcF study drug, then 
discontinuation from study drug treatment may be required after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment for increased QTc should have their QTc 
monitored closely until it normalizes or returns to baseline.  
11.7.5 Contraception and Pregnancy  
11.7.5.1 Contraception 
The effects of VX -661 monotherapy or in combination with ivacaftor on conception, 
pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. Neither VX-661 nor ivacaftor showed any genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) studies. VX-661 and ivacaftor were each found to be nonteratogenic in reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits.
27,28 Subjects should follow the contraception requirements outlined in this study 
protocol. The effects of VX-661 monotherapy or in combination with ivacaftor on the PK of hormonal contraceptives are not known. Thus, hormonal contraception is not an acceptable method of contraception for female subjects though it is acceptable for the female partners of male subjects.  
At this stage in the development of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, participation in this study requires a commitment from the research subject and his/her partner to use at least 1 effective method of birth control. Acceptable methods of contraception for participants of this study and their partners are listed below. Methods of contraception should be in successful use from signing of consent, approximately 28 days, before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented 
through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas 
deferens by ultrasound or medical record before the first dose of the study drug. 
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Postmenopausal: spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months and serum FSH level ≥40 mIU/mL at Screening  
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 58 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). Females who fall 
into this category are considered not to be of childbearing potential only as long as they have not had their first menstrual period. If a female achieves m enarche during 
the study, she will need to provide consent for compliance (proper method of contraception or abstinence).  
• NOTE: All other female subjects  who have had their first menstrual period will be 
considered to be of childbearing potential. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods:  
Acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects or male partners of female subjects 
include the following: 
• Vasectomy 6  months or more previously, with a documented negative postvasectomy 
semen analysis for sperm.  
• Condom and spermicide.  
o In countries where spermicide is not available, condom without spermicide will be 
considered acceptable.  
o Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception.  
Acceptable contraceptive methods for female subjects include the following: 
• Bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously. 
• Continuous use of an intrauterine device (non-hormone- releasing) for at least 90  days 
before the first dose of study drug. 
• Barrier contraception (such as diaphr agm, cervical cap, or female condom) and 
spermicide.  
o In countries where spermicide is not available, barrier contraception without spermicide will be considered acceptable.  
o Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contracept ion.  
• NOTE: Hormonal contraceptives will not be considered as an effective method; however, 
female subjects are not required to discontinue hormonal contraceptives. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods for female partners of male subjects:  
• Bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously. 
• Continuous use of an intrauterine device for at least 90 days before first dose of study 
drug. 
• Barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom) and spermicide.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 59 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   o In countries where spermicide is not available, condom without spermicide will be 
considered acceptable.  
o Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception. 
• Hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least 60 days before first dose of 
study drug.  
Additional notes:  
• Acceptable methods of contraception listed above are examples. Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these examples. Please contact the Medical Monitor with any 
questions. 
• A female condom  cannot be used with a male condom (as a double method of 
contraception) due to risk of tearing. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a partner of the opposite sex. 
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according 
to local regulations and/or requirements. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, thr oughout the 
study, and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant during the study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Male subjects whose female partner becomes pregnant through well-documented in vitro fertilization (donated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug) must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this scenario, the male subject and his female partner must commit to using barrier methods of contraception (to ensure there is no exposure of the fetus to study drug) for the duration of the study and until 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through 
90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
11.7.5.2 Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during 
study treatment and within 90  days after the last dose of the study drug. 
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug must be permanently discontinued immediately. For male subjects, study drug does not need to be permanently discontinued if the female partner's pregnancy resulted from donated sperm or sperm banked before study drug 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 60 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   exposure ( Section 11.7.5.1). The investigator must notify the Medical Monitor and Vertex 
GPS within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the subject's (or partner's) pregnancy using 
the Pregnancy Inf ormation Collection Form.  
If the subject is confirmed to be on study drug, the subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy, and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE.  
11.7.6 Pulse Oximetry  
Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured at visits noted in Table 3-1 
and Table 3-2. This will be assessed following a 5-minute rest (seated or supine) and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before the morning dose. This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. 
11.7.7 Liver Function Test Parameters  
Liver Function Testing 
Liver function testing (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin) must be 
performed as noted in Table  3-2 for serum chemistry, while subjects are receiving study drug 
treatment and at the Safety Follow -up Visit. 
These blood samples should be processed and shipped immediately per the Laboratory Manual. 
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN and clinical 
symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48  to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close 
monitoring of ALT and AST levels, as clinically indicated. In addition, if ALT or AST is >5 × ULN, repeat follow-up levels must be obtained within 7 ± 2 days. 
If a subject cannot return to the site for liver function testing, a local laboratory may be used. Elevations in LFTs at the local laboratory must be report ed immediately to the Medical 
Monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption  
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), 
and the Medical Monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met and confirmed with repeat testing: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 61 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours confirms the initial elevation . Subjects in whom treatment is 
discontinued for elevated transaminases should have their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
Resumption of Study Drug 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation has been identified, study drug 
may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval of the Medical Monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation occurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug treatment must be perman ently discontinued, regardless of the presumed 
etiology. 
11.7.8 Ophthalmologic Examination 
Subjects will undergo an ophthalmologic examination performed by a licensed ophthalmologist at Screening, which includes 
• measurement of best corrected distance visual acuit y of each eye  
• measurement of lens refracting power following cycloplegia (e.g., autorefractor or 
ophthalmoscopy streak) 
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp  
The screening ophthalmologic examination must be completed and the results reviewed 
before randomization. This examination does not have to be repeated if there is documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria and that was within 3  months 
before the start of the Screening Period. Subjects who have documentation of bilateral lens removal do not need the ophthalmologic examination. 
If a cataract, lens opacity, Y -suture, or lamellar rings are identified and determined to be 
clinically significant by the ophthalmologist at the Screening examination, the subject is 
ineligible for study entry (see Section 9.2). If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and 
determined to be clinically significant by the ophthalmologist after dosing, the subject and Vertex Medical Monitor will be notified. After discussion with the Principal Investigator who collaborates with the Vertex Medical Monitor, the subject may elect to continue or discontinue study drug treatment. If the subject discontinues study drug treatment, the subject should complete the ETT and Safety Follow-up Vi sit (see Section  8.1.6). If the subject 
continues study drug treatment, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered . 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 62 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   In addition to the screening examination, an ophthalmologic examination will be performed 
by a licensed ophthalmologist at the Safety Follow -up Visit or ETT Visit for the following 
subjects: 
• subjects < 18 years of age at the Screening Visit who prematurely discontinue 
treatment after receiving at least 1  dose of study drug, 
• subjects < 18 years of age at the Screening Visit who complete study drug treatment but do not enroll in a separate extension study of VX-661/ivacaftor 
within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
This examination may be completed at either the ETT or Safety Follow -up Visit, but must be 
completed by the date of the Safety Follow -up Visit. Additional ophthalmologic 
examinations may be conducted at the discretion of the investigator. The Medical Monitor should be notified of any additional ophthalmologic examinations. 
Subjects who have documentation of bilateral lens removal are not required to complete the 
eye examination at the Safety Follow -up Visit or ETT Visit.  
In addition, at Screening, the following history will be obtained for all subjects: 
• history of steroid use 
• history or presence of diabetes 
• any prior ophthalmologic or optometric examinations 
• history of trauma to the eye 
• any family history of glaucoma, congenital cataracts, or cataracts ari sing later in life  
• use of corrective lenses (contact lenses or eyeglasses)  
• history of prolonged exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light and use of sunglasses 
• history of exposure to secondhand smoke 
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP), both o f 
which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in percent predicted  FEV
1 from study 
baseline to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements in each Treatment Period.  
The null hypotheses to be tested are that the mean change from study baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1 to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements is the same for 
(i) VX-661/ivacaftor and placebo; and (ii) ivacaftor monotherapy and placebo.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 63 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 7 percentage points, 30 subjects per sequence are 
needed to have at least 90% power to detect a 3  percentage point treatment difference 
between VX -661/ivacaftor and placebo when the mean values of the primary endpoint are 
being compared. A 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was used in the sample size calculations. Accounting for the hierarchical testing strategy, the proposed sample size will yield approximately an 85% chance of observing a statistically significant difference between ivacaftor monotherapy and placebo for the primary endpoint, under the assumption that ivacaftor monotherapy is also 3 percentage points better than placebo (refer to Section 12.3.3.2 for a detailed description of the testing strategy). Th e sample size estimate 
was based on 10,000 simulation runs with an incomplete block design assuming no dropouts. In the simulation, the correlation between responses to the 2 treatments within a subject was assumed to be zero. After adjusting for an assumed dropout rate of 10%, the sample size was increased to 34 subjects per sequence (204 total subjects). 
 
12.2 Analysis Sets  
Assignment of subjects to analysis sets will be done before the clinical data lock for the 
study.  
The All Subjects Set is defined as all subjects who were randomized or dosed (i.e., all 
subjects in the study). All subject data listings will be referenced using the All Subjects Set, 
unless otherwise specified. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who carry the intended 
CFTR mutation s (see Section 16) and who have received at least 1  dose of study drug. The 
FAS is to be used in efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned or according to the treatment sequence to which they were randomized. All analyses of background data and efficacy data will be based on the FAS. 
The Safety Set is defined as all  subjects who received at least 1  dose of study drug. The 
Safety Set is to be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. All analyses of safety data will be based on the Safety Set.  
12.3 Statistical  Analysis  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of VX -661/ivacaftor and 
ivacaftor monotherapy through 8 weeks of treatment in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del  mutation on the CFTR gene and a second allele with  a CFTR 
mutation predicted to have residual function. 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of efficacy and safety for 
this study. The Vertex Biometrics department or a designated CRO will analyze the data derived from this study. SAS
® Version 9.2 or higher will be used to generate all statistical 
outputs (tables, figures, listings, and data sets). 
Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in the SAP for the study.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 64 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3.1 General Considerations  
All individual su bject data for those randomized or exposed to study drug will be presented 
in data listings.  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary 
statistics: number of subjects (n), mean, SD, standard error (SE), median, minimum value 
(min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP.  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to 1 decimal place.  
Treatment emergent (TE) period  for Treatment Period 1 will correspond to data from the 
first dose of study drug in the first period to the safety evaluation visit  or 28 days after the last dose in the same period for subjects who do not have a safety evaluat ion visit. Similarly, 
TE period for Treatment Period 2 will correspond to data from first dose of study drug in the second period through the Safety Follow-up Visit or 28 days after the last dose in the same period for subjects who do not have an Safety Follow- up Visit.  
Baseline: For this crossover study, 2 types of baseline will be defined. The study baseline  is 
defined as the most recent nonmissing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in the study. The de finition will be applied to all 
demographics, background, and baseline characteristics and also efficacy data analysis, including the primary endpoint analysis. In addition, period baseline  is defined as the most 
recent nonmissing measurement (scheduled or  unscheduled) collected before the first dose of 
study drug in each Treatment Period. For Treatment Period 2, the baseline should be from an assessment measured after the TE period for Treatment Period 1. This definition will be applied to all safety data analysis. For ECG, baseline for Period 1 will be defined as the 
average of the 3  pretreatment measurements on Day 1. For sweat chloride, the study baseline 
value will be the mean of assessment values on the left and the right arm at the most recent time point before the first dose of study drug in the study. 
Absolute change from study baseline  will be calculated as post -baseline  
value – study baseline value.   
Relative change from study baseline will be calculated as 100  × (post-baseline value –
 study base line value)/study baseline value.   
Absolute change from period baseline will be calculated as post -baseline  
value – period baseline value.  Relative change from period baseline will be calculated as 100  × (post-baseline value –
 period baseline value)/per iod baseline value.  
12.3.2 Background Characteristics  
Subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant 
medications, study drug exposure and compliance, and other background characteristics will be summarized. Additionally, all subject data will be presented in subject data listings. All 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 65 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   summaries will be based on the FAS unless otherwise specified in the SAP for the study. No 
statistical hypothesis testing will be performed on background characteristics.  
12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition

treatment sequence:  
• All Subjects Set  
• All Randomized 
• Safety Set   
• FAS: Subjects who are randomized and  dosed and carry the intended CFTR mutation s 
(see Section 16) 
The number and percentage (based on the FAS) of subjects in each of the following disposition categories will be presented: 
• Completed study drug treatment 
• Prematurely discontinued study drug treatment and the reasons for discontinuation 
• Last scheduled on -treatment visit completed for subjects who discontinued study drug 
treatment  
• Completed study  
• Prematurely discontinued the study and the reasons for discontinuation 
• Prematurely discontinued the study during the Treatment Period and the reasons for 
discontinuation 
• Last scheduled visit completed

12.3.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, background (e.g., me dical history), and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized by treatment sequence. Protocol deviations/violations will be provided as a subject data listing only. Important protocol deviations/violations will be summarized. 
The following demographics a nd study baseline characteristics will be summarized by 
treatment sequence for the FAS: sex, race, ethnicity, age, weight, height, body mass index 
(BMI), region, study baseline percent predicted  FEV
1, study baseline sweat chloride, and 
study baseline score of CFQ -R respiratory domain.  
12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used in this study will be coded by using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as follows:  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 66 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Prior medication:  any medication that started before the first dose of study drug, 
regardless of when it ended. 
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE period 
for Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2. If a subject took a medication during a 
specific Treatment Period, this medication will be attributed to the treatment the subject 
received during this Treatment Period. As a result, 1 medication could be attributed to more than 1 treatment.  
• Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received beyond the TE 
period for Treatment Period 2, or between the TE periods for Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2, or beyond the TE period for Treatment Period 1 for subjects who do not participate in Treatment Period 2.  
A given medication can be classified as a pri or medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; 
or prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing 
start/end date or time and  it cannot be determined whether the medication was taken before 
initial dosing, concomitantly, or post-treatment, it will be considered as prior, concomitant, and post-treatment.  
Prior medications will be summarized by treatment sequence, and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment based on the FAS. Post- treatment medications will be listed 
for each subject.  
12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatment) will be summarized by treatment for the 
FAS in terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day 
minus the first day of study drug plus 1 within the Treatment Period.  
Study drug compliance will be calculated as follows:  
100 × [1 - (Total number of days study drug  interrupted) / (Duration of study drug 
exposure)]. 
The total number of days of study drug interrupted is defined as the sum of (number of days of study drug interrupted in each interruption interval); where number of days of study drug interrupted in each interval is defined as the interruption end date - the 
corresponding interruption start date + 1.  
Duration of treatment and study drug compliance will be summarized by means of descriptive summary statistics.  
12.3.3 Efficacy Analysis  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of VX -661/ivacaftor and 
ivacaftor monotherapy. For efficacy analysis, the statistical inference will be based on change from study baseline. A hierarchical testing strategy will be used to preserve the overall type I error rate at the 0.05 level. 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 68 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Secondary Endpoints  
• Relative change in percent predicted FEV 1 from study baseline to the average of the 
Week 4 and Week  8 measurements of each of th e Treatment Periods:  Analysis of this 
variable will be similar to that of the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
• Absolute change in sweat chloride from study baseline to the average of the Week 4 
and Week 8 measurements in each Treatment Period:  Analysis of this variable will be 
similar to that of the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Sensitivity analysis, supportive analysis, and subgroup analysis of secondary variables may 
be described in the SAP.  
12.3.3.3 Adjustment for Multiple C omparisons  
There are 3 potential treatment comparisons for the primary and key secondary endpoint: VX-661/ivacaftor versus placebo, ivacaftor monotherapy versus placebo, and VX-661/ivacaftor versus ivacaftor monotherapy. The testing strategy will be limite d to the 
comparison of VX-661/ivacaftor versus placebo and ivacaftor monotherapy versus placebo. The testing procedure is summarized in Figure 12-1.

CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire –Revised (respiratory domain)  
 
A hierarchical testing strategy with α = 0.05 will be used to strongly control the overall type  I 
error rate at the 0.05 level. The testing hierarchy is as follows: 
1. Absolute change in percent predicted FEV 1 from study baseline to the average of the 
Week 4 and Week 8 meas urements for VX -661/ivacaftor versus placebo. 
2. Absolute change in percent predicted FEV 1 from study baseline to the average of the 
Week 4 and Week 8 measurements for ivacaftor monotherapy versus placebo. 
3. Absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from study baseline to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements for VX -661/ivacaftor versus 
placebo. 
4. Absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from study baseline to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements for ivacaftor monotherapy versus placebo. 
 
Note that comparisons of VX-661/ivacaftor versus ivacaftor will be performed and the 
P-values will be reported, but the tests will be performed without strong Type I error control. VX-661/IVA versus PBO

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3.4 Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be based on the set of data associated with the TE period for 
Treatment Period 1 and the TE period for Treatment Period 2. Safety analyses will use the 
Safety Set. The summaries will be by treatment received.  
For safety analysis, the period baseline will be used.  
All safety data will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, lipid panel, vitamin levels, 
urinalysis, and coagulation studies) 
• ECGs 
• Vital signs  
• Pulse oximetry  
• Spirometry  
12.3.4.1 Adverse Events 
For analysis purposes, AEs will be classified as pretreatment AEs, TEAEs, or p ost-treatment 
AEs, defined as follows:  • Pretreatment AE:  any AE that started before the first dose of study drug. 
• TEAE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed during the TE 
period for Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2. An AE t hat started (or increased in 
severity) during a specific Treatment Period will be attributed to the treatment the subject 
was receiving during the Treatment Period.  
• Post-treatment AE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed 
beyond the TE period for Treatment Period 2, or between the TE periods for Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2, or beyond the TE period for Treatment Period 1 for subjects who do not have Treatment Period 2.  
For AEs with missing or partial start date, if the re is no clear evidence that the AEs started 
(or increased in severity) before the first dose, the start date will be imputed to the first dosing date and the AE assigned to the treatment in Treatment Period 1. 
AE summary tables  will be presented for TEAE only and will include the following: 
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs by relationship  
• TEAEs by maximal severity  
• TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 71 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Serious TEAEs  
• TEAEs leading to death  
• Frequently reported TEAEs  
Summaries will be presented by MedDRA system organ cl ass and preferred term using 
frequency counts and percentages (i.e., number and percentage of subjects with an event). 
When summarizing the number and percentage of subjects with an event, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing A E will be counted once, only the 
maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summaries, and the worst/highest relationship level in the relationship summaries. An AE overview table will be provided. In addition, a listing containing individual subject AE data for all deaths and other serious and significant AEs will be provided separately. All AEs, including pre- and post- treatment AEs, 
will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
12.3.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The raw values and change from period baseline values of the continuous laboratory parameters will be summarized in SI units by treatment group at each scheduled time point during the TE period. In addition, the mean value at each visit will be plotted by treatment groups for each of the liver function parameters. 
The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 potentially clinically significant (PCS) 
event during the TE period will be summarized by treatment group. The PCS (post- baseline) 
shift from period baseline will also be summarized by treatment group for selected laboratory parameters. The PCS criteria and the parameter selection criteria will be provided in the SAP.   
Results of urinalysis and serum pregnancy test will be listed in individual subject data listings only. In addition, a listing containing individual subject laboratory measurements outside the reference ranges will be provided. This listing will include data from scheduled and unscheduled time points. 
12.3.4.3 Electrocardiogram  
A summary of raw values and change from period baseline values will be provided by 
treatment group at each scheduled time point during the TE period for the following standard digital ECG measurements: PR, QT, and QTc for HR interval (QTcF); QRS duration; and HR. In addition, the mean value at each visit will be plotted by treatment groups for QTcF. 
The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 PCS event during the TE period will 
be tabulated by treatment group. The PCS criteria for ECG data will be provided in the SAP.  
Additional ECG analyses will be described in the SAP.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3.4.4 Vital Signs  
The raw values and change from period baseline values during the TE period will be 
summarized by treatment group at each scheduled time point: systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (mm  Hg), body temperature ( °C), HR (beats per minute [bpm]), and respiratory rate 
(breaths per minute).  
The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 PCS event during the TE period will 
be tabulated by treatment group. The PCS criteria for vital signs data will be provided in the SAP.  
Additional vital sign analyses will be described in the SAP.

A summary of raw values and change from period baseline values during the TE period will be provided by treatment groups at each scheduled time point for the percent of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. In addition, the mean value at each visit will be plotted by treatment group for the percent of oxygen saturation.  
The number and percentage of subjects with shift changes from period baseline 
(normal/missing and  low according to the reference range) to the lowest percent of oxygen  
saturation  during the TE period will be tabulated by treatment group. 
12.3.4.6.2  Postdose Spirometry  
For the 2-hour and 4-hour postdose measurements on Day 1 of each Treatment Period (Week 1 and Week  17), and at Day 15 of each T reatment Period (Week  2 and Week 18), a 
summary of raw values for percent predicted FEV
1 will be provided by treatment at each 
time point. The absolute change from the predose value of percent predicted FEV 1 on the 
same day will be summarized by treatment at each time point. In addition, a boxplot by time point will be provided. Within each treatment, Day 1 and Day 15 values will be presented on the same plot.  
The above analyses will be repeated for FEV
1. 
In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with percent predicted FEV 1 decline ≥10, 
≥15, and ≥20 percentage points in the absolute change from the predose value will be summarized by treatment and by assessment day and time.  
12.3.5 Interim and IDMC Analyses 
12.3.5.1 Interim Analysis  
No interim analyses of efficacy are planned.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 73 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3.5.2 IDMC Analysis  
An IDMC wil l be formed before study initiation. The IDMC’s objectives and operational 
details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC Charter), which will be finalized 
before the first subject is screened. The IDMC will conduct regular planned safety reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC Charter. 
12.4 Clinical Pharmacology Analysis  
A detailed description of the clinical pharmacology analyses will be provided in a CPAP. 
Listings of plasma concentration data of VX -661, ivacaftor, and their metabolites will be 
provided in the clinical study report. A population approach will be used to analyze the time-versus-plasma concentration data of VX-661, ivacaftor, and their metabolites. The 
PK/PD relationship between concentrations of VX-661 and ivacaftor and (their metabolites as appropriate) and efficacy and safety measurements may be investigated. The results of the PK and PK/PD analyses using a population approach will be presented in a separate report. 
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, 
Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
13.1.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a preexisting condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1.  
13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments, including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs, will be assessed, 
and those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine 
or decreased hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more 
of the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 74 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the clinical status of the subject indicates a life -threatenin g AE. 
13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent) 
• For enrolled subjects wh o have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit  
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, through the earliest  of  
o 28 days after the last dose of study drug 
o The ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug 
(Section 8.1.6) 
o prior to the first dose of study drug in the extension study. 
All subjects will be queried, using non- leading questi ons, about the occurrence of AEs at 
each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the eCRF 
and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
• Indication of dose limiting toxicity  
13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. 
The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 75 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (accessed 
August 2012). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life- threatening.” In 
considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those gi ven in 
the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13 -1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE  Severity 
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death  
 
13.1.1.5 Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). C ausality will be classified using the categories presented in  Table 13-2. 
Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality 
Classification  Definition  
Related There is an association between the event and the administration of 
investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to 
the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event re -appeared on re- exposure to the 
investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and ther e is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative et iology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
AE: adverse event.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 76 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action 
taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13 -3. 
Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE.  
Dose reduced  Not applicable for this study  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE.  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE.  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administratio n does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse  event. 
13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13 -4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/ Resolved 
With Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 
AE: adverse event.  
13.1.1.8 Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. "Yes" is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. "No" indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 77 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subj ect was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g ., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure should not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) should not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and "severe,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through 
the Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to 
Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Informat ion Collection Form 
(hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 79 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   the subject (if applicable), before study participation. The method of obtaining and 
documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH  GCP and all applicable laws and regulations and will be subject to 
approval by Vertex or its designee.  
13.2.3 Investigator Compliance  
No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator and Vertex. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will require IRB/IEC notification before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities.  
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the protocol, the investigator will contact Vertex to discuss the planned course of action. If possible, contact will be made before the implementa tion of any changes. Any departures 
from protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log. 
13.2.4 Access to Records  
The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit 
and for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of th e regulatory health 
authorities (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol. 
13.2.5 Subject Privacy  
To maintain subject confident iality, all eCRFs, study reports, and communications relating to 
the study will identify subjects by assigned subject numbers. As required by federal 
regulations, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical  records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the eCRFs/SAE 
Forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA (or other regulatory authority) may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
As applicable, in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
and associated privacy regulations, a subject authorization to use personally identifiable health information may be required from each subject before research activities begin. This authorization document will clearly specify which parties will have access to a subject' s 
personal health information, for what purpose, and for how long. 
13.2.6 Record Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to I CH GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study 

Protocol VX14- 661-108, Version 3.0 Page 80 of 89 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility, and 
Vertex will be notified.  
13.2.7 Study Termination 
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investi gators or their IRBs/IECs 
may terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Subject or investigator noncompliance 
• Unsatisfactory subject enrollment 
• Lack of adheren ce to protocol procedures 
• Lack of evaluable and/or complete data  
• Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects  
• Decision to modify drug development plan 
• Decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority 
Written notification that includes the reason for th e clinical study termination is required.  
13.3 Data Quality Assurance  
Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study 
documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study fo r each study 
participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into an eCRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. 
Vertex will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within  the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On- site checking of the eCRFs/SAE Forms for completeness 
and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed. 
The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal 
visits from a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the

FOR SUBJECTS WHO ARE HETEROZYGOUS FOR THE 
F508del-CFTR  MUTATION 
Per the study eligibility  criteria, heterozygous F508del-CFTR subjects must have a second 
CFTR allele that encodes a mutation predicte d to have residual function. Criteria for 
including a mutation are (1) having residual function based on population-level phenotypic 
data and (2) in vitro responsiv eness to ivacaftor. The criteria  for clinical phenotype are 
average sweat chloride <86 mmol/L (1 standard deviation from the average sweat chloride 
for the most common processi ng and trafficking mutation, F508del-CFTR), and incidence of 
pancreatic insufficiency ≤50% based on subjects with at least 1 copy of the mutation from 
epidemiologic data16 or published literature. 17 -24 In vitro response to ivacaftor was defined as 
an increase in percent normal chloride transport of  ≥10 percentage points in transfected 
Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing the CFTR form produced by the mutation. The 
list below represents eligible mutations.

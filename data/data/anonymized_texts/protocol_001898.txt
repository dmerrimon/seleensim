 40 
Understanding how carbohydrate metabolism is altered during exercise and post -exercise with recovery 41 
nutrition is necessary for the design and implementation of nutrition interventions aimed to maintain 42 
carbohydrate (e.g., glycogen ) stores during military operations .  The primary objective of this investigation 43 
is to determine the influence of carbohydrate availability (e.g., glycogen depletion and repletion) on skeletal 44 
muscle microRNA expression, and if changes in circulating microRNA are reflective of changes in skeletal 45 
muscle microRNA.   microRNA are small non -coding RNA that have been identified as  regulators of skeletal 46 
muscle plasticity in response to exercise, and have recently been found to be measurable stab le analytes 47 
within circulation.  Little is known regarding the influence of substrate availability, particularly carbohydrate 48 
on microRNA expression in skeletal muscle and circulation.    This randomized cross -over trial will evaluate 49 
the influence of exerc ise-induced (cycle ergometry) depletion and diet -induce d repletion of skeletal muscle 50 
carbohydrate stores (e.g., glycogen) on the expression of microRNA in skeletal muscle and circulati on in 51

 12 healthy, non -obese , recreational active male and female partic ipants between the ages of 18 -39.   After 1 
a glycogen depletion protocol, volunteers will drink a carbohydrate (CHO: 1.0 g∙kg-1∙hr-1 body mass) or an 2 
energy f ree control (CON) beverage during the 3 -hr post -exercise recovery phase  to assess the initial 3 
phase  of glycogen repletion on microRNA expression.  For the remainder of the day participants will 4 
consume meals ready -to-eat (MRE) components designed to adequately (6.0 g∙kg-1∙d-1 carbohydrate) or 5 
inadequately ( 1.5 g∙kg-1∙d-1 carbohydrate) replenish glycogen  stores.  Volunteers will return to the 6 
laboratory the following day to assess how modified daily carbohydrate intake following glycogen depletion 7 
influences microRNA expression.  At this time , volunteers will complete  80-min of stead y-state (60% 8 
VO 2peak) cycle ergometry, while consuming carbohydrate at a rate of 1.8 g∙min-1 to determine of how 9 
initiation of exercise with adequate or low glycogen stores effects exogenous carbohydrate efficiency. 10 
Following a minimum 7 -d washout period participants will retur n to the laboratory to complete the se cond 11 
arm of the investigation.  All testing will take place at the USARIEM research labs in Natick, MA.  12

B2.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE    14 
 15 
Carbohydrate Availability and Physical Performance:  Carbohydrate is a readily available fuel source in 16 
skeletal muscle, providing necessary energy to  sustain physical performance (1).  The body’s ability to 17 
store carbohydrate as glycogen is however limited, and can be altered daily by dietary intake, as well as 18 
exercise type,  intensity and duration (2).  Depletion of glycogen stores with prolonged strenuous physical 19 
activity is associated with fatigue, resulting in reduced work capacity (3).  If glycogen stores are not 20 
sufficiently replenished during recovery from exercise, physical performance may be diminished during 21 
subsequent exercise bouts.  As military personnel often engage in sustained physical activity, with mission 22 
requirements limiting  time available to eat, service members can experience degraded ability to sustain 23 
strenuous physical activi ty during military operations (4).  Understanding  how carbohydrate metabolism is 24 
altered during exerc ise and  with post-exercise recovery  nutrition is crucial for development of nutrition 25 
intervention s aimed to maintain glycogen stores during military operations to mitigate diminished physical 26 
performance.  27 
 28 
Molecular Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism:  The molecular regulation of carbohydrate 29 
metabolism in skeletal muscle is a complex network influenced by multiple factors, such as glucose , energy  30 
availability, muscle contraction, and hormonal environment  (e.g., insulin)  (5).  Modulation in one or more of 31 
these factors results in a shift in  the cellular environment , which initiates activation (e.g., phosphorylation / 32 
dephosphorylation) of signaling pathways that control glucose uptake and storage (6).  Specific to exercise - 33 
induced glycogen depletion, diminished glycogen stores stimulate the upregul ation of adenosine 34 
monophosphate -activated protein kinase (AMPK)  to enhance glucose uptake and oxidation .  Activation of 35 
AMPK phosphorylat es AKT substrate 160 (AS160) resulting in  glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation 36 
to the cell membrane to increase  glucose uptake (7).  Upregulation of AMPK also stimulate glucose 37 
breakdown (i.e., glycolysis) through elevated hexokinase activity to increase energy availability in the cell 38 
(8).  Along with AMPK, peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 -alpha (PGC -1α) is 39 
considered a ke y regulator of energy metabolism (9).  When energy availability is limited within the muscle, 40 
PGC -1α is upregulated (9).  Activation of PGC -1α modulates the activity of its downstream targets, 41 
including peroxisome proliferator -activated receptors ( PPARs) and estrogen -related receptorα (ERRα), 42 
which govern fatty acid β -oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation through  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (10).  43 
When there is an increased concentration of circulating glucose and insulin with carbohydrate 44 
consumption, AMPK and PGC -1α are downregulated to inhibit carbohydrate oxidation and increase 45 
carbohydrate storage (11).  Elevated insulin concentrations result  in insulin binding to its receptor at the 46 
membrane of cell, resulting in phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) which stimulates 47 
GLUT4 translocation to enha nce glucose uptake and storage (12).  Together , these molecular processes 48 
tightly regulate glucose uptake, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation to ensure adequate  energy availabili ty to 49 
support cellular function .   50

 microRNA and Carbohydrate Metabolism  Recently, a new class of small noncoding RNAs, termed 1 
microRNA, has been identified as critical regulators of energy homeostas is and carbohydrate metabolism 2 
(13).  Through negative inhibition, microRNA can influence molecular processes by binding to target 3 
mRNA, resulting in post -transcriptional modifications that repr ess the transl ation of protein (14). microRNA - 4 
dependent gene regulation is a complex process, as one microRNA can regulate hundreds to thousands of 5 
genes (15).  The ability for one microRNA to inhibit the expression of a large number of genes allows a 6 
single microRNA to repress several genes in a common biolog ical pathway, resulting in robust regulation of 7 
an entire molecular process (16).  Additionally, one gene can be targeted by multiple microRNA, resulting 8 
in cooperative / redundant regulation of a signal molecular process (15).  This tight regulation that 9 
microRNA exert on cellular ne tworks  (17) suggests microRNA have may be an important mechanism 10 
controlling skeletal muscle plasticity (18).   11 
    12 
Emerging evidence, suggest that altered expression of microRNA targets specific proteins that regulate 13 
carbohydrate metabolism .  In cell culture experiments , miR-451 has been shown to target  an upstream 14 
activator of AMPK , resulting in an inhibit ion of the AMPK  signaling cascade  (19).  Elevation in miR -451 15 
expression appears to be sensitive to glucose availability.  When glucose concentrations are low, miR -451 16 
expression is repressed, allowing fo r increased activation of AMPK (20).  Conversely, with high glucose 17 
concentrations miR -451 expression is increased, resulting in dimin ished AMPK  (20).  Similarly microRNA 18 
have been shown to alter normal insulin signaling processes.  Cell culture experiments have ident ified miR - 19 
33a/b a nd miR -126 as inhibitors of IRS (21, 22) .  Ov er expression of these microRNA reduce IRS protein 20 
content, resulting in insulin r esistance and impaired glucose uptake (21, 22) .  Furtherm ore, in disease 21 
states that altered metabolic demands, such as diet -induced obesity and diabetes,  dysregulation of 22 
microRNA expression has been observed, with s pecific microRNA (miR -29a, miR -34a, miR -103, miR-107, 23 
and miR -375) predicted to inhibit signali ng proteins associated with  insulin signaling  upregulated  (13).  24 
Findings from cell culture experiments and disease models indicate that microRNA contribute to regulation 25 
of carbohydrate metabolism .   26 
 27 
Our group recent ly found that microRNA which are highly enriched in skeletal muscle (i.e., myomiR) are 28 
sens itive to differing exercise mode s with or without essential amino acid plus carbohydrate 29 
supplementation  (unpublished data) .  In this investigation we found that weig hted endurance -type exercise  30 
diminished miR -1-3p, miR -206, miR -208a -5p, and miR -499 expres sion, while conventional cycle ergometry 31 
endurance exercise increased microRNA expression.  However, when cycle ergometry was combined with 32 
ingestion of essential amino acids plus carbohydrate , microRNA expression was either downregulated or 33 
remained the same immediately post and during the recovery phase, compared to baseline values.   34 
Divergent microRNA were all identified to target insulin signaling , with miR-206, miR -208-5p, and miR -499 35 
were all predicted to target Akt, an intermediate signaling protein  between IRS1 and AS160.  These 36 
findings suggest that diminished microRNA expression immediately following exercise may have a 37 
functional role in mediating glucose uptake to replenish glycogen stores.   Corroborating our findings, 38 
previous investigations ha ve reported the microRNA acutely altered by exercise.  Following an acute bout 39 
of endurance exercise there is diminished expression of miR -23, while mRNA expression of PGC -1α and 40 
its downstream targets are upregulated (23, 24) .  When miR -23 is overexpressed in skeletal muscle there 41 
is a reduction in total  PGC -1α mRNA and protein content that results in reduced efficiency of mitochondrial 42 
function, an organelle crucial to cellular energy production (23).  Furthermore, endurance exercise also 43 
downregulates miR -494, another inhibitor of PGC -1α, allowing for increased gene expression of PGC -1α 44 
and mitochondrial transcription factor A (25).  While interventions have  been conducted examining the 45 
relationship of mi croRNA expression to energy sensing genes in re sponse to endurance exercise , no study 46 
has investigated the influence of altered glycogen  availability in response to dietary manipulation on 47 
microRNA expression .  Understanding how glycogen availability alters expression of microRNA will enable 48 
determination of their functional role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism to support energy availability to 49 
fuel physical performance.        50

 Circulating microRNA:  Beyond their regulatory function within tissue, microRNA have been reported to be 1 
stable and reproducible an alytes present in circulation (26).  From the cytoplasm, microRNA can be 2 
released into the circulation in membrane -derived vesicles (exosomes), complexed with proteins, 3 
lipoproteins (cholesterol), or apoptotic bodies (plasma membrane fragments) (27).  Once released from the 4 
cell, circulating microRNA can function in cell -to-cell communication, indicatin g an endocrine -like function 5 
(28).  Though the exact mechanism by which circulating microRNA influence cellular processes is still 6 
unknown, it has been observed that alterations in circulating microRNA profiles reflect the underlying 7 
physiological  state of the tissue (29).  In disease states that negative impact skeletal muscle, multiple 8 
investigations have shown alterations in circulating microRNA profiles are reflective the underlying 9 
physiological c ondition of skeletal muscle (30-32).  In healthy individuals, our preliminary findings indicate 10 
that circulating microRNA profiles can  be used as a predictive tool to determine anabolic signaling in 11 
response to acute resistance exercise in skeletal muscle (33).  Use of advanced statistical and 12 
bioinformatics analysis identified IGF -1 and mTORC1 signaling as the top canonical pathways upregulated 13 
post-exercise.  T hese findings were supported by activation (e.g., phosphorylation) status of mTORC1 14 
signaling in skeletal muscle following resistance exercise.  Western blotting results determined that an 15 
upregulation in upstream (p -AktSer473) and downstream (p -70S6K1Thr389) targets of mTORC1, were 16 
positively associated with increased expression of specific circulating microRNA that have been reported to 17 
target this pathway.  Though  these and other recent (34, 35)  findings suggest that circulating microRNA 18 
profiles are a ltered by acute exercise, little is known regarding the influence of substrate availability, 19 
particularly carbohydrate, on circulating microRNA expression.  As microRNA regulate metabolic pathways 20 
within skeletal muscle, alterations in circulating microRNA  expression profiles may be used as a marker for 21 
underlying molecular adaptions within tissue.  Though assessment of microRNA expression in skeletal 22 
muscle can yield valuable insight into their functional role in energy metabolism, this type of data collec tion 23 
requires invasive muscle biopsies, which is difficult to perform during military field operations.  Identification 24 
of circulating microRNA as non -invasive markers of carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle has the 25 
capacity to signal nutritional rea diness of service members.   26 
 27 
B3.  MILITARY RELEVANCE     28 
 29 
Military personnel often engage in sustained physical activity while time to eat and availabili ty of food is 30 
limited (4, 36, 37) . Under such conditions, it is likely that skeletal muscle glycogen stores are depleted, 31 
reducing the service member’s ability to maintain an optimal level of physical performance. However, 32 
during ‘real -world’ military training operations there is limited knowledge regarding altered carbohydrate 33 
metabolism at the skeletal muscle level, as invasive investigations requiring muscle biopsies cannot be 34 
condu cted during training operations.   Identifying the mechanism, as well as determination of non -invasive 35 
markers of molecular pathways regulating carbohydrate metabolism is critical to move findings from 36 
controlled laboratory settings to field operations.  M odeling of circulating microRNA may allow for a more 37 
comprehensive understanding of nutrient adequacy during military operations, allowing for implementation 38 
of targeted nutrition interventions to optimize military performance.   Support for this protocol c omes from 39 
Defense Health Program (DHP) Research funds, under Joint Program Committee -5 Nutrition and dietary 40 
supplements working group.      41

 2. Determine how initiation of exercise with adequate or low glycogen stores effects exogenous 1 
carbohydrate efficiency.  2 
 3 
Hypotheses  4 
 5 
1. Expression of microRNA in skeletal muscle will be influenced by alterations in glycogen status, and 6 
that these changes in skeletal muscle microRNA will be associated with modulation in circulat ing 7 
microRNA.  8 
 9 
2. Exogenous carbohydrate efficiency will be greater when exercise is initiated with lower glycogen 10 
stores.  Increased efficiency will be associated with higher phosphorylation of IRS -1 and AMPK.    11

Study Design  18 
Following a 10 -hr overnight fast, a baseline blood draw will be conducted.  A baseline muscle biopsy, 19 
obtained from the lateral portion of the vastus lateralis, will be collected under local anesthetic (lidoc aine).  20 
Participants will rest for 15 -min before beginning a 5 -min warm -up on a cycle ergometer at 50% peak 21 
power output (determined from screening VO 2peak test).  A glycogen depletion protocol (38) will then be 22 
initiated with participants cycling at various intensities until failure.  A second muscle biopsy will be 23 
performed immediately after completion of glycogen depletion.   This biopsy will allow for confirmation of 24 
glycogen depletion and allow f or the assessment of the initial impact of exercise -induced glycogen 25 
depletion on microRNA expression.  Participants will then consume a carbohydrate (CHO: 1 g∙kg-1∙hr-1) or 26 
an energy free control (CON) beverage matched for taste and color during the first  3-hr post glycogen 27 
depletion.  Blood will be drawn from a catheter every 30 -min post -exercise to assess changes in serum 28 
glucose and insulin.  At 3 -hr post -exercise a third muscle biopsy will be conducted to assess acute effects 29 
of carbohydrate consumptio n on microRNA  during the initial phase of glycogen resynthesis during the early 30 
phase recovery from exercise.     For the remainder of the day participants will consume meals ready -to-eat 31 
(MRE) components designed to adequately or inadequately replenish gly cogen stores.  On the study day in 32 
which  participants receive the carbohydrate beverage, daily intake will be provided as 6.0 g∙kg-1 33 
carbohydrate, 1.2 g∙kg-1 protein, 1 g∙kg-1 fat.  On the study day in which participants receive the placebo 34 
beverage, daily  intake will be provided as 1.5 g∙kg-1 carbohydrate, 1.2 g∙kg-1 protein, 3.0 g∙kg-1 fat.  35 
Following a 10 -hr overnight fast, participants will return to the laboratory for a fourth muscle biopsy.  As 24 - 36 
hrs is sufficient time to replenish glycogen stores (1 ), the fourth muscle biopsy with modified daily 37 
carbohydrate intake will allow for isolation of the effect of carbohydrate availability on microRNA 38 
expression.  Volunteers will then complete 80-min of steady -state (~60% VO 2peak) cycle ergometry 39 
consuming c arbohydrate  at a rate of 1.8 g∙min-1 enriched with U-13C-glucose  and U-13C6-D-fuctose  to 40 
determine exogenous carbohydrate efficiency.  A final biopsy will be taken at the conclusion of the exercise 41 
bout. This fifth biopsy will be conducted to assess the impact of initiating steady -state exercise with 42 
adequate or low glycogen stores on molecular markers of glucose uptake and substrate utilization.  43 
Following a minimum 7 -d washout period volunteers will retu rn to the laboratory to complete the second 44 
arm of the investigation.  To ensure glycogen stores are similar between volunteers on testing day, 48 -hrs 45 
prior to testing all volunteers will complete a glycogen depletion protocol and then consume a diet provi ding 46 
6.0 g∙kg-1 carbohydrate to replenish glycogen stores.     47

Research Procedures  6 
Diet Intervention  7 
Volunteers will complete a baseline 3 -d diet record ( Appendix A ) and a 3 -d activity log ( Appendix B ) 8 
according to instructions provided by study team dietitians (39).    The data will be analyzed using Food 9 
Processor SQLTM (Salem, OR Version 10.0) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 10 
Compendium of Physical Activities, respectively.  Information for these forms will be collected to estimate 11 
volunteers total daily energy requirements.  To ensure all volunteers begin the protocol day with similar 12 
glycogen stores, following glycogen depletion 48 -hrs before testing, volunteers will be provided with food 13 
and beverages (except water) containing 6.0 g carbohydrate  ∙kg-1∙d-1 to replete glycogen  stores .  Meals will 14 
be derived from military combat  rations (MRE) and supplemental  food items.  Example of energy and 15 
macronutrient content will be consistent with ACSM dietary guidelines ( Table 1 ) (40).         16 
 17 
On glycogen depletion protocol days, volunteers will receive standardized meals derived from MRE 18 
components and supplemental carbohydrate -based food items.  Meals will either pr ovide adequate 19 
carbohydrate (6.0 g ∙kg-1∙d-1) to replenish glycogen store s or provide low carbohydrate (1.5  g∙kg-1∙d-1) so 20 
glycogen stores remain below baseline concentrations ( Table 1 ).  Study dietitians will prepare and 21 
administer meals to volunteers.  In this cross -over study the order of carbohydrate intake amount will be 22 
randomized to avoid order bias.    23

Volunteers will be instructed to maintain their normal physical activity during the study.  However, 4 
volunteers will be required to refrain from any additional physical activity outside of the study (resistance 5 
and endurance exercise) 48 -hrs before the glycogen depletion protocol days.  Restriction of physical 6 
activity will minimize complications and the p otential for carryover effects that may influence study 7 
outcomes.   8 
 9 
Anthropometric Data  10 
Anthropometrics, performed using standardized techniques and equipment, will be used to determine 11 
volunteer eligibility and characterize study participants.  Height wi ll be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm 12 
using a stadiometer at screening. Body mass will be measured, semi -nude and after an overnig ht fast (≥ 8 13 
hr), using a calibrated digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg at screening.  Body mass will be measured at 14 
baseline,  the morning of and the morning after glycogen depletion protocol days.  15 
 16 
Body composition will be determined using dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DEXA, DPX -IQ, GE Lunar 17 
Corporation, Madison, WI).  The DEXA technique allows for the non -invasive assessment of soft tissue 18 
composition by region with a precision of 1 -3% (41). The volunteer will lay face -up on the DEXA 19 
densitometer table in shorts, t -shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to remain motionless for 20 
the 8 -10 min scan. These data will be used to calculate total body mass, fat -free mass, and fat mass. 21 
Calibration to external standards will be performed before actual data collection. The operator remains in 22 
the room with the volunteer during the scan.  23 
 24 
Determination of Peak Oxygen Uptake  25 
Peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak) will be determined by a cycle ergometer test using a computer -based 26 
metabolic system (True Max 2400, Parvomedics, Sandy, Utah , USA ).  Volunteers will be instructed to fast 27 
overnight (≥ 8 hr) before testing.  Volunteers will be clothed in appropriate athletic attire and perform this 28 
assessment at  standard ambient indoor temperature (20 -22C) and humidity conditions (30 -80%).  29 
Following instructions on testing procedures, the volunteer will be allowed a 5 -min warm -up pedaling at 30 
70W.   At the start of testing, the volunteer will put on a nose clip and a mouthpiece connected to a 2 -way 31 
respiratory valve, which is attached to a head piece to hold it in place.  Every minute, workload intensity will 32 
be progressively increase by 30W until the volunteer is fatigued or unable to maintain a pedaling rate th at 33 
either maintains or increases O 2 consumption.   Heart rate will be monitored using a heart -rate monitor 34 
(Polar Electro Inc, Oulu, Finland) the last 30 seconds of each workload.  The test will be stopped 35 
immediately if the subject reports angina -like sym ptoms, exertional syncope, shows signs of poor perfusion 36 
(i.e., light -headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or cold and clammy skin), or if testing 37 
equipment fails.   38 
 39 
Glycogen Depletion Protocol  40 
The glycogen depletion protocol will be completed on a cycle ergometer, with intensity based on results 41 
from VO 2peak assessment.  Volunteers will begin with a 5 -min warm -up at 70 watts  before beginning the 42 
glycogen depletion protocol.  After the warm -up period volunteers will complete 2 -min of h igh-intensity 43

 cycling (work period) at 90% VO 2peak, followed by 2 -min recovery period where volunteers will cycle at 50% 1 
VO 2peak.  This work -to-recovery ratio will be maintained until volunteers are no longer able to complete 2 - 2 
min of cycling at 90% VO 2pea k, determined as the inability to maintain a cycling cadence of 60 rpm for 15 - 3 
sec.  Cycling intensity will then be lowered to 80% VO 2peak.  When the volunteer is unable to complete 2 - 4 
min of cycling at 80% VO 2peak, cycling intensity will be lowered to 70% V O2peak.   Once the volunteer can no 5 
longer complete 2 -min of cycling at 70% VO 2peak, cycling intensity will be lowered to 60% VO 2peak.   The 6 
glycogen depletion protocol will be terminated once the volunteer is unable to complete 2 -min of cycling at 7 
60% VO 2peak.  For each drop in the intensity of the work period, the cycling intensity during the recovery 8 
period will be maintained at 50% VO 2peak for 2-min.  This exercise protocol will maximally deplete muscle 9 
glycogen stores (38).  Prior to the protocol day, volunteers will perform two practice sessions to en sure 10 
they are familiar with the glycogen depletion protocol procedures.  Following familiarization volunteers will 11 
complete four glycogen depletion protocols, two 48 -hrs before testing and two testing days.  12 
 13 
Volunteers will be allowed to consume water ad libitum during the glycogen depletion protocol.  Exercise 14 
will be conducted in a temperature controlled room.  Heart rate will be monitored using a heart -rate monitor 15 
and the session will be terminated if the subject reports any discomfort (i.e. angina -like symptoms or 16 
exertional syncope) or shows signs of poor perfusion, or if there is an equipment failure.   17 
 18 
Muscle Biopsy   19 
Percutaneous muscle biopsy will be performed to obtained skeletal muscle samples for assessment of 20 
muscle glycogen, microRNA expression and molecular pathways regulating carbohydrate metabolism.  21 
Muscle samples will be taken from the vastus lateralis using  a 5-mm Bergstrom needle with manual suction 22 
while the participant is under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) according to the approved USARIEM SOP 23 
(42, 43) . Multiple passes with the biopsy needle may be necessary to obtain adequate sample with each 24 
biopsy.  Muscle biopsies will be conducted immediately before and after the muscle glycogen depletion 25 
protocol.  After the second muscle biopsy volunteers will res t and consume either a carbohydrate beverage 26 
or a matched placebo.  Three hours following the conclusion of the glycogen depletion protocol a third 27 
biopsy will be obtained to assess the acute influence of carbohydrate intake.  Volunteers will be allowed to  28 
leave at this point.  Volunteers will return the following morning for a fourth muscle biopsy taken at a new 29 
incision site.  In this same incision a fifth biopsy will be taken after 80-min of steady state exercise to 30 
determine the influence of adequate or  low glycogen storage on exogenous carbohydrate uptake and 31 
oxidation during exercise.  Following a minimum 7 -d washout period, volunteers will return to the laboratory 32 
to complete the second arm of the investigation.  A total of ten muscle biopsies will be  conducted per 33 
volunteer.          34 
 35 
Assessment of Resting Respiratory Quotient  36 
Respiratory Quotient (RQ) will be measured under resting conditions before the 24 -hr post glycogen 37 
depletion muscle biopsy, using open circuit indirect calorimetry (Parvo Medic s).  Assessment of RQ will 38 
allow us to determine the influence of glycogen storage on carbohydrate and fat oxidation.  Measurements 39 
will occur between 0500 -0800 -hrs following a minimum 10 -hr overnight fast. Volunteers will rest in the 40 
supine position for a pproximately 30 -min prior to each measurement in a quiet and dim, temperature 41 
regulated room. To minimize error, volunteers will be instructed to minimize movement once the 42 
mouthpiece is inserted, or the mask/hood is placed over their heads to collect expi red air. The test will be 43 
discontinued when 10 -min of steady state oxygen consumption (VO 2) and carbon dioxide production 44 
(VCO 2) are recorded.    45 
 46 
Steady -State Exercise  47 
After the fourth muscle biopsy volunteers will complete 80 -min of steady -state exercise  on the cycle 48 
ergometer at 60 ± 5% of their VO 2peak.  During exercise VO 2 and VCO 2 will be measured for 4 -min using a 49 
metabolic cart (Parvo Medics) at approximately 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 -min to determine substrate 50 
oxidation. HR (measu red continuously; Polar Electro ) will be recorded at the same times as the metabolic 51

 cart measurements. Breath samples will be collected at approximately 0, 20, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80- 1 
min to determine exogenous carbohydrate oxidation using single -patient breath coll ection bags (Quin -Tron 2 
Instrument Company, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Breath will be transferred to 20 mL evacuated tubes.    3 
 4 
Carbohydrate Supplementation  5 
After the post  glycogen depletion muscle biopsy, volunteers will drink a CHO (glucose and fructose in a 2:1 6 
ratio) or CON beverage (Combat Feeding , Natick , MA.  Carbohydrate will be provided at 1 g∙kg-1∙hr-1 in 7 
accordance with current American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines (40). The CON beverage will be 8 
sugar free and void of other nutrients to allow for assessment of the independent effect of carbohydrate 9 
availability on skeletal muscle and circulating microRNA expression.   Beverag es will be consumed 10 
immediately following the post glycogen depletion muscle biopsy and then every 30 min thereafter (5 11 
times) until the 3 -hr post glycogen depletion muscle biopsy.  12 
 13 
Additionally, all participants will consume the CHO beverage at 1.8 g∙min-1 during steady -state exercise to 14 
examine the impact of glycogen availability on exogenous carbohydrate oxidation efficiency.   Volunteers 15 
will consume the beverage immediately before the start of the exercise and then again at 20, 40, and 60 - 16 
min during th e exercise bout.  The CHO beverage  consumed during exercise  will be enriched with 200 mg 17 
of U-13C-glucose  and U -13C6-D-fructose  (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Andover, MA, USA) to significantly 18 
increase the isotopic enrichment above natural levels and optimize the measurement of exogenous 19 
carbohydrate oxidation.      20 
       21 
B5.4  Data Collection    22 
 23 
Blood Sampling  24 
Blood samples will  be collected using intravenous access by a USARIEM credentialed phlebotomist on 25 
glycogen protocol days at baseline (before glycogen depletion), immediately following and every 30 min 26 
after the glycogen depletion protocol to assess circulating glucose and insulin ( Figure 1).  Baseline and 24 - 27 
hr post glycogen depletion blood sampling will occur after a 10 -hr overnight fast.  A total of 1 20 mL of blood 28 
will be sampled from each volunteer during each glycogen depletion protocol day study ( Table 2 ).  Blood 29 
samp les will be used to assess nutrient status (glucose and insulin) and circulating microRNA.     30 
   31 
Biochemical indices of metabolic homeostasis will be measured from stored samples at USARIEM.  32 
Unused serum will be retained for future u se if subject provide  permission in the informed consent 33 
document .  Samples will be stored at USARIEM using subject identification numbers.  34

Breath Sample Processing for Isotopic Enrichment  38 
Measurement of 13C/12C in expired CO 2 will be measured using isotope -ratio mass and cavity ring -down 39 
spectroscopy (Metabolic Solutions, Inc., Nashua, NH).  40 
 41 
Calculations of Carbohydrate and Fat Oxidation  42 
Fat and CHO oxidation will be calculated from VO 2 and VCO 2 measured using open circuit indirect 43 
calorimetry (4 min collection), neglecting the contribution of protein oxidation to the energy yield  (44): 44 
 45 
Fat oxidation (g/min) = 1.695 x VO 2 (L/min) – 1.701 x VCO 2 (L/min)   46

 Glucose oxidation (g /min) = 4.585 x VC O2 (L/min)  – 3.226  x VO 2 (L/min)  1

Calculations of Exogenous and Endogenous Glucose Oxidation  3 
Exogenous glucose oxidation can be calculated:  4 
 5 
Exogenous glucose (g/min) = VCO 2 [(Rexp - Rref)/(Rexo - Rref)]/k  6 
 7 
where VCO 2 is in L/min, Rexp is the observed isotopic composition of expired CO 2, Rref is the isotopic 8 
composition of expired CO 2 at rest before ingestion of the first dose of 13C-glucose  and U-13C6-D-fructose , 9 
Rexo is the isotopic composition of the exogenous glucose ingested, and k (0.747 L /g) is the volume of 10 
CO 2 provided by the complete oxidation of glucose. Endogenous glucose oxidation can be calculated by 11 
subtracting exogenous glucose o xidation from total CHO oxidation. The first 40 min of steady -state 12 
exercise will allow for equilibration between the 13C/12C in expired CO 2 and the 13C/12C in CO 2 produced in 13 
tissues (45). Thus, endogenous glucose oxidation will only be calculated from samples obtained in the last 14 
40 m in of steady -state exercise (4 0 to 80 min).  15 
 16 
Muscle Glycogen  17 
Approximately 20 mg of muscle will be dehydrated in a freeze dryer.  Samples will then be ground to 18 
powder and visible connective tissue will be removed.  Powdered muscle will be placed in 500 µl 2 N H Cl.  19 
Samples will then be placed in an incubator for 120 min at 100 ˚C.  Following incubation samples will be 20 
neutralized with 1500 µl 0.67 N NaOH.  Muscle glycogen will be in solution at this point.  Glycogen will be 21 
quantified by a fluorometric assay (Sig ma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).      22 
 23 
Intramuscular Triglyceride Concentrations  24 
Intramuscular triglyceride concentrations will be determined using the Folch method (46). Dehydrate 25 
muscle will be homogenized in a 2:1 chloroform -to-methanol solvent. Following extraction, samples will be 26 
saponified in ethanolic KOH at 60 °C, and glycerol content will determined using a commercially available 27 
colorimetri c assay (Sigma)  28 
 29 
mRNA and microRNA Expression  30 
Total RNA will be isolated from approximately 25 mg of muscle using a mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit 31 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  Quantity and quality of RNA will be assessed using a Nanodrop ND - 32 
1000spectro photometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA).  Equal amounts of total RNA will be 33 
synthesized into cDNA for analysis of mRNA (iScriptTM Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit; Bio -Rad) and a 34 
TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).   Individua l primers will be used to 35 
determine the mRNA expression of known intracellular targets regulating muscle  metabolism, to include 36 
but not limited to PGC -1α, SIRT1, ACC, AMPK, PDK4, IRS1, and GLUT4 .    miRNA (20 -40 bp) will be size - 37 
selected from total RNA using Illumina’s protocol  (US Army Center for Environmental Health Research, 38 
Frederick, MD) . The sorted miRNA will be tagged and assayed using the Illumina NextSeq instrument. 39 
Briefly, 500 ng total RNA will be used to construct sequencing libraries. Subseq uently, the samples will be 40 
amplified using index -tagged primers to facilitate multiplexing. The amplified cDNA constructs will be size - 41 
selected, quality controlled before loading to the NextSeq instrument to generate 50 base reads. Image 42 
analysis and base  calling will be performed using the Illumina pipeline.  43 
 44 
Preprocessing of raw base calls, sample de -multiplexing, trimming and filtering will be similar to that 45 
described in ‘Analysis of sequencing output’. For the miRNA quantification/enrichment, reads a re first 46 
aligned to the Rfam RNA database to filter and profile other small RNA species in the samples. Then reads 47 
are mapped for small RNA annotation against reference zebrafish mature mature RNA sequences from the 48 
miRBASE database. The miRNA read count m atrix for each sample will be generated using open source 49 
tools such as PICARD.    50

 Following identification of skeletal muscle microRNA  that had a significant change , Taqman® probes 1 
(Applied Biosystems) will be used to assess the expression of these microR NA in serum to determine their 2 
potential use as noninvasive markers of altered carbohydrate metabolism following glycogen depletion and 3 
repletion.  Total c irculating miRNA will be extracted from 200 µL serum using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit, 4 
which allows fo r extraction and purification of small (< 200 nt) cell -free RNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). 5 
Exosomal circulating miRNA will also be extract from 1000 µL serum  using miRCURYTM RNA Isolation Kit 6 
to measure miRNA. To avoid introduction of potentially contami nating material, prior to RNA extraction 7 
serum samples will be centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris.  Supernatant will be 8 
removed and transferred to a new tube without disturbing the pellet.  Due to the small amount of RNA in 9 
the serum, 3.5 µL of a Spike -In Control (C. elegans miR -39; Qiagen) will be added to all samples prior to 10 
extraction of RNA to determine the yield of template recovered.  After extraction 3 μl of serum RNA will 11 
reverse transcribed using the TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (A pplied Biosystems) with miRNA -specific stem - 12 
loop RT primers pooled in 1X -Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer for a final dilution of 0.05X.  A pre -amplification step 13 
will be performed after reverse transcription to increase cDNA template using a primer pool of 20 X 14 
Taqm an® Small RNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) for miRNA of interest at 0.05X concentration in 1X TE 15 
buffer.  All serum miRNA will be normalized to the geometric of external (Spike -In Control C. elegans miR - 16 
39) and internal controls to allow for both technical and inter -individual normalization (47). Geometric mean 17 
of controls will be used to correct for possible outlying values and abundance differences between the 18 
different controls (48).   19 
 20 
All reverse transcription for  mRNA and miRNA, and pre -amplification of serum miRNA will be conducted in 21 
a T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA). A StepOnePlusTM real-time PCR system (Applied 22 
Biosystems) will be used to perform all mRNA and miRNA analysis.  Fold changes will be  calculated using 23 
the ∆∆ cycle threshold (∆∆ CT) method as described below in statistical analysis section.  24 
 25 
Bioinformatics Analysis  26 
microRNA with significant changes in their expression will be uploaded to DNA Intelligent Analysis 27 
(DIANA) -miRPath 3.0 (Alex ander Fleming Biological Sciences Research Center [BSRC], Athens, Greece; 28 
http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr) to determine potential molecular pathways that these microRNA have 29 
previously been reported to regulate. Relevant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Geno mes (KEGG; 30 
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathways will be identified using experimentally verified targets from TarBase 31 
7.0 (Alexander Fleming BSRC).  Based on findings from this analysis, relevant gene and protein 32 
expression of relevant targets will be asse ssed.    33 
 34 
Western Blotting  35 
Approximately 30 mg of muscle will be homogenized in ice -cold buffer (1:10 wt/vol) containing 50 mM Tris – 36 
HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM Na -pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% 37 
Triton -X, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM benz -amidine, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg mL −1 trypsin inhibitor and 2 μg mL−1 38 
aprotinin.  Homogenate will be centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C.  Protein concentration of 39 
supernatant (lysate) will be determined using 660 nm Protein Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, 40 
MA, USA).  Phosph orylation status and total protein expression of molecular markers associated with 41 
carbohydrate metabolism will be determined using Western blot.  Muscle lysates will be solubilized in 42 
Laemmli buffer, with equal amounts of total protein (15 μg) separated b y SDS -PAGE using precast 43 
Tris·HCl gels (Bio -Rad). Proteins will be transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and 44 
exposed to commercially available primary antibodies of intracellular markers involved with muscle  45 
metabolism to include but not limited to Akt, p -AktSer473, AMPKα, p - AMPKαThr172, PGC -1α , SIRT1, ACC, p - 46 
ACCSer79, PDK4, IRS1, p -IRS1 Ser302, GSK -3β, p -GSK -3βSer9, GSK -3α , p-GSK -3α Ser21, GLUT4 and PEPCK  47 
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight.  Labeling will be  performed using 48 
secondary antibody (anti -rabbit IgG conjugate with horseradish peroxidase; Cell Signaling Technology), 49 
and chemiluminescent reagent will be applied (Super Signal, West Pico Kit; Pierce Biotechnology, 50 
Rockford, IL, USA). Blots will be quant ified using a phosphoimager (ChemiDoc XRS; Bio -Rad) and Image 51

Citrate Synthase Activity  4 
Homogenate from muscle samples prep ared for Western blotting will be used to assess citrate synthase 5 
activity. Enzyme activity will be determined using a colorimetric assay analyzed on an SpectraMax® M 6 
Series Multi -Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), by combining 10 μl of 7 
diluted (1:10; 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 8.1) sample to 150 μl of reaction master mix (1 mL DNTB, 3 mg Acetyl 8 
CoA, and 8 mL 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 8.1). The reaction w as initiated when 10 μl of 10 mM oxaloacetate was 9 
added to each well (49). Samples were read at 412 nm. Data were normalized to pro tein content.  10

 All potential volunteers will complete the background questionnaire ( Appendix H). Volunteers must be 1 
medically cleared by the Office of Medical Support and Oversight (OMSO) for participation in accordance 2 
with USARIEM procedures outlined for screening volunteers for research involving exercise. Potential 3 
military and civilian participants will undergo the same clearances used at USARIEM for research invol ving 4 
maximal aerobic exercise testing. In addition, volunteers will be screened for problems with blood clotting, 5 
including prothrombin time (PT)/ partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is a specific criterion for research 6 
involving muscle biopsies. Heal th problems identified during the screening process will be documented and 7 
a copy provided to the volunteer. The volunteer will be encouraged to make an appointment with their 8 
primary care provider for a full evaluation of the problem. Volunteers with evid ence of any physical, mental, 9 
and/or medical conditions that would make the proposed studies relatively more hazardous will be 10 
excluded. Any personal health information collected during this screening process will be destroyed at the 11 
time of study withdraw al or at the completion of the study.  12 
 13 
All females will be given a urine pregnancy test during the initial screening and the morning of or at least 24 14 
hours prior to each DEXA scan. The test will be read by a female member of the study team and the results  15 
will be shared with the volunteer. If the pregnancy test is positive, the volunteer will be excluded from 16 
further participation in this study.  17 
 18 
All volunteers must be willing to consume only food and beverages provided by study staff during the 48 -hr 19

It is the policy of USAMRMC that data sheets are to be completed on all volunteers participating in this 2 
research for entry into the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Volunteer Registry 3 
Database.  The information to be entered into this confidential database includes name, address, social 4 
security number, study name, and dates.  The intent of the database is twofold: first, to readily answer 5 
questions concerning an individual’s participation in research sponsored b y the USAMRMC; and second, to 6 
ensure that the USAMRMC can exercise its obligation to ensure research volunteers are adequately 7 
warned (duty to warn) of risks and to provide new information as it becomes available.  The information will 8 
be stored at the USA MRMC for a minimum of 75 years.  9 
 10 
C2.  COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION    11 
 12 
Military and civilian personnel will receive $35 for each successful blood draw.  There are 20 blood draws 13 
during the two glycogen depletion protocol days (10 per protocol day).  Volunteers completing all 20 draws will 14 
receive $700.  If a volunteer does no t complete the entire study, they will be compensated for the number of 15 
successful blood draws they did complete.  Volunteers will not be eligible for any other form of compensation 16 
during this study.    17 
 18 
C3.  WITHDRAWAL FROM RESEARCH PARTICIPATION    19 
 20 
Participants will be allowed to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would 21 
otherwise be entitled.  An investigator may stop an individual’s participation in the study if the participant is 22 
unwilling or unable to complete study  procedures.  An investigator or the medical monitor may also withdraw a 23 
participant if the individual becomes ill or injured or it would not be in the participant’s best interest to continue.   24 
 25 
C4.  PRIVACY FOR SUBJECTS    26 
 27 
To protect the participant ’s privacy, any of their research -related records will be labeled or “coded” with an 28 
assigned research participant number that will not include their name or social security number. Dr. Lee M. 29 
Margolis will keep the link between participant number and the par ticipant ’s research records in a locked 30 
cabinet.  Any documents that will require the participant’s name, such as the consent form, will be kept in a 31 
locked cabinet separate from any research documents that contain the participant’s ID number.  The princip al 32 
investigator is the only person who will be able to match the research participant number with any of their 33 
personal identifying information.    34 
 35 
When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will be included  36 
that would reveal the participants identity to others.  If photographs, videos, or audio -tape recordings of you will 37 
be used for educational purposes, your identity will be protected or disguised.  All identifiable or recognizable 38 
information (e.g., names  and faces) will be covered in any photographs unless volunteers agree to sign a 39 
photo release form.  40

C6.  RISKS  OF HARM , MEASURES TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF HARM , AND BENEFITS OF 12 
PARTICIPATION  13 
 14 
       C6.1 Risks of Harm    15 
 16 
Research Procedure Name:  DEXA Scan  17 
Research Procedure Description:  Volunteer will lay face -up on the DEXA densitometer table in shorts, t - 18 
shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to remain motionless for the 8 -10 min scan.  19 
Research -related Ri sks:  The DEXA scan is an X -ray and is considered to be a no greater than minimal 20 
risk procedure.  The radiation dose of the whole -body DEXA scan is 0.1 mrem.  This dose is equivalent to 21 
approximately 1/250 of normal annual background radiation, 1/9 of the  radiation received in a transatlantic 22 
flight, or 1/30 of the radiation received in a chest X -ray.     23 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  A quality assurance check will be 24 
completed on the DEXA each day prior to its use; the so ftware will not allow the use of the DEXA 25 
densitometer if the quality assurance check fails.  All females will be required to have a pregnancy test the 26 
day before, or the day of testing.  If you are pregnant you will not be scanned, nor will you be able to  27 
continue the study.  28 
  29 
Research Procedure Name:  Indwelling Catheters  30 
Research Procedure Description:  A 18-20 g x 1.25 inch needle will be used to guide a catheter into the 31 
antecubital vein of the volunteer.  The catheter will be attached to saline to keep the line patent for multiple 32 
blood draws.     33 
Research -related Risks:  The risks of blood sampling are small  and usually limited to local bruising or 34 
swelling.  Also sometimes volunteers feel faint or may faint, and in very rare cases experience a seizure 35 
during or right after a blood draw.  If the volunteer has had problems with fainting during blood draws in 36 
the past, they may be more prone to them during future procedures.  If the catheter, the tube that is left in 37 
the arm after the needle is removed, becomes clogged at any time during the protocol, we will have to 38 
replace this to continue blood sampling and t herefore the study. This will require another needle to be 39 
inserted into your arm.   40 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  Trained technicians will use sterile 41 
techniques to place the catheter; however, in spite of being careful t here is a chance that the site may 42 
become infected.  Volunteers should not give blood for eight weeks before or after this study.   43

Research Procedure Name:  Venipuncture  45 
Research Procedure Description:  A 21 g  x 0.75 inch needle will be used for single bl ood draws of the 46 
antecubital vein.    47 
Research -related Risks:  Venipuncture is a routine clinical procedure the medical community commonly 48 
uses to obtain blood samples.  The immediate complications may be slight pain during the entry of the 49 
needle into the skin, possible dizziness, syncope, and in very rare cases experience a seizure.  Dizziness 50 
or syncope constitutes no long -term harm, and immediate relief is achieved by having the subject put their 51

 head down between their knees or lie down.  Additionally, a hematoma may result from the venipuncture, 1 
but this is more unsightly than risk producing.  Late complications might include thrombosis of the vein due 2 
to trauma or infection.  These complications are extremely rare.  3 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: ( Precautions, safeguards):  Participant monitoring, aseptic 4 
technique, including sterile disposable blood collection apparatus and adherence to standard medical 5 
precautions reduce risk.  Trained technicians will perform all venipuncture.  6 
 7 
Research Procedure  Name:   Lidocaine Injection  8 
Research Procedure Description:   Roughly 8 -10 mL of Lidocaine will be injected using a 25 g needle at 9 
the site of the incision, superficially (i.e., skin) and within the vastus lateralis.  10 
Research -related Risks:   Slight pain at the site of injection might occur. Although rare, anaphylactic 11 
reactions may also occur following administration of lidocaine.  Unlikely, but possible side effects could 12 
include: dizziness, confusion, shakiness, visual changes, nausea, and u nusually slow heartbeat.   13 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm : (Precautions, safeguards) :  Volunteers will be instructed to Notify 14 
study coordinator or PI immediately if an allergic (i.e., swelling, itching, rash, hives, difficulty swallowing, or 15 
difficult y breathing) reaction occurs. In the case of severe reaction, lidocaine use will be discontinued.                 16 
 17 
        Research Procedure Name:  Muscle Biopsy  18 
Research Procedure Description: A small incision will be made in the skin and fascia of the vastus 19 
lateralis.  A 5-mm Bergstrom biopsy needle will pass through these incisions with manual suction while the 20 
participant is under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) to collect muscle samples.  21 
Research -related Risks:  Percutaneous needle muscle biopsies h ave been established as a non -routine, 22 
but safe research procedure. Similar to blood draws, there is a risk that volunteers will feel faint or may 23 
faint, and in very rare instances experience a seizure during or right after a muscle biopsy.  If the 24 
partici pant has had problems with fainting during blood draws or muscle biopsies in the past, they may be 25 
more prone to them during future procedures.  There is some risk of post -biopsy infection, which can be 26 
minimized by employing correct sterile procedures and  carefully instructing volunteers on care of the 27 
wound.  Nerve damage is possible.  Moderate stiffness, hematoma and swelling around the biopsy site 28 
may occur following the procedure, but this usually resolves itself within several days.  Some minimal 29 
scarring will accompany healing of the incision and formation of a hypertrophic scar or keloid is possible.  30 
Although this is a rare event in fair -skinned persons, the incidence of hypertrophic scarring or keloid 31 
formation associated with healing of a primaril y closed skin biopsy site (i.e., one which was closed with 32 
sutures immediately afterward) is 5 -10% in dark -skinned persons.  Complications of bleeding can be 33 
reduced by applying direct pressure to the wound following the biopsy.  If symptoms should occur, they 34 
usually do not interfere with normal walking or heavier exercise.  Volunteers with evidence of bleeding 35 
diatheses or with local skin infection or irritation, or recent anticoagulant medication (including aspirin), will 36 
not be used.     37 
Measures to Min imize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  Volunteers will be instructed about 38 
precautions against hematoma and infection.  They will be given a handout outlining instructions for 39 
proper care of the incision site ( Appendix I).  Dr. Margolis will perf orm the procedure with sterile 40 
technique according the USARIEM Muscle Biopsy SOP  and record notes for each biopsy ( Appendix J ).  41 
The medical staff at USARIEM will follow -up with participants within 3 days post -biopsy to monitor for any 42 
sign of infection, b leeding, or hematoma.  To minimize the likelihood of hypertrophic scarring or keloid 43 
formation, biopsy wounds will be closed as promptly as feasible.  44 
 45 
Research Procedure Name:  Exercise  46 
Research Procedure Description:  All exercise testing in this investigation will occur on a cycle ergometer, 47 
cycling at various levels of intensity based on exercise protocol.  48 
Research -related Risks:  Exercise is generally considered safe and beneficial for individuals without 49 
cardiovascular disease. The U.S. prevale nce of fatal events is approximately 1:100,000 to 1:300,000 in 50 
competitive high school athletes and increases to 1:15,000 to 1:50,000 in athletes over the age of 35.  51

 Current civilian and military guidelines state that individuals less than 40 years of age  who have no 1 
symptoms of or known presence of heart disease or major coronary risk factors have a low risk for cardiac 2 
complications during vigorous exercise.  All volunteers in this study fall into this low risk category.  Local 3 
muscle discomfort and fati gue may occur in active muscles during and shortly after exercise.  Muscle 4 
soreness, ranging in intensity from mild to severe, may persist for 1 to 7 days.  5 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  Studies have confirmed the safety o f 6 
maximal exercise testing, particularly among apparently healthy persons without significant cardiovascular 7 
risk factors.  As a precaution, there will be at least one spotter during all cycle exercise sessions, and 8 
heart rate will be monitored in real tim e during testing.  In addition, exercise monitors and test 9 
administrators will be CPR -certified.   10 
       11 
C6.2  Incidental or Unexpected Findings    12 
 13 
Health problems identified during the screening process will be documented and a copy provided to the 14 
volunteer. The volunteer will be encouraged to make an appointment with their primary care provider for a 15 
full evaluation of the problem. Volunteers with evidence of any physical, mental, and/or medical conditions 16 
that would make the proposed studies relat ively more hazardous will be excluded.  17

 24 
       C7.1 Monitoring  25 
 26 
The PI will, with the assistance of Associate Investigators, continuously evaluate recruitment, the informed 27 
consent process, adverse events, and protocol adherence and deviations in order to identify unanticipated 28 
problems or risks to the volunteers associated with the research. The PI will  ensure that the number of 29 
volunteers recruited for this study complies with the protocol.  The PI or AI will submit a monthly summary 30 
of all adverse events to the Research Monitor to determine whether the number of adverse events is 31 
excessive for the risk s outlined in the research protocol.  The PI (or acting PI) and onsite physician or PA 32 
will discuss “discontinuation criteria” for individual volunteers as the study progresses, based on their 33 
observations of the volunteer during testing or non -testing per iods. Every morning, volunteers will be asked 34 
the following questions to evaluate their readiness to test.  35 
 36 
• How have you been feeling well since the last test in our laboratory (below average, average, above 37 
average)?  38 
• Do you have any pain or symptoms to report that may affect our testing today (e.g., sinus congestion, 39 
fatigue, muscle soreness, fever, tooth pain)?  40 
• Have you reported all food and beverages consumed in the last 24 h that were not provided to you by 41 
study staff?  42 
• What time did you fall a sleep last night and awake this morning?  43 
• Did you perform any exercise or physical activities outside of study activities in the last 24 h?  44 
 45 
       C7.2 Research Monitor  (as applicable)    46 
The research monitor for this study is CPT Steven Yoo.  This individual is an appropriate subject matter 47 
expert not associated with the protocol. The research monitor shall, at a minimum, review all unanticipated 48 
problems involving risk to subjects or othe rs, serious adverse events and all subject deaths associated with 49 
the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event.  Other responsibilities may be assigned by 50 
the MRMC  IRB as needed.  51

Clinical Trial Phase Phase Ib    
 
Background / Rationale Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represent approximately 
40% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Median age at 
diagnosis is 64 years and the majority of patients present with 
advanced disease. DLBCL is increasingly recognized as a 
heterogeneous disorder and the existence of biolo gically defined 
subgroups with different cell of origin (COO) can be shown  
(Flowers, 2010; Lenz, 2008; Vaidya, 2014).  
The immune-chemotherapy regimen consisting of the anti- CD20 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab plus the standard CHOP 
chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone) (R- CHOP) is the current standard of care (SoC) for 
the treatment of newly diagnosed DLBCL. Rituximab improved 
the outcome compared with CHOP alone in untreated patients with 
DLBCL, but still 30–40% of patients relapse (Habermann, 2006; 
Coiffier, 2010). Thus, the development of a more effective initial 
therapy is essential to improve long-term outcomes.  
Literature data suggests that at least a part of the untreated DLBCL 
patients exhibits low CD20 expression (16-42%; Johnson, 2009; 
Tokunaga, 2014; Choi, 2016; Boltezar, 2018). Low CD20 
expression was reported to be associated with inferior survival (5-
year event-free survival [EFS] 39.4% in CD20- low compared to 
66.5% in CD20-high group) (Choi, 2016) . Particularly for those

  Page 12 of 117 patients targeting of an additional, independent antigen might be 
of value. 
The B- lymphocyte lineage specific surface antigen CD19 is the 
earliest and most broadly expressed of the selective B- cell markers 
and is highly expressed on tumor cells of most patients with B-  
NHL. Due to its lineage- specific expression pattern, targeting 
CD19 has clinical utility as a therapeutic approach to NHL 
treatment (Hammer, 2012).  
Tafasitamab is an Fc- enhanced, humanised, mAb with 
significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cell- mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell- mediated 
phagocytosis (ADCP) and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis). The 
Fc-enhancement led to increased binding affinity for Fc receptors 
on effector cells, particularly on NK cells, thereby increasing NK-
cell mediated effector functions (ADCC) on tumor cell lines in 
vitro . In preclinical studies, anti-tumor activity was increased 
versus respective monotherapy treatments when tafasitamab was 
combined with Rituximab, different chemotherapeutic and non-
chemotherapeutic drugs including lenalidomide. These data 
suggest a rationale and a potential benefit of the tafasitamab add-
on strategy to R-CHOP independent of CD20 expression status. 
Monotherapy with tafasitamab has shown preliminary signs of 
clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity in a phase I study in R/R 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(CLL/SLL) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and a phase IIa study in R/R NHL 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In patients with relapsed- refractory (R/R) 
DLBCL, treatment with tafasitamab until progression showed 
single agent activity with 26% ORR, with some responses ongoing 
for several years (Jurczak, 2018). 
Lenalidomide belongs to a class of immunomodulating agents 
(immunomodulatory drugs [IMiDs]), which hav e demonstrated 
direct tumoricidal and immunomodulatory actions. Lenalidomide 
has both anti- proliferative and antiangiogenic activities, 
modulating the tumor cell microenvironment and stimulating the 
activity of effector cells such as cytotoxic T- cells and natural killer 
(NK) cells. Lenalidomide demonstrated manageable toxicity when 
administered as monotherapy and in combination, as well as a 
synergistic effect with rituximab, administered alone or as a part 
of an immune-chemotherapeutic regimen (see below).  
Preclinical data suggest that the combination of tafasitamab with 
lenalidomide may act synergistically by increasing NK cell-
mediated ADCC, making this a combination of interest for further 
study in patients with B-cell lymphoma. In the phase II L- MIND

  Page 13 of 117 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in patients with R/R DLBCL, the 
combination of tafasitamab with lenalidomide achieved a high 
ORR of 58%, a CR rate of 33% and a median PFS of 16 months 
(Salles, 2018) and this combination has rec ently received 
breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA. 
Tafasitamab as single agent is well tolerated and its primary side 
effects consist of those induced by B-cell depletion (Jurczak,  
2018).  
In combination with lenalidomide, tafasitamab had little additive 
toxicity to lenalidomide. The most common treatment- emergent 
adverse events grade ≥3 (percentage of patients with AE ) were 
neutropenia (36%), thrombocytopenia (12%), febrile neutropenia 
(7%), anemia (6%), pneumonia and lung infection ( 7%) and rashes 
(7%) (Salles, 2018).   
The safety and tolerability of tafasitamab or tafasitamab plus 
lenalidomide in addition to R- CHOP has not yet been tested in 
humans.  
This open label, prospective phase Ib study is designed to confirm 
the safety and preliminary efficacy of tafasitamab or tafasitamab  
plus lenalidomide in addition to R- CHOP in patients with newly 
diagnosed DLBCL.

Design, Sample Size and 
Methodology This is a Phase Ib, open-label, randomized study of tafasitamab  
given in addition to R-CHOP or tafasitamab plus lenalidomide 
given in addition to R-CHOP in patients with newly diagnosed 
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. Each of the two arms will enroll 
approximately 30 patients (for a total of approximately 60  
patients). If a patient discontinues the trial for an y reason other 
than treatment related toxicity or progression/relapse of disease or 
death, this patient may be replaced. 
Safety monitoring will be performed continuously throughout the 
study. For further detail see section 6.1  and 6.3.  
Safety Committee meetings will be held to evaluate safety data and 
to monitor if stopping rules have been met. In case stopping rules 
were met, enrolment in the concerned arm will pause until the 
Safety Committee will meet. The committee will advice the

  Page 16 of 117 Sponsor on whether treatment with study drugs of ongoing patients 
and enrolment in the concerned arm should be stopped.  
In addition, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(iDSMB) will review safety data at defined timepoints and give 
advice to the sponsor in regards to the safety of the study treatment. 
The Study consists of two phases: 
1. Safety Run-in Phase: 
Initially, 12 patients will be enrolled in each arm. In order to 
evaluate the safety in accordance with the stopping rules ( section 
6.3), enrolment may be paused when 12 patients in each arm have 
been recruited and have been followed for 21 days after C1D1.  
2. Main Phase:  
If no unexpected safety signals (except for those being causally 
related to R-CHOP) are observed in either arm, enrolment will 
continue as planned to enrol additional approximately 18 patients 
in each arm in the main phase. 
Stopping rules for the Safety Run-in Phase and the Main P hase of 
the study are described in the section 6.3.  
As this is a Phase Ib study to primarily explore safety objectives , 
no formal statistical hypothesis will be considered for the sample 
size calculation of this study.

Co-Medication 6 cycles of R-CHOP: Patients will be treated with R- CHOP  
according to the institutional guidelines. R- CHOP serves as a 
backbone treatment. 
Steroid pre-phase: In patients with urgent need for a steroid pre-phase before initiation of therapy, the use of oral prednisone 25-
100 mg/d or equivalent over 7 days is allowed after tumor 
investigations (imaging, blood samples) for screening have been 
performed.  
Under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the 
investigator, the steroid pre- phase can be started prior to 
acquisition of PET. Any pre- phase steroid use must be adequately 
documented and justified in the patient’s source data. 
IRR prophylaxis for tafasitamab infusions should be administered 
in accordance with the protocol and consist of oral acetaminophen 
(e.g., 650−1000 mg), an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride (50−100 mg) and glucocorticosteroids (e.g. 100 mg 
IV prednisone or prednisolone or equivalent) 30 −60 minutes prior 
to the start of the infusion (unless contraindicated). Note: t he Day 
1 steroid dose being part of CHOP ( 100 mg prednisone or 
prednisolone or equivalent, IV or PO) can be used as further 
component of premedication prior to Tafasitamab infusion.

  Page 24 of 117 Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for patients 
receiving lenalidomide: Patients in the tafasitamab plus 
lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP arm must receive e.g. aspiri n 
70-325mg daily or low molecular weight heparin. This is due to 
increased risk of thrombosis in patients treated with lenalidomide 
without prophylaxis.  
CNS prophylaxis: Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with 
intrathecal chemotherapy may be given a ccording to institutional 
practice. CNS prophylaxis with intravenous methotrexate is 
allowed only if it was pre- planned and it may be administered only 
after the last treatment cycle and after the End of Treatment tumor 
assessment by PET/CT or PET/MRI. 
Pre-planned radiotherapy: Pre- planned local radiotherapy may be 
administered to initial sites of bulky or extranodal disease 
according to institutional guidelines. Pre- planned radiotherapy 
may be administered only after the last treatment cycle and after 
the End of Treatment tumor assessment by PET/CT or PET/MRI.  
Use of growth factors: The use of granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) or pegylated G-CSF is mandatory for the 
prophylaxis of neutropenia and should be administered as per 
institutional guidelines.  
Prophylaxis of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS):  In patients with high 
risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. patients with large tumor 
burden, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) , or high 
proliferation rate of tumor cells), TLS p rophylaxis should be 
considered. All approaches to mitigate the risk of developing TLS, 
such as adequate hydration or hypouric emic agents (e.g. 
allopurinol or rasburicase), may be used in high risk patients as per 
institutional guidelines. 
Supply and Preparation  Tafasitamab DP is a lyophilisate supplied in single- use 20 ml 
glass vials. Each vial contains 200 mg of tafasitamab for 
reconstitution with 5 ml of water for injection (WFI ). 
Reconstitution yields 40 mg/ml tafasitamab in 25 mm sodium 
citrate, 2 00 mm trehalose and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at ph 
6.0. Each product vial is intended to deliver 200 mg of tafasitamab  
in 5 ml of reconstituted solution. Tafasitamab will be diluted into 
a 250 ml infusion bag containing 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for 
injection.  
Lenalidomide will be provided by the sponsor.  
R-CHOP is not an IMP. It will be not provided by the sponsor.

Visit Schedule and 
Assessments Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments (SoA)    
Efficacy Assessments Disease response assessments will be made according to the 
revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma based on the 
guidelines of the Lugano Classification (as reported by Cheson,  
2014) and will be based on investigator assessment. Efficacy will 
be evaluated in terms of ORR, DoR, PFS, EFS, OS, TTP and 
TTNT.  
Safety Assessments The safety and tolerability of study treatment ( tafasitamab in 
addition to R-CHOP or tafasitamab and lenalidomide in addition 
to R-CHOP) will be evaluated by means of AE reports (nature, 
severity, frequency, causality), performance status, physical 
examinations, ECG and laboratory safety evaluations.  
Laboratory and AE reports will be graded according to N ational 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology C riteria for adverse 
events (CTCAE), version 5.0.  
Pharmacokinetics of 
Tafasitamab The pharmacokinetic profile of tafasitamab will be investigated 
during the course of the study. Tafasitamab PK samples will be 
collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments.  
Immunogenicity 
Assessments (anti-
tafasitamab antibodies) The potential immunogenicity of tafasitamab will be investigated 
during the course of the study. Anti-tafasitamab antibody samples 
will be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments. 
Other Assessments Blood and tumor specimens for the analysis of exploratory 
biomarkers will be collected throughout the study.   
 Tumor biopsies at screening and if available at 
progression/relapse 
 Peripheral blood samples will be collected as outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments.   
Biomarker 
Assessment(s) Blood and tumor specimens for the analysis of exploratory 
biomarkers will be collected throughout the study. A range of 
exploratory biomarkers are planned to be investigated during the 
course of the study including tumor CD19 and CD20 expression, 
B-, T- and NK and other cell counts in peripheral blood or tumor 
tissue . To facilitate the investigational research blood samples will 
be stored for the analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
populations (e.g. monocytes or CD4+ T-cells).

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 26 of 117 To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of tafasitamab , circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be quantified serially in the peripheral 
blood as an early indicator of treatment response and to detect 
minimal residual disease (MRD). 
Gene expression profiling of diagnostic tumor biopsies will be 
used to determine the cell of origin (COO) subtype and to assess 
tumor infiltrating immune cells via their gene expression 
signature. Together, with the quantification of tumor- associated 
macrophages and tumor infiltrating NK cells by 
immunohistochemistry this will provide a deeper understanding of 
the mode of action of tafasitamab.     
Statistical Methods and 
Data Analysis  As this is a Phase 1b study, Primary, Secondary and Exploratory 
endpoints will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. No formal 
statistical tests will be performed.  
Primary completion analyses are planned to be performed after all 
randomized patients c ompleted their treatment phase or 
discontinued earlier. Final Analyses will be performed at the end 
of Follow-up period. Details will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Stopping Rules If any of the situations listed below occur, the Sponsor will pause 
enrolment in the relevant study arm. The Safety Committee and 
the iDSMB will convene ad- hoc meetings and make 
recommendations on e.g. whether to stop further enrolment and 
stop treatment of ongoing patients. The Sponsor will make the 
final decisions, taking account of these recommendations. 
1) The situations are as follows. During Safety Run- in Phase: 
if any of the events listed below ( A-C)* occur in ≥4 of the 
first 12 patients in either of the two arms who have received 
at least one dose of study drug.  
2) During Main Phase: if any of the events listed below ( A-
C)* occur in more than 33% of the currently randomized 
patients in either of the two arms who received at least one 
dose of study drug.  
A) a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event ( in 
either of the two arms) 
B) a grade 3 or higher thrombosis/embolism suspected to 
be related to treatment with lenalidomide (only for the 
tafasitamab-lenalidomide-R-CHOP arm)

  Page 37 of 117 4 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
4.1 Overview of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematologic malignancy in adults. The 
majority of NHLs are of B-cell origin, with multiple different histologic subtypes (according to 
the WHO 2016 classification) that confer different clinical outcomes. Generally, NHL can be 
divided into aggressive and indolent lymphomas.  
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common NHL, representing approximately 
40% of all NHLs, and its rate of incidence continues to increase with median age at diagnosis of 
64 years. DLBCL is an aggressive B-NHL and the majority of patients present with advanced 
disease. DLBCL is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disorder with distinct cell of 
origin subtypes, each arising from different stage of normal B-cell development. Several studies 
have shown that the distinct COO subtypes, Germinal Centre B-cell type (GCB) and activated 
B-cell type (ABC) have unique mutational profile and also different prognostic outcomes (Lenz, 
2008; Flowers, 2010; Vaidya, 2014; Schmitz, 2018).  
4.2 Current Treatment of DLBCL and Unmet Medical Need 
The immune-chemotherapy regimen consisting of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
rituximab (R) plus the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) 
chemotherapy (R-CHOP) is the current standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of newly 
diagnosed DLBCL patients. Based on recent data published at ASH2018, there is no added 
benefit of 8 vs. 6 cycles of R-CHOP in previously untreated DLBCL. Thus, rituximab with 6 
cycles of CHOP-21 should be considered SoC (Sehn, 2018).  Although the addition of rituximab 
to CHOP dramatically improved outcomes compared with CHOP alone, still 30–40% DLBCL 
patients are primary refractory or relapse (Habermann, 2006; Coiffier, 2010). Although some 
patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL can be salvaged with second line chemotherapy 
followed by consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT), the majority will succumb to the disease. Thus, the development of a more effective 
initial therapy is essential to improve long-term outcomes.  
Various alternative regimens have been explored in an attempt to improve the efficacy of R-
CHOP e.g. by increasing the intensity of the chemotherapy, increasing the dose of rituximab, 
adding maintenance therapy, adding targeted agents to R-CHOP or by using consolidation with 
high dose therapy and ASCT in the initial management of DLBCL. However, these approaches 
have largely been unsuccessful, including attempt at maximising dose density with R-CHOP 14 
(Pfreundschuh, 2008; Cunningham, 2013; Delarue, 2013). Recent large, randomized, phase III 
DLBCL trials including BO21005/GOYA, comparing the efficacy and safety of Obinutuzumab 
plus CHOP (G-CHOP) with R-CHOP (Vitolo, 2017), DA-EPOCH-R (Wilson, 2016), and 
REMARC, comparing lenalidomide maintenance with placebo (Thieblemont, 2016) did not 
demonstrate clinically meaningful benefit for the experimental therapies being tested, reflecting 
a continued need to improve upon SoC therapies.

  Page 38 of 117 4.3 Lenalidomide in Hematological Malignancies 
Lenalidomide belongs to a class of immunomodulating agents (immunomodulatory drugs 
[IMiDs]), which have demonstrated direct tumoricidal and immunomodulatory actions. 
Lenalidomide has both anti-proliferative and antiangiogenic activities, modulating the tumor cell 
microenvironment and stimulating the activity of effector cells such as cytotoxic T-cells and 
natural killer (NK) cells. Lenalidomide is FDA- and EMA-approved in multiple myeloma, 
mantle-cell lymphoma and in 5q- myelodysplastic syndromes.  
Lenalidomide monotherapy was investigated in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL 
patients and shown to result in poor outcomes (Witzig, 2011; Czuczman, 2017).  Lenalidomide 
demonstrated manageable toxicity as single agent or in combination with rituximab in R/R 
DLBCL or in combination with R-CHOP in the so called R2-CHOP regimen in untreated 
DLBCL (see below). It is currently unknown whether the cell of origin (COO) has an impact on 
lenalidomide efficacy in frontline DLBCL therapy. 
A dose finding phase Ib trial of lenalidomide (dose levels 15, 20 and 25mg given days 1-10) in 
combination with R-CHOP given every 21 days was conducted in newly diagnosed DLBCL 
patients and showed that lenalidomide did not affect dose intensity and schedule of R-CHOP, 
was safe and associated with high (100% ORR, 77% CR) response rates (Nowakowski, 2011). 
Based on this study and another single arm phase II study with a different lenalidomide dosing 
regimen (15 mg, days 1-14 q21 days) (Vitolo, 2014), it was concluded that lenalidomide can be 
safely combined with R-CHOP in the initial treatment of patients with DLBCL. The phase III 
ROBUST trial of oral lenalidomide (15 mg, days 1-14) plus R-CHOP versus placebo plus R-
CHOP in patients with previously untreated ABC-type DLBCL did not meet its primary endpoint 
for PFS, although a positive trend favoring lenalidomide plus R-CHOP has been observed in 
advanced-stage and higher-risk patients  (NCT 02285062). The most common grade 3/4 adverse 
events reported were neutropenia (60% in the lenalidomide/R-CHOP arm vs 48% in the 
placebo/R-CHOP arm), anemia (22% vs 14%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 11%), leukopenia 
(14% vs 15%), febrile neutropenia (14% vs 9%), and lymphopenia (11% vs 8%). The safety 
profile of lenalidomide plus R-CHOP was consistent with those of the individual medicines, and 
no new safety signals were identified with the combination (Vitolo, 2019).   
In contrast, the results of the recent ECOG-ACRIN1412 trial, a randomized phase II trial of R-
CHOP in combination with Lenalidomide (25 mg/day on day 1-10 of each 21-day cycle) have 
shown promising efficacy in newly diagnosed DLBCL with 34% reduction in risk of progression 
or death in R2-CHOP arm compared to R-CHOP arm. Lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP was 
well tolerated despite a higher frequency of haematological toxicity and febrile neutropenia 
compared to R-CHOP. Importantly, there was no increase in treatment-related mortality in the 
R2-CHOP arm (1%) compared to R-CHOP arm (4%) (Nowakowski, 2019).  
4.4 Overview of Tafasitamab 
Tafasitamab (synonyms: MOR00208; XmAb®5574) is an Fc-engineered mAb that binds to the 
human B-cell surface antigen CD19. Tafasitamab possesses significantly increased tumor 
cytotoxicity when compared to the tafasitamab version with a non-engineered Fc region. The 
increased binding of tafasitamab to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), due to the engineered mutations, 
significantly enhances in vitro  ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), 
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 39 of 117 and its direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on the tumor cells compared with the non-engineered 
parental murine antibody. Tafasitamab has not been shown to mediate complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC). 
More specifically, in preclinical studies, tafasitamab has been shown to significantly enhance in 
vitro  ADCC, ADCP, and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on CD19+ tumor cell lines spanning 
a broad range of human lymphomas and leukemias (Burkitt lymphoma, CLL, hairy cell leukemia 
[HCL], CD19+ chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], DLBCL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
[ALL]), expressing levels of CD19 antigen ranging from 15,000 to 105,000 molecules/cell. 
Similar effects were also noted in relation to freshly isolated patient CLL or ALL cells and are 
also expected to translate to primary NHL cells since the expression range reported for ALL and 
CLL B-cells covers the range observed for NHL B-cells (Ginaldi, 1998; Olejniczak, 2006). 
Tafasitamab has also shown superior efficacy to its non-engineered version in relation to its 
ability to induce a marked reduction in tumor growth, inhibit tumor growth rate and increase 
survival in vivo  in xenograft models of human lymphoma in severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID) mice (Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). 
The pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions of tafasitamab in combination with two standard-of-
care drugs fludarabine and bendamustine (BEN), and one investigational drug, lenalidomide 
used in the treatment of patients with CLL and NHL, were investigated in a human intravenous 
(IV) lymphoma model in SCID mice (see IB). In this orthotopic model for disseminated B-cell 
malignancies, the median survival was superior for all of the groups receiving tafasitamab 
combination therapy (with fludarabine, BEN or lenalidomide) when compared with the groups 
receiving tafasitamab monotherapy. The lenalidomide xenograft study showed a clear 
potentiation of the efficacy benefit of tafasitamab (3 mg/kg) and lenalidomide (100/200 mg/kg) 
combination therapy compared with the respective monotherapies (1.5x increase in median 
lifespan). 
Tissue cross-reactivity studies have shown that the pattern and distribution of tafasitamab 
binding to cynomolgus monkey tissues closely parallels those of human tissues. Flow cytometry 
experiments show tafasitamab binding to human and cynomolgus monkey B-cells, but not to the 
B-cells of other common laboratory species (such as rat, mouse, rabbit and dog). Therefore, 
pharmacology studies were restricted to human and cynomolgus monkey cell-based in vitro  
systems, CD19+ human B-cell tumor xenograft models in SCID mice, and cynomolgus monkeys 
in vivo . In in vivo  studies in cynomolgus monkeys, tafasitamab was shown to induce B-
lymphocyte depletion in peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. 
Cynomolgus monkeys were also judged to be the only relevant common laboratory species for 
toxicity studies. 
The results of studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics (PK), PD and toxicity of tafasitamab in 
cynomolgus monkeys, are provided in the IB. The findings in four preclinical studies were 
limited to the expected pharmacological effects of tafasitamab, with no reports of unanticipated 
toxicity. 
The four studies, all conducted in cynomolgus monkeys included: a 26-week single 10.0 mg/kg 
dose, PK, PD and toxicity study; a 28-day single IV dose, dose-ranging (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) 
PK/PD study; a 29-day, single-dose (3.0 mg/kg) study comparing tafasitamab with two other 
CD19 antibodies with different Fc regions; and an 8-week toxicity study in which tafasitamab

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 40 of 117 was administered IV every 2 weeks at a dose of 2.0, 10.0 or 50.0 mg/kg for 8 consecutive weeks 
with a 90-day recovery period. The aim of the latter Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant, 
multiple-dose toxicology study was to support the use of tafasitamab in human clinical studies. 
Other than the expected dose-related decreases in B-lymphocyte levels and cellularity in spleen 
tissues, there were no tafasitamab-related changes identified in ‘clinical observations’, food 
consumption, body weight, electrocardiography, ophthalmology, urinalysis, coagulation, serum 
chemistry, and gross anatomic pathology at doses up to 50.0 mg/kg. In addition, GLP-compliant 
tissue cross-reactivity studies were performed on normal tissue panels from human and 
cynomolgus monkey donors. No specific staining of structures other than the expected 
mononuclear leucocytes, lymphocytes and hematopoietic precursor cells was observed. 
4.4.1 Clinical Experience with Tafasitamab 
The clinical development program of tafasitamab comprises five MorphoSys AG-sponsored 
clinical trials so far. Monotherapy with tafasitamab has shown preliminary signs of clinical 
efficacy and acceptable toxicity in a phase I study in R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (XmAb®5574-01) and a phase IIa study 
in R/R NHL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (MOR208C201). In this study, patients with R/R DLBCL (n=35), 
treatment with tafasitamab until progression showed single agent activity with 26% ORR, with 
some responses ongoing for longer than 12 months in 5 out of 9 responding patients (Jurczak, 
2018). Additional tafasitamab studies which are currently ongoing evaluate tafasitamab in 
different combination therapies in patients with R/R DLBCL and R/R CLL.  
Preclinical data suggest that the combination of tafasitamab with lenalidomide may act 
synergistically by increasing NK cell-mediated ADCC, making this a combination of interest for 
further study in patients with B-cell lymphoma.  
In the phase II MOR208C203 L-MIND study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in patients with R/R DLBCL, the 
combination of tafasitamab with lenalidomide achieved a high ORR of 58%, a CR rate of 33% 
and a median PFS of 16 months (Salles, 2018). This combination has recently received 
breakthrough designation by the FDA. Enrolment is complete with 81 patients and updated 
results from the ongoing L-MIND study indicate a significant improvement in outcome for these 
patients who have very limited treatment options (Salles, 2018). 
The ongoing Phase II/III study MOR208C204 (B-MIND) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a randomized 
study of tafasitamab combined with bendamustine versus rituximab plus bendamustine in 
patients with R/R DLBCL who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT.  
The ongoing study MOR208C205 (COSMOS) is a Phase II study of tafasitamab in combination 
with either idelalisib or venetoclax in R/R CLL/SLL patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
4.4.2 Safety of Tafasitamab 
To date, a total of 351 patients have been dosed with tafasitamab up to the data lock point of the 
most recent DSUR report (Version 6, Dec 6th 2018).  Tafasitamab was generally well tolerated 
in clinical studies with no new safety signals being observed compared to other B-cell depleting 
antibodies. 
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 41 of 117 Tafasitamab has a novel mechanism of action that may have the potential to add to the care of 
patients with NHL. Based on the available data from the completed clinical study of tafasitamab 
(Protocol XmAb®5574-01), the data from the ongoing MOR208C201 clinical study, nonclinical 
studies and experiments, and literature data on CD19, the sponsor believes that the potential 
benefit of tafasitamab outweighs the potential risks. It is expected that the potential risks will be 
adequately controlled by the design of this study (e.g., by the inclusion and exclusion criteria) 
and by frequent monitoring of adverse drug reactions throughout the entire study. As the clinical 
trials with tafasitamab in combination therapy (MOR208C203, MOR208C204 and 
MOR208C205) are ongoing, no complete analysis of safety data is available, yet.  
Based on the results of the phase I clinical study (XmAb®5574-01) of tafasitamab in patients 
with CLL/SLL (Woyach, 2014), and the results of the MOR208C201 (Jurczak, 2018) and 
MOR208C202 (Klisovic, 2017) studies, the anticipated possible risks associated with 
administration of tafasitamab to patients include the following AEs (incidence > 3%) assessed as expected for tafasitamab treatment: 
 Infusion related reactions (IRRs) 
 Febrile neutropenia 
 Neutropenia 
 Thrombocytopenia 
 Tumor lysis syndrome 
 Upper respiratory tract infections 
 Fatigue 
 Chills 
 Pyrexia 
 Nausea 
 Diarrhoea 
 Headache 
 Rash 
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) increases . 
In clinical trials IRRs were the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and were all judged as related to tafasitamab. Other frequent adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) were hematologic events with neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Fatigue, chills, pyrexia, nausea, diarrhoea, headache, elevation of liver enzymes, upper 
respiratory tract infection, rash and tumor lysis syndrome were the most frequent non-
hematologic ADRs.

grade/grade ≥3) were neutropenia in 39/35 (48%/43%) patients, thrombocytopenia in 26/14 
(32%/17%), anemia in 25/7 (31%/9%), diarrhea in 24/1 (30%/1%), pyrexia in 18/1 (22%/1%) 
and asthenia in 16/2 (20%/2%) patients. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 16 
(19.8%) patients; the majority of the events were infections or neutropenic fever. No infusion 
related reactions were reported with tafasitamab. 41 (51%) patients required dose reduction with 
lenalidomide, 58 (72%) patients were able to stay on a daily lenalidomide dose of 20 mg or 
higher. In 9 (11%) patients lenalidomide was permanently discontinued due to an adverse event.  
A detailed tafasitamab exposure-response analysis for safety with results from clinical studies 
MOR208C201 (tafasitamab monotherapy in R/R NHL (including DLBCL), n=92) and 
MOR208C203/L-MIND (tafasitamab plus lenalidomide) in R/R DLBCL, n=81) was performed. 
In both studies, all subjects were treated at the dose level of 12 mg/kg tafasitamab. The 
tafasitamab exposure metrics AUC28 (ie, area under the time-concentration curve from 0-28 
days) and Cmax (overall maximum tafasitamab concentration) were derived by simulation for 
each subject from a population PK model. The individual exposure metrics were separated into 
exposure quartiles and analyzed against TEAEs and AESIs. As a conclusion from this analysis, 
there were no obvious trends for increasing TEAEs or AESIs with increasing exposure. The 
numbers and percentages of subjects experiencing a TEAE/AESI were equally or randomly 
distributed across the 4 exposure quartiles (e.g. results for “Any TEAE of Special Interest” in 
study L-MIND: AUC28 quartile 1: 20 subjects (24.7%); quartile 2: 20 subjects (24.7%), quartile 
3: 19 subjects (23.5%); quartile 4: 19 subjects (23.5%)). 
The possible risks associated with the administration of tafasitamab are described in detail in the 
tafasitamab IB. 
4.5 Study Rationale 
Six cycles of R-CHOP is considered the current SoC therapy in previously untreated DLBCL 
(Sehn, 2018); however, a substantial number of patients relapse after R-CHOP or are primary 
refractory to R-CHOP. After a number of phase III studies were unable to demonstrate 
meaningful benefit of various experimental approaches over R-CHOP, there is a need to evaluate 
novel approaches in order to improve the activity of R-CHOP in patients with previously 
untreated DLBCL.  
Literature data suggests that at least a part of the untreated DLBCL patients exhibits low CD20 
expression (Johnson, 2009; Tokunaga, 2014; Choi, 2016; Boltezar, 2018). Low CD20 expression 
was reported to be associated with inferior survival (5-year event-free survival [EFS] 39.4% in 
CD20-low compared to 66.5% in CD20-high group) (Choi, 2016).  Particularly for those 
patients, therapeutic targeting of an additional, independent B-cell antigen might be of value. 
The B-lymphocyte lineage specific surface antigen CD19 is the earliest and most broadly 
expressed of the selective B-cell markers and is highly expressed on tumor cells of most B- NHL.

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 43 of 117 Due to its lineage-specific expression pattern, targeting CD19 has clinical utility as a therapeutic 
approach to NHL treatment (Hammer, 2012).  
Tafasitamab is an Fc-enhanced, humanised, anti-CD19 mAb with significantly enhanced 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
phagocytosis (ADCP) and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) compared with the parental murine 
antibody. The Fc-enhancement leads to increased binding affinity for Fc receptors on effector 
cells, particularly on NK cells, thereby increasing NK-cell mediated effector functions (ADCC) 
on tumor cell lines in vitro .  
In preclinical studies, anti-tumor activity was increased versus respective monotherapy 
treatments when tafasitamab was combined with rituximab, different chemotherapeutic and non-
chemotherapeutic drugs including lenalidomide. 
A phase I clinical trial investigating tafasitamab in humans has been completed (clinical trial 
XmAb5574-01, “A Phase I Study of XmAb5574 to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and 
Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia”). 
Based on data derived from dose levels between 3 and 12 mg/kg, the estimated beta half-life 
averaged at approximately 13.5 days. The highest tested dose of 12 mg/kg was recommended 
for phase II (Woyach, 2014). 
Lenalidomide belongs to a class of immunomodulating agents (immunomodulatory drugs 
[IMiDs]), which have demonstrated direct tumoricidal and immunomodulatory actions. 
Lenalidomide has both anti-proliferative and antiangiogenic activities, modulating the tumor cell 
microenvironment and stimulating the activity of effector cells such as cytotoxic T-cells and 
natural killer (NK) cells by various mechanisms. Lenalidomide increases NK cell proliferation 
and numbers in vivo, modulates expression of co-stimulatory surface receptors on NK cells and 
stabilizes the immunological synapse between NK cell and target tumor cell. Preclinical data 
suggest that the combination of tafasitamab with lenalidomide act synergistically by increasing 
NK cell-mediated ADCC. In the phase II MOR208C203 L-MIND study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in 
patients with R/R DLBCL, the combination of tafasitamab with lenalidomide achieved a high 
ORR of 58%, a CR rate of 33% and a median PFS of 16 months (Salles, 2018).  
Taken together, these data suggest a potential benefit of the tafasitamab or tafasitamab plus 
Lenalidomide add-on strategy to R-CHOP in newly diagnosed DLBCL and thereby provide the 
rationale for this study.

6.1 Overall Clinical Trial Design and Investigational Plan 
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase Ib trial to assess safety and preliminary 
efficacy of tafasitamab in addition to R-CHOP or tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in addition to 
R-CHOP in adult patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. Approximately 60 patients (30 in each 
arm) will be randomized in this study. If a patient discontinues the trial for any reason other than 
treatment related toxicity, progression/relapse of disease or death, this patient may be replaced. 
6.1.1 Safety monitoring 
Safety monitoring will be performed on a continuous basis as follows:   
A. Sponsor Safety Review Meetings  will be performed  every two weeks during the safety run-
in phase, and every four weeks during the main study phase.  Once all patients are in the follow-
up phase, the frequency of these meetings will be decreased to approximately every eight weeks. 
Overall patient safety data including AEs, laboratory values, ECG outputs as well as physical 
examination including vital signs of every patient will be part of the review. Safety monitoring 
will be conducted by representatives of the sponsor with medical and pharmacovigilance 
expertise and the medical monitors of the CRO. Individual case monitoring by Drug Safety will 
ensure steady oversight whether stopping rules are likely to be met. In case the stopping rules 
have been met, an ad- hoc meeting of the Safety Committee will be required. 
B. Safety Committee . The sponsor established a Safety Committee consisting of sponsor 
representatives with at least two representatives of the participating investigators of this clinical 
trial. This committee will meet regularly until all patients have completed treatment. During 
these meetings, safety data including e.g. AEs, laboratory values, ECG outputs as well as 
physical examination including vital signs of every patient will be reviewed. Details of specific 
responsibilities, composition, meeting formats and frequency of the Safety Committee are 
outlined in the Safety Committee Charter.   
C. In addition, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (iDSMB)  consisting of 
independent haematologists will be established. During its meetings, safety data including e.g. 
AEs, laboratory values, ECG outputs as well as physical examination including vital signs will 
be reviewed. The iDSMB will provide a recommendation at the end of safety run-in phase when 
all patients in both arms have finished their first treatment cycle; during the main phase after 
approximately 40 patients (20 per arm) have finished their first treatment cycle, and at the end of the 
treatment period (last patient reached C6D21 plus approximately 30 days) . Details of specific 
responsibilities, composition, meeting formats and frequency of the iDSMB will be described 
separately in the iDSMB charter and will follow relevant regulatory requirements for such body. 
Furthermore, both committees as described in B. and C. will meet ad-hoc  in case the stopping 
rules are met (see Section 6.3). In such situation, both committees will make their 
recommendation to the Sponsor on whether e.g. treatment with study drugs of ongoing patients 
and further enrolment in the concerned arm should be stopped. 
The trial consists of two phases, see Figure 1.

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 47 of 117 1. Safety Run-in Phase: 
As the addition of tafasitamab to R-CHOP and tafasitamab and lenalidomide plus R-CHOP has 
not previously been evaluated in a clinical study, a safety run-in phase with 12 patients in each 
arm will be performed. In order to evaluate the safety in accordance with the stopping rules 
(Section 6.3), enrolment may be paused when 12 patients in each arm have been recruited and 
have been followed for 21 days after C1D1. 
2. Main Phase:  
If no unexpected safety signals (except for those being causally related to R-CHOP) are observed 
in either arm, enrolment will continue as planned to enrol additional approximately 18 patients 
in each arm in the main phase. Stopping rules are described in Section 6.3.   
As this is a Phase Ib study to primarily explore safety objectives, no formal statistical hypothesis 
will be considered for the sample size calculation of this trial.  
It is expected that approximately 10% of the patients will prematurely withdraw from the trial 
prior to end of treatment. An additional approximately 5% are expected to prematurely withdraw 
between end of treatment and end of 24 months after randomization.

  Page 48 of 117 Figure 1: Trial design  
  
 
 
All patients are expected to receive 6 cycles of study treatment (each cycle consisting of 21 days) 
and to be followed up for 24 months (or 731 days) from the date of randomization. For more 
details see Section 6.4. 
3.  End of Study   
The end of study is defined as the timepoint when data collection will stop and the final analysis 
of the study will occur. The end of study will happen after all patients have completed their End 
of Study/Early Follow-up Termination Visit.  
6.2 Early Study Termination 
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by the sponsor. Should this be necessary, 
the patient will be contacted by the investigator or his/her designee. The patient should be seen 
as soon as possible for an Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit or Early Follow-up 
Termination Visit as applicable, and the assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 10) should be performed. The investigator will be responsible for informing IRBs and/or 
ECs of the early termination of the trial. 
6.3 Stopping Rules 
If any of the situations listed below occur, the Sponsor will pause enrolment in the relevant study 
arm. The Safety Committee and the iDSMB will convene ad-hoc meetings and make 
recommendations on e.g. whether to stop further enrolment and stop treatment of ongoing 
patients. The Sponsor will make the final decisions, taking account of these recommendations. 
The situations are as follows: 
1)  During Safety Run-in Phase: if any of the events listed below ( A-C)* occur in ≥4 of the first 12 patients in either of the two arms who have received at least one dose of study 
drug.  

Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 49 of 117 2) During Main Phase: if any of the events listed below (A-C)* occur in more than 33% of 
the currently randomized patients in either of the two arms who received at least one dose 
of study drug.  
A) a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event  (in either of the two treatment 
arms) 
B) a grade 3 or higher thrombosis/embolism suspected to be related to treatment with 
lenalidomide (only for the tafasitamab-lenalidomide-R-CHOP arm) 
C) a dose reduction or delay of over 7 days of R-CHOP  (for the total across both 
treatment arms) 
Note: Toxicity-related dose modifications of R-CHOP which are not thought to be related to lenalidomide and/or tafasitamab treatment will not be considered. 
* Any combination of events (A-C) occurring in  ≥ 4 patients during the Safety Run-in 
Phase or in more than 33% of the currently randomized patients during the Main Phase 
will lead to a Safety Data Review.   
6.4 Clinical Trial Duration 
From the time of providing informed consent, each patient is expected to be included in the study 
for a duration of approximately 25 months. Three periods are defined for each patient in the 
study. 
6.4.1 Screening period 
The screening period of a maximum of 21 days is the interval between the date of signing of 
informed consent and the date of randomization.  
The ICF must be signed prior to beginning any study related assessments. Standard of care 
assessments done on the day of consent (but prior to signing the ICF) do not need to be repeated 
solely for the purpose of screening and may be used as study data, if they meet the protocol 
requirements. 
During screening, each patient who signs the ICF will be allocated a unique identification 
number. All patients who fulfil all inclusion criteria and who are not barred by any of the 
exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to treatment comprising tafasitamab in addition to 
R-CHOP or tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP in a 1:1 ratio.  
Study treatment should start within 24 hours after randomization. 
6.4.2 Treatment period 
The treatment period starts with the first administration of study drug (C1D1) and consists of 6 
cycles, each 21 days. The End of Treatment Visit or Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit 
will be performed 6±2 weeks after End of Treatment. End of Treatment is defined as day 21 of 
the last treatment cycle the patient started. Patients who discontinue early because of 
progression/relapse of disease may have the Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit earlier 
at the discretion of the investigator. 
All assessments specified in Section 10 should be performed within the acceptable visit windows 
(+/- 2 days) on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each cycle (Note: C1D1 visit window: +1 day).  
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 50 of 117 6.4.3 Follow-up period 
The Follow-up period starts at the End of Treatment or Early Study Treatment Discontinuation 
Visit; the 30-day safety follow-up visit will be included in this visit. Clinical evaluation will be 
performed every 3 months. CT scans will be performed every 6 months until final completion of 
study or until disease progression/relapse. All patients are expected to be followed up for a total 
of 18 months after the End of Treatment Visit or Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit. 
The End of Study Visit or Early Follow-up Termination Visit marks the completion of the study 
for an individual patient. 
The assessments outlined in the Section 10  should be performed within the acceptable visit 
windows during the follow-up period once patient has completed 6 cycles of tafasitamab in 
addition to R-CHOP (Arm A) and tafasitamab and lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP (Arm 
B). A visit window of +/- 2 weeks is allowed throughout the follow-up.  
Figure 2: Clinical trial periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up 
 
6.5 Risks and Benefits to Patients 
All eligible patients will be treated with standard of care for six cycles of R-CHOP as a 
potentially curative treatment approach. In addition, patients will receive either tafasitamab (Arm 
A) or tafasitamab plus lenalidomide (Arm B) as an add-on to R-CHOP to potentially improve 
the CR rate and hence to possibly reduce the treatment failure rate. Based on the safety profile 
of tafasitamab single agent and the well manageable safety profile of the tafasitamab plus 
lenalidomide combination (as demonstrated in the L-MIND study in R/R DLBCL), it is expected 
that the overall risk-benefit is favorable without additional toxicities compared to the treatment 
with R-CHOP only.  
The predictable risks and most common side effects of tafasitamab +/- lenalidomide are infusion-
related reactions, transient neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, pyrexia and 
asthenia. Treatment-related serious AEs consist mainly of infections or neutropenic fever.  
Together, the potential risks identified with tafasitamab +/- lenalidomide alongside with the 
measures in place to minimize risk to patients participating in this trial are justified by the 
anticipated benefits that may be achieved by the add-on treatment in patients with newly 
diagnosed DLBCL, which constitutes a life-threatening condition.

m. Any contraindication concerning any individual component of R-CHOP  
7.3 Restrictions  
Note: Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken 
during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect can be expected. Therefore, lenalidomide is 
contraindicated during pregnancy. In women of child bearing potential lenalidomide is 
contraindicated unless the conditions for pregnancy prevention are complied with. See Appendix 
H to decide whether a female is of childbearing potential.  
Patients should refrain from donating blood during the course of study and for 3 months after the 
last dose of study drug.  
7.3.1 Restrictions applicable in all countries except US  
 All men and all women of childbearing potential should undergo counselling on the need to 
avoid pregnancy. 
 Patients should be capable of complying with the requirements of safe use of lenalidomide. 
 Patients must be provided with appropriate patient educational brochure and patient card. 
The following restrictions apply while the patient is receiving study drugs and for the specified 
times before and after: 
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 55 of 117 1. Women of child-bearing potential should use reliable methods of contraception at least 4 
weeks prior to start of study drugs until 3 months after discontinuing study drugs, or, for R-
CHOP, according to the local guidelines, whichever is longer. Acceptable methods of 
contraception include true abstinence, implant, tubal ligation, levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system, medroxyprogesterone acetate depot, ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only 
pills (i.e. desogestrel) and vasectomised partner (vasectomy must have been confirmed by two 
negative semen analysis). All these methods of contraception should be used in combination 
with the use of a condom by their male sexual partner for intercourse. 
Note: implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased 
risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
True abstinence is part of the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for 
the duration of exposure to the investigational product, and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. If females of child-bearing potential wish to become pregnant they 
should be advised to arrange for freezing oocytes prior to the start of study treatment.  
2. Male patients should avoid unprotected sex with a female of child- bearing potential during 
treatment with the study drugs and for a washout period of 3 months after last dose of study drug, 
or, for R-CHOP, according to the local guidelines, whichever is longer. Patients should refrain 
from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 3 months after discontinuing study drugs or, 
for R-CHOP, according to the local guidelines, whichever is longer. If male patients wish to 
father children they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start 
of study treatment. 
7.3.2 Restrictions applicable in US 
 All men, and all women of childbearing potential should undergo counselling on the need 
to avoid pregnancy, including contraception requirements (females), barrier 
contraception requirements (males), true abstinence and emergency contraception.  
 Patients should be capable of complying with the requirements of safe use of 
lenalidomide. 
 Patients must be provided with an appropriate patient educational brochure and a patient 
card. 
The following restrictions apply while the patient is receiving study drugs, and for the 
specified times before and after: 
1. Females of childbearing potential should use at the same time 2 effective methods of 
contraception (at least one highly effective method and one effective method, see Appendix G ) 
each time when engaging in sexual activity with a male, starting at least 4 weeks before taking 
the study drug, while taking the study drug, during breaks (dose interruptions), and for at least 3 
months after stopping the study drug or, for R-CHOP, according to the US guidelines, whichever 
is longer. True abstinence (see Appendix G ) from heterosexual sexual intercourse is also an 
acceptable method of contraception.  
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 56 of 117 The use of emergency contraception is also permitted. If females of child-bearing potential wish 
to become pregnant they should be advised to arrange for freezing oocytes prior to the start of 
study treatment. 
2. Male patients should use latex or synthetic condom each time they have sex with a female of 
childbearing potential while taking the study drug, during breaks (dose interruptions), and for at 
least three months after stopping the study drug or, for R-CHOP, according to the US guidelines, 
whichever is longer. True abstinence (see Appendix G ) from heterosexual sexual intercourse is 
also an acceptable method of contraception. The use of emergency contraception is permitted.  
7.4 Withdrawal and Termination Criteria 
7.4.1 Patient Withdrawal 
For patients withdrawing for any reason from the clinical trial the Early Study Treatment 
Discontinuation or Early Follow-up Termination Visit, as applicable and as outlined in the 
Section 10 should be performed. 
An explanation should be given of why the patient is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the 
clinical trial. 
The reason for withdrawal must be noted in the Case Report Form (CRF). If the reason for 
withdrawal is a clinical AE, monitoring will continue until the outcome is evident.  The specific 
event or test result(s) must be recorded in the CRF.   
For patients who show clinical signs of progression/relapse of disease, an unscheduled 
radiological confirmation of disease progression/relapse should be performed.  
In case of radiologically confirmed disease progression/relapse, patients should undergo the 
Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit and continue with the follow-up period of the trial 
and may receive other anti-cancer treatments (see Section 8.7.2.1) unless they must be withdrawn 
per patient or investigator decision. 
Patient Decision 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, each patient is free to withdraw from the study 
at any time.   
Investigator Decision 
Investigator(s) also have the right to withdraw patients from the study or from study treatment 
in the event of illness, adverse events (AEs), or other reasons concerning the health or well-being 
of the patient, or in the case of lack of co-operation. 
The investigators are encouraged to keep a patient experiencing clinical benefit in the study 
unless significant toxicity puts the patient at risk or repeated cases of routine noncompliance puts 
the study outcomes at risk.  
At a minimum, all patients who discontinue study treatment, including those who refuse to return 
for a final visit, will be contacted for safety evaluations.  
If such withdrawal occurs, or if the patient fails to return for visits, the investigator must 
determine the primary reason for a patient´s premature withdrawal from the study and record the 
information on the eCRF. If the reason for withdrawal is an AE, monitoring should continue 
until the outcome is evident. The specific event or test result(s) must be recorded in the eCRF.

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 57 of 117 Patients who are withdrawn for any reason shall not re-enter the study at any time. 
Patient Replacement 
Patients dropping out during screening may be replaced. If a patient discontinues the trial for 
any reason other than treatment related toxicity or progression/relapse of disease or death, this 
patient may be replaced.  
7.4.2 Clinical Trial or Clinical Trial Site Termination 
The investigator and the sponsor both reserve the right to terminate the study at any time at a 
given clinical study center. The sponsor also reserves the right to terminate the entire study or 
temporarily interrupt enrolment and/or dosing of already enrolled patients for further evaluation, 
for example, if during the ongoing evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio the sponsor decides that 
the study risks outweigh its benefits. 
Should a termination of a given clinical study center or the whole study become necessary, then 
the procedures will be arranged with all involved parties. In terminating a study center, or the 
entire study, the sponsor and the investigators will ensure that adequate consideration is given to 
the protection of the patients’ interests. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics 
Committees (IECs) and competent authorities will be notified of premature termination in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

8.2 Investigational Medicinal Product(s) 
8.2.1 Tafasitamab 
8.2.1.1 Tafasitamab Supplies 
The sponsor will supply the Investigational Medicinal Product tafasitamab for this study.  
8.2.1.2 Tafasitamab Dosage form, Packaging, Storage and Preparation 
Study sites must store tafasitamab vials under refrigeration at 2° C to 8° C in its original package 
in an appropriate storage facility accessible only to the study site personnel. 
Tafasitamab drug product (DP) is a yellowish lyophilisate supplied in single-use 20 mL glass 
vials. Each vial contains 200 mg of tafasitamab for reconstitution with 5 mL water for injection 
(WFI). Reconstitution yields 40 mg/mL tafasitamab in 25 mM sodium citrate, 200 mM trehalose 
and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0. Each product vial is intended to deliver 200 mg of 
tafasitamab in 5 ml of reconstituted solution. The solution after reconstitution is colorless to 
slightly yellow and essentially free of foreign particles; it may contain a few white to whitish 
product-related particles. 
For administration, tafasitamab will be diluted into a commercially available 250 mL infusion 
container with 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for injection. 
The individual tafasitamab infusion will be prepared under aseptic conditions and administered 
at the study site, according to the directions of the sponsor, which will be provided in a Drug 
Handling Manual. In general, a vial of tafasitamab must be used as soon as possible after 
reconstitution with WFI; any solution remaining in the vial has to be discarded.  After dilution for

  Page 59 of 117 infusion, administration of tafasitamab should take place as soon as possible. Maximum allowed 
storage times and conditions will be detailed in the Drug Handling Manual. 
8.2.1.3 Tafasitamab Administration 
Tafasitamab will be administered IV at a dose of 12mg/kg body weight for 6 cycles. Each 21-
day cycle will consist of tafasitamab infusions on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15, i.e. each patient will 
be treated with a maximum of 18 infusions of tafasitamab over the 6 cycles. 
Please refer to section 8.7  of the protocol for pre-medication for tafasitamab infusions.  
For the first infusion, the IV infusion rate should be 70 mL/h for the first 30 minutes and 
subsequently increased to a rate of 125 mL/h; the total infusion duration will be approximately 
2.5 hours.  
All subsequent tafasitamab infusions will be administered IV at a constant rate of approximately 
125 mL/h over an approximately 2-hour period. Tafasitamab should NOT be administered as an 
IV push or bolus. 
The infusion rate escalation schedules in this protocol and the Drug Handling Manual are 
recommendations. If required, the investigator should use clinical judgement to optimise patient 
safety by administering the infusion more slowly. 
8.2.1.4 Patient Monitoring During Tafasitamab Infusion 
Vital signs should be measured as outlined in Section 9.8 . All supportive measures consistent 
with optimal patient care will be provided throughout the study according to institution 
standards. 
Precautions for anaphylaxis should be observed during tafasitamab administration. Emergency 
resuscitation equipment and medications must be readily available. Additional supportive 
measures should also be available and may include, but are not limited to, epinephrine, 
antihistamines, corticosteroids, IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, 
diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen (paracetamol). 
8.2.2 Lenalidomide 
8.2.2.1 Lenalidomide Supplies 
The Sponsor will supply the Investigational Medicinal Product lenalidomide from a commercial 
source as capsules in various dose strengths for oral administration as outlined in the Drug 
Handling Manual. 
8.2.2.2 Lenalidomide Administration 
Patients will self-administer a starting dose of 25 mg oral lenalidomide daily on Days 1–10 of 
each 21-day cycle . Lenalidomide dose may be reduced according to the guidelines described in 
section 8.5.3 .  
8.3 R-CHOP 
R-CHOP is the standard of care and will be given according to institutional guidelines. R-CHOP 
is not an IMP and will not be supplied by the Sponsor.  
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 60 of 117 8.3.1 R-CHOP administration 
Rituximab is advised to be given approximately 30 minutes after the tafasitamab infusion, 
followed by the CHOP chemotherapy which will be given approximately 30 minutes after the 
end of the rituximab infusion.  
Note: The Day 1 steroid dose being part of CHOP (100 mg prednisone or prednisolone or 
equivalent, IV or PO) can be used as further component of premedication prior to Tafasitamab 
infusion. 
8.4 Treatment Compliance and Product Accountability 
Patients will receive tafasitamab under the direct supervision of study site personnel. Each 
administration volume or dose will be checked and the vial/outer package code and volume or 
dose per administration will be recorded in each patient’s eCRF as well as in the source data. 
 
The dosing of tafasitamab will be considered appropriate if the tafasitamab dose administered is 
≥80% to ≤120% of the assigned dosage per single infusion. Overdose treatment is described in  
Section 8.6. 
Lenalidomide is to be dispensed at the initiation of each new treatment cycle for treatment from 
D1-10. Patients should return all unused or empty lenalidomide blister packs to the site 
throughout the treatment period of the study, as instructed by the investigator and keep record of 
lenalidomide intake at home, which will be reviewed by site personnel on an ongoing basis. A 
patient will be considered compliant with the protocol if the planned lenalidomide dose 
administered is ≥80% to 100% of the assigned dosage. Overdose treatment is described in  
Section 8.6. 
R-CHOP therapy (non IMP) must be documented in the eCRF. 
8.5 Recommended Dose Modifications, Drug Interruptions and 
Discontinuation Guidelines 
8.5.1 Tafasitamab Dose Modifications, Drug Interruptions and Discontinuation 
Dose reductions of tafasitamab are not permitted. Drug interruptions or discontinuation may 
occur in case of e.g. severe infusion-related reactions, allergic reactions, infections, febrile 
neutropenia or severe hematologic toxicity. Delaying the tafasitamab dosing is permitted for no 
more than 2 days (example:  If dosing was planned on Day 8 delaying that dose is allowed  up 
to day 10). Alternatively, a tafasitamab infusion may be skipped completely (e.g. on Day 8 or 
Day 15) and the next scheduled dose will be administered.  
8.5.2 Management of Tafasitamab Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) and Cytokine 
Release Syndrome (CRS) 
IRRs will be defined according to the NCI-CTCAE, Version 5.0 definition of IRR and cytokine

8.5.3 Interventions for IRRs and CRSs 
Grade 2 IRRs, grade 1 CRSs  
If a patient presents with a grade 2 infusion reaction or grade 1 CRS: 
• the infusion should be stopped immediately 
• the patient should receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) as clinically indicated 
• once the symptoms have been resolved or reduced to Grade 1 according to investigator 
assessment, the infusion can be continued at an infusion rate of 50% of the speed so far. If, after

  Page 62 of 117 one hour, the patient’s symptoms do not return and vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may 
be increased every 30 minutes, as tolerated, to the baseline rate. 
If a patient who developed a grade 2 IRR or grade 1 CRS receives further infusions of 
tafasitamab, then premedication should be given before all subsequent infusions of tafasitamab 
throughout the study. 
Grade 3 IRRs, grade 2 CRSs 
If a patient presents with a grade 3 IRR or grade 2 CRS: 
• the infusion should be stopped immediately 
• the patient must receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) and, if necessary, further medications (i.e. 
epinephrine, bronchodilator) 
• only after the complete resolution of all symptoms, and after having received appropriate 
prophylactic medication(s) as described above, the infusion may be resumed at an infusion rate 
of 25% of the speed so far. If, after 1 hour, the patient’s symptoms do not return and vital signs 
are stable, the infusion rate may be increased to a maximum of 50% of the baseline speed. 
• if, after the resumption of the infusion, symptoms return (irrespective of grade), the infusion 
must be stopped immediately and the infusion tubing should be disconnected from the patient. 
Based on the investigator’s decision the patient may receive further tafasitamab provided 
clinically appropriate precautions were undertaken. If a patient who developed a grade 3 IRR or 
grade 2 CRS receives further infusions, then premedication should be given before all subsequent 
infusions of tafasitamab throughout the study. 
If precluded from further tafasitamab administrations, the patient may continue treatment with 
R-CHOP or lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP.  
Grade 4 IRRs, grade 3 CRSs, grade 4 CRSs 
If a patient presents with a grade 4 infusion reaction or grade 3-4 CRS: 
• the infusion should be stopped immediately and the infusion tubing should be disconnected 
from the patient 
• the patient must receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) and, if necessary, further medications (i.e. 
epinephrine, bronchodilator) 
The patient must not receive any further tafasitamab infusions, but may continue treatment with 
R-CHOP or lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP as per protocol. 
8.5.4 Lenalidomide Dose Modifications, Drug Interruptions and Discontinuation 
Lenalidomide may be given only on Day 1 to 10 of each cycle and must not be administered 
beyond this period. 
The dose of lenalidomide may be reduced successively level by level from the starting dose of 
25mg daily. This is described in below Table 2.

Lenalidomide may be interrupted (up to 3 days) within the 10-day dosing period and may be 
restarted within this period at the same dose or at dose level -1, but may not be extended beyond 
day 10 of this cycle. If lenalidomide dosing was interrupted during the previous cycle and was 
restarted with a one-level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of 
the cycle, then that reduced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 of the next cycle. There will be 
no more than one dose reduction from one cycle to the next. Once a patient’s lenalidomide dose 
has been reduced, no dose re-escalation is permitted. 
Patients who cannot tolerate Dose Level -3 are to be discontinued from lenalidomide treatment 
in arm B but should continue therapy with tafasitamab plus R-CHOP for the total duration of six 
cycles, if possible.  
Additional information 
The most up-to-date information regarding constitution, dosing and most frequent AEs related 
to the administration of lenalidomide are contained in the summary of product characteristics 
(SmPC) which will be distributed to the participating sites.   
8.5.5 Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, 
Prednisone/Prednisolone Dose Modifications and Drug Interruptions and 
Discontinuation 
The toxicity management of R-CHOP will be performed at the investigator’s discretion and 
should follow local standard R-CHOP treatment guidelines. 
8.5.6 Criteria to Start Next Treatment Cycle (day 1 of cycle 2-6) 
The next cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 if the following criteria are met: 
• ANC ≥ 1,000/mm3  (unless neutropenia is due to infiltration of bone marrow) 
• Platelets ≥ 75 000/mm3 (unless thrombocytopenia is due to infiltration of bone marrow) 
• All other toxicities have resolved to ≤ Grade 2 
In case of overlapping toxicities it should be ensured that study drugs (lenalidomide, tafasitamab) 
are reduced or interrupted or discontinued (see below) before any dose reductions of R-CHOP. 
If the above mentioned criteria are not met on Day 1 of the planned new cycle, the next cycle 
should not be commenced. The patient will be evaluated again within 7 days. If the above 
mentioned criteria are met at any time within 7 days, the next treatment cycle may be initiated.

  Page 64 of 117 If the above mentioned criteria are still not met after 7 days delay, the next cycle should not 
commence. The patient will be evaluated again after another 7 days (or earlier). If the above 
mentioned criteria are met at any time within 7 days, the next treatment cycle may be initiated. 
For Patients in Arm B, lenalidomide should be decreased to the next lower dose level ( Table 3 ). 
If lenalidomide was already at the lowest dose level, lenalidomide treatment should be 
permanently discontinued.  
If the above mentioned criteria are still not met after 14 days delay, the next cycle should not 
commence. The complete blood count should be repeated at a frequency deemed appropriate by 
the investigator. If the above mentioned criteria are met in Arm B, lenalidomide should be 
permanently discontinued and tafasitamab should be interrupted in this treatment cycle while R-
CHOP treatment may be resumed. In Arm A tafasitamab should be interrupted, while R-CHOP 
treatment may be resumed.  
If the above mentioned criteria are fulfilled, but the patient developed non-hematological 
toxicity  as described in Table 4  due to lenalidomide, tafasitamab plus R-CHOP should continue 
even if lenalidomide is interrupted. Lenalidomide may be resumed at the next cycle if the criteria 
are met. Skipped doses of lenalidomide will not be made up for. 
If the above mentioned criteria are fulfilled, but the patient developed non-hematological 
toxicity  due to tafasitamab (for example Grade 4 IRR), lenalidomide plus R-CHOP or R-CHOP 
should continue even if tafasitamab was discontinued. Note that visits on Day 8 and Day 15 
should still take place in such case as outlined in Section 10. 
Any individual component of R-CHOP may be omitted (or reduced in dose) due to specific 
toxicities related to Rituximab, Vincristin, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide or Prednisone in 
accordance with institutional guidelines.  
Tafasitamab, lenalidomide as well as R-CHOP treatment, as long as permitted by the above rules, 
should be started on Day 1 (within the applicable visit window) of each cycle. 
8.5.6.1 Dose Modifications, Drug Interruptions and Discontinuation in Case of 
Hematological Toxicity (day 2-21 of each cycle) 
Patients will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v5.0 used as a guide for 
grading severity. The dose of lenalidomide for each patient will be checked, interrupted and/or 
modified following toxicity as described below. Refer to Table 3  and Table 4  for instructions on 
dosing interruptions/modifications and for lenalidomide dose reduction instructions. 
The toxicity management of R-CHOP will be performed according to institutional guidelines.  
Guidance on managing specific toxicities is summarised in Table 3 and Table 4. Note that even 
if tafasitamab is interrupted or discontinued due to toxicities, visits on Day 8 and Day 15 
should still take place as outlined in Section 10.

8.6 Tafasitamab and Lenalidomide Overdose Treatment 
MorphoSys is not recommending any specific treatment of a suspected overdose of tafasitamab 
and/or lenalidomide. In case an overdose of tafasitamab and/or lenalidomide happens and 
requires treatment, symptomatic treatment including but not limited to blood product 
transfusions, growth factors, antibiotics, antiemetics and analgesics may be administered per 
investigator’s discretion.  
For purposes of this trial, overdose of tafasitamab is defined as any tafasitamab dose above 
120% of the assigned dosage per single infusion as per protocol ( see section 8.4 ).  
For lenalidomide the overdose is defined as any dose greater than the planned dose for a 
particular patient as per protocol ( see section 8.4). 
 
“Overdose” should be entered in the eCRF. If accompanied by symptoms, the overdose should 
be reported as adverse event in the adverse event page of the eCRF together with the observed 
symptoms. 
8.7 Concomitant and Prohibited Medication 
For possible drug-drug interactions and contraindications of Lenalidomide or R-CHOP or any 
concomitant medication please refer to the respective SmPCs ( section 4.5 ) or to the respective 
Prescribing Information (section Drug Interactions, section Contraindications). 
8.7.1 Prior and Concomitant Medication 
Corticosteroids administered/taken within three weeks before ICF signature will be recorded in 
the eCRF. Patients may continue the medications they were receiving at screening. Patients may 
receive concomitant medications that are medically indicated as standard of care for the 
treatment of symptoms and intercurrent illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, bronchial 
asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients may also receive therapy to mitigate 
side effects of the study treatment as clinically indicated, as well as best supportive care as per 
institutional guidelines. All concomitant medications should be recorded in the eCRF. 
8.7.1.1 Pre-Medication for Tafasitamab Infusions 
Tafasitamab infusions should be administered to patients after pre-medication with oral 
acetaminophen (e.g., 650−1000 mg), an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride 
(50−100 mg) and glucocorticosteroids (e.g. 100 mg IV prednisone or prednisolone or equivalent) 
30−60 minutes prior to starting each infusion (unless contraindicated). Note: the Day 1 steroid 
dose being part of CHOP (100 mg prednisone or prednisolone or equivalent, IV or PO) can be 
used as further component of premedication prior to Tafasitamab infusion.  
Premedication is mandatory for the first cycle. For patients who do not experience ≥ Grade 2 
IRRs / ≥ Grade 1 CRSs to tafasitamab during the first cycle, premedication will be optional for 
subsequent antibody infusions at the discretion of the investigator. Otherwise, the premedication 
should be continued for subsequent administrations.

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 70 of 117 8.7.1.2 Steroid Pre-Phase 
In patients with urgent need for a steroid pre-phase before initiation of therapy, the use of oral 
prednisone 25-100 mg/d or equivalent over 7 days is allowed after screening tumor investigations 
(imaging, blood samples) have been completed.  
In exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the investigator, the steroid pre-phase can 
be started prior to acquisition of PET.  
Any pre-phase steroid use must be recorded in the eCRF and adequately documented and 
justified in the patient’s source data. 
8.7.1.3 CNS Prophylaxis 
Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy may be given 
according to institutional practice. CNS prophylaxis with intravenous methotrexate is allowed 
only if it was pre-planned before randomization and it may be administered only after the last 
treatment cycle and after the End of Treatment tumor assessment by PET/CT or PET/MRI. 
8.7.1.4 G-CSF 
As per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, CHOP belongs to 
chemotherapy regimens with an intermediate risk for febrile neutropenia. There is the potential 
for increased neutropenia risk with the addition of monoclonal antibodies such as Rituximab or 
tafasitamab, as well as lenalidomide. To mitigate the risk of febrile neutropenia, primary 
neutropenia prophylaxis with G-CSF or Peg-G-CSF is mandatory in this study. The dose and 
schedule of the selected drug will be done according to local practice and institutional guidelines.  
8.7.1.5 Pre-planned radiotherapy  
Pre-planned local radiotherapy may be administered to initial sites of bulky or extranodal disease 
according to institutional guidelines. Pre-planned radiotherapy may be administered only after 
the last treatment cycle and after the End of Treatment tumor assessment by PET/CT or 
PET/MRI. However, the decision to administer radiotherapy as well as the location to be treated 
must be determined before randomization. In this case, the radiotherapy will not count as a next 
anti-lymphoma treatment. All unplanned radiotherapy administered to patients or a decision to 
switch radiotherapy to a different lesion will be considered as a next anti-lymphoma treatment. 
8.7.1.6 Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) for Patients 
Receiving Lenalidomide 
Prophylaxis of VTE is mandatory in patients receiving lenalidomide (Arm B) due to increased 
risk of thrombosis in patients treated with lenalidomide without prophylaxis. Patients must 
receive e.g. aspirin 70-325mg p.o. daily or low molecular weight heparin. Patients with a history 
of VTE or thrombophilia may participate if they are willing to be on full anticoagulation during 
the treatment if randomized to Arm B. The choice of VTE prophylaxis agent is at investigator´s 
discretion and should be tailored to the patient’s individual risk/benefit profile by taking into 
account the individual thrombotic risk, bleeding risk, and the quality of compliance with the 
VTE prophylaxis. 
8.7.1.7 Prophylaxis of Hepatitis B Reactivation

  Page 71 of 117 are the standard of care may be treated prophylactically. Patients with occult HBV infection, 
defined as negative HBsAg and positive total HBcAb and negative HBV DNA, are eligible and 
must undergo ongoing DNA testing (irrespective of prophylactic treatment) as described in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 10). 
8.7.1.8 Anti-Infectious Prophylaxis 
Anti-infectious prophylaxis including prophylaxis of opportunistic infections can be given as per 
institutional guidelines. 
8.7.1.9 Prophylaxis of tumor lysis syndrome   
In patients with high risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. patients with large tumor burden, elevated 
LDH, or high proliferation rate of tumor cells), TLS prophylaxis should be considered. All 
approaches to mitigate the risk of developing TLS, such as adequate hydration or hypouricemic 
agents (e.g. allopurinol or rasburicase), may be used in high risk patients as per institutional 
guidelines. Patients with high risk of TLS should be followed closely and appropriate laboratory 
monitoring should be performed as per institutional guidelines.   
8.7.2 Prohibited Medication 
8.7.2.1 Anticancer Therapies 
No radiotherapy (including limited field radiotherapy) is permitted after the screening PET/CT 
scan for initial disease assessment has been performed, except for the pre-planned radiotherapy 
described in Section 8.7.1.5. Other than the study drugs, R-CHOP and permitted concomitant 
medication, patients should not receive any other DLBCL-specific therapy during the study 
treatment period. The patient should not receive any investigational agent other than tafasitamab 
and lenalidomide during the treatment period of the study. 
The use of concurrent antineoplastic therapies other than study drugs and R-CHOP, including, 
but not limited to, chemotherapies, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, biological response 
modifiers, mAbs with or without conjugation, radioisotopic therapies, stem cell transplant and 
targeted small molecules are not permitted during the entire treatment period of this study.  
After disease progression/relapse has been recorded or if an end of treatment tumor assessment 
indicates residual (partial metabolic response) or no metabolic response (SD), additional 
antineoplastic therapies are permitted at the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with 
the local guidelines. They should be recorded in the eCRF as next anti-lymphoma treatments. 
Patients should be encouraged to complete the Follow-up period in such case and may stay in 
the study unless they participate in another clinical study.  
8.7.2.2 Live vaccines 
Because of the immunosuppressive effects of the study treatment, administration of any live 
vaccine is not recommended during the treatment period and at least 6 months after the end of 
treatment.  
Thereafter the decision to administer live vaccine is at the investigator’s discretion and should 
follow local guidelines for R-CHOP (the haematological status of individual patient, including 
B-cell depletion, should be considered).

  Page 73 of 117 9 CLINICAL TRIAL PROCEDURES 
All study-required procedures should occur as outlined in Section 10 . Excursions from the timing 
of assessments will be considered protocol deviations and should be recorded in the documents 
along with the reasons for excursion. 
9.1 Patient Numbering 
Each patient is identified in the study by a 7-digit Patient Number (Patient No.) that is assigned 
by the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system when the patient is screened (i.e. signs the 
ICF), and is retained as the primary identifier for the patient throughout his/her entire 
participation in the trial. 
 The Patient No. consists of the 5-digit Center Number (assigned to the study site) and a 
sequential 2-digit patient number suffixed to it, so that each patient is numbered uniquely 
across the entire study 
 The investigator or designated study personnel will contact the IRT system and provide the 
requested identifying information for the patient to register them into the IRT system and 
assign a Patient No. 
 Once assigned, the Patient No. must not be reused for any other patient.  
9.2 Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
All patients who fulfil all inclusion criteria and who are not barred by any of the exclusion criteria 
will be treated with R-CHOP and randomly assigned to study drugs comprising tafasitamab or 
tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in a 1:1 ratio.  
Randomization  will be done through IRT before the patient receives any study treatment.  While 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria need to be reviewed again prior to randomization, laboratory 
results and results of assessments obtained during the screening period or on the day of 
randomization may be used for determining patient eligibility for study randomization.  
9.3 Re-Screening 
A patient can be re-screened at the discretion of the investigator under certain circumstances. 
Re-screening is restricted to one attempt per patient and can only be performed if one of the 
following criteria is met:  
1. The patient has already consented and met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
and his or her randomization was delayed due to an unexpected change in the patient’s personal 
situation (e.g. family issues).  
2. The patient previously failed to be eligible due to any event (e.g., planned surgery, laboratory 
test result) that has been resolved.  
Note: A patient should only be re-screened if there is a clear indication that the patient may be 
eligible according to the currently valid study protocol. 
If previous screening activities were discontinued and enrolment did not occur, the following 
procedures should be implemented:  
1. The eligible patient will receive a new Patient number via the IRT  
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 74 of 117 2. A new electronic case report form (eCRF) will be completed  
3. The patient will be documented as re-screened in the source documents.  
A re-screened patient can be randomized, if all of the inclusion criteria are met and none of the 
exclusion criteria are met. 
9.4 Demographic Data/Relevant Medical History and Current Medical 
Conditions/Baseline Stage and Prognostic Classification 
Demographic variables to be recorded will include age, gender, race/ethnic origin.  
At the time of signing of the ICF, relevant medical history and current medical conditions should 
be recorded. The medical history of DLBCL should be documented in detail, including all 
symptoms at screening.  Also, examinations leading to the diagnosis of DLBCL should be 
documented in the patient’s source documents. This may include, for example, results of 
laboratory examinations, imaging results, or clinical symptoms related to DLBCL. The 
assessment of the lymphoma should include disease staging. In order to reflect the patient’s status 
at the time of screening, the standard Ann Arbor staging system used for DLBCL reflecting the 
number of sites of involvement and their relation to the diaphragm, the existence of B-symptoms, 
and the presence of extranodal disease, will be documented (Appendix C).  Additionally, the 
disease risk assessment as per IPI ( Appendix D ) and patient status as per Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status criteria (see Appendix B ), will be recorded. 
Screening for CNS lymphoma involvement is not mandatory. Lumbar puncture with 
cerebrospinal fluid evaluation (cytology, flow cytometry) and/or head CT/ head MRI is 
recommended in patients with high risk disease to exclude CNS lymphoma involvement.  
9.5 Diagnostic Lymphoma Biopsy and Central Pathology Review 
For each participating patient suitable and sufficient archival tumor tissue material must be 
provided. A central pathologist will provide confirmation of the histological diagnosis of 
DLBCL. Surgically acquired tissue samples are preferred, but core biopsies are permitted. Bone 
marrow biopsies are not adequate for this purpose and should be performed only for disease 
staging. 
The local pathology report indicating DLBCL diagnosis is acceptable for determining a patient’s 
eligibility for receiving the first trial treatment. Central pathology review is mandatory, but 
retrospective in nature. Tissue samples or archival tumor tissue material, as stated above should 
be submitted within 30 days of patient randomization. Archival paraffin blocks are preferred. In 
exceptional cases where no such blocks can be provided, unstained slides are also acceptable. In 
such case, tissue curls will be required in addition.  
In case of discrepancies between the assessments of the local and the central pathologists, the 
assessment of the central pathologist prevails. If the DLBCL diagnosis of the local pathologist 
cannot be confirmed by the central pathologist, and a patient’s treatment has already commenced, 
the patient may remain in the study. 
9.6 Bone marrow assessment 
As per the Lugano criteria (Cheson, 2014), a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is not mandated 
in patients who undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI. However, bone marrow assessments may be

  Page 75 of 117 performed according to investigator´s discretion. The data of such examination will be collected 
in the eCRF. 
9.7 Radiographic Imaging Assessment  
Radiographic assessments will be performed at the timepoints indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 10). Additional radiographic assessments may be performed by the 
investigator during the course of the study, if deemed necessary. 
A CT scan (with contrast unless contraindicated) covering at least the neck, chest, abdomen,  
pelvis, and any other disease sites as well as PET scans are required for the pre-treatment tumor 
assessment. The use of historical PET/CT or PET/MRI scans within a maximum of 21 days 
before signature of ICF is permitted as long as they are of acceptable quality and cover the 
aforementioned anatomical areas. Information on extranodal involvement (e.g. gastric or skin 
involvement) will be recorded in the source documents.  
During the course of the study, response assessments will be performed covering the 
aforementioned anatomical areas as for screening unless additional regions are deemed required 
to be covered.  
A mid-treatment CT/MRI should be performed at Cycle 3 D18 +/- 3 days, i.e. prior to the end of 
cycle 3; a mid-treatment PET/CT (or PET/MRI) is optional and should be triggered by local 
guidelines.  
An end of treatment PET/CT or PET/MRI should be performed 4-8 weeks after the last study 
treatment. 
During the follow-up period CT scans should be performed roughly every 6 months. 
If disease progression/relapse is diagnosed purely on the basis of clinical symptoms, a CT scan 
with IV contrast (or MRI if IV contrast is contraindicated) or PET/CT (or PET/MRI) is required 
within 4 weeks of diagnosing disease progression/relapse based on symptoms. If such imaging 
was performed, it does not need to be repeated at the Early Treatment Discontinuation visit.  
NOTE: PET/CT hybrid scanners may be used to acquire the required CT images only if the CT 
produced by the scanner is of diagnostic quality.  
If using a hybrid machine to acquire both PET and CT, the PET must be performed prior to the 
CT with IV contrast as to not compromise PET results.  
If independent CT and PET scanners are used, and the patient is receiving both scans on the same 
day, the PET must be performed prior to the CT with IV contrast. Assessment of PET results is 
based on Lugano classification (Cheson, 2014; see Appendix E ) 
Lesion measurements and other parameters relevant for the response assessment based on 
Lugano classification (Cheson, 2014; see Appendix E ) will be collected in the eCRF. 
9.8 Vital Signs 
Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature. 
Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 76 of 117 Vital signs will be measured at the time points described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 
10). Vital signs are to be obtained pre-tafasitamab infusion, and then at least 3 times during the 
infusion, and as clinically indicated. 
The frequency or the length of the monitoring period may be adapted if clinically indicated, for 
example if in the opinion of the investigator the vital sign results, at the time of event onset, are 
clinically significant. In such a case the patient’s vital sign measurements should continue to be 
recorded until they have returned to normal or pre-infusion levels and corresponding AEs to be 
recorded. 
If possible, before vital signs are measured, the patient should be resting for at least 5 minutes. 
Ideally/Optimally, the same position should be used each time vital signs are measured for a 
given patient, and blood pressure should be measured from the arm contralateral to the site of 
study drug administration. Body temperature should be measured according to normal hospital 
practice.  
9.9  Electrocardiograms, Echocardiograms or Cardiac MUGA scans 
Standard 12-lead resting ECGs will be obtained at the various time points described in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 10). Ideally,  ECGs will be recorded after the patient has rested 
in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. ECG will first be interpreted locally. 
The investigator will evaluate the clinical significance of each ECG value outside the reference 
ranges, according to the nature and degree of the observed abnormality. Any new abnormal 
values or those deteriorating from baseline considered to be clinically significant should be 
reported as AEs.  
If clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artefacts are present that result in an 
inability to adequately interpret the results, the ECG will be repeated.  
The sponsor will further organize a central review of ECG tracings. In case of discrepancies 
between the outcome of the local and the central assessment, the assessment of the central 
reviewer will prevail.  
Echocardiogram or cardiac MUGA scan will be obtained at screening and at End of Treatment 
Visit or Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit to evaluate cardiac function, including 
assessment of LVEF (data will be collected in the eCRF).  
LVEF is the central measure of left ventricular systolic function. LVEF is the fraction of 
chamber volume ejected in systole (stroke volume) in relation to the volume of the blood in the 
ventricle at the end of diastole (end-diastolic volume). SV is calculated as the difference 
between EDV and end systolic volume (ESV). LVEF is calculated from: 
LVEF: [SV/EDV] x 100

  Page 77 of 117 9.10 Physical Examination (PE) 
Physical examination will be performed according to Schedule of Assessments ( Section 10). 
A full PE will be performed by the investigator or a qualified designee during the screening and 
at the End of Treatment Visit or Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit.  
Full physical examination should include at least: cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and 
neurologic assessment. The tumor assessment includes the evaluation of presence and degree of 
enlarged lymph nodes, liver and spleen assessments.  
Limited physical examination will be guided by the individual patient’s status and will include 
body systems associated with symptoms and/or the underlying DLBCL disease (lymph node 
status, liver, spleen). Limited PEs may be focused on tumor response assessment (e.g., lymph 
nodes, liver, spleen) and AEs per investigator discretion.  
9.11 Body Weight Measurement 
Body weight will be measured as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 10) .  
The body weight measured on Day 1 of a cycle will be used to calculate the tafasitamab dose to 
be used throughout this cycle.  
9.12 B-symptoms, ECOG performance status 
B-symptoms and ECOG performance status will be assessed at the timepoints indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 10).  
9.13 Hepatitis Virus Serology 
Patients will be examined according to the schedule in Section 10 for viral hepatitis B and C. 
Hepatitis B biomarkers include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), total anti-hepatitis B core 
antibody (anti-HBc) and anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). Patients with a positive 
test for anti-HBc can only be included if hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA) is not detected. In 
these patients only , HBV DNA should be assessed at various subsequent visits as outlined in 
Section 10.  
In the context of exclusion criteria, seropositive for or active viral infection with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) means:  
a) HBsAg positive 
b) HBsAg negative, anti-HBs positive and/or anti-HBc positive and detectable HBV DNA.  
Note: Patients who are HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and HBV DNA negative are eligible. 
Note: Patients who exhibit the classical vaccination profile of anti-HBs positive, anti-HBc 
negative, and HBsAg negative are eligible.  
If HBV-DNA becomes detectable during treatment, patients should be prophylactically treated 
and followed-up for potential hepatitis B reactivation. If the HBV-DNA assay is positive, then 
patients can only stay in the study if they are assessed by a physician experienced in the treatment

  Page 78 of 117 of hepatitis B and pre-emptive treatment is initiated, if deemed appropriate, and/or according to 
local practice/guidelines.  
Hepatitis C serology is to be done at screening only. Hepatitis C biomarkers include anti-
hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV). For patients who are positive for anti-HCV antibody, 
HCV-RNA should be measured.  
A positive Hepatitis C test is defined as a positive test for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibodies 
and a positive test for HCV RNA.  
9.14 Pregnancy Testing 
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) at various time 
points either by urine pregnancy test or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) test of a 
serum sample (see Section 10) . The pregnancy test assay should have a minimum sensitivity of 
25 IU/mL.  
Applicable in all countries except US:  FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests prior to 
starting the study drug, even if true abstinence is the chosen method of birth control. The first 
pregnancy test must be performed during screening and the second pregnancy test must be 
performed within the 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. The patient must not receive study 
drug until the Investigator or Designee  has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are 
negative. 
Applicable in US: FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests prior to starting study drug, 
even if true abstinence is the chosen method of birth control. The first pregnancy test must be 
performed within 10-14 days before study drug initiation, the second pregnancy test must be 
performed within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.  The patient must not receive study 
drug until the Investigator or Designee has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are 
negative. 
9.15 Local Laboratory Testing 
Local laboratory tests will be performed according to Section 10.  
Laboratory results are required for determining patient eligibility for study enrolment and will 
be used for the primary statistical analysis of the study results.  
During screening, it is permitted to repeat the local laboratory assessment of serum chemistry 
and hematology parameters due to the variability of the parameters and their dependence on 
multitude of factors (e.g., hydration, muscle mass). This is, provided no safety concerns arise 
and that such laboratory results might have been caused by a transient, medically plausible event, 
which resolved spontaneously or as result of a medical intervention in the meantime (e.g., 
dehydration, vomiting, imaging procedure with a contrast). This procedure and the rationale 
behind it must be explicitly documented in source data. Such repeated assessment (once only) of 
the concerned parameters will not be counted as “re- screening” for that patient.  
Local laboratory samples may be taken up to 24 hours before study drug administration. Local 
laboratory results will be used for taking treatment or clinically related decisions, or for the 
immediate safety management of a study patient.  The investigator or designee should review,

  Page 79 of 117 laboratory results before dosing so that the administration of the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) may be adjusted or interrupted if necessary.  
The laboratory results will be kept in the patient’s source documentation. Any clinically 
significant discrepancies will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All blood samples will be 
processed and handled according to standard laboratory procedures. The time of blood collection 
should be documented in the source data .  
9.16 Immunogenicity (anti-tafasitamab antibodies) 
Serum samples for anti-tafasitamab antibody analysis will be collected according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Section 10) . 
Serum samples for anti-tafasitamab antibody analysis will be handled and stored as specified in 
the laboratory manual at the study site until shipment on dry ice to an external analytical 
laboratory. At each sampling time point, the obtained serum sample should be split into 2 aliquots 
(a primary and a back-up sample).  
9.17 Tafasitamab Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Serum samples for tafasitamab PK analysis will be collected according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 10) . 
Serum samples for PK analysis of tafasitamab will be handled and stored as specified in the 
laboratory manual at the study site until shipment on dry ice to an external analytical laboratory. 
At each sampling time point, the obtained serum sample should be split into 2 aliquots (a primary 
and a back-up sample). 
9.18 Other Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and tumor specimens for the analysis of exploratory biomarkers will be collected 
throughout the study according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 10) and will be 
characterized for markers, which are important in the mechanism of action of tafasitamab, or 
could predict response to the study drugs.  
Samples for exploratory biomarker analysis will be handled and stored as specified in the 
laboratory manual.

* A visit window of ± 2 days is allowed for all visits starting from C1D8 until C6D15. For C1D1 a visit window of +1 day applies. Study treatment should start within 24 
hours of randomization.  
a End of treatment Visit is defined as 6 ± 2 weeks after End of Treatment. End of Treatment is defined as day 21 of the last treatment cycle the patient started. Patients who 
discontinue early because of toxicity or withdraw consent at any time during the study should return for an Early Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit 6 +/-2 weeks after 
day 21 of the last treatment cycle the patient started. Patients who discontinue early because of progression/relapse of disease may have this visit earlier at the discretion of 
the investigator. 
b At screening, age, sex, race/ethnic origin and relevant medical history will be recorded. This includes history of prior non-hematologic cancers, e.g. prostate cancer, 
melanoma.  
c  Full physical examination should include at least: cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurologic assessment. The tumor assessment includes the evaluation of 
presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes, liver and spleen assessments. Limited physical examination will be guided by the individual patient’s status and will include 
body systems associated with symptoms (e.g. respiratory, heart, skin) and/or the underlying DLBCL disease (lymph node status, liver, spleen). 
d Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature. Vital signs are to be obtained pre-tafasitamab infusion, and then at least 3 times during the infusion, and 
as clinically indicated.  
e Note: Risk counselling is mandatory for all participants, incl. males at screening. After randomization, risk counselling will only continue at the indicated frequency for 
patients that are randomized to Arm B. A serum/urine pregnancy test is mandatory only for females of childbearing potential (FCBP). For US only: the serum pregnancy 
test for FCBP at screening needs to be done within 10-14 days prior to treatment initiation.  
f Hematology lab includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, percent and absolute white count differential (neutrophils, 
eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils).  
g At screening and during treatment, serum chemistry includes Na, K, Ca, phosphate, chloride, creatinine, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, 
LDH, AP, uric acid, calculated creatinine clearance and C-reactive protein, glucose.  
h HCV RNA by PCR only if the patient is anti-HCV antibody positive. In anti-HBc-positive patients, the HBV DNA titer needs to be determined using real-time PCR at Day 
1 of each cycle and until at least 1 year after the last treatment cycle. 
i Tumor measurements by PET/CT or PET/MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis to be performed according to the Lugano criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 
2014; see Appendix E ) at screening and 6 ±2 weeks after day 21 of the last treatment cycle the patient started. Note: A mid-treatment CT or MRI scan and tumor evaluation 
is required at Cycle 3 D18 ± 3 days prior to the end of cycle 3; a mid-treatment PET/CT is optional. Every effort should be made to use the same scan modality (CT or 
MRI) for all assessments. If progression/relapse is diagnosed purely on the basis of clinical symptoms, a CT-scan or PET/CT is required within 4 weeks of clinical diagnosis. 
In such case the imaging does not need to be repeated at the early treatment termination visit.  MRI scans may be used instead of CT-scans in patients for whom CT-scans 
are contraindicated. Screening visit PET/CT or PET/MRI: A PET/CT or PET/MRI of suitable quality that has been taken less than 21 days prior to signing the ICF may be 
used. 
j As per the Lugano criteria (Cheson, 2014), a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is not mandated in patients who undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI. However, bone marrow 
assessments may be performed according to local guidelines. The data of such examination will be collected in the eCRF.  
k  Tafasitamab infusions should be given after pre-medication with oral acetaminophen (650 – 1000 mg), an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50-100 
mg), and glucocorticosteroids (e.g. 100 mg IV prednisone or prednisolone or equivalent) 30-60 minutes prior to starting each infusion in cycle 1. The Day 1 steroid dose 
being part of CHOP (100 mg prednisone or prednisolone or equivalent, IV or PO) can be used as part of the premedication prior to Tafasitamab infusion. After cycle 1, 
for patients who do not experience any grade 2 or higher infusion-related reactions (IRRs) with their previous infusion, pre-mediation at subsequent treatments may be 
omitted according to institutional treatment guidelines. NOTE:  The R-CHOP treatment is considered to be standard of care (SoC) and will be given according to 
institutional guidelines. Rituximab is advised to be given approximately 30 minutes after the end of tafasitamab infusion, followed by the CHOP chemotherapy which 
will be given approximately 30 minutes after the end of the rituximab infusion.  
l  In selected centres, if the patient progresses and agrees on an additional biopsy, fresh material shall be provided  
m Applicable in US : For FCBP who have regular menstrual cycles, urine pregnancy test should be performed on day 1 of each cycle and at the End of Tretment visit. For 
FCBP with irregular menstrual cycle,s urine pregnancy tests should be done on day 1 and on day 15 of each cycle, and at End of Treatment Visit.

VARIABLES 
11.1 Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy assessments will be made according to the revised response criteria for malignant 
lymphoma based on the guidelines of the Lugano Classification (as reported by Cheson, 2014) 
and will be based on investigator assessment ( Appendix E ) 
Efficacy will be evaluated in terms of ORR, DoR, PFS, EFS, OS, TTP and TTNT (Please see 
section 13.12  and section 13.13  for the definition of efficacy endpoints). 
Imaging assessment of efficacy/disease response will be recorded at the end of cycle 3 and after 
the end of treatment (6±2 weeks after day 21 of the last treatment cycle the patient started) as 
well as approximately every 6 months during the FU period.  
11.2 Safety Assessments 
11.2.1 Local Safety and Hematology Laboratory Testing 
Any abnormal laboratory findings that constitute an AE should be reported as such and should 
be followed up until the outcome is known. Also, additional diagnostic tests may be indicated to 
determine a more precise diagnosis of the patient’s condition (e.g., ordering a white blood cell 
(WBC) differential count to help characterise a high or low WBC count, or ordering a 
determination of red blood cell (RBC) indices to help characterise a low hematocrit).  
11.2.2 Safety Monitoring 
The patients will be closely observed and questioned for any kind of AE during the study 
procedures and at follow-up appointments throughout the study period with non-leading 
questioning (e.g., “How do you feel?”). AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
the patient during or between study visits or through physical examination, laboratory tests, or 
other assessments. 
 
Study personnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs, particularly those that may be 
life-threatening. Personnel who are trained in the acute management of IRRs, cytokine release 
syndrome, anaphylaxis, and other emergencies, and who have access to appropriate clinical 
supplies, should be readily available. 
 
All AEs should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study treatment 
including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping concomitant treatments, 
changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalization, or any other medically 
required intervention. Once an AE is detected, it should be followed up, and an assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in its severity, its 
suspected relationship to the study drug(s) or R-CHOP, any of the interventions required to treat 
it, and its outcome.

  Page 86 of 117 11.2.3 Definition of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events of 
Special Interest 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal 
product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship to this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
it is considered related to that study drug. 
AEs include any clinically significant deterioration of a patient’s medical status after the signing 
of the ICF. Also, an increase in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing event or conditions 
and events resulting from protocol mandated procedures (e.g., invasive procedures) fall under 
the definition of AEs.  
Please note that in the context of this protocol symptoms that are clearly associated to disease 
progression/relapse do not fall under the definition of AEs. 
The PI or designee should evaluate each AE to determine the following: 
 Relationship to the study drug or R-CHOP (suspected/not suspected)  
 Duration (start and end date, or if continuing at end of study) 
 Intensity: the intensity of all AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following definitions: 
o mild:  tolerable 
o moderate: interferes with normal activity 
o severe:   incapacitating (causes inability to perform usual activities or 
   work) 
 Severity, i.e., toxicity grade: determined according to the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, using 
the following definitions: 
o grade 1:  mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
   observations only; intervention not indicated 
o grade 2: moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
   limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 
   (refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, 
   using the telephone, managing money, etc.) 
grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living  
o grade 4: life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
o grade 5: death related to AE 
 Outcome 
o All non-serious AEs must be followed up for a final outcome. An outcome of 
“unknown” is not considered to be an acceptable final outcome. An outcome of 
“not yet resolved” is an acceptable final outcome for non-serious AEs at the end 
of a patient’s participation in the study. All SAEs must be followed up for a final

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 87 of 117 outcome until resolution or, if resolution becomes unlikely, until stabilization or 
death. 
 Action taken (no action taken; study drug or R-CHOP temporarily interrupted; study drug 
or R-CHOP permanently discontinued due to this AE; medication taken; non-drug 
therapy given; hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization) 
 Seriousness: an SAE is defined as serious if it: 
o results in death 
o is life-threatening 
o requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization signifies that the patient was an inpatient for at least one 
overnight stay) unless hospitalization is for : 
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with 
deterioration of symptoms related to DLBCL 
 elective or preplanned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated 
to DLBCL and has not worsened since signing of the informed consent 
 social reason and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the 
patient’s general condition 
o results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
o is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
o is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or 
may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously. 
The term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was, in the view of the 
reporting Investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Medical judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious in other situations: important AEs that 
are not immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the previous definitions should also be considered as serious. 
AEs of special interest  (AESIs) for tafasitamab are: TLS, IRRs and allergic reactions to study 
drug ≥ grade 3, cytokine release syndrome, second primary malignancies, hepatitis B 
reactivation, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). 
AEs of special interest  (AESIs) for lenalidomide: Second primary malignancies.  
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs and AESIs are monitored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements (see Section 11.2.4 below). 
For each AE, the investigator should determine the causality (relationship to the study drug or 
R-CHOP) based on his/her clinical experience and on the information given in the IB. The causal 
relationship of all AEs to the study drug or R-CHOP will be judged as either suspected or not 
suspected. A suspected causal relationship means at least a reasonable possibility that the event 
is caused by the study drug or R-CHOP. If no relationship has been provided by the investigator, 
the event will be considered as related to the study drug.

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 88 of 117 Information about adverse drug reactions already known about the investigational study drugs 
can be found in the IB or SmPC, or will be communicated in the form of Investigator 
Notifications. This information will be included in the patient ICF and should be discussed with 
the patient during the study, as needed. 
11.2.4 Reporting of AEs, SAEs and AEs of Special Interest 
All AEs that occur after the provision of informed consent until the end of the study will be 
recorded in the eCRF and in the patient’s medical records, whether or not the Investigator 
considers them to be related to the study drugs (tafasitamab, Lenalidomide) or R-CHOP. All AEs 
should be recorded in terms of diagnoses, if possible.  
For screening failure patients only SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. Non-serious AEs will 
only be recorded in the patient’s medical records. 
In addition, SAEs and AESIs will be recorded on the SAE report form. Study centers and 
investigators are instructed to report SAEs and AESIs to the contract research organization 
(CRO) within 24 hours. NOTE: Follow-up SAE reporting has to be sent to the CRO within 24 
hours as well. Notification of initial or follow-up SAE/AESI information must be transmitted to 
the CRO as described in the investigator site file.  
The sponsor is responsible for submission of expedited (including 7-day and 15-day SUSAR) 
reports and periodic reports (including DSURs) to the regulatory authoritiess, IECs/IRBs and 
investigators as per country specific requirements. 
IRRs and allergic reactions to study drugs grade 3 or higher, cytokine release syndrome or TLS, 
which are AESIs in this study, should be reported as diagnosis along with their respective 
symptoms in one event term (e.g., “IRR with symptoms of hives, chills and fever” for IRRs; 
“TLS with symptom of hyperuricemia” for TLSs).  
Contact details of the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, the CRO Medical Monitor (24/7 coverage), 
and for SAE reporting are provided in the Investigator Site File. 
11.2.5 Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported using a Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Form. To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy of a study patient or a female partner 
of a study patient must also be reported within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence to the CRO 
as indicated in the investigator site file.  
Female study patients who become pregnant must be withdrawn from the study treatment period. 
A newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient or female partner of a study patient who has received 
any study drug is not considered an SAE unless it meets any criteria of seriousness or it is 
suspected that the study drug interacted with a contraceptive method and led to pregnancy.

  Page 89 of 117 If the pregnancy results in clinical consequences/complications in mother or child, e.g., if the 
child is born with a birth defect, this should be reported as an SAE of mother or child as 
applicable. 
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital 
abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. Every infant has to be followed up for 
2 months after delivery. 
11.3 Other Variables 
11.3.1 Biomarkers 
Biomarker assessments will include B-, T- and NK and other cell counts in peripheral blood or 
tumor tissue, the expression of CD19 and CD20 in tumor tissue, as well as analysis of prognostic 
and exploratory markers by IHC, FISH (e.g., MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 protein levels and gene 
rearrangements). Blood samples will be stored to enable the analysis of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell populations (e.g. monocytes or CD4+ T-cells), to facilitate the investigational 
research topics that may arise during the course of the study. 
To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of tafasitamab, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be 
quantified serially in the peripheral blood as an early indicator of treatment response and to detect 
minimal residual disease (MRD). 
Gene expression profiling of tumor biopsies at screening will be used to determine the cell of 
origin (COO) subtype and to assess tumor infiltrating immune cells via their gene signature. 
Together, with the quantification of tumor-associated macrophages and tumor infiltrating NK 
cells by immunohistochemistry this will provide a deeper understanding of the mode of action 
of tafasitamab. 
 
Optional analysis of Biomarkers on fresh tumor biopsy samples 
In a selected subset of participating centers, and as an optional analysis that a patient needs to 
consent to individually, fresh biopsy samples will be collected and analysed at a central 
laboratory. Such analysis will include a quantitative assessment of CD19 and CD20 on malignant 
B-cells. The selection of centers will be driven by the logistical needs of the planned biomarker 
analyses. 
11.4 Appropriateness of Measurements 
All assessments and measurements are appropriate and generally regarded as standard medical 
practice.

The PI will provide his/her electronic signature on the CRF. 
12.2 Clinical Monitoring 
MorphoSys or designee will monitor the clinical trial conduct at the clinical trial sites to ensure 
data quality (accurate and complete data collection), patient’s safety and right protection. 
12.3 Audit and Inspection 
According to ICH E6-GCP, the sponsor or regulatory authorities may audit the investigational 
site.  The sponsor’s or CRO’s Quality Assurance Unit, independent of the Clinical Research and 
Development Department, is responsible for auditing the study. 
The investigator(s) must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection to verify 
compliance of study conduct with regulatory requirements and GCP. 
12.4 Clinical Data Management 
The sponsor will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the data.  The handling 
of data, including data quality control, will comply with applicable regulatory guidelines. 
Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using MedDRA and WHO 
medication dictionary. 
12.5 Archiving 
All study documentation at the clinical trial site and sponsor site will be archived in accordance 
with the applicable regulatory requirements as well as International Council for Harmonization 
(ICH) E6-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the sponsor’s quality standards and SOPs.

patients/entries in the particular category. 
Definition of baseline value: the last pre-administration observation will be used as the baseline 
value for calculating post-administration changes from baseline. 
All data obtained via the eCRF and entered into the database will be provided in separate data 
listings showing individual patient’s values. A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) detailing the 
statistical analyses will be finalized prior to first patient first visit. 
The planning and reporting of statistical analysis will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s 
SOPs governing clinical trials. 
The sponsor and/or designated CRO will analyze the data. Any data analysis carried out 
independently by the investigator should be submitted to the sponsor before publication or 
presentation. 
It is planned that the data from participating centers in this protocol will be combined, so that an 
adequate number of patients will be available for analysis.

13.6 Hypothesis 
As this is a Phase 1b study, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.  
13.7 Sample Size Determination 
As this is a Phase Ib study primarily conducted to explore safety endpoints, no formal statistical 
hypothesis has been established for the sample size calculation of this trial.  
With a sample size of 12 patients in each arm, there is a 60% probability to observe 4 or more 
patients with unacceptable toxicity if the underlying incidence rate of these toxicities is 33%.  
With a sample size of 30 patients in each arm, there is a 55% probability to observe 10 or more 
patients with unacceptable toxicity if the underlying incidence rate of these toxicities is 33%. 
13.8 Procedures for Missing, Unused and Spurious Data 
Missing values will not be substituted by estimated values, but treated as missing in the statistical 
evaluation. All data from all patients dosed in the clinical trial will be included in all listings, 
plots, summary tables, and statistical analyses when appropriate. 
If a patient discontinues the trial for any reason other than treatment related toxicity or 
progression of disease or death, this patient may be replaced. 
In the event of a significant volume of missing data, sensitivity analyses for the efficacy and 
biomarker endpoints may be performed using the principle of multiple imputation.  
13.9 Procedures for Reporting Deviations from Original Statistical Plan 
Details of the analyses to be performed on data from this trial will be provided in a separate SAP. 
Any deviations from the statistical analysis outlined in this protocol will be described, and 
reasons for the deviations listed, in the clinical trial report. 
13.10  Primary Objective Analysis 
The Primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of tafasitamab in addition 
to R-CHOP and tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP in patients with newly 
diagnosed DLBCL. To assess safety and tolerability, the incidence and severity of 
haematological and non-haematological AEs including clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities will be determined.  AEs will be categorized with regards to seriousness, intensity, 
toxicity, study treatment relationship, outcome and action taken. AE reports will be graded 
according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events 
(CTCAE), version 5.0. Further details are provided in Section 11.2.

  Page 96 of 117 13.12.2.3 Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 12 Months and 24 Months  
Tumor assessments will be performed by local radiologists using Lugano 2014 criteria (Cheson, 
2014). 
PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiologically 
or histologically/cytologically documented disease progression or death due to any cause. If a 
patient has not progressed or died at the analysis cut-off date or when he/she receives further 
anti-neoplastic therapy, PFS will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor evaluation 
before the earlier of the cut-off date or start of the further antineoplastic therapy date. 
Kaplan Meier plots will be used to estimate the distribution of PFS. The PFS probabilities at 12 
and 24 months, and the associate 95% CI will be summarized for each treatment arm. 
13.12.2.4 Event-free Survival (EFS) Rate at 12 Months and 24 Months  
EFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiologically 
documented disease progression or death due to any cause or start of new anti-lymphoma 
treatment. If a patient has not progressed or died or started a new anti-lymphoma treatment at 
the analysis cut-off date, EFS will be censored on the date of last contact. 
Kaplan Meier plots will be used to estimate the distribution of EFS. The EFS probabilities at 12 
and 24 months, and the associate 95% CI will be summarized for each treatment arm. 
13.12.2.5 Time to Next Anti-lymphoma Treatment (TTNT) 
Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT) is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of administration of next anti-lymphoma treatment or death due to any 
cause. If a patient has not received next anti-lymphoma treatment or did not die until the analysis 
cut-off date, he/she will be censored on the date of last contact. 
Kaplan Meier plots will be used to estimate the distribution of TTNT. The TTNT probabilities 
at 12 and 24 months, and the associate 95% CI will be summarized for each treatment arm. 
13.12.2.6 Overall Survival at 12 Months and 24 Months 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause and 
documented by the date of death.  
Kaplan Meier plots will be used to estimate the distribution of OS. The OS probabilities at 12 
and 24 months, and the associate 95% CI will be summarized for each treatment arm. 
13.12.3 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Tafasitamab serum concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Mean 
concentrations (on original and on log-linear scale) will be visualised in figures.  
13.12.4 Immunogenicity Analysis 
The absolute number and percentage of patients, who develop anti-tafasitamab antibodies, and 
the results of semi-quantitative anti-tafasitamab antibody titer determinations of confirmed 
positive samples will be tabulated.

13.14  Safety Analysis 
The primary and one of the secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of tafasitamab in addition to R-CHOP and tafasitamab plus Lenalidomide in 
addition to R-CHOP in adult patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL.  
All Safety Analysis will be presented by treatment arms and overall.  
Primary Endpoint: 
Incidence and severity of TEAEs. 
Treatment emergent adverse events are all adverse events which start after the first dose of 
study treatment until 30 days after day 21 of the last treatment cycle the patient started. 
Secondary Endpoint:  
Incidence and severity of AEs will be presented for patients in the study starting from 31st day 
after End of Treatment to the End of Study Visit.  
Note: At the time of primary completion analysis, all non-treatment emergent AEs collected  
(AEs prior to first dose of study drug administration and after 30 days of End of Treatment) 
will be listed.

  Page 98 of 117 13.14.1 Adverse Events 
All adverse events which start after the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after day 21 of 
the last treatment cycle the patient startedwill be considered as a treatment emergent adverse 
event (TEAE). Adverse events that start during the study but before the time of the first dose of 
study treatment (e.g. screening period) will be classified as a non-treatment emergent adverse 
event and will be included in adverse events listings, but will not be summarized. 
TEAEs will be coded according to MedDRA SOC and preferred terms. Incidence and frequency 
of all AEs will be summarised by SOC, preferred term, relationship to treatment, severity and 
seriousness. 
An AE summary table will be presented showing the number of events, number of subjects and 
the percentage of subjects in each arm and overall having: 
 All Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
 TEAEs by maximum severity 
 SAEs 
 Drug-related TEAEs  
 Drug-related TEAEs in each severity/toxicity grading 
 TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation 
 IRRs by grade. 
Adverse Events of Special Interests in this study are:  
 Infusion-related reactions ≥ grade 3 
 Cytokine release syndrome 
 Allergic reactions to tafasitamab ≥ grade 3 
 Second primary malignancies  
 PML 
 Hepatitis B reactivation 
 TLS 
The sponsor will describe AESIs, in addition to those reported as SAEs. AESI tabulations will 
be analogous to the tabulation of TEAEs. 
The sponsor will discuss other significant AEs as appropriate, e.g. laboratory abnormalities that 
qualify as AEs (other than those meeting the definition for serious) and any events that led to an 
intervention (including premature discontinuation of IMP, increase of dose interval, or 
significant additional concomitant therapy), in addition to those reported as SAEs. 
In addition to the investigator’s evaluation of normal or abnormal, the sponsor will internally 
evaluate each clinical laboratory result, vital sign result, and ECG result for whether it reflects 
a new abnormality , and for numeric data, whether it reflects a significant worsening  from 
baseline or an outlying result  or extreme value .  These terms are defined for clinical laboratory 
results, vital sign results, and ECG results as follows: 
 A new abnormality will be any abnormal post baseline result for a patient whose 
baseline was within normal limits. 
 A significant worsening will be any numeric clinical laboratory result, vital sign result, 
or ECG interval measurement that represents a change from baseline by 25% of the

  Page 99 of 117 baseline value, in the direction away from normal (i.e., in the direction that is clinically 
significant). 
 An outlying result for any numeric laboratory result, vital sign result, or ECG interval 
measurement will be any post-administration change from baseline that meets either of 
the following criteria: 
<25th Percentile - 1.5 * (interquartile range) OR 
>75th Percentile + 1.5 * (interquartile range). 
 An extreme value for any numeric laboratory result, vital sign result, or ECG interval 
measurement will be any post-administration change from baseline that meets either of 
the following criteria: 
<25th Percentile – 3 * (interquartile range) OR 
>75th Percentile + 3 * (interquartile range). 
Patients who demonstrate new abnormal results will be noted in data listings and reviewed by 
the sponsor. All results showing a significant worsening will be noted in data listings and 
reviewed by the sponsor. Outlying results or extreme values will be identified and reviewed in 
the context of the patient’s other abnormal results. 
13.14.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
The analysis of local laboratory parameters for each treatment arm will be presented, separated 
into blood parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation). All data collected in the 
course of the study will be listed. 
The following analyses will be performed, where appropriate, for measurements of hematology 
and blood chemistry tests: 
 Standard descriptive statistics for values measured at baseline and post-baseline visits 
including changes from baseline 
 For selected laboratory parameter, shifts in assessments from baseline to worst-post 
baseline value  
 Number (and percentage) of subjects with clinically notable changes for selected tests 
Each abnormal value measured in the local laboratory will be flagged to show whether it is a 
value below or above the reference range for the given local laboratory. For the assessment of 
laboratory variables, the investigator will need to judge their clinical significance. 
The assessment of the clinical relevance of central laboratory variables will be tabulated by time 
point for each clinical laboratory analyte using frequency tabulations.  
Clinical laboratory analytes with available NCI-CTCAE grades may be presented with additional 
frequency and shift tables based on these grades. 
 Laboratory values that are outside the reference range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with the corresponding reference ranges. 
The analyses will be performed on SAF. Further details will be specified in the SAP.

  Page 100 of 117 13.14.3 Vital Signs 
Descriptive summaries of actual values and changes from baseline will be calculated for vital 
signs. These summaries will be presented for the SAF at all time points. Each abnormal value 
will be flagged to show whether it is a value below or above the normal limit. 
13.14.4 Electrocardiograms 
Summary ECG assessment (categories: ‘normal’; ‘abnormal, clinically significant’; ‘abnormal, 
not clinically significant’) will be tabulated by time point using frequency tabulations. 
Each result of the 12-lead ECG (PR, QRS, RR and QT interval values) will be flagged to show 
whether it is a value below or above the normal limit. 
Summary statistics for all time points will be displayed for QT and both QTc correction methods. 
The Bazett’s correction method for QTc will be applied as follows: 
 Bazett’s:  QTcB = QT/ RR 
 Fridericia’s:  QTcF = QT/3RR 
Where relative rate (RR) = 60/heart rate 
Also, the number and percentage of subjects with QTc values above the normal limit (>450 ms, 
>480 ms, >500 ms) and the number and percentage of subjects who experienced a change ≥30 ms 
or a change ≥60 ms will be presented by time point.

    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 101 of 117 The investigator is responsible to provide oversight of the conduct of the study at their site. 
Investigators will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If the investigator feels a 
protocol amendment is necessary to improve the conduct of the study, such an amendment is 
required to be agreed upon by the sponsor and approved by the IEC/IRB and/or regulatory 
authorities as required prior to implementation. Notwithstanding the need for approval of 
protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the 
safety of any subject included in this trial, even if this action represents a deviation from the 
protocol. In such cases, the sponsor must be notified of this action, as well as the IEC/IRB and/or 
regulatory authorities as required. 
14.2.2 Patient Informed Consent 
The investigator or his/her representative is responsible to explain the nature of the study to the 
patient or his/her legally authorized representative and answer all questions regarding the study. 
Patients must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Patients or their legally authorized 
representative will be required to sign the informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study-
specific procedures being performed. The original ICF must be kept as part of the study records 
at the site, and a copy must be provided to the patients or their legally authorized representative. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation 
in the study. The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the patient’s 
source documents. 
14.2.3 Direct access to Source Data/ Documents 
The investigator has to give access to all relevant data and records to monitors, auditors, other 
designated agents of the sponsor, IEC/IRB, and regulatory authorities as required. Personal 
medical information will always be treated as confidential. If an inspection of the clinical site is 
requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform the sponsor immediately that 
this request has been made. 
14.2.4 Confidentiality Regarding Clinical Trial Patients 
Patients will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that 
any patient´s data that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; patient names 
or any information which would make the patient identifiable will not be transferred. 
 
14.2.5 Financial Disclosure 
Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial 
certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators and 
sub-investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.

Sponsor: MorphoSys AG                 Confidential             Protocol Number: MOR208C107   
    V6.0 of 5-FEB-2020  
 
  Page 102 of 117 be submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database in accordance with 
local regulations. 
14.4 Publication Policy 
Any presentation or publication of data from this trial will be intended as a joint publication by 
the investigator(s)/appropriate trial site personnel and appropriate sponsor personnel. Authorship 
will follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals and will be defined prior to the first publication. 
For multicentre studies, it is mandatory that the first publication be based on data from all centres, 
and that the data are analysed and submitted as stipulated in the protocol by a statistician assigned 
by the sponsor. 
Thus, no investigator or institution may publish any results of the trial conducted at their site, 
before such a first multicentre publication is made which covers the data from all sites. The 
authors have the final responsibility for the decision to submit their manuscript and shall be given 
full access to the data resulting from the trial. 
The coordinating investigator and/or authors shall coordinate any intended publication of trial 
results with the sponsor, to enable the sponsor to ensure that results are presented in a responsible 
and coherent manner. 
The sponsor reserves the right to review all manuscripts and abstracts at least 60 days before 
their submission for publication or presentation. This is not intended to restrict or hinder 
publication or presentation, but is to allow the sponsor to protect the confidentiality of 
information and to provide comments that may not yet be available to the investigator. 
At the sponsor’s request, any confidential information (other than trial results) will be deleted 
and all reasonable comments made by the sponsor will be incorporated prior to the submission 
for publication or presentation. In the rare event that such publication would affect the 
patentability of any invention to which the sponsor has rights, the sponsor has the right to request 
an additional delay to the proposed publication of no more than 90 days so as to allow the sponsor 
to protect its intellectual property rights. 
The results of the trial may be used by the sponsor for the purposes of national and international 
registration, publication, and information for medical professionals. If necessary, the authorities 
will be notified of the investigators’ names, addresses, qualifications, and extent of involvement.

Ann Arbor Staging 
Grade Description 
Stage I Involvement of a single lymph node region (I) or of a single extralymphatic 
organ or site (IE)a 
Stage II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions or lymphatic structures on the 
same side of the diaphragm alone (II) or with involvement of limited, 
contiguous extralymphatic organ or tissue (IIE) 
Stage III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III), which 
may include the spleen (IIIS) or limited, contiguous extralymphatic organ or 
site (IIIE), or both (IIIES) 
Stage IVb Diffuse or disseminated foci of involvement of one or more extralymphatic 
organs or tissues, with or without associated lymphatic involvement 
 
Note: All cases are subclassified to indicate the absence (A) or presence (B) of the systemic B 
symptoms of significant unexplained fever (> 38 0C), night sweats, or unexplained weight loss 
exceeding 10% of body weight during the 6 months prior to diagnosis. 
a The designation “E” generally refers to extranodal contiguous extension (i.e., proximal or 
contiguous extranodal disease) that can be encompassed within an irradiation field appropriate 
for nodal disease of the same anatomic extent. A single extralymphatic site as the only site of 
disease should be classified as IE, rather than Stage IV. 
b Involvement of bone marrow at screening will always qualify for Ann Arbor Stage IV and 
should be recorded as extranodal involvement.

Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2014) 
Target and Non-Target Lesions 
Up to six of the largest target nodes, nodal masses, or other lymphomatous lesions that are 
measurable in two diameters should be identified from different body regions representative of 
the patient’s overall disease burden and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease, if 
involved. At baseline, a measurable node must be greater than 15 mm in longest diameter (LDi). 
Measurable extranodal disease may be included in the six representative, measured lesions. At 
baseline, measurable extranodal lesions should be greater than 10 mm LDi. 
All other lesions (including nodal, extranodal, and assessable disease) should be followed as 
nonmeasured disease as non-target lesions (e.g. cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, 
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, bone, bone marrow). 
Split Lesions and Confluent Lesions 
Lesions may split or may become confluent over time. In the case of split lesions, the individual 
product of the perpendicular diameters (PPDs) of the nodes should be summed together to 
represent the PPD of the split lesion; this PPD is added to the sum of the PPDs of the remaining 
lesions to measure response. If subsequent growth of any or all of these discrete nodes occurs, 
the nadir of each individual node is used to determine progression. In the case of confluent 
lesions, the PPD of the confluent mass should be compared with the sum of the PPDs of the 
individual nodes, with more than 50% increase in PPD of the confluent mass compared with the 
sum of individual nodes necessary to indicate progressive disease. The LDi and smallest 
diameter (SDi) are no longer needed to determine progression.

a A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the time 
of an interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de-escalation is investigated, it may be 
preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment).  
Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions 
selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of 
the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non-nodal lesions 
include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), gastrointestinal involvement, cutaneous 
lesions, or those noted on palpation. Non-measured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured;

nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the 
requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which 
is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including 
pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that 
cannot be confirmed and followed by imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (e.g., GI tract, 
liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic 
response, but should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (e.g., with marrow 
activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).

areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.

Definition of Highly Effective, Effective and Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control and 
True Abstinence 
Highly effective birth control methods: Intrauterine device, hormonal methods (birth control 
pills, hormonal patches, injections, vaginal rings, or implants), tubal ligation, partner's 
vasectomy 
True abstinence: 
True abstinence is part of the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence 
for the duration of exposure to the investigational product, and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. 
Additional effective birth control methods : male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, 
cervical cap 
Unaccaptable methods of birth control  are progesterone-only "mini-pills", IUD Progeserone T, female condoms, natural family planning (rhythm method)or breastfeeding, fertility 
awareness, withdrawal, and cervical shield (A cervical shield should not be confused with a 
cervical cap, which is an effective mehtod of contraception)

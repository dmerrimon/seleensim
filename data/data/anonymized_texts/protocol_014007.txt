STUDY NAME: EXPEDITION 
TITLE An exploratory, randomized, double-b lind, placebo-controlled study of the 
effects of dupilumab on airway inflammation of adults with persistent asthma 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION North America and Europe 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 2a 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) Main Objective 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab, compared to placebo, on
airway inflammation in patients with persistent asthma. 
Additional Objective 
• To assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of dupilumabcompared to placebo. 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To explore the effects of dupilumab, compared to placebo, inpatients with persistent asthma on: 
- Pulmonary function and asthma control, 
- T-helper cell 2 (Th2)-associated biomarkers in peripheral blood  
• To explore the pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic relationship of
the inflammatory biomarkers. 
• To evaluate the relationship between the baseline characteristics of
patients (eg, demographics, clinical status, clinical lab values, 
biomarkers, and genetic profiles) and treatment responses. 
STUDY DESIGN • Phase 2a, multicenter, exploratory, randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled, parallel group study of repeated doses of
dupilumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in patients with
persistent asthma.
• During the study, patients will undergo 2 bronchoscopy proceduresfor the collection of bronchial biopsy, brushing and lavage samples
before treatment and at the end of the treatment period.
• Dupilumab is used as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)in combination with long-acting beta-agonists (LABA).
• The clinical trial consists of three parts:
- Screening  5 weeks (and potentially additional up to 7 days for
confirmation of eligibility or scheduling of bronchoscopy)   
- Randomized Treatment Period (12 weeks)
- Post-Treatment Period (12 weeks)  for patients not participating
in the open label extension study 
• Eligible patients, who complete the treatment period, including the
end-of-treatment assessments, will be offered the opportunity to 
participate in an open label extension (OLE) study with dupilumab.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 7 • RNA will be isolated from whole blood to evaluate baseline gene 
expression, including eosinophilic and type 2 / Th2-related genes. 
• Additional inflammatory cell c ounts in bronchial epithelium and 
submucosa and basement membrane thickness will be assessed by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC)/histology.  
• Inflammatory cell counts in BALF will be assessed at baseline and 
12 weeks. 
• Exploratory genetic analysis of blood deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).  
ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE See Section  1 for details 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: Approximately 42 patients will be randomiz ed to achieve 21 completers per 
group. The statistical power of the st udy is estimated based on the additional 
pharmacodynamics endpoint of FeNO as no historical data is available for the 
main endpoints of bronchial submuc osal inflammatory cells. With 
21 completers per group, the study will have an 80% power to detect a 
difference of 25 ppb in the change from baseline in FeNO at Week 12 
between SAR231893 and placebo, assuming a pooled SD of 32, and with a 
T-test at 1-sided alpha=0.05. 
A patient who received treatment and prematurely ends his/her treatment 
prior to Week 12 may be replaced in order to have a sufficient number of 
patients with adequate bronchial biopsies to assess the main endpoints. 
Analysis Population: 
Pharmacodynamics 
 
For the main PD endpoints in bronchial submucosa, the PD population will 
consist of all randomized patients who underwent baseline and 
Week12/end-of-treatment (EOT) bronc hoscopies and have adequate biopsies 
for analysis at both baseline and end-of-treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The PK population will consist of all patients in the safety population with at 
least one post dose, non-missing and elig ible serum concentration data. 
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. 
Safety  
All patients who were exposed to study treatment, regardless of the amount of 
treatment administered, will be included in the safety population.  
ADA 
The ADA population will consist of all patients in the safety population with at 
least one qualified ADA result in the ADA assay following the first dose of the 
study medication. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment 
actually received. 
Main Analysis: 
The main endpoints, change from baseline in the number of airway 
submucosal inflammatory cells per surf ace airway of basal lamina (cells/mm2) 
and mucin in the bronchial mucosa, will be analyzed by analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with fixed terms for treatment, stratification factors of region and ICS dose, and airway submucosal infla mmatory cells per surface airway of 
basal lamina (cells/mm
2) and mucin in the bronchial mucosa at baseline as

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 8 covariates. An estimate and two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the 
difference in treatment mean changes will be calculated from the model. No 
multiplicity adjustment will be made for the main analyses. 
Descriptive statistics will also be performed by treatment and timepoint on raw 
changes and percent changes from baseline. 
Analysis of additional endpoints Pharmacodynamics:
 
The additional PD endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the main analysis. 
Analysis of FeNO will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Dupilumab concentrations will be summari zed by timepoint with descriptive 
statistics and plotted over time. Anti-drug antibodies
 
Incidence of positivity in the ADA assay will be assessed as absolute 
occurrence (n) and percent of patients (%), presented by study treatment. 
Safety  
The safety analysis will be based on the review of descriptive statistics 
(summary tables) and individual data for adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory, vital signs and ECG parameters. Adverse events will be coded 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA), and the number 
of patients with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be summarized. Potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) for clinical 
laboratory, vital sign, and ECG data and out-of-normal range values for clinical laboratory data will be flagged and summarized in frequency tables. 
Analysis of exploratory endpoints 
Exploratory PD endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the main analysis. Associations between biomarker baseline characteristics and treatment 
outcome (as measured by FEV
1 and other efficacy endpoints) will be 
explored.  Composite biomarker scores  (eg, Th2-related biomarkers) may be 
explored as appropriate. Correlations between changes in biomarkers and 
treatment responses (as measured by FEV 1 and other efficacy endpoints) will 
be assessed. 
Descriptive statistics and, as appropriate, graphs will be provided for raw 
data, absolute changes and percent changes from baseline. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  Total study duration for each patient, is approximately 29 weeks. 
• Screening: maximum of 5 weeks.  
• Treatment period: 12 weeks. 
• Follow-up period: 12 weeks.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway 
hyperresponsiveness, acute and chronic bronchoco nstriction, airway edema, and mucus plugging. 
The inflammatory component of asthma invol ves many cell types, including mast cells, 
eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epit helial cells and their biological products.  
The poor response of some patients with asthma to the standard re gimen of controller and reliever 
therapies may reflect the number of cellular and molecular mechanisms operative in asthma. Recent therapeutic approaches in asthma have been focused on trying to control the Type 2/ T-helper cell-2 (Th2) response. Up-regulation of  the Th2 cell-derived cy tokines interleukin-4 
(IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13)  has been implicated as an important inflammatory component of 
asthma disease progression.  
Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody th at binds with high affinity to human IL-4R α, 
a subunit of heterodimeric IL-4 receptors (Type I and Type II) that mediates signaling by IL-4 
(both receptor types) and by IL-13 (Type II receptor). Dupilumab inhibits the downstream 
signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, thereby inhibitin g receptor-mediated activation of secondary 
messengers such as STAT6 and downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. 
While IL-4 and IL-13 have overlapping pleotr opic actions, IL-4 tends to predominate in 
modulating immune cell functions whereas IL-13 predominates in stimulation of tissues ( 1, 2, 3). 
IL-4 is a major mediator of the polarization of T helper cells toward the Th2 phenotype, ie, cells 
that secrete more exclusively IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 ( 4) and their proliferation. Th2 cytokines have 
a central role in stimulating secretion of chemotaxins that promote homing of Th2 cells, 
eosinophils and mast cells into  the respiratory epithelium ( 5). Surface immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
receptors on mast cells and eosinophils facilitate release of stored pro-inflammatory mediators 
from these cells through both allergen-dep endent and -independent mechanisms ( 6). Under 
conditions of asthmatic infla mmation, IL-4 and IL-13 prime mast cells, enhancing their 
responsiveness, in part by up-regulating surfac e receptors for IgE, and inducing the production 
and storage of cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13 ( 7). Th2 asthma is often associated with 
elevation in serum IgE and allergen sensitization (ie, atopy). IL-4 is recognized as the principle promoter of IgE class switching in B cells and is thus central to elevation in IgE and the 
sensitization of cells expressing IgE receptors ( 6). The various mediator s released by these 
sensitized cells during exposure to allergens are major contributors to airway hyper-
responsiveness and disease exacerbation. 
IL-13 promotes goblet cell hyperplasia and exce ss mucus production, characteristic of asthma ( 1). 
Epithelial basement membrane thickening is another feat ure of asthmatic inflammation, and a 
subset of asthma patients exhibit more extensive airway remodeling, characterized by 
subepithelial fibrosis, submucosal gland hyperplasia, increased airway smooth muscle mass, and 
increased airway vascularization, which results in thickening of the airway wall and luminal

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 22 narrowing ( 8). The preponderance of evidence indicat es that Th2 cytokines, more dominantly 
IL-13, have a central role in facilitating this remodeling.  They stimulate the secretion of several 
mediators thought contributory to tissue remodeling such as periostin, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), Pulmonary and Activated  Regulated Chemokine (PARC) and various 
growth factors. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL- 13 initiate the polarization of monocytes and 
macrophages toward the formation of so called “alternatively activated” M2a macrophages which 
promote the deposition of collagen and fibrosis ( 9). Thus, dupilumab has potential for preventing 
progression of airway remodeling in  patients with severe asthma. 
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease compri sed of several phenotypes and endotypes ( 10). 
Dupilumab is expected to substantially suppress airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with allergic/atopic asthma  and other forms of 
eosinophilic asthma, collectively known as Th2 asth ma, which represent roughly half the overall 
asthma population. The therapeutic effectivene ss of dupilumab across the breadth of asthma 
subpopulations will be  assessed during c linical trials.  
For complete information regarding the preclinical and clinical evaluation of dupilumab to date, see the Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.2 RATIONALE 
4.2.1 Study Rationale 
The initial clinical study of dupilumab in eo sinophilic asthma (ACT11457) and the dose-ranging 
study (DRI12544) in a broader population with pers istent asthma both showed treatment-related 
suppression of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and IL-4-/IL-13-dependent biomarkers in 
peripheral blood. The current study is designed to  more directly invest igate the effects of 
dupilumab on underlying mechanisms of inflammation in the asthmatic airway utilizing 
bronchoscopy.  
In ACT11457, 104 patients with m oderate-to-severe asthma in adequately controlled with 
medium-to-high dose combination inhaled cortic osteroids (ICS) / long-acting beta-agonists 
(LABA) (fluticasone/salmeterol, budesonide/formoterol, or mome tasone/formoterol) and with 
blood eosinophils >300 cells/µ L (101 patients) or sputum eosinophils >3% (3 patients) were 
studied. Patients were sw itched to fluticasone/salmeterol at Day 1 for 4 weeks, after which 
background therapy was reduced systematically. The primary endpoint was the incidence of 
asthma exacerbations after 12 weeks. An 87% (p<0.0001) relative reduction in asthma 
exacerbations was observed after 12-week treatme nt with dupilumab (5.8%) vs placebo (44.2%).  
In the Phase 2b study (DRI12544), different doses and regimens of dupilumab (up to 300 mg 
every 2 weeks [q2w] with a loading dose of 600 mg) have been evaluated in patients with 
moderate to severe, uncontrolled asthma. All patie nts received a stable dose of medium to high 
ICS/LABA in addition to their study treatment (placebo or dupilumab). An interim analysis (dated 
02 November 2014) was performed after the last patients completed their Week 12 assessments. 
At the time of the interim repor t, 776 patients had been enrolled in the study and 731 patients had 
completed the 12-week study period. Results from the interim analysis indicated significant improvements, compared with placebo, in the chan ge from baseline forced expiratory volume in

q2w. In addition, the majority of main secondary efficacy results (annualized rates of severe 
exacerbation and loss of asthma control  events, and changes from baseline at Week 12 in morning and evening asthma symptom scores , ACQ-5 scores, AQLQ scores, morning and 
evening peak expiratory flow [PEF], and Sinona sal Outcomes Test 22-item scale total scores) 
demonstrated statistically significant differences (not adjusted for multiplicity) in favor of dupilumab compared with placebo across the treat ment comparisons, especially for the q2w 
dosing regimens. A final analysis for 24 weeks of treatment demonstrated a sustained therapeutic 
effect. 
In addition, the effects of dupilumab on several ph armacodynamic and Th2-associated biomarkers 
were evaluated in the ACT11457 and DRI12544 studi es. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), 
a quantitative method to measure airway infla mmation, decreased in dupilumab-treated patients 
and remained suppressed through the end of treatment. Seru m levels of the Th2-associated 
chemokines, Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC) and eotaxin-3, remained 
unchanged with placebo, whereas, with dupilumab, circulating TARC and eota xin-3 levels rapidly 
decreased and remained significantly lower than baseline values throughout the dupilumab 
treatment. Serum total IgE also significantly decreased during dupilumab treatment. Thus, decreased levels of the biomarkers FeNO, eotaxi n-3, TARC, and total IgE confirmed the biologic 
activity of dupilumab and suggest that dupilumab is impacting Th2-mediated airway inflammation. The current study has been designed  to more directly evaluate the effect of 
dupilumab on the Th2 response and inflammation within the lung through bronchoscopy 
sampling. 
The current study will directly assess airway inflammatory biomarkers in bronchial biopsies, 
brushings and alveolar lavage fluid and furt her correlate these assessments with various 
biomarkers in peripheral blood a nd breath and with the overall clin ical condition of the patients. 
We now hypothesize that dupilumab, by reducin g the production of potent chemotaxins, will 
decrease the numbers of mast cells, eosinophils, to tal T lymphocytes and T-helper lymphocytes in 
the bronchial submucosa. Dupilumab, by controlling inflammation, as further evidenced by a reduction in FeNO, will result in a decrease in mucin in the mucosa, which reflects the excess production of mucus characteristic of asthma.   Ex ploratory analyses may show further changes in 
inflammatory cells in the bronchial epithelium and reversal of basement membrane thickening associated with asthma.  Shifts in the transcri ptome in the mucosa, biops ies, and bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) cells, particularly in Th2 signature genes, mucin genes, and genes related to mast 
cells and eosinophils, may reflect the overall imp act of dupilumab on underlying inflammatory 
processes.  
4.2.2 Population rationale 
In this placebo-controlled study, dupilumab will be added-on to standard of care asthma therapy (minimum of an inhaled corticosteroid in combin ation with LABA) in patients with persistent 
asthma.  Patients requiring a thir d asthma controller are eligible. The population is comprised of 
patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma for ≥12 months, based on the Global Initiative for 
Asthma (GINA) 2015 Guidelines (11) and entry criteria described in Section  7.  A similar patient 
population is being evaluated in the asthma Phase 3 clinical trial (EFC13579) because in addition to suffering the symptoms associated with a lack of asthma control, such patients utilize a

and may suffer the long term adverse effects of systemic and inhale d corticosteroids.  
In this small exploratory study, to better evaluate the effects of dupilumab on airway 
inflammation, the study population will be enrich ed for patients with evidence of ongoing 
inflammation based on eleva tion in FeNO levels ( ≥26 ppb; upper limit of normal ( 12)). In 
addition, due to the bronchoscopy procedures in this  study, additional restri ctions will be in place 
for patients’ safety, as detailed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section  7), including more 
restrictive requirements for age and FEV 1 criteria, as compared to the asthma Phase 3 clinical 
trial.  
4.2.3 Design Rationale  
PDY14192 is an exploratory, randomized, double-b lind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. 
The clinical trial uses an add-on therapy approach to inhaled corticosteroid in combination with 
LABA. Patients requiring a third controller for their asthma will be considered eligible for this study.  
After a screening period (5 weeks with optional additional up to 7 days) patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following 12 week-treatments: 
• Dupilumab 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w).  
• Placebo q2w with placebo loading dose.  
During the Randomized Treatment Period, patients continue the stab le (or equivalent) dose of an 
allowable combination product. The End-Of-Treatme nt (EOT) is designated as 2 weeks after the 
last dose of dupilumab. 
Patients treated with placebo will serve as an inactive control group, to more clearly establish the 
effects attributed to dupilumab.  
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic 2 weeks after the last treatment dose for the EOT assessments, with the exception of the bronchoscopy procedure, and then  participate in follow-up assessments in the 
Post Treatment Period as indicat ed in the visit schedule (see Section  1.2 and Section  10.3.4).   
Eligible patients, who complete  the treatment period, including the EOT assessments, will be 
offered the opportunity to participate in an op en label extension (OLE) study with dupilumab. 
Patients subsequently enrolled in the OLE will not participate in the Post Treatment Period of this trial. 
Patients not participating in the OLE will enter a Post Treatment Period immediately after the 
EOT visit (2 weeks after the last treatment dose), or otherwise after premature treatment 
discontinuation, and will be evalua ted for an additional 12 weeks. The Post Treatment Period is 
designed to monitor patients on their background controller medication alone after discontinuation 
of the blinded treatment. During this follow-up pe riod, patients continue trea tment with the stable 
background dose of their background controller medica tion or their asthma treatment as modified 
based on medical judgment.

PDY14192 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 25 4.2.4 Dose Rationale  
The dose regimen of subcutaneous (SC) dupilumab selected for this study is the highest dosing 
regimen that will be tested in the Phase 3 clini cal trial - 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w). All patients 
randomized to receive treatment with dupiluma b will get an initial loading dose of 600 mg on 
Day 1. The administration of the loading dose of dupilumab will allow systemic concentrations to 
reach steady-state faster, and potentially reduce the time to onset of clinical effect. 
Proof of concept for efficacy was established in the ACT11457 phase 2a study at 300 mg weekly 
for 12 weeks, which was generally well tolerated. The study showed unprecedented efficacy in a 
population of mostly severe asth matics with poor asthma control and decreased lung function at 
baseline while on treatment with mostly high doses of ICS in combination with a LABA. In the subsequent phase 2b dose-ranging study, interim analysis at 12 weeks has shown the rapid effects of dupilumab on FEV
1 and FeNO which plateaued by Week 12 following repeated treatment.  The 
treatment response was also obser ved to approach the maximal e ffect at 300 mg q2w regimen. 
4.2.5 Endpoint Rationale 
Commensurate with the hypothesis that dupilumab will overall suppre ss asthmatic airway 
inflammation, several endpoints have been selected for this  exploratory clinical study.  
First, changes from baseline in the inflammatory cells most consistently characteristic of asthmatic inflammatory infiltrat es, namely eosinophils, mast cells, total T-lymphocytes and 
T-helper cells, will be assessed in the submucosa of bronchial biopsies. In a clinical trial with omalizumab in allergic asthma, these inflammatory cell types were evaluated by bronchial biopsies and demonstrated a response to treatment ( 13).  
Bronchial biopsies afford a direct assessment of the effects of dupilumab on bronchial inflammation. Inflammatory cell in filtration can occur in the mucosal, submucosal and smooth 
muscle layers, but most abundantly in the submucosa. During asthmatic inflammation, 
eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, including IL-4 expressing subpopulations within each of 
these cell types, are all increased in bronchial biopsies from atopic asthmatic patients compared with healthy control subjects. Assessmen t of the abundance of these cells using 
immunohistochemistry or other staining techniques will characterize the type of inflammation and 
quantify the effects of dupilumab on immune cell infiltration. 
In addition, the reported dependence of goblet  hyperplasia and mucus production on IL-4R α 
mediated mechanisms suggests that dupilumab will markedly suppress mucin in the bronchial 
epithelium of asthmatic patients; therefore, the abundance of mucin in the mucosa will be 
quantified.   
4.2.6 Risk assessment 
In terms of safety, there are no significant safety findings based on curr ent available data and 
dupilumab has been generally well tolerated in all clinical trials completed in healthy volunteers 
and in patient populations, including those with  atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and chronic 
sinusitis with nasal polyposis. Local injection site reactions have been observed as the most 
frequent treatment emergent adve rse event (TEAE) in studies conducted in healthy subjects. The

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 26 adverse event profile observed in  the completed and the ongoing study in patients with AD is 
consistent with the profile observed in the studies in asthma patients. The most frequent TEAEs in 
both AD and asthma patient studies were in the sy stem organ classes (SOCs) of Infections and 
Infestations (preferred term [PT]: nasopharyngitis),  Nervous System Disorder (PT: headache), and 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (high level term [HLT]: injection site reactions). Based on the results of the recently completed dose-ranging study in patients with AD 
(study R668-AD-1021) and of the interim analysis  of the dose-ranging study in patients with 
asthma (study DRI12544), injection site reactions appear to be the pr imary dose-dependent TEAE 
related to dupilumab trea tment, while nasopharyngitis and headach e appear to be balanced across 
treatment groups including placebo. A fe w TEAEs were observed more often in 
dupilumab-treated patients in individual studies wit hout contributing to a pattern for a particular 
dose or underlying disease; these TEAEs includ e nasopharyngitis, headache, oral herpes/herpes 
simplex, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and influenza. The majority of the TEAEs were 
mild-to-moderate in intensity. 
In summary, the safety data observed so far in completed and currently ongoing studies in AD and 
asthma patients (at the same or even higher doses than that proposed for this study) have 
demonstrated a positive profile for dupilumab in comparison to placebo.  
Bronchoscopy 
Bronchoscopy will be performed prior to treatment (during screening) and at the end of treatment 
to allow assessment of the effects of dupilumab within the lung and provide a mechanistic 
understanding of the response to dupilumab in asthma.  The risks of bronchoscopy include discomfort and coughing (which will be reduced through local anesthetics), wheezing (which can be reduced by premedication with beta-agonist), reduced oxygen (which will be monitored and treated as needed during the procedure), minor bl eeding, infection and fever. Pneumothorax is a 
rare complication of bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopies will be performed at experienced centers with established standard operating procedures.  Prior to the procedure, the investigator will confirm patient suitability by evaluating the patient’s current lung function (eg, FEV
1), oxygen saturation 
and asthma control.  In addition, prior to the procedure, the investigator will perform assessments, such as coagulation tests and platelets, to confirm suitability as well as any other assessments, such as a chest X-ray, at the investigator’s discretion.  Patients will be monitored after the 
procedure for at least one hour to allow detec tion and treatment of any complications. Another 
major risk of doing bronchoscopy in patients with asthma is inducing an asthma exacerbation. Because of this patients will receive prednisone/prednisolone  for 3 to 5 days after the 
bronchoscopy to prevent procedure-induced asthma exacerbations.  
4.2.7 Specific parameters rationale 
Main Endpoints 
Eosinophils, mast cells, total T-lymphocytes and T-helper lymphocytes will be counted in the 
bronchial submucosa of biopsy thin sections using quantitative histology and/or 
immunohistochemistry and reported as the num ber of cells per square millimeter.  
Goblet cell hyperplasia and increased production of mucin, features of asthmatic inflammation, 
will also be assessed histologically.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 27 Additional Endpoints 
Percent eosinophils in bronchoa lveolar lavage fluid (BALF) : 
Th2 mechanisms are recognized as drivers of  eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. 
Assessment of eosinophilic infl ammation during asthma studies  is routinely achieved by 
conducting cytological examinations  of bronchoalveolar lavage flui d or sputum and reporting the 
eosinophils as a percentage of total cells counted. 
FeNO : 
Nitric oxide (NO) is produced in the airway epithelium as a result of NO synthases, the activity of 
which is upregulated during inflammation. FeNO is  an accepted measure of airway inflammation 
for which clinically meaningful changes have been defined ( 12). Use of FeNO measurements has 
been recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) for the monitoring of asthmatic inflammation ( 12). FeNO can be readily performed in a standardized and quantitative manner 
using a convenient hand-held device ( 12). During previous studies, a significant suppression of 
FeNO was observed when dupilumab treatment was added onto ICS/LABA maintenance therapy.  
Exploratory endpoints: 
Bronchial biopsy histology 
 
In addition, thickening of the respiratory subepithelial membrane is a common histological 
finding in asthma.  The mechanism of this me mbrane thickening is not well understood, however, 
IL-4 and IL-13 are known to stimulate secretion of  growth factors and to  promote transformation 
of monocytes and macrophages into cell phe notypes that secrete collagen and promote 
remodeling. Therefore, dupilumab treatment has potential for slowing or reversing epithelial membrane thickening. 
Goblet cell hyperplasia and increased production of mucin, features of asthmatic inflammation, 
will also be assessed histologically. 
Bronchial biopsy RNA analysis:
 
Bronchial brushings collected during bronchoscopy will constitute a more selective sampling of 
the respiratory mucosa which is comprised of primarily goblet cells and ciliated epithelial cells.  
Bronchoalveolar lavage cell RNA analysis:  
Cells harvested from BALF are predominantly macrophages with lesser numbers of eosinophils, 
neutrophils and lymphocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated Th2 polariz ation of inflammatory 
cells in sputum from asthma patients.  The current study will further explore this polarization in 
BALF cells. In a milieu dominated by IL-4, macro phages should in principle be polarized toward 
an M2a phenotype that overexpresses growth f actors and may promote airway remodeling. 
Dupilumab should suppress the expr ession of markers associated with M2a polarization, as well 
as other markers of IL-4 α driven processes in BAL cells.

All patients will be evaluated at baseline and at EOT with a multiallergen-specific IgE panel, 
specific to global region for environmental allergens, which includes Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SAE) A & B IgE for all regions. This panel will be used to classify patients as atopic and, as 
quantitative tests to assess shifts in allergen-specific IgE titers during treatment. SAE IgE is 
associated with severe asthma, a diminished FEV
1 and higher intake of oral glucocorticosteroids 
and hospitalization due to asthma exacerbations. Enterotoxins generated by S. aureus can act both as nominal antigens, stimulating specific IgE responses, and as superantigens, promoting a polyclonal IgE response reflected by an increase in total IgE levels.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) (IMP) 
8.1.1 Dupilumab 
Sterile dupilumab will be provided in 150 mg/mL in glass pre-f illed syringe to deliver 300 mg in 
2 mL. 
8.1.2 Placebo 
Sterile placebo for dupilumab will be provided in identically matched glass pre-filled syringe to 
deliver 2 mL. 
8.1.3 Preparation of investigational product 
Dupilumab or matching placebo in glass pre-filled syringes will be supplied to the investigational 
site. Additional information will be provided in the Pharmacy manual. 
8.1.4 Dosing schedule 
The IMP is administered every 14 ± 3 days (q2w).  The doses of investigational product must be 
separated by ≥11 days to avoid an overdose.  
The IMP will be administered at the clinical site  following clinic procedures and blood collection. 
Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each study-site administered 
investigational product administra tion for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction.   
Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the 4 quadrants of the abdomen 
(avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs or  the upper arms, so that the same site is not 
injected twice consecutively. This instruction pertains to the day that the loading dose is injected as well as the administration of q2w injections . For each injection, the anatomic site of 
administration will be recorded in the electronic case report form (e-CRF). 
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.2.1 Inhaled corticosteroid in combination with LABA 
On a daily basis throughout the study, the patient uses an electronic diary to record daily use of 
ICS in combination with LABA. The controller dr ugs will not be dispensed or supplied by the 
sponsor.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 38 8.2.1.1 Screening period 
Prior to screening, patients must be on a stable  background therapy of a medium to high dose of 
ICS ( ≥250 mcg of fluticasone propionate twice daily or equipotent ICS daily dosage to a 
maximum of 2000 mcg/day of fluticasone propion ate or equivalent) in combination with a 
long-acting beta agonist [LABA] for at  least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to 
Visit 1. Patients requiring a third controller are allowed to participate in this study. The third 
controller should also be used for at  least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to  
Visit 1(patients requiring oral st eroids as controller medication or biologics are excluded). If 
patients take two different ICS, the total daily dose of ICS should be calculated to evaluate the 
eligibility criteria on daily dose of ICS which will be still considered as one controller. Please refer to medium and high dose of ICS in  Appendix B . Please note that the dose of ICS means the 
delivered dose from inhaler. For example, 110 mc g of fluticasone propionate MDI could deliver 
125 mcg of fluticasone propionate, and 125 mcg w ill be used to calculate the ICS dose for 
eligibility.  
If the Study Investigator based on their medical judgment, decides to optimize use of asthma 
medications prior to Visit 1 irrespective of potential participation in the study, note that changes in ongoing asthma medications must occur at least 1 month prior to Visit 1. The introduction of new 
controller medications must occur at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 with a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1. 
8.2.1.2 Randomized treatment period 
During this period, patients will continue to take  their controller medication(s) used during the 
screening period. The dose and regimen should not be changed. Only a transient increase in dose of ICS in addition to other rescue medication will be allowed to treat acute symptoms of asthma as per investigator's guidance. This will be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.2.1.3 Post-treatment period 
Upon completing the randomized treatment period, pa tients not continuing with the open label 
extension will proceed to be treated with the controller medication reg imen and dose used during 
the randomized treatment period, wh ich could be adjusted based on the medical judgment of the 
investigator of the patients’  asthma control status.  
8.2.2 Albuterol or levalbuterol reliever medication 
The reliever medication will not be dispensed or supplied by the sponsor. 
Patients may administer albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol MDI as reliever 
medication as needed during the study. Nebulizer so lutions may be used as an alternative delivery 
method.  
All other reliever medications rather than albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol 
should be avoided.

After the bronchoscopy procedure, patients will receive prednisone/prednisolone 40 mg po daily 
for 3 days.  Treatment may be extended up to a total of 5 days if clinically indicated.  If a patient 
requires treatment with prednisone /prednisolone for more than 5 days after the first bronchoscopy, 
the patient will not be included in the study due to the bronchoscopy requirement at the  end-of-treatment. 
Prednisone/prednisolone w ill not be dispensed or supplied by the sponsor. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
Dupilumab and placebo will be provided in identically matched 2.25 mL pre-filled syringes. To 
protect the blind, each treatment kit of 2.25 mL (dupilumab / placebo) glass pre-filled syringes 
will be prepared such that the treatments (dup ilumab and its matching placebo according to its 
dose) are identical and indistinguishable and will be labeled with a treatment kit number.  The randomized treatment kit number list will be generated by Sanofi.     
Study patients, Investigators, and study site pe rsonnel will not have access to the randomization 
(treatment codes) except under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected adverse drug  reaction unblinding by the Sponsor. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by calling any other 
phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpos e.  If the blind is broken, the Investigator 
should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking.   Patient withdrawal will only occur when the code break call is made at the site level, not the study 
level. This means that if the Emergency Unblindi ng transaction is performed by the investigator 
(ie, at the site level), then the patient will be withdrawn from treatment. However, if the 
Emergency Unblinding transaction is performed by  the Global Safety Officer (GSO) (ie, at the 
study level, as the GSO is not site based), then the patient will not be withdrawn from treatment. 
At the facilities where the systemic drug concentration measurements, anti-drug antibodies and 
selected biomarkers are determined, the samples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to unblinding of responsible bioa nalysts. Bioanalysts are exclude d from the clinical trial team.

antigen-specific IgE, total IgE, Eosinophil Cationic Protein (ECP), TARC and periostin while the 
study is ongoing, as the related data are not esse ntial for patient care a nd have the potential for 
unblinding. 
The Data Monitoring Committee will receive blinded by treatment group or unblinded (if 
necessary) confidential reports from an independent  statistician for review , which have to be 
handled strictly confidentially. None of these reports can be delivered to unauthorized persons. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by Sanofi. The investigational 
product (dupilumab or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list. 
The Sanofi Clinical Supplies team will provide the randomized treatment kit number list and the 
Study Biostatistician will provide  the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment 
allocation system. This centralized treatment allocation system will generate the patient 
randomization list according to which it will a llocate the treatments to the patients. 
Patients who meet the entry crite ria will be randomized to receive  either dupilumab or placebo.  
Patients who failed screening for transient entry criteria may be re-screened once more if the study enrolment is still open; a different patient identification will be issued. Re-screening is not permitted if the patient failed screening after baseline bronchoscopy was already performed. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen-failure date and the re-screening 
date. The IVRS/IWRS report will flag re-screened patients. Patients that are re-screened must sign 
a new consent form and all Vis it 1 procedures must be repeat ed unless a prior assessment is 
performed within the time frame permitted prior to study entry. 
The Investigator obtains treatment kit numbers at  randomization and subse quent scheduled visits 
via an IVRS/IWRS that will be available 24 hours a day.   Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 rando mization ratio for dupilumab 300 mg q2w and  
placebo q2w in 2 mL. Randomization will be stratified by ICS dose (medium and high) and 
region (North America and Europe). 
A randomized patient is defined as  a patient who is registered a nd assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A 
patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
Dupilumab and placebo will be supp lied as one glass pre-filled syri nge packed in a patient kit 
box.  Both glass pre-filled syringe and box will be labeled.  
Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements.

All investigational products shoul d be stored at a temperature between 2°C and 8°C in an 
appropriate, locked room under the responsibility of the Investigator  or other authorized persons 
(eg, pharmacists) in accordance with lo cal regulations, policies and procedures.  
Control of investigational pr oduct storage conditions, especially control of temperature 
(eg, refrigerated storage) and information on in-use stability and instructions for handling the IMP 
should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be reco rded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to r ecall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator suppl y IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical tria l protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
The Investigator or pharmacist will also keep accurate records of the quantities of the IMP dispensed, used and unused. The IMP tracking log and inventory form is to be updated each time investigational product is dispensed. The study m onitor will periodically check the supplies of the 
IMP held by the Investigator or pharmacist to verify accountability. 
Treatment kit number has to be recorded on the appropriate page of the e-CRF and also on the 
IMP tracking log and inventory log form.  An electronic diary is used by the patient for the daily recording of salbutamol/albuterol or 
levosalbutamol/levoalbuterol use as well as daily combination product ICS/LABA use and 
recording of oral steroids use after bronchoscopy  and in case of an exacerbation event. Site 
personnel will review and download the eDiary data  at each clinic visit and will follow up with 
the patient accordingly.

For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor, tracking and reconciliation has to be achieved by the 
Investigator and must be captured in standard site documents and records (eg, medical notes). 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
All used, partially-used or unused  treatments will be re trieved by the Sponsor or destroyed at 
study site. 
The IMP tracking log and inventory form will be used by the Investigator (or the pharmacist) to 
document destroyed IMP. The form will be countersi gned by the Investigator and the monitoring 
team. The Investigator will not destroy the unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written 
authorization.  
For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor, tracking and reconciliation has to be achieved by the 
Investigator and must be captured in standard site documents and records (eg, medical notes). 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient  concomitantly to any IMP(s). 
8.8.1 Prohibited Concomitant Medication 
The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during the Screening Period or the 
Randomized Treatment Period: 
• Systemic steroids (steroids can only be used  to treat an asthma exacerbation and after 
bronchoscopy as described in Section  8.2.3). 
• Anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy (eg, omalizumab). 
• Biologic therapy. 
• Immunosupressant. 
• Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (except for a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker initiated more than 3 months prior to Visit 1 with stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1).

• Selective beta-1 adrenergic re ceptor blockers, if patient ha s been on a stable dose for at 
least 3 months prior to Visit 1. 
8.8.3 CYP substrates  
The impact of dupilumab on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity has not been studied and 
the effect of dupilumab on levels of IL-4 and IL-13 has not been fully characterized. However, 
interleukin-4 (IL-4) was re ported to upregulate CYP2E1, 2B6, 3A4 mRNA expression or 
downregulate CYP1A2 mRNA ( 14, 15). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
incubated with various Th2 cyt okines showed that IL-4 and IL-13 increased mRNA expression of 
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 ( 16).  Since the clinical significance of the limited in vitro findings for 
IL-4 and IL-13 involvement in CYP regulation and the impact of dupilumab on CYP enzymes are 
not fully understood, during the study treatment and at least up to the end of follow-up, caution should be used for drugs which are metabolized vi a these CYP isoforms and which have a narrow 
therapeutic index.  This means that close clinic al observation and/or laboratory monitoring as 
applicable are required in order to enable early detection of toxic manife stations or lack of 
activity/efficacy of these drugs, followed by dose adjustment or their withdrawal if needed. Some 
examples of CYP450 substrates with na rrow therapeutic indices are provided in Appendix C .

9.1 MAIN ENDPOINT 
9.1.1 Main Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
There are multiple main pharmacody namic endpoints in this exploratory study.  These endpoints 
will be assessed on bronchial biopsies taken at baseline and the end of treatment (12 weeks) and 
include the following: 
• Change from baseline in numbers of the follo wing inflammatory cells in the bronchial 
submucosa (per square millimeter) at 12 weeks: 
- Eosinophils, 
- Mast cells, 
- Total T-lymphocytes, 
- T-helper lymphocytes. 
• Change from baseline in mucin-stained area in the bronchial mucosa (per square 
millimeter) at 12 weeks.  - Mucin will be identified by staining with Alcian-blue periodic acid-Schiff and/or 
immunostaining for MUC5AC and then the mu cin-positive area will be measured and 
expressed per square millimeter. 
9.2 ADDITIONAL ENDPOINTS 
9.2.1 Additional Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
• Absolute and relative change from baseline in FeNO at 12 weeks. 
• Absolute and relative change from baseline in the average FeNO from 6 to 12 weeks.  
9.2.1.1 Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide  
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) will be analyzed using a NIOX instrument (Aerocrine AB, 
Solna, Sweden), or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s, and reported in parts per billion 
(ppb). This assessment should be c onducted prior to spirometry and following a fast of at least 
1 hour. Further details on the procedure for meas uring exhaled nitric oxide with NIOX will be 
provided in a separate instruction manual. FeNO will be performed at multiple times during the study as specified in the study flowchart ( Section  1.2).  
Treatment effect on FeNO will be assessed at the end of treatment (12 weeks) as both an absolute 
and relative change from baselin e.  In addition, FeNO will be assessed at multip le time points 
during the treatment period and the change from baseline in average FeNO from 6 to 12 weeks 
will be assessed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 45 9.2.2 Safety endpoints  
The same safety assessments will be applied across all arms.  Adverse events, including serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI), will be collected at every visit. The Investigator will ask the patient how he/s he has felt since the last study visit. The study 
specific and general safety criteria are detailed in Section  10.4. To assure the continuing safety of 
patients in this study, an inde pendent DMC will be responsible fo r reviewing the safety data on a 
periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in  Section  6.4.1.  
Safety observations 
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure  the safety of the patients. 
Notably, he/she should follow up the outcome of SAEs /AESI until c linical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal or until progression has been stabilized or death. In all cases, this may imp ly that observations will continue beyond the 
last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investiga tions may be requested by the 
Sponsor. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient. 
• In case of any SAE/AESI with immediate notification brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her to be caused by the investiga tional product with a reasonable possibility, this should be 
reported to the Sponsor. 
9.2.2.1 Adverse events 
Adverse events for each patient will be monitored and documented from the time the patient gives informed consent at Visit 1 until the End-of Study Visit or till the rollover to the extension study except for SAEs and AESIs.  
Adverse events, adverse events with special inte rest (AESI) and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
will be reported as described in Section  10.4. 
Refer to Section  10.4 to Section  10.7 for details. 
9.2.2.2 Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood anal ysis (including hematolo gy, clinical chemistry 
and serology) and urinalysis. Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion into 
standard international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. 
The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by an accredited (Co llege of American Pathologists 
or equivalent) central laborato ry with national and regional c linical licenses as required for 
diagnostic testing and must provide evidence of  participation in proficiency testing, as 
appropriate. After reviewing the la boratory report and evaluating any results that are outside the 
normal range, the Investigator must sign and date the laboratory repor t. Abnormal laboratory 
values that are considered to be clinically signif icant by the Investigator must be repeated as soon

laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal or until an etiology of the 
persistent abnormalit y is determined. 
Refer to Section  1.2 Study Flow Chart for the description of  the clinical laboratory evaluations 
and the schedule of laboratory evaluati ons performed throughout this study. 
The clinical laboratory testing  parameters that will be measured are: 
• Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet co unt, total white blood cell count with 
five-part differential count (neutrophils , eosinophils, basophils, monocytes and 
lymphocytes), and total red blood cell count. 
• Coagulation:  Prothrombin time, par tial thromboplastin time (PTT) at Visit 1 only 
• Serum chemistry:  creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucos e, uric acid, total cholesterol, 
total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, 
differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
electrolytes (sodium, potassium , chloride), bicarbonate, and creatine phosphokinase. The 
blood sample must be ta ken with the patient in fasting state which means no intake of any 
food or drink except for water for at least 8 hours. (If the visit can only be done during the 
day and the patient is not unde r fasting conditions, the patient  should eat light food and the 
site should document that serum chemistr y is not taken under fasting conditions). 
• Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)  at Visit 1 for all patients a nd at Visit 8 only for patients 
planned to participate in the OLE. Note: An ti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA is 
positive ( ≥1:160 titer). 
Other laboratory safety testing that will be measured includes: 
• Urinalysis:  Urine dipstick analysis including specifi c gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood, 
protein, nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen and bilirubin. A quantitative 
measurement for glucose, protein, erythrocytes, and leucocytes will be performed in the event that the urine dipstick is positive for any of the above parameters. If the urine 
dipstick is positive for proteins, a microscopic analysis will be performed.  
• Virus serology testing:  (at Visit 1 for all patients and at  Visit 8 only for patients planned 
to participate in the OLE)  hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb [total and IgM]) and hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCV Ab), HIV screen (An ti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies). Patients who 
are Total-HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative at Visit 1 must undergo HBV DNA testing prior to randomization to determine eligibility. In case of results showing HCV Ab 
positive, HCV RNA testing must be perform ed prior to randomization to determine 
eligibility. At Visit 8, the follow-up testing noted above (HBV DNA or HCV RNA) must 
be done as needed to determine eligibility for the OLE study. Refer to Table 1  for 
eligibility interpretation of hepatitis serology results.

position using the same arm at each visit, and will be measured prior to receiving investigational 
product at the clinic visits.  Body temperature ma y be measured as oral or auricular, but at a 
clinical site, temperature must be measured consistently with the same method throughout the 
study. Refer to Section  1.2 Study Flow Chart for the schedule of vital signs performed throughout 
this study. 
9.2.2.4 Oxygen saturation 
On Visits 2 and 9, oxygen saturation will be measured by pulse oximetry before the bronchoscopy procedure to ensure patient suitability (See Section  10.1.2 and Section  10.1.10).  The  
pre-bronchoscopy oxygen saturation (%) will be recorded in the eCRF. In addition, during and 
after the bronchoscopy procedure, the patient’s oxygen saturation will be monitored for safety, as per the clinical site’s standard procedures.  
9.2.2.5 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations will include an assessment of general appearance, skin, eyes, ear/nose/throat, heart, chest,  abdomen, reflexes, lymph nodes, spine and extremities.  All 
deviations from normal will be recorded, including those attributable to the patient’s disease. Refer to Section  1.2 for the schedule of physical examina tions performed throughout this study.

A minimum of 3 complexes in an appropriate lead (lead II) will be averaged to determine the 
PR-interval, QT/QTc-interval, QRS-complex and heart rate will be measured for each ECG.   
The investigator should review the ECG and docu ment his/her interpreta tion signed and dated on 
the ECG print out.  The original trace is kept as source data.  Electrocardiogram tracings are also 
read manually by independent, certified and “ centralized” cardiologists, who determine ECG 
parameters and who in addition alert the Investigator and the Sponsor of any clinically significant findings or changes. These manually read tracings are the ECG tracing of record for this clinical trial. A specific written manual regarding the procedures related to the centralized ECG reading 
are provided to each investigator. Refer to the ECG manual for further details.  
Note:  Any abnormal ECG parameter should be immediately rechecked for confirmation before 
making a decision of permanent discontinuation of treatment with dupilu mab for the concerned 
patient. 
9.2.2.7 Pregnancy test 
A serum pregnancy test ( β-human chorionic gonadotrophin) will be performed at screening 
(Visit 1) in women of childbearing potential, and a urine dipstick pregnancy test will be 
performed at Visit 3 prior to randomization and ot her visits. A negative result must be obtained at 
Visits 1 and 3 prior to randomization. Refer to Section  1.2 Study Flow Chart for the schedule of 
pregnancy test performed throughout this study. 
9.2.3 Systemic drug concentration and anti-drug antibodies 
9.2.3.1 Sampling time 
Predose blood samples will be collected for de termination of serum functional dupilumab and 
anti-dupilumab antibodies as designat ed in the study flow chart (see Section  1.2).  The date of 
collection should be recorded in the patient e-CRF .  The date and time also will be collected on 
the central laboratory requisition form and entered into the database throu gh data transfers from 
the central laboratory.  
If an SAE occurs in a patient, blood samples shoul d be collected for determination of functional 
dupilumab concentration, and anti-dupilumab antibody assessment at or near the onset and 
completion of the occurrence of the event, if possible.  The exact date and time of sample collection must be recorded and entered into the database by the central laboratory.  An unscheduled systemic drug concentration page  in the e-CRF must be completed as well. 
Patients who discontinue early fr om treatment or patie nts who choose not to participate in the 
OLE study may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall clinical presentation at that time. Patients may be scheduled for additional follow-up ADA assessments after the EOS visit if necessary  based on the overall 
assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation.

9.3.1 Exploratory Efficacy endpoints 
• Change from baseline in spirometry including FEV 1 
- Absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, 
- Percent change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12,  
- Change from baseline in other lung f unction measurements (% predicted FEV 1, forced 
vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory fl ow [FEF]25-75%) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12.  
• Change from baseline in morning [AM]/evening [PM] peak expiratory flow [PEF] at 
Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12.  
• Change from baseline in Asthma Control Qu estionnaire 5-question version [ACQ-5] score 
at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. 
9.3.1.1 Disease-specific efficacy measures 
9.3.1.1.1 Spirometry 
A spirometer that meets the 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory 
Society (ERS) recommendations will be used. Spirometry should be performed in accordance 
with the ATS/ ERS guidelines ( 17). For pre-bronchodilator measured parameters, including FEV 1, 
PEF, FVC, FEV 1/FVC and FEV 25-75%, spirometry will be performed in the morning after 
withholding the last dose of sal butamol/albuterol or levosalbutam ol/levalbuterol for at least 6 
hours and withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours (vilanterol should be withheld 
for at least 24 hours) and withholding the last dos e of long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
for at least 24 hours. 
At all visits, spirometry should be perform ed between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM. The same 
spirometer and standard spirometric techniques, including calib ration, will be used to perform 
spirometry at all visits and, whenever po ssible, the same person should perform the 
measurements.  
Pulmonary function tests will be measured in the sitting position; however, if necessary to 
undertake the testing with the patient standing or  in another position, this should be noted on the 
spirometry report. For any patient, the positi on should be consistent throughout the study. 
Three measurements fulfilling the ATS acceptability and repeatability criteria should be obtained 
at every visit. The acceptability criteria must be applied before the repeatability criteria. Unacceptable maneuvers must be discarded befo re applying the repeatability criteria.  
The largest FEV
1 and largest FVC should be recorded afte r the data are examined from all of the 
acceptable curves, even if they do not come fr om the same curve. The FEF 25-75% should be 
obtained from the single curve that meets the acceptability criteria and gives the largest sum of FVC plus FEV
1 (best test).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 51 Automated best efforts, which combine FEV 1 and FVC are not acceptable. 
The spirometer must be calibrated following the principles of the ATS/ERS guidelines every day 
that a study patient is seen and spirometry is ca rried out. The calibration records should be kept in 
a reviewable log. It is preferred that the calibration equipment (ie, 3-liter syringe) that is used to 
calibrate the spirometer be subjected to a validated calibration according to the manufacturer’s 
specifications. 
Further details on spirometry will be available in a separate operational manual provided to the 
sites. 
9.3.1.1.2 Reversibility 
If not documented within 5 years of screening, a reversibility test may be administered during screening following pulmonary func tion testing after asthma medica tions have been withheld for 
the appropriate intervals. Reversibility in this circumstance could be demonstrated and recorded in a spirometry assessment regardless of FEV1 compliance with entry criterion at that visit.  Patients will receive two to up to four puffs of albutero l/salbutamol from a primed MDI. Alternatively and 
only if it is consistent with usual office practice (to be documented), reversibility may be performed using inhalation of nebulized albuterol/s albutamol. Spirometry may be repeated several 
times within 30 minutes after admin istration of bronchodilator. Reve rsibility, which is defined as 
an increase in absolute FEV
1 of 12% over the baseline value, with an absolute increase of at least 
200 mL, must be demonstrated within 30 minutes of bronchodilator administr ation. If the patient 
does not meet the reversibility at Visit 1, up to 3 repeat assessments can be performed at any time (ie, unscheduled visits) prior to Visit 2 . 
9.3.1.1.3 ACQ-5  (Asthma Control Questionnaire, 5-question version) 
The ACQ-5 was designed to measure both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.  
The ACQ-5 has 5 questions, reflecting the top-scor ing five asthma symptoms: woken at night by 
symptoms, wake in the mornings with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath 
and wheeze. Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and 
to respond to the symptom questions on a 7- point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum 
impairment) (see Appendix G ). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are eq ually weighted and the ACQ-5 score is the mean 
of the 5 questions and, therefore, between 0 (tot ally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).  
Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Pa tients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately 
controlled asthma and patients w ith scores above 1.0 reflect inad equately controlled asthma. On 
the 7-point scale of the ACQ-5, a change or differ ence in score of 0.5 is the smallest change that 
can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the Minimal Clinically Important 
Difference (MCID) defined by the developer. 
Measurement properties such as reliability and ability to detect change have been documented in 
the literature ( 18).

9.3.1.2.1 Electronic diary/ PEF meter  
On a daily basis throughout the study, the pa tient uses an electronic diary / PEF meter to: 
• Measure morning and evening PEF, 
• Indicate the number of inhalations/day of salbutamol/albuterol or, 
levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for symptom relief, 
• Record the number of inhalations/day of background product used, 
• Record oral steroids use after bronchoscopy and for exacerbation event. 
At screening (Visit 1), patients will be issued an electronic diary/PEF. Patients will be instructed on the use of the device, and written instructions on the use of the electronic PEF meter will be provided to the patients. In additi on, the investigator will instruct the patients on how to record the 
following variables in the electronic PEF meter: 
• AM PEF performed within 15 minutes after arising (between 5:30 AM and 12:00 P M) prior 
to taking any albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol, 
• PM PEF performed in the evening (between 5:30 PM and 12:00  AM) prior to taking any 
albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol, 
• Patients should try to withhold albuterol/salbut amol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol for at 
least 6 hours prior to measuring their PEF, 
• Three PEF efforts will be performed by the patient; all 3 values will be recorded by the electronic PEF meter, and the highes t value will be used for evaluation. 
Baseline AM PEF will be the mean AM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to Visit 2, and 
baseline PM PEF will be the mean PM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to Visit 2. 
Period stability limit is defined as the respective mean AM or PM PEF obtained over the last 7 days prior to Visit 2.  
Information derived from the electronic PEF meter will be evaluated by the Investigator at study 
visits.  
9.3.2 Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
To evaluate the mechanism of action of dupilumab, biomarkers related to asthmatic inflammation 
and Th2 polarization will be assessed in bronchoscopy samples, including BALF, bronchial brushings and bronchial biopsies. RNA will be isolated from these samples to characterize 
treatment related changes in gene expression. In addition, selected biomarke rs will be assessed in 
peripheral blood to allow correlation with the airw ay and/or therapeutic responses, to document 
the time course of drug response, and to compare with observations in other dupilumab clinical 
studies.   
All samples will be archived to allow further analyses related to the mechanism of action of 
dupilumab. More detailed information on the collec tion, handling, transport and preservation of 
samples (eg, minimum volumes required for blood collection and for aliquot s for each biomarker 
assay) will be provided in a separate laboratory manual.

- Cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, TNF- α, IFN- γ,  
- Note: Samples taken at Visits 1 and 2 will be analyzed for the PD biomarkers listed above for all patients who are randomize d.  Samples from patients who are not 
randomized may be analyzed or stored for future use (See Section  10.1). 
• BALF will be assessed for evidence of  overall inflammation, eg, chemokines, 
inflammatory proteins and inflammatory cells, as specified in the laboratory manual. 
• RNA: RNA will be isolated from bronchoscopy samples (biopsy, brushings, and BAL) 
and whole blood and will be subjected to disc rete panels of PCR analyses to evaluate 
genes related to inflammation including eosinophils, lymphocyte subsets and macrophages.  RNA will also be stored for future analyses which may include microarray analysis.  
• Additional inflammatory cell counts in bronchial epithe lium and submucosa will be 
assessed by IHC/histology, including: 
- Mast cells, eosinophils, total T lymphocytes and T helper lymphocytes in bronchial 
epithelium. 
• Basement membrane thickness will be measured in bronchial biopsies 
• Brushings will be obtained for analysis of infl ammatory protein expression, as specified in 
the laboratory manual. 
• Inflammatory cell counts in BALF  including: eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, 
neutrophils, epithelial cells, mast cells 
- Bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed at baseline and at the end of treatment 
(12 weeks) according to the study manual.  Cells will be recovered by centrifugation and slides will be prepared for cellular differential.  The procedure for slide 
preparation and staining will be described in a separate study manual.  Differential cell 
counts will be performed by a central reader  on duplicate slides for each time point 
(baseline and 12 weeks). The absolute number and percentage of each cell type present 
will be determined and the change from baseline in the percentage of each cell type (eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, neut rophils, epithelial ce lls, mast cells) will 
be calculated.

9.3.3.1 Optional stored DNA sample 
For those patients who signed the optional pharmacogenetic informed consent form, blood 
samples for exploratory genetic analysis of DNA will be collected at the study visit as specified in 
the study flow chart and this sample will be stored for future analysis. Specific procedures for 
collection, storage and shipping of pharmacogenetic samples will be provide d in a lab manual.  
The DNA sample may be used to determine a possi ble relationship between genes and response to 
treatment with dupilumab, possible adverse reactions to dupilumab, and to study the genetics of 
asthma. The DNA may be subjected to a genome-wi de association study by single nucleotide 
polymorphism array analysis and/or to whole exome sequencing or whole genome analysis in 
order to thoroughly explore genetic associations with disease risk and/or progression or treatment 
response (efficacy or adverse reactions).  
The blood sample will be transferred to a site that will, on behalf of Sanofi, extract DNA from the 
sample. The contractor site can be located outsi de of your country, within or outside of the 
European Union.  
The DNA that is extracted for genetic testing w ill be assigned a second number, a Genetic ID 
(de-identification code) that is different from the Patient ID. This  “double coding” is performed to 
separate a patient’s medical  information and DNA data. 
The clinical study data (coded by Patient ID) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environm ent from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by  Genetic ID). The key linking Patient ID and 
Genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of clinical data and pharma cogenetic data, for the purpose of da ta analysis, will be possible only by 
using this key, which will be under strict access control. All data will be  reported only in coded 
form in order to maintain confidentiality. 
The aliquots of DNA sent to the bioanalytical la boratories for specific genetic testing will be 
destroyed after completion of that specific analysis and issuance of the related analytical data. 
For future genetic analysis, the DNA will be stored for up to 15 years from the completion of the 
clinical study report in the US. 
9.4 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
Not all of the samples collected during this study may be required for the tests planned in this clinical trial. For patients who ha ve consented to it, the samples th at are archived, unused or left 
over after planned testing may be used for additi onal research purposes (any genetic analysis 
subject to additional consent per  Section  9.3.3). For patients who have c onsented to it, archival 
blood samples will be collected at the visit specifi ed in the study flow chart and processed and 
stored as described in the laboratory manual. For patients who have c onsented to it, samples 
collected during the bronchoscopy procedure (BAL , brushings, biopsy) will also be archived.

bronchoscopy samples (BAL, brushings, biopsy)  remaining from planned laboratory work, may 
be used for research purposes related to asthma (eg, exploratory biomarke rs of disease or drug 
effect), dupilumab mechanism of action, additional drug safety assessments  or development and 
validation of bioassay methods beyond those define d in the present protocol. These samples will 
remain labelled with the same identifiers as the ones used during the study (ie, patient ID, sample 
ID). Samples will be stored for up to 15 years from the completion of the clinical study report. They will be transferred to a Sanofi site (or a subcontractor site) which can be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting 
patient confidentiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and Section  14.5). 
9.5 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
Bronchoscopy and the associated procedures of endobronchial biopsies, BAL and bronchial 
brushings have been employed in numerous clin ical studies in asthma to characterize the 
underlying airway inflammation and demonstrate treatment effects.  
Richmond et al. studied the intr asubject variability with respect to inflammatory cell counts in 
endobronchial biopsies from patients with mild to moderate stable asthma and concluded that in 
order to obtain 80% power to detect a signifi cant difference for lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+ or 
CD8+) or eosinophils (EG2+), 15 subjects was an optimal minimal sample size ( 19).  In a clinical 
trial with omalizumab in allergic asthma, a treatment effect on the numbers of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, total T-lymphocytes and T-helper cells, in the submucosa of bronchial biopsies was observed with a sa mple size of 14 per group ( 13).  Ward et al. studied the 
intrasubject variability of cellular parameters, incl uding eosinophils, in BAL in clinically stable, 
symptomatic patients with mild to moderate asthma and concluded that sample sizes between 15 and 20 were adequate to detect meanin gful differences in these parameters ( 20).  More severe 
patients, however, may demonstrate greater variability. 
The effect of dupilumab on inflammatory cell coun ts within BAL or bronchial biopsies has not 
been previously determined.  Therefore, the effect of dupilumab on FeNO, a surrogate marker for 
airway inflammation, has been used to guide the length of treatment and sample size in this 
exploratory study with dupilumab.  In the prior studies, dupilumab treatment resulted in a marked 
reduction in FeNO as early as 4 weeks after the start of treatment ( 21). In addition, dupilumab 
treatment results in a rapid decrease in soluble attractants of inflammatory cells, such as the chemokine TARC, as early as 1 week after the start of treatment with a nadir by 4 weeks after treatment initiation ( 21).  In clinical studies of other monoclonal antibody treatments for asthma, 
treatment effects on inflammatory cells in bronc hial biopsies can be seen at 10 weeks after 
treatment initiation with mepolizumab ( 22) and at 16 weeks of treatment with omalizumab ( 13).

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The clinical trial consists of three parts, using an add-on therapy approach to inhaled 
corticosteroid in combination with LABA: 
• Screening (5 weeks and optional addition of  7 days and not to exceed 6 weeks of 
screening; Visits 1 & 2).  
• Randomized Treatment Period (12 weeks; Visits 3-9). 
• Post-treatment Period (1 2 weeks; Visits 10-13). 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (relativ e to the first injection), as scheduled. The visit 
schedule should be adhered to within the ± 3 day visit window, unless otherwise noted.  
All the study visits should be scheduled in the mo rning, to have the spirometry performed and the 
patient should be fasting for seru m chemistry tests. However, if the visit can only be done at a 
different time of the day and the patient is not fasting, then he/she should be advised to have a 
light meal and the site should document that serum chemistry was not obtained under fasting 
conditions. For spirometry, it should be performed at a pproximately the same time of the day at 
each visit throughout the study. 
Patients should be reminded that sexually active female patients of reproductive potential are 
required to practice effective contraception dur ing the entire study duration, while taking 
dupilumab and for 12 weeks post last IMP dose . 
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussion of participation in the study, the written 
consent form (including voluntary participation in pharmacogenetic testing/future use of samples) 
must be signed and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the headings of Visits 1and 2 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be perfo rmed over more than 2 site visits if necessary, as 
long as the screening visit window prior to rando mization (Day 1) is re spected and all results 
related to inclusion/exclusion criteria are availabl e prior to the baseline bronchoscopy procedure. 
If needed, in order to (re)confirm eligibility by repeating assessments and to optimize scheduling 
of the baseline bronchoscopy, an additional up to 7 days may be added to the screening period on 
the condition that: overall screening peri od will not exceed 6 weeks and Visit 2 (and 
bronchoscopy) will occur at least 3 days prior to visit 3 (day 1). Patients who failed the initial screening for certain inclusion/exclusion criteria (time-dependent and those that may be transient), may be rescreened for study eligibility one additional time if deemed appropriate at the discretion of the investigator and as long as the screen ing failure occurred prior to baseline bronchoscopy. 
Patients who are re-screened, must sign a new cons ent form and must repeat all of the Visit 1 
procedures (refer to Section  8.4 for further instructions related to rescreening) unless a prior 
assessment is performed within the time frame permitted prior to study entry. For patients who participate in screening visits but are subsequently not randomized into the clinical trial, further assay of stored specimens will be discontinued unless re-designated for the alternative purposes of biomarker assay development or establishment of  biomarker and RNA valu es for patients with 
asthma.

Following a discussion of participation in the clinical trial, inform ed consent must be obtained and 
documented. These steps precede any study procedures. 
The following procedures will then be performed: 
• Call IVRS/IWRS to assign patient num ber and register screening visit. 
• Interview to collect patient demographic information, asthma history (including smoking 
habits), other medical history and surgical history, and prior and concomitant medications. 
• Inquire about AEs/SAEs and background asthma therapy tolerability. 
• Review entry criteria to assess eligibility, with special attention to verify the following: 
- Prescribed treatment dosage meets the per-pro tocol definition of  medium to high dose 
ICS ( ≥250 mcg of fluticasone propi onate twice daily or equipotent ICS daily dosage to 
a maximum of 2000 mcg/day of fluticasone propionate or equivalent)  
(See Appendix B ) in combination LABA for at least 3 months with a stable dose 
≥1 month prior to Visit 1,  
- Documentation of reversibility within 5 years of Visit 1 of at least 12% and 200 mL in 
FEV 1 after the administration of 200 to 400 mcg albuterol/salbutamol (2 to 4 
inhalations of albuterol/salbut amol or of a nebulized solu tion of albuterol/salbutamol. 
OR documentation of airway hyperresponsiveness (methacholine PC 20<8 mg/mL [or 
PC20<16 mg/mL on ICS]) within 5 years of Visit 1, 
- If no documented reversibility or airway hy perresponsiveness, then reversibility must 
be assessed during screening. 
• Obtain urine for urinalysis.  
• Perform 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).  
• Measure vital signs [blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate , body temperature], 
weight (kg), and height (cm). 
• Perform blood sampling (fasting) for the following tests: 
- PD Biomarkers (refer to Section  9.3.2). During the screening period, blood collected 
for biomarker analysis will be stored. The planned analysis will only be conducted for 
patients who are randomized into the clinical  trial. Blood collected from patients who 
are not subsequently randomized into the clinical trial may be used for biomarker 
assay development or establishment of biom arker values for patients with asthma, or 
stored for future use, 
- Clinical laboratory testing: hematology , serum chemistry, coagulation, and  
anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (see Section  9.2.2.2 for details), 
- Virus serology (see Section  9.2.2.2 for detail), 
- For women of childbearing potential, serum β -HCG pregnancy test.  
• Perform any additional laboratory testing required to confirm suitability for the bronchoscopy procedure, as per site’s standard  operating procedures / local requirements. 
• Perform physical examination.

- Entry criteria at Visit 1 include the requirement of a specific FEV 1 and demonstration 
of reversibility, if not previously documented, as specified in  Section  7.1. See below 
for additional directions, 
- Spirometry will be performed in the morning, after withholding the last dose of 
salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for at least 6 hours and 
withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours (vilanterol should be withheld 
for at least 24 hours) and withholding the last dose of LAMA for at least 24 hours, 
- Pre-bronchodilator Forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) must be 55 to 85% predicted 
normal, 
- If a patient’s FEV 1 does not qualify, then the patient may return to the site on a 
subsequent day to attempt to meet the spirometry criteria (3 pre-randomization 
attempts maximum). Patients must meet this criterion prior to the bronchoscopy procedure on Visit 2, 
- Treatment Period stability limits will be established for FEV
1 and PEF (The Treatment 
Period stability limit for PEF is defined as the respective mean AM or PM PEF obtained over the last 7 days prior to Visit 2). 
• If reversibility or airway hyperresponsivene ss is not documented from historical data 
within 5 years of screening (See Inclusion Criteria I 01), establish reversibility 
- Reversibility must be at least 12% and 200 mL in FEV 1 after 200 mcg to 400 mcg (2 to 
4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol  or of a nebulized solution of 
albuterol/salbutamol, if considered as a standard office practice, 
- If a patient’s reversibility does not qualify, then the patient may return to the site on a subsequent day to attempt to meet the reversibility criteria (3 pre-randomization 
attempts maximum). Patients must meet this criterion prior to the bronchoscopy procedure on Visit 2. 
• As per local standard of care, perform chest X-ray if no chest imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) 
available within the previous year and if there is local requirement. 
• Dispense electronic diary/PEF meter, provide instructions for daily use, and remind patient 
to bring the device to the next visit. 
• Dispense and resupply salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/leval buterol for use as 
reliever medication throughout the study. Instruct  patient to record usage in the electronic 
diary.

10.2 DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA 
All evaluations that are reported in the case report form must be supported by appropriately 
identified source documentation. 
Source data is all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial. Source data are cont ained in source documents. Source documents are 
original documents, data and records such as hos pital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, etc. 
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be tr anscribed directly from source documents.  Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central laboratories, spirometry, nitric oxide measurement, and patient electronic diary / PEF meter will be considered source data. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs. Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under clos e and appropriate  clinical/and 
or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the  AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with IMP.   
In addition, the following conditions(s) will be cau ses for temporary treatme nt discontinuation:  
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment. 
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per 
Appendix D .

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 71 10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients must be withdrawn from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be th e Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be 
made to document the reasons for treatment disc ontinuation and this should be documented in the 
e-CRF.  
Patients must be withdrawn from the treatment (ie, from any furt her investigational product or 
study procedure) for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (Legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research). 
• If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuati on in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being. 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
• Any code breaking requested by the Investigator will lead to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. 
• Pregnancy. 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment. 
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during the study, ex cluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 
• Any opportunistic infection, such as TB or ot her infections whose nature or course may 
suggest an immunocompromised status (See Appendix F ).  
• Serum ALT >3 ULN and Total Bilirubin >2ULN (See Appendix D ). 
• Serum ALT >5 ULN if baseline ALT < 2 ULN or ALT >8 ULN if baseline ALT >2 ULN 
(Appendix D ). 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a decision of perman ent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 72 10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to  recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whiche ver comes last. 
If possible, and after the permanent discontinuation of treatment, the patients should complete the EOT visit assessments and enter the Post Treatment Period for continued safety follow-up.  
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP to complete the EOT assessments, with the exception of the bronchoscopy, and then participate in the Post Treatment period according to the visit schedule.  For example, if a patient disc ontinues treatment at Visit 4, he/she would undergo 
assessments indicated for Visit 9 (EOT), except the bronchoscopy, 2 weeks after his/her last IMP 
dose and then the patient would continue in the study according to the visit schedule until the end 
of study visit (Visit 13).  In this way, all patients would undergo 12 we eks of safety follow-up 
after their last IMP dose.  
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the CRF wh en considered as confirmed. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study 
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason. 
If possible, the patients are assessed us ing the procedure normally planned for the 
end-of-treatment visit with the excep tion of the bronchoscopy procedure. 
Withdrawal of consent for trea tment should be distinguished fr om withdrawal of consent for 
follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact follow-up, eg, medical 
records check. Patients requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow-up may jeopardize the public health value of the study. If possible, the patients should be 
assessed using the procedures defined above. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing. 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens of the  
e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, 
at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Inve stigator should make the be st effort to recontact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, re viewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to dete rmine his/her health status, includi ng at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).

with the patient after 3 document ed attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e-mail, certified 
letter, etc). 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary 
endpoints will be considered. 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be rerandomiz ed (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.  
10.3.6 Replacement of patients 
A patient who received treatment a nd prematurely ends his/her treatment prior to Week 12 may be 
replaced in order to have a sufficient number of  patients with adequate  bronchial biopsies to 
assess the main endpoints.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessar ily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
Since asthma exacerbations are representative of th e underlying disease (persistent asthma) of the 
study population, these events should not be repor ted as AEs unless fulfilling the criteria for a 
serious adverse event as described in Section  10.4.1.2.  For this study, asthma exacerbations will 
be managed by the Investigators based on thei r medical judgment and applicable national / 
international asthma management guidelines. Any surgical procedures are not considered as adverse events, including the bronchoscopy 
procedure, but an adverse event caused by the procedure will be reported as AE. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 74 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
 Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
 reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
 be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
 patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
 treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which conditi on has to be considered as a medi cally important event. The list is 
not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm,  
- Anaphylaxis (refer to Appendix E  for Definition of Anaphylaxis), 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse, 
- ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN,  
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality, 
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling), 
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions, 
- Cancers diagnosed during the study, 
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed).  
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added or removed dur ing a study by protocol amendment. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be inform ed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described Section  10.4.2, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding pages in the CRF (to be sent) or screens in the e-CRF.  
• Anaphylactic reactions or - systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require  
treatment (refer to Appendix E for Definition of Anaphylaxis). 
• Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours.

• Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner 
of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued,  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partner of a male participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP/NIMP 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP  is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic pills count) and defined  as at least twice the inte nded dose  during an interval of less than 
11 days.  The circumstances (i e, accidental or intentional)  should be clearly specified 
in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate adverse event forms, 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with any NIMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient and defined as at least twice of the 
intended dose within the intended therapeutic interval. The circumstances

• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or,  
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consu ltation, and/or,  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or,  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or,  
- Defined as an AESI. 
10.4.4 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 78 10.4.6 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of certain laboratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in 
Appendix D .  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, documented, and managed according to the related flow chart in protocol appendices.  
• Neutropenia. 
• Thrombocytopenia. 
• Increase in ALT. 
• Acute renal insufficiency. 
• Suspicion of rhabdomyolysis. 
In addition, on-treatment eosinophil counts >3000 cells/µ L (3.0 giga/L) are to be reported as AEs. 
NOTE: In some clinical trials these laborat ory abnormalities can be considered as AESIs. For 
this study, only significant ALT increase will be considered as AESIs (see Section  10.4.1.3 ).  
10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at leas t reasonably related to the IMP (SUSAR), to 
the regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators.    
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study, some AEs are considered relate d to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected [eg, wheezing related to asthma]. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. For safety, the treatment code will be unblinded by the Sponsor for reporting to the Health 
Authority of any suspected unexpected adverse drug reaction (SUSAR) and reasonably associated 
with the use of the IMP according to either the judgment of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor. 
In case of a SUSAR, Sanofi Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology will utilize XGRID to reveal medication assignment for regulatory reporting requirements for the particular case. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct  of the trial in the clinical 
study report.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 79 10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypersensitivity  
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Acute allergic reactions may be defined as allergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms 
experienced by patients during or shortly after th e pharmacologic or biologic agent given. These 
reactions may present in a variety of ways, in cluding dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, 
hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticar ia/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting. 
Anaphylaxis may represent the most severe form of infusion reaction, but these events may also 
occur via non-IgE mediated mechanisms (eg, an aphylactoid reactions), or may occur via other 
immune-mediated mechanisms (eg, cytokine-mediated). Allergic reactions may begin within a few hours and persist up to 24 hours post dosin g. Refer to Appendix E “Definition of 
Anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. 
10.6.2 Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each study-site 
administered investigational product administration for any signs or symptoms of a 
hypersensitivity reaction in the first 12 weeks.  Any anaphylactic reactions, acute 
systemic allergic reactions or acute allergic reactions that require immediate 
treatment must be reported as an AESI (within 24 hours) (for further details, see 
AESI definition in Section 10.4.1.3) and study medication must be permanently 
discontinued. Trained personnel and medications should be available to treat 
anaphylaxis or any severe allergic reaction if it occurs.  Severe injection site 
reactions 
Based on the subcutaneous mode of administrati on of high doses of protein and on a higher 
incidence of local injection site  reactions observed at the highest dose level (300 mg weekly), 
severe injection site reactions, are considered as a potential risk. Patients who experience an 
injection site reaction must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection site reaction with a future injection. Any severe in jection reaction that lasts over 24 hours will be 
reported as an AESI with immediate notification.   
If there is any consideration being given to pr emedicating before the next dose (for preceding 
systemic or local allergic symptoms of any type/severity), please contact sponsor prior to dosing patients. 
10.6.3 Infections, including parasitic infections 
Some biologic therapies have been associated with an increased risk of infection, including 
opportunistic infection.  As a precautionary measur e, the Investigator is required to carefully 
monitor for any signs or symptoms of infection such as, but not limited to, increased body temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dy spnea, pulmonary infiltra tes, or serious febrile 
systemic illness.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80 Any opportunistic infection requiring parenteral or prolonged (>14 days) antibiotics or 
antituberculosis medication should be considered serious and be reported as AESI with immediate 
notification. The study medication should be disconti nued in case of suspicion of serious infection 
and a complete diagnostic work-up should be performed (ie, cultures for fungi and/or 
mycobacteria other than tuberculosis, histopa thological or cytological evaluation, antigen 
detection and serum antibody titers).  Patients should be referred to an infectious disease specialist if deemed necessary for diagnostic work up and appropriate treatment.  
Since dupilumab binds to IL-4R α, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 activation of their respective 
receptors, it inhibits the T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines production. Infections with a diversity of 
helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like lymphocyte responses. The Th2 
response is characterized by production of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5, subsequently generating IgG
1 
and IgE-secreting cells, and e liciting eosinophilia.  Eosinophilia is  prominent in a number of 
helminthic parasitic dise ases. The eosinophilic response to he lminths is determined both by the 
host's immune response and by the parasite, incl uding its distribution, migration, and development 
within the infected host. Therefore, patients treated with dupilumab may potentially have an 
increased risk of parasitic infection. 
In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded 
from the study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of 
parasitic infection are also excluded, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessments 
have ruled out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrh ea, fever, fatigue hepatosplenomegaly) that 
could be associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated, especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/ or residence in endemic areas, especially 
when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, ex tended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running 
water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact with carriers and vectors,  etc.). Subsequent medical a ssessments (eg, stool exam, blood 
tests, etc.) must be performed in order to rule out parasitic infe ction/infestation.   Patients with 
confirmed parasitic inf ections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate 
notification and will be permanently discontinued from the study.   
10.6.4 Elevated liver function tests 
No pre-clinical and clinical da ta has suggested any hepatic toxicity of dupilumab; however, as a 
general consideration of clinical developmen t, the administration of immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulating agents may represent an addi tional risk factor for hepatotoxicity.  
In order to closely follow liver function tests (LFT), assessment of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non-
conjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratory testing at 
Visit 1 adds hepatitis screen (HBsAg, HbsAb, HBcAb [total and IgM], HCV Ab). Patients who are -Total-HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative at Visit 1 must undergo HBV DNA testing prior 
to randomization to determine eligibility. In case of results showing HCV Ab positive, HCV RNA 
testing must be performed prior to randomization to determine eligibility. At Visit 8, the

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
 
The sample size determination and the statistical power are estimated based on the pharmacodynamic endpoint of fracti onal exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)  as no historical data is 
available on the main endpoints of bronchial s ubmucosal inflammatory cells. The following 
assumptions are used for the estimations: 
• A difference of 25 ppb in the change from baseline in FeNO at Week 12 between SAR231893 and placebo, and a common standard  deviation of 32 ppb (This corresponds 
to a hypothesized effect size of 0.78). 
• A t-test at 1-sided α=0.05. 
• Not accounting for early dropout, ie, the calculate d sample size refers to the size of 
completers. Definition of completers will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) prior to database lock. 
Based on the above assumptions, it is estimate d that, with a total of 42 completers, or 
approximately 21 completers per gr oup, the study will have a 80% power to detect a difference of 
25 ppb in the change from baseline in FeNO at  Week 12 between SAR231893 and placebo. Based 
on observations in other clinical trials (see Section  9.5), it is expected that this sample size will be 
sufficient to evaluate the main PD endpoints in bronchial submucosa.   
 Approximately 42 patient s will be randomized to achieve 21 patients per group with adequate 
biopsy samples.    The calculations were made using nQuery Advisor 7.0.  
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who met the inclusion criteria and signed the 
informed consent.  
Randomized patients consist of all patients with a treatment kit number allocated and recorded in 
IVRS database, and regard less of whether the treatme nt kit was used or not. 
Patients treated without being ra ndomized will not be considered as randomized and will not be 
included in any efficacy population.   
The safety experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported separately, and 
these patients will not be in the safety population.

11.3.1 PD and Biomarker analyses population 
For the main PD endpoints in bronchial submucosa, the PD populati on will consist of all 
randomized patients who underwent baseline and Week12/EOT bronchos copies and have 
adequate biopsies for analysis at both baseline and end of treatment. The analysis will be  
“as-treated” or based on the treatment actually received. If a patient receives in error both placebo and dupilumab during the course of the study, the patient will be include d in the dupilumab group.  
Analysis population for additional PD/biomarker endpoints will be similarly defined. The details will be specified in the SAP. 
11.3.2 Efficacy population 
For analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints,  the efficacy population will consist of all 
randomized patients who have bot h baseline and a post-baseline sp irometry data. The analysis 
will be “as-treated” or based on the treatment actually received. If a patient receives in error both placebo and dupilumab during the course of the study, the patient will be included in the dupilumab group. Additional exploratory efficacy analyses will be also performed using the 
conventional mITT population in wh ich patients will be included in the group as randomized.   
11.3.3 Safety population 
 The safety population will consist of all patients randomized a nd exposed to study medication, 
regardless of the amount of treatment administered. The safety analyses will be conducted according to the treatment patients actually received.  Treatment emergent period for safety populati on is defined as the time between the first 
administration of study medication to the end of the Post-treatment Period. 
In addition:  
• Nonrandomized but treated patie nts will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately.  
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety  population as randomized. 
• For a patient receiving in error both placebo and dupilumab during the trial, the patient 
will be included in the dupilumab group (ie, as-treated analysis).  
11.3.4 Pharmacokinetics (PK) population 
 
The PK population will consist of  all patients in the safety population with at least one 
non-missing and eligible serum c oncentration data. Pa tients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment actually received.

The ADA population will consist of all patients in the safety popula tion with at least one qualified 
ADA result in the ADA assay following the first dose of the study medication. Patients will be 
analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by 
actual treatment received within the safety population. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
Duration of IMP exposure is defined as:  last dose date – first dose date + 14 days, regardless of 
unplanned intermittent  discontinuations. 
11.4.1.2 Compliance 
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol.  No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data. 
 Percentage of compliance for a patient will be defined as the number of administrations the patient was compliant divided by the total number of administrations the patient was planned to 
take during the treatment period (ie, from the first to the last administration). 
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Medi an, Min, and Max). The percentage  of patients with compliance 
is <80% will be summarized. In addition, number a nd percentage of patients with at least 1  
above-planned dosing administra tion will be given, as well as the number and percentage of 
patients with 0, (0, 20%],  and >20% under-planned  dosing administrations.

The main endpoints (see Section  9.1), change from baseline in the number of airway submucosal 
inflammatory cells per surface airway of basal lamina (cells/mm2) and mucin in the bronchial 
mucosa, will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with fixed terms for 
treatment, stratification factors of  region and ICS dose, and airway submucosal inflammatory cells 
per surface airway of basal lamina (cells/mm2) and mucin in the bronchial mucosa at baseline as

main analyses. 
Due to the small sample size of the trial, s econdary analyses of the main endpoints will be 
performed using an ANCOVA model similar as above but excluding one or both stratification 
factors. 
Descriptive statistics will also be provided by treatment and timepoint on raw changes and percent 
changes from baseline. 
 
The main analyses will be based on PD population. 
11.4.2.2 Multiplicity considerations 
No multiplicity procedures will be used as the study is exploratory in nature.   
11.4.2.3 Analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints  
(see Section  9.3.1) 
 
The change from baseline in FEV 1 at Week 12 will be analyzed using a mixed-effect model with 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach based on efficacy population. The model will include 
change from baseline values up to week 12 as resp onse variables, and factors (fixed effects) for 
treatment, pooled countries / regions, visit, treatment-by-vis it interaction, FEV 1 baseline value and 
baseline-by-visit interaction. An unstructured correlation matrix will be used to model the  
within-patient errors. Paramete rs will be estimated using rest ricted maximum likelihood method 
with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Descriptive statistics including numbe r of patients, mean, 
standard error and LS means will be provide d. In addition, difference in LS means, the 
corresponding 90% CI and the p-value will be pr ovided for comparisons of each dose against 
placebo. No imputation will be performed for the MMRM model.  
11.4.3 Analyses of additional and exploratory pharmacodynamics and biomarker 
endpoints  
(see Section  9.2.1 and Section  9.3.2) 
 
The values to be used as baselines will be those collected on Visit 2. If any of the scheduled assessments on Visit 2 are technically disqualified (eg, insufficient sample), then values determined at Screening Visit 1 can be used as baseline.  For all parameters, raw data, absolute changes from baseline and percent changes from baseline will be summarized in descriptive statistics by treatment group and time point.  
Summary plots (mean +/- standard error of the mean) on raw data, absolute changes from baseline 
and percent changes from baseline w ill be provided by treatment group.

(See Section  9.2.2) 
The summary of safety results w ill be presented by treatment gr oup. All safety analyses will be 
performed on the safety population using the following common rules: 
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before the first dose of IMP.   Treatment emergent period for safety population is defined as the time from the first 
administration of study medication to the end of the Post-treatment Period. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  the Sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG.  
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment period, taking into account all evaluations  performed during the on-treatment period, 
including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage.  
11.4.4.1 Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by internationally agreed order), high-level group te rm (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE.  Multiple occu rrences of the same event in the same patient 
will be counted only once in the tables w ithin a treatment phase. The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safe ty population within each treatment group. 
Proportion of patients with at l east one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), serious TEAE 
and TEAE leading to discontinuation of the st udy will be tabulated by treatment group. In 
addition TEAEs will be de scribed according to maximum intensity and relation to the study drug. 
None treatment emergent seri ous AE, None treatment emergent AE leading to study 
discontinuation will be summarized separately. 
11.4.4.1.1 AESI 
The following summaries will be generated:  
• Incidence of each AESI will be tabulated by treatment group.  
• The time-to-first event analyzed using K-M methods and displayed as K-M plots (cumulative incidence (%) versus time based on K-M estimates) will be provided to depict 
the course of onset over time. When TEAE start date or worsening date is partially 
available, the maximum of the earliest possible TEAE start date and the treatment start date will be used. When TEAE start date or worsening date is completely missing, the treatment start date will be used.

(according to confidentiality and personal data protection rules). 
13.4 USE AND COMPLETION OF CASE REPORT FORMS (CRFS) AND ADDITIONAL 
REQUEST 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ma intain adequate and accu rate CRFs (according to 
the technology used) designed by the Sponsor to record (according to Sponsor instructions) all 
observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation in a timely manner. All CRFs 
should be completed in their entirety in a neat, le gible manner to ensure ac curate interpretation of 
data. 
Should a correction be made, the corrected information will be en tered in the e-CRF overwriting 
the initial information. An audit trail allows identifying the modification.  
Data are available within the system to the S ponsor as soon as they are entered in the e-CRF. 
The computerized handling of the data by the Sp onsor may generate add itional requests (DRF) to 
which the Investigator is obliged to respond by confirming or modifying the data questioned. The 
requests with their responses will be managed through the e-CRF.  
13.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
The complete list of computerized systems used for the study is provided in a separate document 
which is maintained in the Sponsor and Investigator study files.

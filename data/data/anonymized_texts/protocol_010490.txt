 1 1 Synopsis  
The START trial was designed to address the following question:  In HIV -1 
(subsequently referred to as HIV) infected asymptomatic participants with a CD4+ 
count greater than 500 cells/mm3, is immediate use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) 
superior to deferral of ART until the CD4+ count declines to 350  cells/mm3 or AIDS 
develops in t erms of morbidity and mortality?   In this international randomized trial, 
participants were randomized in a 1 :1 allocation ratio to the  immediate ( early ) or 
deferred ART group.  The design is illustrated in the schematic below with the sample 
sizes in each group that were achieved.  
 
START Design Schematic : Original Design  
 
 
 
 
 
On May 15, 2015 the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for 
START determined that th is question had been addressed. Immediate use of ART 
provided significant benefit over deferred ART for the primary composite endpoint  of 
START and its two major components, serious AIDS and serious non -AIDS events  over 
an average follow -up of 3 years .  The DSMB recommended offering ART to participants 
in the deferred arm who had not yet started ART .  They also recommende d continued 
follow -up of study participants.   
 
START investigators and study participants were informed of these recommendations 
on May 27, 2015 and per the DSMB’s recommendation, participants in the deferred arm 
who had not started treatment  were offered ART. 
 
Even though the findings from START unequivocally indicate that immediate ART has 
substantial benefits on major clinical outcomes compared to deferred  ART, longer 
follow -up, as recommended by the DSMB, is warranted for several scientific and 
practical reasons.   
 Early ART Group  
    (n = 3,000)       (n=3,000)  
Initiate ART immediately 
following randomization  
 
 
N=2,325  HIV-infected individual s who are ART -naïve with  
CD4+ count  > 500 cells/mm3 
Deferred ART Group  
    (n = 3,000)       (n=3,000)  
Defer ART until the CD4+ count 
declines to < 350 cells/mm3 or 
AIDS develops

INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0

 2 The general aim of long -term follow -up, formulated as two hypotheses stated below,  is 
to determine whether the risk of major morbidity and mor tality associated with deferral 
of ART is eliminated  once ART is initiated or whether it persists due to the lower CD4+ 
cell count at ART initiation.    
 
This version of the protocol  describes the rationale and the plan for continued follow -
up of START part icipants through 2021 .  The major difference between this version of 
the protocol and Version 3.0 is that the data collection plan after 2017 has been 
greatly simplified , and beginning in 2018 , as originally planned,  antiretroviral treatment 
will be provid ed through local sources  and not through a Central Drug Repository  
(CDR) . 
 
Rationale  for Extended Follow -up 
Follow -up through  2021 will provide 6 years of additional follow -up (9.5 years total 
from randomization) from January 2016 by which time 8 1% of participants in the 
deferred arm had initiated ART ; by the end of 2016 93% of participants in the deferred 
ART group had initiated ART.   This is a large increase from the 48% of deferred arm 
participants taking ART in May 2015 .  
 
Extended follow -up is important for several reasons : 
 
 To determine whether the harm resulting from deferral of ART can be  eliminated 
for the primary and key secondary endpoints, overall and for key subgroups.  
 
 The START cohort is unique in many respects: 1) it is demographicall y and 
geographically diverse; 2) participants had a median CD4+ count of 651 
cells/mm3 at baseline ; approximately  25% had counts > 800 cells/mm3; 3) 
approximately one -third of participants had a viral load < 5000 copies/mL at 
entry; and 4) the median time since diagnosis of HIV was one year.  
 
 Although most participants in the deferred arm have now started ART,  the 
randomized allocation to immediate or deferred ART treatment led to  a median 
difference in CD4+ cell counts of 180 cells/mm3 at the time of ART initiation  at 
the end of 2016 , substantial differences in exposure to ART  (a median of 2.5 
years between ART initiation in the immediate and deferred groups) , and 
consequently  to large differences in viral load , CD4+ count , and markers of 
inflammation, coagulation, and vascular injury .  These differences , as well as 
differences in other factors,  may impact treatment differences in clinical 
outcomes even after ART is initiated for participants in the deferred ART group . 
 
 Treatment for HIV  is life -long and the median age of the cohort at study entry 
was 36 years.  Th e average th ree years of follow -up accrued  so far may be 
insufficient to understand the full benefit s of ART.  It is important to more fully 
understand those benefits in order to  inform calculations of cost -effectiveness of 
approaches for diagnosing people as rapidly as possible after infection.  
 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 3  For key clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and all -cause 
mortality, the number of participants with events were sm all, and with long -term 
follow -up the effects of immediate ART compared to deferred ART on these 
outcomes will be more precisely estimated.  
 
 The extended follow -up coupled with the experimental design of START allows 
new scientific questions which are clinically relevant to HIV positive participants 
and the people who are providing their care to be addressed in this unique 
cohort.  
 
Based on the initial findings of START, we have formulated two scientific hypotheses 
that will be addressed through follow -up of the study participants through 202 1.  These 
hypotheses take advantage of the initial randomization  and experimental design of 
START .  Importantly, no other study has the capability of addressing these questions.    
   
Hypothesis 1 (HIV RNA Hypothesis):  As a consequence of nearly all deferred arm 
participants initiating ART by the end of 2015 and the resulting similar HIV RNA levels 
after 2015 for the two treatment groups, the primary event rate in the two treatment 
groups will be simila r between 2016 and 202 1; the cumulative event rates in the two 
arms at the end of  2021 will remain significantly different from one another, reflecting 
the difference in accrued events when the study was unblinded, but the treatment 
difference will be subs tantially smaller than at the time of DSMB’s recommendation  in 
May 2015 .  
 
In terms of the treatment hazard ratio ( HR), we hypothesize the true HR will be 1.0 
and the estimated HR for the time period between 2016 and 202 1 will not differ 
significantly from  1.0; the average HR for the entire follow -up period from 
randomization through 2021, will be significantly less than 1.0 but much closer to 1.0 
than the HR of 0.43 reported following the DSMB recommendation.  
 
In other words, participants who were randomiz ed to deferring ART until the CD4+ 
count decreased to 350 cells /mm3 have an increased risk of the primary endpoint 
during the deferral period, and this risk is nearly completely eliminated once ART is 
initiated.  
 
Hypothesis 2 ( Nadir CD4+ Hypothesis): As a  consequence of deferred arm 
participants initiating ART 2.5 years after the immediate ART group , the primary event 
rate for the deferred  ART group will remain substantially higher  than in the immediate  
ART group between 2016 and  2021; as a consequence, th e cumulative event rates in 
the two arms at the end of 202 1 will also remain substantially different from one 
another with only a modest movement of the overall average HR towards 1.0 from 
0.43.  
 
In other words, participants who were randomized to deferrin g ART to 350 cells /mm3 
have an increased risk of the primary endpoint during the deferral period that persists, 
albeit at lower levels, for 6 years after initiating ART .  This increased risk resulting from 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 4 deferred ART  persists because of  a number of factors including,  the lower CD4+ cell 
count at which ART was initiated , lower CD4+ count levels during extended follow -up, 
increased exposure during the deferral period to activated inflammatory and 
coagulation pathways, and a reduced ability  to normalize markers of inflammation, 
coagulation and vascular injury after ART is initiated .  If data are consistent with this 
hypothesis , we will estimate the rate with which the HR moves toward 1.0 over the 6 
years, if at all.  
 
Primary Endpoint of STAR T 
The primary composite endpoint of START is the development of a serious AIDS 
event  (“AIDS*”) , a serious non -AIDS event  (“non -AIDS”) , or death from any cause.    
 
This endpoint will remain the primary focus of the extended follow -up planned.    
 
Serious AID S events  (or AIDS*)  include most traditional opportunistic conditions  but 
exclude non -fatal esophageal candidiasis and chronic Herpes simplex  (see Appendix 
A for a complete list of conditions).   Non-fatal e sophageal candidiasi s and chronic 
Herpes simplex  are not counted in the primary endpoint of  serious AIDS events  
because they are more common than most other opportunistic events at higher CD4+ 
counts  and usually do not cause significant limitations for people in whom they occ ur. 
 
In this protocol, th e term “AIDS ” (without an asterisk) denotes  all opportunistic 
conditions, including  non-fatal esophageal candidiasis and chronic Herpes simplex  
(see Appendix A).   
 
The following serious non -AIDS conditions are the components of the primary 
composite endpoint  referred to as serious non -AIDS events, or “non -AIDS”:   
 Cardiovascular disease  (CVD)  (myocardial infarction, stroke , coronary 
revascularization) ; 
 End-stage renal  disease  (ESRD) (initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation);  
 Decompensated liver disease; and   
 Non-AIDS -defining cancers  (excluding basal and squamous cell skin cancers).  
 
START Participant s 
Participants enrolled in START were in reasonably good health , and  in the clinician's 
opinion, able to adhere to  the protocol (i.e., be willing to accept and adhere to  the data 
collection schedule and assigned treatment strategy).  
 
Participants had to meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria  to be 
randomized :

All HIV -posit ive participants in START are eligible to continue in extended follow -up. 
 
Data Collection Plan for Extended Follow -up 
In January 2016, the START protocol was amended as Version 3.0.  Version 3.0 
described plans to continue follow -up with existing funding through December 2017 and 
to seek funding for longer follow -up through December 2021. Study visits are required 
twice each year in  Version 3.0.   ART was being provided through a  CDR until the end 
                                            
 
1 The term “licensed” refers to an FDA -approved kit or, for sites located in countries other than the 
United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country.  
Confirmation of the initial test result must use a test  method that is different than the one used for the 
initial assessment.  
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 6 of 2017  at which time , as originally planned,  sites were re quired to transition all 
participants  to a local ART supply.  
 
This version of the protocol (Version 4.0) describes plans for a much simplified follow -
up data collection plan beginning in 2018.  In person s tudy visits will no longer be 
required. Data colle ction will occur once each year and focus on major clinical events. 
In addition, after 2017, the START trial no longer includes  substudies .   ART is no 
longer provided through the study  and the protocol does not specify ART regimens to 
be used.  Since foll ow-up data are collected retrospectively on an annual basis , serious 
and unexpected adverse reactions attributed to ART will no longer be collected in real 
time and reported to regulatory authorities by the sponsor.   Investigators will be 
reminded of thei r obligation to report to regulators per their countries’ requirements for 
reporting post -marketing adverse events considered related to ART. The occurrence of 
specific adverse outcomes (see below) will be collected on a t least a n annual basis as 
part of t he trial data .  
 
The m ajor clinical  outcomes to be  collected have been assessed since the beginning of 
the trial  using similar methods, allowing  the two treatment strategies to be compared for 
the outcome s below for  three calendar periods: 1) from randomization to December 31, 
2015; 2) from January 1, 2016 to December 31 , 202 1;  and 3) cumulatively from 
randomization through December 2021 .

 2 Background and Rationale  
The START trial was designed to address the following question:  In HIV -1 
(subsequently referred to as HIV) infected asymptomatic participants with a CD4+ 
count greater than 500 cells/mm3, is immediate use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) 
superior to deferral o f ART until the CD4+ count declines to 350  cells/mm3 or AIDS 
develops in terms of morbidity and mortality?  In this international randomized trial, 
participants were randomized in a 1 :1 allocation ratio to the immediate (early) or 
deferred ART group.1  The design is illustrated in the schematic below with the sample 
sizes in each group that were achieved.  
 
START Design Schematic : Original Design  
 
 
 
 
 
On May 15, 2015 the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for 
START determined that this question had been addressed. Immediate use of ART 
provided significant benefit over deferred ART for the primary composite endpoint of 
START and its two major components, serious AIDS and serious non -AIDS events over 
an average follow -up of 3 years.   
 
Two months following the recommendation by the DSMB, the primary results of START 
were published.2  Key findings from the primary report of START  are summarized 
below:  
 
 Over an average follow -up of 3 years, i mmediate use of ART provided significant 
benefit over deferred ART for the primary endpoint of START (HR=0.43; 95% CI: 
0.30-0.62); p<0.001) and each of its major components, serious AIDS (p<0.001) 
and serious non -AIDS events (p=0.04).  
 Early ART Group  
    (n = 3,000)       (n=3,000)  
Initiate ART immediately 
following randomization  
 
 
N=2,325  HIV-infected individual s who are ART -naïve with  
CD4+ count  > 500 cells/mm3 
Deferred ART Group  
    (n = 3,000)       (n=3,000)  
Defer ART until the CD4+ count 
declines to < 350 cells/mm3 or 
AIDS develops

  The magnitude of benefit of immediate ART as compared to deferred ART was 
greater for serious AIDS events (HR=0.28; 95% CI: 0.15 -0.50) than for serious 
non-AIDS events (HR= 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38 -0.97).  
 
 While the overall rate of serious non -AIDS events was lower in the immediate 
compared to the deferred arm, the relative difference varied by type of event. The 
HR for non -AIDS cancer was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.22 -1.11; p=0.09).  For 
cardiovascular disease, for which a similar numb er of participants (26) 
experienced an event as for non -AIDS cancer (27 participants) the HR was 0.84 
(95% CI: 0.39 -1.81).  
 
 All-cause mortality rates favored the immediate ART group but the confidence 
interval was wide due to the small number of deaths (HR =0.58; 95% CI: 0.28 -
1.17; p=0.13).  
 
 Symptomatic grade 4 events (potentially life -threatening events) and 
unscheduled hospitalization for reasons other than AIDS progression occurred at 
similar rates in the two treatment groups (HR= 1.01; 95% CI: 0.73 -1.39;  p=0.97 
and HR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.77 -1.08;  p=0.28, respectively).  The HR for a composite 
measure of clinical benefit that included the primary endpoint, grade 4 events, 
and unscheduled hospitalization, favored immediate ART and was 0.82; 95% CI: 
0.71-0.96; p =0.01).  
 
 During the follow -up period, the average CD4+ count was 194 cells/mm3 higher 
(95% CI: 185 -203) in the immediate ART group compared to the deferred ART 
group.  
 
 In both treatment groups, once ART was initiated, a high percentage of 
participants (over 90%) achieved and maintained virologic suppression  (viral load 
200 copies/mL or less) . 
 
 In the deferred arm, 68 of 96 primary events (71%) occurred before ART was 
initiated.  Fifty -seven of the 96 events in the deferred arm occurred at CD4+ 
counts > 5 00 cells/mm3; 23 of the primary events occurred at counts > 650 
cells/mm3. 
 
Concurrent with the findings of START, findings from a trial of early ART that included 
participants with a median age of 35 years from the Ivory Coast (TEMPRANO) showed 
that immed iate ART led to lower rates of severe illness after an average follow -up of 2.3 
years as compared to de ferral of ART according to World Health Organization  (WHO)  
criteria, which varied over follow -up, among those with CD4+ counts of at least 500 
cells/mm3 at study entry.3  These findings reinforced findings from START that early 
ART has benefits in populations across the world including Africa where the prevalence 
of HIV is highest.  Like START, follow -up in TEMPRANO was relatively short 
considering that AR T treatment is life -long.

 After START was initiated and prior to the interim findings of START becoming 
available, a large randomized clinical trial showed conclusively that lowering viral 
replication in the HIV -infected person substantially reduce s heterosexual transmission.4  
Another recent study support s reduced transmission in both hetero - and homosexual 
relationships having condomless sex.5  
 
Taken together, the findings from these studies provide strong evidence for both an 
individual benefit to the person with HIV over a 2 to 3 year period and a public health 
benefit to early use of ART.  As a consequence of these studies guidelines across the 
world have changed.6,7,8 
 
Following the DSMB’s recommendation in May 2015,  participants in the deferred arm 
who had not started treatment were offered ART.   At the time of the DSMB 
recommendation in May 2015, 48% had initiated ART. By the beginning o f 2016, ART 
had been started for 81% of participants in the deferred ART group ; by the end of 2016 
93% of part icipants in the deferred ART group had initiated ART.  Participants in the 
deferred ART group initiated ART a median  (25th, 75th percentile)  of 2.5 (1.6, 3.4) years 
after participants in the immediate ART group.  Ninety -five percent of  participants in the 
deferred ART group who started ART are currently virologically suppressed.    
 
The median CD4+ count at ART initiation for deferred arm participants  by the end of 
2016 was 468 cell/mm3.  This CD4+ count is approximately  180 cells/mm3 lower than 
the median count at initiation in the immediate ART group.   In addition, the most recent  
follow -up CD4+ counts for immediate and deferred arm participants are 882 and 711 
cells/mm3, a difference  of 172 cells/mm3 which is very similar to the difference in CD4+ 
counts at ART initiation for the two treatment groups.  
 
Recently, a panel of inflammatory, coagulation, and vascular injury biomarkers were 
measured at baseline and 8 months after randomization.9  Immediate ART reduce d the 
level of these biomarkers compared to de ferred ART, and D -dimer and interleukin -6 (IL-
6) increased in the deferred ART group.  
 
These data on inititation of ART in the deferred ART group, HIV RNA supppression 
after initiating ART, and CD4+ cell count and biomarker differences provide a strong 
foundation for testing the HIV RNA and Nadir CD4+ hypothe ses.  
 
In January 2016, the START protocol was a mended  as Version 3.0.  Version 3.0 
described plans to continue follow -up with existing funding through December  2017 and 
to seek funding for longer follow -up through December 2021. Those plans have not 
changed; however, this version of the protocol describes plans for greatly simplified 
data collection beginning in 2018.  Currently participants who consented to Ver sion 3.0 
are being seen twice each year.   ART is being provided through a Central Drug 
Repository (CDR) until the end of 2017.  By that time , all participants will have  
transitioned to local sources of ART.

 Continued follow -up of START participants for m orbidity and mortality  is important 
because many indiv iduals who become HIV positive will not initiate ART until their 
CD4+ cell count declines to less than 500 cells/mm3 because of delayed diagnosis or 
unavailability of ART .  Many individuals living with HIV are not aware of it.  The WHO 
estimates this percentage to be 40% worldwide;10 estimates for the U.S. and Europe 
are 13% and 15%, respectively.11,12  Further, l ate diagnoses are common in resource -
rich and –poor settings.13,14,15,16,17,18  A demonstration in a randomized trial of persistent 
poor prognosis with deferred ART will create a further impetus for individuals to seek 
HIV testing  and treatment, and for  health systems to more comprehensively ensure 
access to th ese service s. 
 
Additionally, data from the ex tended follow -up of START participants will provide 
important insights into the pathophysiology of the impact of  prior levels of HIV -induced 
immunodeficiency on risk of morbidity and mortality once HIV is controlled.  
 
It is critical to determine w hether the risk of major morbidity and mortality assoc iated 
with delayed initiation is completely eliminated  once ART is initiated and HIV RNA 
levels are suppressed or whether it persists due to the delay in initiating ART .  No prior 
randomized trial has addressed this question.  START is the only trial that will ever 
settle this question.   
 
Observational studies have attempted to address this question. A cohort analysis 
published around the time of the START results found that mortality differences among 
different  ART initiation strategies for participants with a CD4+ count > 350 cells/mm3 
were small and decreased over time;19 importantly, as they note, their estimates relied 
on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. Another recent report based on a 
cohort stu dy found that after surviving for 5 years of ART, the mortality of those who 
started ART with low baseline count converged to those with high baseline counts.20  
Other  observational studies suggest residual excess risk of non -AIDS morbidity 
associated with lower nadir CD4+ counts, but their design makes them unable to 
demonstrate whether the associations are causal.21,22,23 
 
In addition, the long -term follow -up will provide more information on rates of specific 
non-AIDS conditions and all -cause mortality in thi s unique cohort of individuals  most of 
whom  will be  treated with ART  that provides long -term virologic suppression . 
 
In summary, t his streamlined version of the protocol (Version 4.0) with a more focused , 
cost-effective  data collection plan and with locall y sourced ART, allowing for the 
elimination of sponsor -reported  serious and unexpected adverse reactions attributed to 
ART will enable START to address an important scientific question at substantially 
reduced cost.  Sites will report serious and unexpecte d events  to national and 
international regulatory authorities according to local post-marketing reporting 
requirements .

 3 Methodology  
3.1   Study Design  
This version of the START protocol continues follow -up of the HIV -positive participants 
in START, using a reduced data collection schedule to optimize resources and thus 
allow for a longer follow -up period.   START is  a multicenter, international, randomized 
trial that compar es initiation of ART at a CD4+ cell count > 500 cells/mm3 (early ART) 
versus initiation  of ART at a CD4+ cell count of < 350 cells/mm3 (deferred ART) for a 
composite outcome of AIDS*, non -AIDS, and death from any cause (see Appendix A).2  
From April 2009 through December 2013, e ligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to either the early ART group or the deferred ART group.  Randomization was 
stratified by clinical site.  A total of 4,68 4 HIV-positive particip ants were randomized  
(one randomized participant included in the primary result paper was later determined 
to be HIV -negative) . Participants in the early ART arm commenced ART immediately 
following randomization.  Participants in the deferred ART group, th e control arm, were 
to commence treatment when the CD4+ declines to < 350 cells/mm3 or if an AIDS -
defining diagnosis occurs.    
3.2   Extended Follow -up Objectives  
3.2.1  Primary Objective  and Hy potheses  
With extended follow -up of participants in START, the primary objective is to determine 
whether  the benefit of early ART as compared  to deferred ART in delaying the 
occurrence of a composite outcome consisting of AIDS*, non -AIDS, or death from any 
cause  is maintained, increased or reduced . 
 
Two scientific hypotheses , both of which take advantage of the randomized design of 
START  and the extended follow -up through 2021 , have been formulated to address 
the primary objective.  These hypotheses  are: 
   
Hypothesis 1 (HIV RNA Hypothesis):  As a consequence of nearly all def erred arm 
participants initiating ART by the end of 2015 and the resulting similar HIV RNA levels 
after 2015 for the two treatment groups, the primary event rate in the two treatment 
groups will be similar between 2016 and 202 1; the cumulative event rates in the two 
arms at the end of follow -up in 2021  will remain significantly different from one 
another, but the treatment difference will be substantially smaller than at the time of 
DSMB’s recommendation  in May 2015 .  
 
In terms of the treatment hazard ratio  (HR), we hypothesize the true HR will be 1.0 
and the estimated HR for the time period between 2016 and 2021 will not differ 
significantly from 1.0; the average HR for the entire follow -up period from 
randomization through 2021, will be significantly less than 1.0 but much closer to 1.0 
than the HR of 0.43 reported following the DSMB recommendation.  
 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
12 
 In other words, participants who were randomized to deferring ART until the CD4+ 
count decreased to 350 cells /mm3 have an increased risk of the primary endpoin t 
during the deferral period, and this risk is nearly completely eliminated once ART is 
initiated.  
 
Hypothesis 2 ( Nadir CD4+ Hypothesis): As a consequence of deferred arm 
participants initiating ART 2.5 years after the  immediate ART group,   the primary 
event rate for the deferred  ART group will remain substantially higher  than in the 
immediate  ART group between 2016 and 2021; therefore , the cumulative event rates 
in the two arms at the end of follow -up in 2021 will also remain substantially different 
from one another with only a modest movement of the overall average HR towards 1.0 
from 0.43.  
 
In other words, participants who were randomized to deferring ART to 350 cells /mm3 
have an increased risk of the primary endpoint during the deferral period that persists, 
albeit at lower levels, for 6 years after initiating ART.  This increased risk persists 
resulting from deferred ART, is due to a number of factors including,  the lowe r CD4+ 
cell count at which ART was initiated, lower CD4+ count levels during follow -up, 
increased exposure during the deferral period to activated inflammatory and 
coagulation pathways, and a reduced ability to normalize markers of inflammation, 
coagulatio n and vascular injury after ART is initiated.  If data are consistent with this 
hypothesis, we will estimate the rate with which the HR moves toward 1.0 over the 6 
years, if at all.  
3.2.2  Secondary Objectives  
As secondary objectives , we will evaluate these two hy potheses for major components 
of the START primary endpoint and other major outcomes between 2016 and 2021 
and using all of  follow -up through  2021. The two hypotheses will also be evaluated for 
baseline -defined subgroups.  
 
a. To compare early ART to deferred ART for  the following components of the primary 
composite outcome : 
 AIDS* or death from AIDS  
 Non-AIDS  or death not attributable to AIDS  
 CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization)  or death due to 
CVD  
 Cancer (AIDS and n on-AIDS malignancy,  excluding basal and squamous cell 
skin cancers ) 
 All-cause mortality  
 Tuberculosis  
 Serious bacterial infections  
 
b. To compare early ART to deferred ART for the following other  clinical  outcomes:  
 ESRD (initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation)  
 Decompensat ed liver disease  
 Non-AIDS malignancy, including basal and squamous cell skin cancers  
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
13 
  AIDS  
 Unscheduled hospitalizations  
 
c. To compare early ART with deferred ART for the primary composite outcome and 
other major clinical outcomes in subgroups defined by the following characteristics 
measured at baseline:  
 Age 
 Gender  
 Race/ethnicity  
 Presence and levels of risk factors , including risk scores which are based on 
several risk factors,  for serious non -AIDS and AIDS conditions in addition to age, 
gender and race/ethni city (e.g., smoking, estimated GFR (eGFR), hepatitis co -
infection, diabetes mellitus, estimated CVD risk, lipids, blood pressure, presence 
of resting ECG abnormalities)  
 Baseline CD4+ cell count  
 Baseline CD8+ cell count  
 Baseline HIV RNA level  
 Baseline IL -6 level 
 Baseline D -dimer level  
 Duration of HIV infection , including those recently infected and those who are 
slow/non -progressors.  
 Viral characteristics, including subtype , and evidence of transmitted drug 
resistance  
 Host genetic traits  
 Geographic region  
 High versus low/moderate income countries  
 Calendar date of enrollment  
3.2.3  Other Objectives  
a. To compare the early and deferred ART groups for:  
 ART use over follow -up 
 HIV RNA levels over follow -up  
 CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts over follow -up 
 
b. To compare the early and deferred ART groups for maintained virologic suppression 
following the initiation of ART during follow -up according to:  
 Presence of ART drug resistance at baseline  
 Geographic setting with and without access to routine resistance te sting  
 Viral characteristics, including subtype  
 
c. Among participants in both treatment groups, to study predictors , including genomic 
correlates,  of the primary endpoint  and its components  
 
d. To study the effects of time -updated HIV RNA , CD4+ and CD8+ cell cou nt levels on 
risk of the primary endpoint and its components, and the extent to which changes in 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0

14 
 these laboratory markers explain treatment differences in major clinical outcomes 
during  the three calendar periods for which the immediate and deferred ART gr oups 
will be compared  to address the HIV RNA and  Nadir CD4+ hypothes es.  The three 
calendar periods are : 1) from randomization to December 31, 2015; 2) from January 
1, 2016 to December 31 , 202 1; and 3) cumulatively from randomization through 
2021 . 
3.3   Primary Study Endpoint  
The primary composite endpoint , defined in Appendix A, remains the same as it has 
been throughout START  and includes the following three major components:  
 AIDS* or death from AIDS  
 
Opportunistic events consistent with the 1993 CDC expanded surveillance definition 
plus additional events associated with immunosuppression in the patient population 
targeted for enrollment.  Esophageal candidiasis and chronic Herpes simplex  
infection will  be counted as primary endpoints only if they result in death.  
 
 Non-AIDS  
o CVD:  myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization  
o ESRD:  initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation  
o Decompensated liver disease  
o Non-AIDS -defining cancers, excluding b asal and squamous cell skin cancers.  
Basal and squamous cell skin cancer will be counted as a primary endpoint 
only if they result in death.  
 
 Death not attributable to AIDS, including death of unknown cause  
 
The primary outcome of START and each of the ma jor components of the primary 
outcome will be evaluated as the time to the first occurrence of one of the above events .  
Other major endpoints are referred to in the Study Objectives (section 3.2).  
3.4   Statistical Considerations  
In this section , assumptions underlying the predicted HRs and 95% CIs cited for the 6  
year period from January 2016 to December 2021  and cumulatively from randomization 
through 202 1 for the HIV RNA and Nadir CD4+ count hypotheses are given.  
 
Assumptions Underlying HIV RNA Hypothesis  
 
 In the immediate ART group, the rate of AIDS* does not change over time.  Rates 
of serious non -AIDS and all -cause mortality increase due to aging by 7.5% per 
year after December 31 , 201 6. 
 In the deferred ART group, as a consequence of the great majority of  participants 
initiating ART, event rates for AIDS*, serious non -AIDS and all -cause mortality 
will be the same as rates in the immediate ART group between  2016 and 2021 . 
   
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
15 
 Assumptions Underlying Nadir CD4+ Count Hypothesis  
 
 In the immediate ART group, the  rate of AIDS* does not change over time.  Rates 
of serious non -AIDS and all -cause mortality increase due to aging by 7.5% per 
year after December 31 , 201 6. 
 In the deferr ed ART group,  the event rate for the primary endpoint  between  2016 
and 202 1 will be 75% higher than rate in the immediate ART group  as a 
consequence of the ir lower nadir CD4+ count and  continued CD4+ cell count 
difference between treatment groups, e.g., the  CD4+ count difference between 
treatment groups at the latest follow -up visit is currently  172 cells/mm3.    
 
For both hypotheses, it is assumed that 90% of participants of the 4,684 HIV+ 
participants will be under fo llow-up on 1 January 2018.  It is also assumed that very 
few participants will experience both AIDS* and serious non -AIDS events, and that the 
lost-to-follow -up percent will be 1% per year after 2017.  
 
Considering these assumptions, we estimate 406 primary events will occur by 31 
December 2021  under the Nadir CD4+ hypothesis ; 242 primary events are expected 
to occur between  2016 and 202 1.  Under the HIV RNA hypothesis, 17 7 primary events 
are expected to occur between 2016 and 2021 and 34 1 events are predicted between 
randomization and 2021. Based on the assumptions above, the predicted HRs and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the two hypotheses are given below.

With 242 events, power is 0.9 8 during th e calendar period January 2016 through 
December  2021 to detect a HR (Imm/Def) of 0.60; power is 0. 79 to detect a HR of 
0.70, a difference that is more conservative than the projected HR of 0.57 under the 
Nadir CD4+ hypothesis.  
3.5   Participant  Selection  
Participants enrolled in START  were  in reasonably good healt h, and  in the clinician's 
opinion, able to adhere to  the protocol (i.e., were  willing to accept and adhere to  the 
data collection schedule and the assigned treatment strategy).2,24  The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria used at study entry are given in the synopsis  for reference.  
All HIV -positive participants in START who sign a consent  for Version 3.0 (or Version 
4.0 if required by the local ethics committee) are eligible to continue in extended follow -
up with the exception of those who are involuntarily incarcerated .  Incarcerated 
participants may be re -consented to Version 4.0 upon re lease.

 3.6   Study Plan  
Through May 2 6, 2015, t he management of participants was guided by their assigned 
treatment strategy  (see below) .  On May 27 , 2015  investigators and participants were 
informed that on May 15, 2015 the independent DSMB determined that the primary 
question of START had been addressed.  The DSMB recommended offering ART to 
participants in the deferred arm who had not yet started ART and continu ing follow -up 
of all study participants .    
3.6.1  Treatment Strategies  
For reference, t his section des cribes the two treatment strategies in START through 
May 2 6, 2015.  Beginning on May 27, 2015, all participants in the deferred arm were 
offered ART.  
 
Before a participant was randomized, a potent combination ART regimen was pre-
specified by the study clinician.   The initial regimen used was to be from a  list of 
regimens based on DHHS guidelines .  This list of regimens was regularly  updated 
following changes in th ose guidelines.    
  
After randomization, participants in the two gro ups w ere to  use potent combination ART 
as follows:  
a.   Participants assigned to the early  ART group w ere to  start the prespecified ART 
regimen as soon as possible.  
  
b.   Participants assigned to the deferred  ART group w ere to  defer ART until one of the 
following conditions occurs :  
    CD4+ cell count declines to < 350 cells/mm3 and is confirmed by a repeat CD4+    
 measurement within 4 weeks, or 
    AIDS develops, or  
    Conditions specified by local guidelines occur that indicate initiation of potent  
combination ART, e.g., s ymptoms indicative of HIV progression  such as  oral 
thrush, unexplained weight loss, or unexplained fever . 
  
The intent of the deferral strategy used in START was to initiate ART as soon as 
possible after the CD4+ count dropped below 350 cells/mm3.  The CD4+ count was 
monitored closely as it approache d 350 cells/mm3. 
 
After discussion with their clinicians, participants in the deferred ART group who 
develop ed any of the conditions noted above w ere to  start an ART regimen selected  
from the  same  list of regimens based on DHHS guidelines  that regimens for the 
immediate ART group used.    
  
Women assigned to the deferred ART group who become pregnant before the CD4+ 
cell count declines to < 350 cells/mm3 were to be  prescribed ART using  a regimen in 
keeping with l ocal treatment guidelines .

 3.6.2  Concomitant Medications  
There are no restrictions on concomitant medications for participants in either group.   
3.6.3  Baseline Screening  
For reference, below we describe the data collected prior to randomization.  These data 
will be used to address many of the stated objectives of long -term follow -up. 
 
All consenting participants had the following information and measurements collected 
within 60 days before randomization unless otherwise noted.  All measurements were  
done locally unless otherwise noted.  
 Demographics, including education  
 Documentation of HIV infection  
 CD4+ cell count  and CD4%:  two measurements at least 2 weeks apart, with the 
earliest within 60 days before randomization  
 Karnofsky scor e 
 For women of child -bearing potential, a pregnancy test (serum or urine) done in the 
clinic must be documented to be negative within 14 days before randomization  
 Targeted health history including date of first diagnosis of HIV infection, likely mode 
of HI V infection, history of non -AIDS events, pregnancy status, and history of 
fractures  
 Brief clinical evaluation including weight, height, sitting blood pressure, pulse, and 
smoking status  
 Nadir CD4+ cell count and CD4% and maximum HIV RNA level available in  the 
medical record from any time in the past  
 Up to three most recent (before the above baseline measurements) CD4+ cell 
counts, CD4%s, and HIV RNA measurements available in the medical record

measurements):  
o Complete blood count (CBC):  hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count 
(WBC) with differential and platelets  
o CD8+ T -cell count and CD8%  
o Renal function:  serum creatinine to estimate GFR25 
o Liver function :  alanine aminotransferase ( ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and albumin  
o Glucose

 o Lipids:  total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein 
(HDL), triglycerides  
o Dipstick urinalysis for measurement of protein  
 Documentation of hepatitis B and C status:  hepatitis B surface anti gen, core 
antibody and surface antibody; hepatitis C antibody and, if available, genotype and 
viral load.  Documented positive tests at any time in the past or documented 
negative tests in the 6 months before randomization may be used.   
 In a subset of par ticipants, a r esting ECG  (at sites with a study -provided ECG 
machine and a certified technician)  
 ART regimen to be prescribed for the participant if randomized to the early group 
and whether the regimen would  be obtained locally or through the INSIGHT  CDR  
 For consenting participants, s tored plasma (sufficient for eight  1-mL transport tubes)  
for future HIV -related research (e.g., HIV resistance testing, CVD biomarkers)  
 For consenting participants, s tored urine (sufficient for six 1 -mL transport tubes) for 
future HIV -related research  
 
In participants who w ere to  be prescribed abacavir, HLA -B*5701 screening test results 
for abacavir hypersensitivity had to  be available before prescription.  
 
In additio n to the aforementioned data,  the following laboratory measurements , which 
will also be used to address objectives of long -term follow -up have been  made  on 
stored baseline specimens:  
 IL-6, D-dimer, high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), IL -27, serum amyloid 
A (SAA), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (sICAM -1), and soluble 
vascular cell adhesion molecule -1 (sVCAM -1) were measured in all randomized 
participants who consented to the storage of blood for future research.  
 In a subsample of participants who reported recent infection and/or recent an 
HIV diagnosis, a Limiting Antigen -Avidity assay and a Johns Hopkins avidity 
modified Genetic Systems ( GS) HIV-1/HIV -2 PLUS O enzyme immunoassay 
(EIA) were measured to identify pa rticipants with early HIV infection.26,27 
 In 2,549 START participants who consented to store DNA,  a genome wide 
association study (GWAS) has been performed to investigate genetic 
determinants of immune function, ART toxicities , elevated biomarker levels,  and 
AIDS and serious non -AIDS events.  
 Among 3,785 participants who consented to store specimens for future research 
with a baseline HIV RNA level > 1,000 copies/mL, next generation sequencing 
for HIV resistance was performed.    
3.6.4  Participant Follow -up 
The planned follow -up is through December 2021 . The extent of d ata collection  and 
methods for data collection varied between Versions 1.0/2.0, Version 3.0 and Version 
4.0.  In Versions 1.0 and 2.0, participants were seen at routine follow -up visits which 
occur red at 1 and 4 months after randomization, and every 4 months thereafter .  
Beginning with Version 3.0 , data collection visits occu rred at 6 month intervals .  The

In Version 4.0, follow -up data collection will occur once each year.  The following 
information will be collected:  
 ART regimen currently prescribed  
 CD4+ cell counts and CD8+ cell counts measured since the last assessment , if 
available.  
 HIV RNA levels determined since the last assessment , if available.  
 Event documentation for serious AIDS, serious non -AIDS and deaths which 
constitute the START primary endpoint.  
 Event documentation for the following secondary outcomes:  
o Non-AIDS malignancy, including basal and squamous cell skin cancers  
o All AIDS events, including esophageal candidiasis and chronic Herpes 
Simplex  
o Bacterial pneumonia  
 Unscheduled hospitalizations , including an assessment of the severity of the 
condition that led to the hospitalization.  
 
For most participants th ese data will already exist as a consequence of routine care.  At 
some sites in order to collect these data , participants w ill be seen for a study visit.  
Whether the data exist already or are  collected as part of a study visit, electronic case 
reports forms (eCRFs) will used to record  the data  at each site . 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0

The INSIGHT Endpoint Review Committee (ERC) has established objectiv e criteria for 
each event comprising the primary endpoint and for major secondary endpoints; these 
criteria are also found in the START Protocol Instructions Manual.  The ERC is 
responsible for reviewing each reported primary event to determine the level o f 
diagnostic certainty.  Events which are judged as confirmed or probable will be included 
in the primary analysis.  
3.6.5  Participant Relocation to a New Site  
If a participant relocates to a n area without a START  site where the participant could be 
transferred , data collection of items that are considered to be part of routine care (e.g., 
HIV RNA level, CD4+ cell count, clinical events) will continue if the participant gives  
permission .  The START Protocol Instructions Manual provides guidance on how to 
collect data for participants who relocate and/or transfer to another START clinical site.   
3.6.6  Stored Samples and Future Research  
After 2017, no blood or urine specimens will be obtained for storage.  Specimens 
collected through  December 2017  will be stored at a central specimen repository for use 
in HIV -related research concerning the effects of HIV and ART on AIDS and non -AIDS 
conditions.  Proposed research utilizing these specimens will be reviewed and approved 
by the IN SIGHT Scientific Steering  Committee.  Results of research tests on individual 
specimens will not be given to participants or their clinicians, but aggregate research 
results will be made available.  
4 Clinical Management Issues  
4.1 Antiretroviral Treatment  
Based on the result s of START, all participants should be offered ART with a goal  of 
continually suppressing HIV RNA levels.  Local guidelines  which stipulate that once 
ART is started the goal should be viral suppression  should be followed for clinical 
managemen t. 
4.2 HIV Transmission Counseling  
All participants should receive counseling regarding prevent ion of HIV transmission to 
others as indicated.  
4.3   Study Withdrawal  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time at their request and resume 
participation at any time upon re -consent.  A participant may be withdrawn if:  
 S/he relocates and data can no longer be collected.  
 S/he is imprisoned, or involuntarily incarc erated for medical reasons.  In this case, 
no data will be collected during the imprisonment or involuntary incarceration.  
However, once released from imprisonment or involuntary incarceration, an 
individual may resume participation  upon re -consent.

Co-enrollment in other studies is permissible . 
5 Evaluation  
5.1  Data Analysis  
The primary analysis will be by intention  to treat, comparing the early and deferred 
groups.   Time -to-event methods, including stratified log -rank tests , proportional 
hazards regression analysis, and Kaplan -Meier cumulative event curves, will be used 
to summarize the primary endpoint (i.e., time to t he first event) and major secondary 
outcomes .28  Unless otherwise stated, analys es will be based on a Cox model with a 
single indicator for treatment group and with strata corresponding to geographic region 
(North America, South America, Europe, Australasia , and Africa).  
 
Analys es will be carried out for the following three calendar periods: 1) from 
randomization to December 31, 2015; 2) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2021 ; 
and 3) cumulatively from randomization through 202 1.  These analyses will focus  on the 
primary endpoint, serious AIDS events, serious non -AIDS events, all -cause mortality, 
CVD , non-AIDS cancer , and unscheduled hospitalizations .  
 
To assess whether treatment hazard ratios differ between the follow -up period prior to 
January 1, 2016  and afterwards, Cox models which include an interaction term with 
the calendar follow -up period will be used.  Similar analyses will use the cutoff of May 
27, 2015.  Cox models will also be used to assess the homogeneity of hazard ratios 
over the entire foll ow-up period , during the period between 2016 and 202 1, and during 
the period before  (May 27, 2015)  and after investigators and participants were 
informed of the interim results.  
 
The randomized compar isons planned above will be supplemented with analyses that 
take into account the timing of ART use (viral suppression) in the deferred ART arm 
and consider ART use (viral suppression) and latest CD4+ count as time -updated 
covariates in order to determine the extent to which the treatment HR is explained by 
those factors.  
 
Subgroup analyses for the  primary endpoint and major secondary  outcomes will also 
be performed for the following three calendar time periods : 1) from randomization to 
December 31, 2015; 2) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2021; and 3) 
cumulatively from randomization through 2021.  Subgroup analyses will be aimed at 
determin ing whether the treatment effect ( immediate  versus deferred ) differs 
qualitatively across various baseline -defined subgroups.  Subgroup analyses will be 
performed by age , gender , race/ethnicity , geographic region , including low versus 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
23 
 moderate/high income countries , the presence of risk factors , including risk scores,  for 
serious non -AIDS and AIDS conditions, baseline CD4+ cell count, baseline HIV RNA 
level, baseline leve ls of IL -6 and D -dimer, duration of HIV infection at enrollment, viral 
characteristics, including subtype , and evidence of transmitted drug resistance, and 
calendar date of enrollment in order to assess the effect of different treatment patterns 
that may e merge . The consistency of the treatment difference across participating 
countries  will also be assessed.  An overall test of heterogeneity will provide evidence 
of whether the magnitude of the treatment difference varies across baseline 
subgroups.  
 
HIV RNA  levels , CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts  will be compared for the early and 
deferred groups.  Likewise, discontinuation of ART in the early and deferred groups 
will be closely monitored.  Kaplan -Meier life -table methods will be used to estimate the 
cumulative pe rcent of participants in the deferred group who initiate therapy after 
different periods of follow -up.  Follow -up levels of HIV RNA and CD4+ count will be 
summarized in a number of ways.  Follow -up time spent in various categories will be 
compared.  Longitudinal measurements of viral load and CD4+ cell count will be 
summarized using measured levels (or log transformed) and using repeated binary 
assessments (e.g., viral load below 50 copies/mL) . 
 
Analyses which take into account use of ART by deferred arm participants will also be 
carried out for comparing the immediate and deferred ART groups for the time period 
between  2016  and 202 1.  These analyses will be aimed at estimating the effect of 
initiating ART on the residual excess risk of the primary end point after taking into 
account the duration of  ART after 2016.    
5.2 Data Monitoring  
The trial will be conducted under the direction of the START study protocol team  which 
includes representatives from the community,  the major funder (NIAID),  and from 
differe nt scientific and administrative disciplines .  
 
During the extended follow -up the protocol team and other INSIGHT committees will 
closely monitor the data for completeness and quality.  
 
There are no planned interim analyses that would lead to earlier repor ting of findings  
related to the two major hypotheses that will be addressed with extended follow -up.  
However, at least on an annual basis, the protocol leadership will review a report on 
data quality, the completeness of follow -up, and treatment differenc es for the primary 
and major secondary outcomes.

  28 August  2017  
 D-1 Appendix D:  Informed Consent Forms  
 
This appendix includes the sample informed consents for Version 3.0 and 4.0 of the 
START protocol.   
 
All START participants were asked to re -consent to Version 3.0, because at that time 
we were asking for participant consent to be followed until 2021, several more years 
than originally planned.  Participants who did not wish to continue follow -up under 
Version 3.0, with its reduced data collection schedule, withdrew from START.  Although 
sites mu st obtain appropriate IRB/EC approvals and registration with INSIGHT for 
Version 4.0 of START, the study sponsor is not requiring participants to re -consent in 
order to continue follow -up under Version 4.0.  The duration of follow -up under Version 
4.0 is t he same as that to which participants consented for Version 3.0.  Data collection 
requirements have again been reduced, so we are not asking anything more from 
participants than what they have already consented to provide.  These changes can be 
communicate d to participants in any way the site considers appropriate for its 
population, including verbal communication (documented in the participant’s record) at 
the participant’s next clinic visit.  A sample participant information sheet will be provided 
should sites wish to use it.  
 
As participants may move their care to another START site during follow -up or 
participants who have been lost to follow up and have yet to consent to version 3.0 
may return to clinic, a sample informed consent document for Version 4. 0 of the 
protocol is also included in this appendix.   In addition, in some countries, individual 
sites’ IRBs/ECs may elect to require that participants re -consent to continue follow -up 
under Version 4.0.  In such cases, if participants decline re -consent t hey will be 
withdrawn from START.

INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to continue to participate in the START study th rough 2017, and 
possibly through 2021 if funding is available. This extended follow -up will provide 
important additional information on the long -term benefits and risk of taking HIV 
medicines.  
 
YOUR PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY  
This consent form gives you information about the planned long -term follow -up of 
participants in the START study that will be discussed with you.  Once you understand OHRP Requirements to be read by the sites:  
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SAMPLE LANGUAGE DOES NOT PREEMPT OR REPLACE LOCAL IRB REVIEW AND APPR OVAL.  
INVESTIGATORS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE LOCAL IRB WITH A COPY OF THIS SAMPLE LANGUAGE ALONG WITH 
THE LANGUAGE INTENDED FOR LOCAL USE.  LOCAL IRBS ARE REQUIRED TO WEIGH THE UNIQUE RISKS, 
CONSTRAINTS, AND POPULATION CONSIDERATIONS AS A CONDITION OF ANY APPROVAL.  ANY DELETION OR 
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING RISKS OR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT MUST BE JUSTIFIED BY 
THE INVESTIGATOR, APPROVED BY THE LOCAL IRB, AND NOTED IN THE IRB MINUTES.  JUSTIFICATION AND IRB 
APPROVAL OF SUCH CHANGES MUST BE FORWARDED TO THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING CENTER. .  SPONSOR -
APPROVED CHANGES IN THE PROTOCOL MUST BE APPROVED BY THE LOCAL IRB BEFORE USE UNLESS INTENDED

SUBJECTS AT NEXT ENCOUNTER, WITH ALL NEW SUBJECTS PRIOR TO INVOLVEMENT, OR AS THE LOCAL IRB MAY 
OTHERWISE ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE.  
 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 D-3 the reasons for extended follow -up, and if you agree to take part, you will be asked to 
sign this consent form. You will be given a copy to keep.  
 
Before you learn about the extended follow -up, it is important that you know the 
following:  
 Your participation is entirely voluntary;  
 You may decide not to take part or to withdraw from the planned follow -up at any 
time without losing the benefits of your routine medical care.  
 
START is being funded primarily by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID), U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), through a grant to the 
University of Minnesota, which is the lead institution in the INSIGHT group.  The 
University of Minnesota is the sponsor of this study.  This study is also being conducted 
with additional funding from Agence Nationale  de Recherches sur le SIDA et les 
Hépat ites Virales (ANRS, France); Australian National Health and Medical Research 
Council (NHMRC); Danish National Research Foundation; Medical Research Council 
(MRC, United Kingdom); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI); National 
Institute of Ment al Health (NIMH); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke (NINDS); and Division of Clinical Research (NIAID).  Additional support is being 
provided by AbbVie Laboratories, Inc.; Bristol -Myers Squibb; Gilead Sciences, Inc.; 
GlaxoSmithKline, Inc.; Merck & Co., Inc, and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
WHY IS FOLLOW -UP CONTINUING THROUGH 2021?  
On May 15, 2015 the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for 
START determined that the primary study question had been answered. Beginning H IV 
medicines right away (the Early arm) was better than waiting to start HIV medicines (the 
Deferred arm) for the primary endpoint of START and its two major outcomes, serious 
AIDS illnesses and other non -AIDS serious medical illnesses.  The DSMB 
recommend ed offering HIV medicines to participants in the Deferred arm who had not 
yet started HIV medicines.  The DSMB also recommended continued follow -up of study 
participants.  
 
START investigators and study participants were told about these recommendations, 
and participants in the deferred arm who had not started treatment were offered HIV 
medicines.  
 
This consent describes the plan for continued follow -up of START participants through 
2021.  Currently, the START study has enough funding for follow -up through 2017. If 
the request for more funding to continue follow -up through 2021 is not successful, the 
follow -up and data collection described in this consent will end in 2017.  
 
The primary reason for continuing follow -up is to find out the differences in serious  
illnesses between the Early and Deferred HIV medicines groups.  Your continuing 
participation in START is very important to our ability to learn about these long -term 
effects, even if you are now taking HIV medicines.  
 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 D-4  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL  TAKE PART IN T HE STUDY?  
All HIV -positive participants randomized to START are being invited to be in the 
extended follow -up.   
 
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE  IN THE STUDY?  
You will be in this study at least until the end of 2017.  We are asking you to consent to 
be followed thro ugh the end of 2021, because we plan to seek funding for follow -up 
through 2021.   
 
HOW WILL THE STUDY W ORK?  
If you consent, we plan to see you at clinic visits for data collection twice each year 
(about every 6 months), instead of three times a year as before.  We will follow your 
regular HIV care and collect a little additional information from you, but not as much as 
in the past.  
 
At these visits, your study doctor or nurse will ask questions about your health and your 
HIV infection and will give you a  short medical examination.  You will have about 5 -10 
mL (about 1 -2 tablespoons) of blood drawn.  This blood will be used to measure the 
amount of HIV in your blood, CD4+ cell count, and CD8+ cell count (another type of 
blood cell that is affected by HIV).    
 
Once each year, you will also have an extra 40 -55 mL (3 -4 tablespoons) of blood drawn 
to test how your kidneys and liver are working and to look at the amount of sugar and 
types of fats (called lipids) in your blood.  You will be asked to not eat anyth ing for at 
least 8 hours before these tests for sugar and lipids, and to not drink anything except 
water during that time.  You will give a urine sample which will also be tested to see 
how your kidneys are working.  
 
These results will be shared with you w hen they are available.  You will be asked what 
medicines you are taking.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At your annual visit in 2016, you will also have an electrocardiogram (ECG), a routine 
test that allows the doctor to look at the rhythm of your heart.  This involves lying on a 
table and having 10 small electrodes stuck to your skin for at least 5 minutes while the 
test is done.  This procedure does not usually hurt.  You will not have any more ECGs 
done in the study after 2016.  
 
Throughout the long -term follow -up of the study  Site instruction:  
If your site will not be collecting study -specific ECGs please remove the text 
in italics in the next paragraph.  If your site will be doing ECGs, please 
change the text to not be in italics.  
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 D-5 It is very i mportant to let your study doctor or nurse know right away if you are sick or 
injured or in the hospital.  This is important for your safety, and also for the study to 
learn more about illnesses that happen to people with HIV who are treated early (or 
defer treatment) for their HIV infection.  Your study doctor or nurse will ask you for 
permission to get medical records from your other doctors or from the hospital (if you 
were in the hospital).  You will be asked to give permission for other doctors or hosp itals 
to share this information with the study team.  
 
You should tell your study nurse or doctor before you take any other medicines or 
dietary supplements or enroll in other clinical trials.  This is important because some 
medicines should not be taken to gether.  Your study doctor or nurse will help figure out 
what medicines and supplements are safe for you to take.  
 
Your doctor may decide to see you more often than required for the study based on 
your needs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stored specimens for future research  
If you have agreed to have blood and urine specimens stored, you will be asked to give 
a 15-30 ml sample of blood (about  1-2 tablespoons) and a urine sample once each 
year.  These samples will be stored in a safe and secure laboratory in the United States 
for use in future research related to HIV infection, its complications, and the immune 
system.   
 
We will also collect a  10-mL sample of blood (about 2 teaspoons) if you change HIV 
medicines because of the amount of HIV virus in your blood or because resistance 
mutations have been detected. You will be asked for this sample before you start taking 
your new HIV medicines.  T his blood will be used sometime in the future to confirm 
whether your HIV virus had stopped responding to the HIV medicines you were taking.   
 
You and your doctor will not receive any results from tests done on these stored 
samples.  No tests of your gene s (DNA) will be done on these samples.  These samples 
will not have any information on them that can identify you by name.  There is no time 
limit on how long your samples will be stored.  You can still be in the START study even 
if you do not want to have  samples stored.   
 
HOW WILL YOU GET HIV MEDICINES?  
If you are already taking HIV medicines provided by the study, you will continue to 
receive them.  Likewise, if you begin to take HIV medicines, you may receive them from 
the study.  The study will be abl e to give you HIV medicines through 2017.  It is possible 
you will be able to get some or all HIV medicines from the study after 2017, but we do 
not know that yet.  Your study doctor or nurse will let you know at least 6 months ahead Site Instruction:

 D-6 of time if the study w ill not be able to give you some or all HIV medicines anymore.  
They will help you arrange to get HIV medicines no longer provided by the study 
through your insurance or some other program.   
 
WHAT IF YOU MOVE?  
If you move or transfer your medical care to another doctor, the study staff would like to 
continue to collect information about your health.  If you give permission, your study 
doctor or nurse will contact your new doctor and ask him or her to provide information 
about your health.  The types of inf ormation your new doctor will be asked for are 
routine things, such as results of laboratory tests (for example, CD4+ cell count and 
viral load), what medicines you are taking, and whether you have been sick.  When you 
move, you will be asked by the study staff to give permission for your new doctor to 
share this information with the study team.  Your new doctor may also ask you to give 
permission.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS OF THIS STUDY?  
This section describes risks or discomforts that you may  have.  There may be other 
risks to you (or to your baby, if you are a woman and become pregnant while taking HIV 
medicines) that we have no way of knowing about right now.  If other risks or benefits 
are found during the study, your study doctor or nurse will let you know about them right 
away.  
 
Possible risks of taking HIV medicines  
The long -term risks of using HIV medicines are not clear, and as with all medicines, 
side effects can happen.  However, your risks are no greater than taking these 
medications and not being followed in START.   
 
It is also possible for the HIV virus to dev elop resistance to any anti -HIV drug.  Longer 
follow -up in START will help us know if beginning to treat HIV earlier or later will lead to 
resistance to more HIV medicines over time.  
 
It is possible that someone could inadvertently find out that you are in fected with HIV if 
you are taking HIV medicines and someone in your household or at work notices you 
taking them.  
 
Risks of drug -drug interactions (where one medicine affects how another works)  
For your safety, you must tell your doctor or nurse about all medicines, including 
prescription, over -the-counter (non -prescription), herbal or alternative medicines, and 
dietary supplements you are taking.  This is because there may be serious side effects 
when other medicines are taken with HIV medicines.  Also, pl ease let your nurse or 
doctor know before you enroll in any other studies while on this study.  
 
Risk of transmitting HIV  
Using HIV medicines such that your viral load is undetectable has been shown to 
substantially lower your ability to transmit HIV to oth er people, but this does not work 
100% of the time.  You should continue to use precautions to make sure you do not 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 D-7 infect someone else.  Your study doctor or nurse will tell you about how to protect 
yourself and other people.  
 
Risks of blood drawing  
The r isks of having blood taken include pain, bleeding, bruising, lightheadedness, 
anxiousness, and in rare cases fainting or infection or a blood clot where the needle 
enters the body.  You may feel some anxiety while waiting for your test results to be 
availa ble.  You will have blood tests like those in this study done as part of your usual 
care, even if you decide not to be in this study.  
 
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY?  
By being in START you have already helped in improving the treatment of many people 
with HIV now and in the future.  What we learn from your continued follow -up will tell us 
more about benefits and risks of therapy.  If you stay in START, there could also be 
some direct benefit to you.  For example, by being in a research study you may fi nd out 
about treatments, services, or other things that could help you live with your HIV 
infection sooner than you would if you were not in a research study.  
 
It is also possible that you may receive no benefit from being in this study.  What we 
learn fr om this study may help us to improve the treatment of other people who are 
infected with HIV.  
 
WHAT IF THERE ARE NEW FINDINGS?  
You will be told about any new information learned during the study that might cause 
you to change your mind about staying in the  study.   
 
WHAT IF YOU DON’T WANT TO BE IN THE STUDY ANY LONGER?  
If you consent to long -term follow -up in the START study, you may decide to stop 
participating at any time.  Withdrawing from this study will not affect the benefits of your 
regular medical c are.  However, if you are receiving HIV medicines from the study, you 
will not continue to be given HIV medicines from the study after you withdraw.  Your 
doctor or nurse will help you find another way to get HIV medicines.  
 
CAN YOUR STUDY PARTICIPATION BE  STOPPED WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT?  
You may be taken off the entire study without your consent if:  
 Your study doctor decides that continuing in the study would harm you;  
 The study is cancelled by the sponsor (the University of Minnesota), the National 
Institute  of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), regulatory authorities in your 
country, or your site’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee(EC);  
 You are in jail or prison; or  
 Other administrative reasons, including a lack of funding for START stu dy follow -up 
past 2017.  
 
WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO YOU?  
<Site should insert specific information about what HIV medicines will be provided for 
free, if any> .  You, your insurance company, or some other third -party payer must pay 
INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 D-8 for all other medicines, includ ing HIV medicines not listed above and medicines needed 
to prevent or treat other illnesses.  We will provide all clinical and professional services, 
lab work, and other tests that are part of this study and not part of your regular care at 
no cost to you.   As stated above, the study may at some point no longer be able to give 
you some or all of your HIV medicines.  At that time, your study doctor or nurse will help 
you get your HIV medicines from another source.  
 
HOW IS YOUR PRIVACY PROTECTED?  
Researchers  will take  every reasonable step to keep your health information private 
and to prevent misuse of this information.  You will not be identified by name or any 
other way in any publication about this study.  You will be identified only by a number

INSIGHT PROTOCOL 001:  START   Version 4.0  
  28 August  2017  
 D-13 All of the people already in the START study are being asked to continue follow -up.    
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DUR ING THE EXTENDED FOL LOW -UP IN START?  
Starting on 01 January 2018, regular study visits are no longer required for START.  Once a 
year the staff at your study site will collect information about any HIV medicines you are taking, 
any illnesses or hospitalizations you have had, and the results of CD4, CD8, and HIV viral load 
tests that you have had.  If you are seen at the site  for your HIV care, the study staff will review 
your medical records to collect this information.  They may call you if they have questions.  
 
If you do not receive your regular heath care at the site, the research staff will contact you to 
see how you are  doing and may ask you to come in for a study visit.  If you get your regular 
HIV care at a different clinic, the site staff will ask for your written permission to get the records 
from this clinic to review.   
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS O F START?  
There are no ri sks associated with continuing your follow -up in START.  Your medical care and 
treatment will be decided by you and your regular doctor.  There are no specific study 
requirements to be followed.  All HIV medicines have some side effects.  There may also be  
long-term risks that we do not know about now.  This is true for anyone taking HIV medicines, 
whether or not you are in the START study.  Even if you are taking HIV medicines, you may 
still be able to give HIV to someone else.  Your doctor or nurse will t ell you about how to 
protect yourself and other people.  
 
We will tell you if we learn about new risks  or any other information that might be important to 
you. 
 
WHAT ARE THE BENEFIT S OF CONTINUING IN S TART?  
Taking HIV medicines can help people with HIV infe ction.  However, we do not know all of the 
effects that taking them for a long time might have on your general health.  By continuing to 
follow people like you in the START study we will learn more about these effects.  
 
WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE OTHER THAN CONTINUING IN START?  
You do not have to continue in START if you do not want to.  If you agree to continue, you can 
stop at any time.   If you choose not to continue or to stop, it will not affect your regular medical 
care.  
 
CAN YOUR PARTICIPATI ON IN START  BE STOPPED EVEN IF Y OU DON’T AGREE?  
The study doctor can take you out of START if you go to prison, or if the study is stopped by 
the study funder, sponsor, review committees (IRB/REC) or government authorities, or for 
other administrative reasons.   
 
WHO  WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR MEDICAL INFORMA TION?  
We will protect the privacy of your medical information as much as legally possible, and 
release your records only with your written permission.  We will label your study records with a 
code number and three l etters, and you will not be identified in any publications about this 
research.   However, your records may be seen by:

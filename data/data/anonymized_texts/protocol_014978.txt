Tofacitinib 5 mg immediate release formulation (IR) was approved for twice daily  (BID) 
dosing schedule by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2012 for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderatel y to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have 
had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In Febru ary 2016, an 11 mg once 
a day  (QD) modified release (MR ) tablet for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was approved 
in the United States.  It may  be used as monotherapy  or in combination with methotrexate
(MTX) or other conventional sy nthetic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs ). 
Biologic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs s (bDMARDs) have been 
used for man y years to treat RA with vary ing levels of success; however, no study  has 
compared the effectiveness and treatment patterns of tofacitinib to bDMARDs in a real -world
setting.
In stud y A3921215, a randomised controlled direct comparative clinical study conducted in 
Japan , the MR formulation did not meet the non- inferiorit y criteria based on the stringent 
criteria requested b y the Pharmaceutic al and Medical Devices Agency  (PMDA ), the 
Regulatory  Agency in Japan. However, the point estimate of the difference in efficacy  
between the MR and IR formulations, based on the primary  endpoint of Disease Activity  
Score ( DAS )28, was within the pre -specifi ed margin. Nonetheless, the data from this study  
are not sufficient to c onclude statistical similarity
 between the clinical efficacy  of MR and IR 
formulations. While randomised controlled trials (RCT) are considered high in the hierarch y 
of medical evide nce for a conventional treatment compari son, the A3921215 results may not 
be applicable to clinical practice due to many  factors including reduced adherence. Patients 
tend to demonstrate worse adherence when they  know their medication is being monitored. 
For example, i n a metanaly sis of RCTs that used electronic pill count monitors, patients had 
lower adherence in studies where they  were blinded to the fact of monitoring than in studies 
where they  were aware of the monitoring .2  Since once daily dosing is associated with 
significantl y improved adherence ,2the double- dummy  nature of A3921215 and high levels of 
patient monitoring may have masked the benefit of the MR 11 mg QDformulation relative to 
IR 5 mg BID by minimizing the variation in adherence across the two stud y arms . 
Increasingl y, there is a recognition that 
patients’ use of medicines in regular clinical practice 
or in settings better reflecting the reality  of he althcare delivery can explain differences 
between expected efficacy  based on RCT outcomes and actual effectiveness in real world.1  
Evidence from medication use in the real-world setting can help to extrapolate an d/or 
augment data obtained in randomised controlled trials and establishes a broad picture of a 
medication’s place in every day clinical practice .6
A study  comparing MR 11 mg QD and IR 5 mg BID within the Corrona R A registry  
demonstrate dthat 6 months post initiation, tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD is effective in 
managing signs and s ymptoms of RA in real world clinical use; and that it does so to a 
similar degree as tofacitinib I R 5mgBID formulation (Pfizer, data on fil e).  However, 
adherence information is not collected in the register and could not be evaluated.

Page 9 of 32This study is designed to compare the RA patient adherence betwe en patients initiating 
tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD to those starting IR 5 mg BID, and to co mpare two proxy measures 
of effectiveness in an insurance claims-based real-world data set ting.  
7. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
Primary Objectives:
To compare, through multivariate regression analyses:
•Two proxies of medication effectiveness (a validated criteria-ba sed algorithm and a 
persistence-based measure)3over 12 months of follow-up among RA patients treated 
with tofacitinib MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitinib IR 5 mg twi ce daily.
•12-month proportion of RA patients who are persistent and adhere nt with tofacitinib
MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitinib IR 5 mg twice daily.
Secondary Objectives:
To compare, through multivariate regression analyses:
•A persistence-based measure of effectiveness over 6 months of fol low-up among RA 
patients treated with tofacitinib MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitin ib IR 5 mg twice 
daily.
•A 6-month proportion of RA patients who are persistent and adher ent with tofacitinib
MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitinib IR 5 mg twice daily.

Page 10of 328.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
This study will include individuals with RA who are commercially  insured (commercial 
claims and encounters database) or Medicare -eligible retirees with employ er sponsored 
Medicare Supplemental coverage (Medicare database) who are treated with tofacitinib .
Patients must meet all of the following inclusio n criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the 
study :
1.First pharmacy  claim for tofacitinib isa 30-day supply (index event).
2.Index prescription isfor labelled dosing for tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD or IR 5 mg 
BID between 01 March 2016 and 31 October 2018 (theidentification period) (See 
Annex 2 for operationalization) .Since the specific dose frequency , ie, twice daily  or 
once dail y is not available, forthose initiating a 30 day s suppl y of tofacitinib MR 11 
mg, a quantity  of 30 pi lls is required ( ie, 1x11 mg per day ) and for those starting a 
30days suppl y of tofacitinib 5 mg, 60 pills (2x5 mg per day ) will be required. 
Patients from the overall cohort will be further assigned into MR 11 mg QD and IR 5 
mg BID subcohorts based on t heir assignment at index .
3.Continuously enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Supplemental insurance plan for 
at least one year before the index date through at least 1year after the index date.
Note: Patients will have a variable length baseline of at lea st a year long. The
baseline period will be censored at January  1,
2013 based on licensed data 
availability .  The majority  of baseline measures will use data from the 12 months 
immediately  prior to the index date. Select measures will use data during the entire 
variable length baseline.
4.Presence of The International Classification of Diseases, 9thRevision or 10th
Revision, Clinical Modification (I CD-9 CM or ICD -10 CM) code for RA (in any
position) during the one -yearpre-index period or on the index date .  
ICD-9 = 714.0x -714.4x & 714.81 or ICD10 = M05.* & M06.0*- M06.3* or 
M06.8*
-M06.9*.
5.At least 18 yearsold as of the index date .
6.At least one claim for methotrexate anytime pre -index .
8.2.2. Exclusion Criteria
Patient s meeting any of the following criteria willnot be included in any study cohort :
1.Patients with claims for other conditions for which advanced therapies (bDMARD or 
Janus Kinase inhibitor (JAK) ) are used during the one -year pre-index period or on the 
index date: anky losing spondy litis, Crohn’s diseas e, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,
juvenile idiopathic arthritis or ulcerative colitis will be excluded from the study .

2.Patients with evidence of the index medication during the one -year pre-index period .  
Patients will be allowed to have been treated with other advanced therapies defined 
as other bDMARD s or other JAK inhibitor s(not tofacitinib) during the one -year 
pre-index period.
3. Patients with more than one advanced therapy prescription fill on the index date will 
be removed from the study , ie, a bDMARD and JAK inhibitor or more than one JAK 
inhibitor or two different tofacitinib formulations (ie, IR and MR) , filled on the index 
date will be removed from the study .
8.3.Cohort Assignment
Patients will be assigned to a tofacitinib study cohort based on the firsttofacitinib claim and 
formulation observed and for which the patient meets the other inclusion/exclusion criteria
While patients may  have multiple eligible treatment episodes, only 
the first will be evaluated . 
Patients whose first tofacitinib prescription reflects a 11 mg formulation and day  suppl y 
consistent with daily  dose equal to 11 mg will be assigned to MR 11 mg  QD.  Patients whose 
first tofacitinib prescription reflects 5 mg formulation with 
a daily  dose equal to 10 mg will 
be assigned to IR 5 mg BID.  Patients are only  eligible for inclusion in one cohort.
8.4.Period of Observation
All patients will be required t o have been continuously  enrolled in the health plan for at least 
24 months (12 months prior to index, and 12 months post index, at minimum) .  Patients will 
have a variable length pre-index baseline period of at least 12 months. The12 months prior 
to the index date will be used to assess the majority of pre -index characteristics. However , 
for select measures, eg,use of methotrexate, number of prior advanced therapies, and years
since first RA diagnosis, the entire variable length baseline period will be utilized. The 
twelve months following the index date willbe used to assess outcomes including adherence, 
persistence, and medication effectiveness.
8.5.Variables
Adherence is defined as percentage of time with medication on hand and will be assessed 
with t he M edication Possession R atio (MPR) and Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) .  Both 
measures have been eval uated in numerous publications for rheumatoid arthritis and other 
conditions andwill be reported in current study for 6 and 12-month follow -up periods.   Both 

Tofacitinib
A3921349 NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Version 1, 27 March 2019
Page 12of 32adherence measures willleverage tofacitinib medication day s supply  in the numerator, for 
which PDC adjusts for overlap in prescriptions while MPR does not . Further, the PDC is a 
more conservation measure of adherence as the denominator includes al l pre-defined 
follow -up (360 day s for the 12-month period; 180 day s for the 6-month period ),which may  
include time after stopping a medication in the calculation, while MPR only  includes time 
between firstandlastprescription (plus last prescription day s supply )in the denominator .  
Patients with an MPR or PDC ≥0.8 are ty pically  characterized as adherent. ThePharmacy  
Quality  Alliance recommends use of PDCs for adherence measurements .8
The proportion of patients who are persistent with treat ment is also commonly  evaluated i
n
similar published studies and will be reported for 6 and 12-month follow -up periods .  Prior 
studies have indicated at least 1/3rdof  patients are not persistent with TNFi therap y, which is 
consistent with proportion of patients with inadequate response in clinical trials.5  This
measure takes into account patients who have not discontinued 
(gap of 60 day s between 
refills) or switched medications; however, it may  underestimate theproportion who are 
persistent depending on the duration of gap(ie, 60 vs. 90 day s) for patients tha t may  appear to 
discontinue and resume treatment for multiple reasons including hospitalization, drug samples
not recorded in claims ,use of stockpile, etc. Hence sensitivity  analy ses with different gaps 
are often employ ed. 
Two measures of effectiveness will be used in this study : 1) a validated algorithm -based, 
dichotomous measure (over the 12 month follow up period) and 2) a duration of therap y 
based co ntinuous measure of medication persistence (over 6 and 12 month follow up 
periods) . 
Among patients with at least one yearof follow up, medication effectiveness at one y ear after
the index date will be determined using an algorithm
-based prox y measure of effectiveness 
based on the following six criteria.3,7  This measure was shown to have good sensitivity , 
specificit y, positive and negative predictive values ranging from 75% to 90% using a gold 
standard of low disease activity  (DAS28 ≤3.2) or improvement in DAS28 by  >1.2 units, 
which the authors suggested was consistent with but not identical to European League 
Against Rheumatoid Arthritis (EULAR) responder definition.3
The second effectiveness prox y is length of treatment duration which captures both the 
sustained positive treatment effect as well as inefficacy , loss of efficacy  and adverse events 
as well as an y discontinuations u nrelated to treatment effect, such as costs and adherence.11  
Note that the MR and IR tofacitinib formulations have same costs. Duration of therap y has 
been used as an endpoint to demonstrate the improved effecti veness of methotrexate relative 
to other csDMARDs despite similar efficacy  in RCT .11  In this study , treatment duration was 
defined as the number of day s between index date to the first of the following: the date of last 
prescription that is followed b y a gap of 60 days without evidence of another advanced 
therap y prior to expiration of gap; the day  before receipt of another advanced therapy ; or the 
end of follow up period.

Treatment Persistent, 6 and 
12 months post-index, 
dichotomous Outcome (persistence) Patients who do not have a switch to anoth er 
advanced therapy or discontinue tofacitinib (ie, 
60-day gap between the run out of prior tofacitinib 
prescription and subsequent fill) over 6 and 
12 month follow-up periods are characterized as 
persistent.  The run out date is the prescription fill 
date + day supply – 1.  For retail outpatient 
pharmacy prescription (RX) claims, the day supply 
will be utilized.  There are no null tofacitinib days 
supply in dataset; however, claims with negative 
days supply or zero days supply will be excluded.  
Most tofacitinib prescriptions are for 30 days supply 
(86%) followed by 90 (12%) and 60 (~1%) days. 
Patients with early refills will be allowed to 
accumulate a stockpile of the index medication of up 
to 14 days for later use. 
A change in the formulation of active ingredient 
prescribed, eg, 5 mg BID vs 11 mg QD is not 
considered a switch for persistence endpoints in 
primary analyses.
Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), 6 and 12 
months post-index, 
continuousOutcome (adherence) The total days supply between the first and including 
the last tofacitinib prescription divided by the time 
between the first through and including last index 
therapy prescription days supply. Multiple 
prescriptions for the same treatment with the same 
fill date will be treated as one prescription with 
longest days supply; and for all prescriptions days 
supply will be capped at end of follow-up. MPR 
will be capped at 1.0 and will be reported at 
6 months and 12 months.
Medication Possession 
Ratio (MPR), 6 and 12

arrays for each fill or administration during the 
denominator periods of 180 and 360 days post-index. 
Patients with early refills will be allowed to stockpile 
medications up to a maximum of 14 days total for 
later use. PDC is capped at 1.0.

are no claims for any csDMARD during the 1-ye ar 
post-index for which there was not a claim during 
1-year pre -index and/or 90 days post-index .
Oral glucocorticoids 
criterionEffectiveness criterion 5 The oral glucocorticoids criterion is met if  a) For 
patients with no oral glucocorticoid prescriptions in 
the 6 months prior to index date, there is not more 
than 30 total days supply of oral glucocorticoids 
between 3 -12 months post index; b) For patients 
with at least one claim for or al glucocorticoids 
during 6 months pre -index, oral glucocorticoid dose 
does not increase during months 6 -12 post -index 
compared to the 6 months before the index date. 
Dose increase is defined as ≥20% increase in 
prednisone equivalent dose (per above) for all 
glucocorticoid claims filled during the respective 
time periods.
Note:  Patients with more than one glucocorticoid 
injection during months 3 -12 after index will be 
evaluated per the injection glucocorticoid criterion.
Injection glucocorticoid 
criterionEffectiveness criterion 6 The injectable glucocorticoids criterion is met if 
patients have one or fewer glucocorticoid injections 
during months 3 -12 after index date.  Patients having 
one or moreglucocorticoid injections on a single day 
are not considered to have failed the criterion.

followed by a gap of 60 days without evidence of 
another advanced therapy prior to expiration of gap; 
the day before receipt of another advanced therapy; 
or the end of follow up period.
A sensitivity analysis will be conducted for the 
Tofacitinib MR and IR comparison to include a

a. Analyses will be repeated stratifying by number of previous a dvanced treatments (0, 1, and 2+ prior) if 
feasible.b. The proportions of patients not meeting each of the 6 criteri a separately will be described.
8.9.2. Descriptive Analysis
All study variables, including pre- and post-index measures, wil l initially summarized 
descriptively.  In general, numbers and percentages will be pro vided for dichotomous and 
polytomous variables, while means, medians, and standard deviat ions will be provided for 
continuous variables. Missing or unavailable data will not be i mputed. 
Results will be stratified by treatment cohort, bivariate compa risons of pre- and post-index 
measures will be provided, and appropriate tests (eg, t-test, M ann Whitney-U test, chi-square 
test) will be used based on the distribution of the measure. The  analysis that is performed (ie, 
the methods that are used and the patients who are included) wi ll be specific the objective 
being examined.  Descriptive techniques will be implemented for  each objective. 
8.9.3. Multivariate Analysis
To control for possible confounding of the relationship between  the outcomes and 
independent variable of interest multivariable (logistic, gener alized linear, and Cox) 
regression models will be evaluated as described in Table 4 . 
The models will include insurance type, region, age, sex, prior advance therapies in variable 
length period (None, 1 and 2+) as covariates.  The following va riables will be evaluated for 
inclusion as a covariate and be included if differences between  MR 11 mg QD and IR 5 mg 
BID at baseline with p <0.10: 12-month pre-index use (% and mea ns) of csDMARD, opioids, 
corticosteroids and presence of comorbidities including, cardio vascular disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, kidney disease, d epression, anxiety, liver 
disease, sleep disorders, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Quan-Ch arlson comorbidity index and 
CIRAS scores, rheumatologist visit count during 1-year pre-inde x, disease duration, 
pre-index total costs, length of pre-index period, use of advan ced therapy in 12 month 
pre-index and presence of csDMARD in 90 days post-index.  
Generalized linear models (GLM) will be fit, using appropriate distributions and links for the 
nature of the data (eg, normally-distributed data with identity  link, binary data and logit link).  
Point estimates, 95 percent confidence intervals, and p-values will be presented for contrasts; 
analysis of variance table will be presented to display the stre ngth of the independent CCI

8.10. Quality Control
This is a retrospective study, so issues of quality control at st udy sites, eg, data queries, do
not apply.  Analyses are programmed according to the specificati ons in the protocol, and if
applicable, the statistical analysi s plan, and documented in a pr ogramming plan. Final
deliverables are reviewed and verified by a second, independent prog rammer who may also
perform double programming.  All quality checks are documented i n the programming plan.
8.11. Limitations of the Research Methods
Limitations that are general to claims database analyses and spe cific to this study should be
noted. First, diagnosis of autoimmune conditions will be identi fied using ICD-10-CM
diagnosis codes, which are subject to potential miscoding, though pres umably without 
respect to the treatment or outcomes. Second, the baseline peri od for this study will 
generally be 12 months long.  Therefore, patients treated with a bDMARD or tofacitinib in
the baseline can be considered to be prior users of therapy; however, pati ents with no
bDMARD or tofacitinib use in the baseline may have just been off therapy for the 12 months 
prior. Lastly, this study will include an examination of medicati on effectiveness at 1 year
among all bDMARD and tofacitinib users. Effectiveness (yes/no) wil l be measured using a 
validated algorithm; however, the algorithm was not validated for all medications being
included. Specifically, tofacitinib was approved for treatment of RA after the algorithm was
developed. This study will include consultation with physicians to determine if the algorithm 
is valid for all study medications or if modifications need to be  implemented.CCI

9.PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
9.1.Patient I nformation 
All parties will comply  with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation 
of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of patient personal data.  Such 
measures will include omitting patient names or other directl y identifiable data in an y 
reports, publications, o r other disclosures, except whe re required b y applicable laws.
To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data, when study  data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized 
parties, an y patie nt names will be removed and will be replaced by  a single, specific, 
numerical code .  All other identifiable data transferred to Pfizer or other authorized parties 
will be identified by  this single, patient -specific code .  In case of data transfer, Pfizer will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of patients’ personal data consistent 
with the vendor contract and applicable privacy  laws.
9.2.Patient 
Consent
As this study  does not involve data subject to privacy  laws according to applicable l egal 
requirements ,obtaining informed consent from patie nts by  Pfizer is not required. 
9.3.Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics C ommittee 
(IEC)
IRB is not required forthis study as it uses commercially available de- identified secondary
data sources and is considered exempt from the requirements for “human subjects research”
in the US.
9.4.Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generall y accepted research practices 
described in CT24 -WI-GL02 -RF04 and the International Society forPharmacoeconomics 
and Outcomes Research (I SPOR).
10.MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVERSE EVEN TS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This study  involves data that exist as structured data by  the time of study  start or a 
combination of existing structured data and unstructured data, which will be converted to 
structured form during the implementation of the protocol solely  by a computer using 
automated/algorithmic me thods, such as natural language processing.

Page 25of 32In these data sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not 
possible to link (ie, identify  a potential association between) a particular product and medical 
event for an y individu al.  Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (AE) (ie, 
identifiable patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met.
11.PLANS FOR DISSEMINAT ING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
For all publications relating to the Study ,Pfizer will comply with recognized ethical
standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, 
established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the part y responsible for collecting data 
from the participant is aware of an y new information which might influence the evaluation of 
the benefits and risks of a Pfizer product , Pfizer s hould be informed immediately .

NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  5  Section 2: Introduction  
1) Background and rationale   
Improving diabetes health is a public -health imperative. Diabetes mellitus affects 30.3 million people 
in the US and is a leading cause of disability and cardiovascular disease.1 In 2017, total costs for type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the US were $327 billion.2 Low-income individuals in the US  have twice the 
odds of T2DM3 compared to the general population. More than 30% of low -income households are also 
food insecure,4 defined as having limited access to nutritious food for a healthy life. Food insecurity is 
associated with poor diabetes control ,9,10 morbidity, and mortality7,8 via worsened nutrition (diet quality, 
obesity), mental health (stress, depression), and health behaviors (non- adherence, missed clinic 
visits).5,6 Behavioral coping strategies triggered by food insecurity, such as purchasing and consuming 
cheap, energy -dense foods,7,8 can persist into periods of food security, altering dietary habits and 
continuing to undermine diabetes health.9,10  
Diabetes -healthy food support may improve diabetes health for low -income individuals, yet its 
optimal design, positioning (i.e. within healthcare vs. nutrition safety -net), and effectiveness is still 
unresolved. Our preliminary work shows that diabetes -healthy food support is feasible and may 
improve T2DM health for low -income individuals .11,12 Yet where and how such food support is located 
may affect its impact on diabetes health. For instance, food pantries may not be the optimal setting for 
direct provi sion of  diabetes self -management education with food support  to improve T2DM 
outcomes .13 Alternatively, locating medically  tailored food support within healthcare- related settings, 
integrated into diabetes self -management programs, may be a more effective strategy to support the 
nutritional and self -management needs of low -income people with T2DM.  
The Diabetes Self -Management Program (DSMP) is a national, evidence- based ,14-16 ancillary 
healthcare service providing group- based diabetes self -management education to people with diabetes 
over 6 weeks. The DSMP covers topics such as healthy eating, exercise, medication use, and symptom management, but does not address structural barriers to diabetes self- management, such as reduced 
access to diabetes -healthy food, which may limit its effectiveness in vulnerable populations .
16,17 While 
consistent access to diabetes -healthy food is essential for ongoing diabetes self -management, insights 
from psychology and economics suggest that  access to healthy food may also promote behavior change and support habit formation for diabetes -healthy diets
17-19. Providing diabetes -healthy food 
support together with the DSMP may be  a promising strategy to improve T2DM outcomes for low -
income individuals who face resource and behavioral constraints to healthy eating.  
Together with our partner s Project Open Hand, a non- profit organization providing healt hy 
food support to chronically ill individuals, and the Contra Costa Health System , a county safety -
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  6  net health system, we are conducting  the Nutrition  Supported Diabetes Education Program 
(NU-DSMP) Pilot Study . Our goal for this pilot randomized trial  is to investigate the feasibility, 
acceptability and preliminary impact of a novel, multicomponent diabetes health intervention. N U-
DSMP will provide 12 weeks  of diabetes -healthy  food support and nutrition case- management  to 
low-income individuals with T2DM, in conjunction with participation in a DSMP group.  
2) Objectives  
Aim 1: Conduct planning to refine the design of the NU -DSMP intervention and study  
procedures. Conduct expert consultation and stakeholder meetings across diabetes clinical 
providers,  diabetes self -management educators, nutrition organizations and health care payers 
and organizations to  refine the NU -DSMP intervention and identify and set up procedures with 
new study partners  responsive to conducting the study in the context of COVID -19. 
 
Aim 2: Pilot test the NU -DSMP intervention among low -income individuals with T2DM,  
compared to the DSMP alone, to assess feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on diabetes  health. We will randomize a total of 72 adults living with T2DM 1:1 to the 
intervention (diabetes -healthy  food support plus the DSMP) or control (DSMP only) arms and 
conduct surveys and medical record review  at baseline (DSMP start), 6 weeks (DSMP ends - 
survey only), 12 weeks (end of food intervention), and 24 weeks (to assess durability). Control 
participants will receive diabetes -healthy food support at th e end of  the 24- week follow -up 
period. The primary outcome is glycemic control (HbA1c); secondary outcomes are health-
related quality of life, acute care utilization and hypoglycemic episodes. We will also assess  
intermediate outcomes including preliminary impact on nutrition, mental health, and behavioral  
parameters.  
 Aim 3: Conduct process evaluation to understand strengths and weaknesses of the  
intervention and trial design. We will collect and analyze qualitative in -depth interview data 
from at  least 25 intervention participants to explore perceived benefits and challenges of the 
intervention, program  adherence and satisfaction, and suggestions for implementation. We will 
also review nutrition case- management  notes from intervention participants and collect 
administrative data on intervention exposure (number of food deliveries received and case-
management sessions received). Quantitative data from intervention and control participants will 
assess food utilization, feasibility and the acceptability of  study procedures, and acceptability of 
the control condition.  
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  7  Section 3: Study Methods   
1) Trial design  
A pragmatic RCT among low -income individuals with T2DM  will be conducted to test the 
feasibility, acceptability , and preliminary impact of NU-DSMP , a twelve -week  diabetes -
healthy food support and nutrition case- management intervention provided in conjunction 
with participation in a DSMP group, compared to  participation in a DSMP group alone. 
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention (n= 36) versus control (n= 36), using 
a parallel design.  
 
2) Intervention description  
NU-DSMP Intervention: The NU -DSMP intervention builds a diabetes -tailored nutrition 
intervention into the delivery of routine evidence- based group- based diabetes self -management 
education.  
 
Base condition provided to both study arms : Diabetes Self -Management Program (DSMP):  
The Diabetes Self -Management Program (DSMP) is an evidence- based diabetes self -
management  education program consisting of weekly group sessions covering healthy eating, 
exercise, medication use,  and symptom management. Real -world DSMP programs in English 
and Spanish will be used as the base condition in both intervention and control arms  for testing 
the additional benefit of the nutritional  intervention. We are not testing the impact of the DSMP 
nor altering the program in any way. We are testing the impact of diabetes -tailored food support 
in a population receiving the DSMP.  
 
NU-DSMP Intervention:  
The intervention will provide:  
1) Diabetes- healthy food support : Twelve weeks of diabetes -healthy food support consisting 
of both meals and groceries (weekly meal delivery; monthly grocery box delivery) meeting 
American Diabetes  Association guidelines and approximately one- third of daily energy 
requirements. Food support will include medically tailored meals , produced and home- delivered 
by Project Open Hand, and grocery boxes focused on diabetes -healthy, shelf -stable items  from 
Project Open Hand's grocery center, plus a hand- out with nut ritional information and recipes.  
 
2) Nutrition case -management : Experienced Project Open Hand client services staff will 
provide three individualized encounters with intervention participants to set up and support their 
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  8  receipt of medically  tailored meals and groceries, including assessing preferences and any 
barriers, troubleshooting any issues  with the intervention, and checking on participant well -
being.  
 
Additional services provided to the control condition:  
Control condition: After 24 -week follow -up (or about 6 months), control participants will receive 
monthly  diabetes -healthy, home -delivered grocery boxes  for three months  focused on diabetes -
healthy, shelf -stable items , plus educational materials  with nutritional information and recipes.  
 
5) Data collection   
Study measurements using surveys and medical record review will be assessed at 
baseline, 6 weeks (end of DSMP), 12 weeks (end of food intervention), and at 24 weeks (to assess durability of any improvements). Qualitative interviews will be collected between weeks 12 and 24 to explore participant experiences in the study as part of our process evaluation.  
 
At baseline , 6 weeks, 12 weeks , and 24 weeks  the following data will be collected  in both arms : 
a) Surveys.  Trained UCSF research assistants (RAs), including Spanish/English bilingual RAs, 
will administer the structured interview either over the phone or in person, depending on 
public health protocols and acceptability of in- person visits to participants due to COVID -19. 
When visits are conducted in- person, interviews will take place in private offices at POH, in a 
private room at the  partner clinic (if available), in a private location at a community space 
(e.g., library, community center), or at a private location of the participants choosing (e.g. , 
home visit).  
The content of the interviews will cover : 
• Socio-demographic information.  
• Food insecurity and diet quality . 
• Physical activity . 
• Mental health (e.g depressive symptoms,  diabetes distress , self-efficacy for following 
T2DM recommendations ). 
• Diabetes m edications  
• Adherence to T2DM medications . 
• Health- related quality of life. 
• Diabetes  co-morbidities (e.g. , nephropathy, retinopathy) . 
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  9  • In addition, at 6-week, 12- week , and 24- week follow- up, the structured interview will also 
include questions to assess participant experiences in the intervention and control 
conditions (i.e. , food utilization such as sharing  or waste), barriers to intervention use, 
and program satisfaction in DSMP and food program).   
 
b) Medical record review (baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks ). Medical records from CCHS will 
be used during recruitment to confirm  the following eligibility criteria:  T2DM diagnosis, 
HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%, and other  clinical exclusion criteria (i.e. , stage 5 chronic 
kidney disease or on/recommended to be on dialysis, type 1 diabetes) . In addition, they will 
confirm whether a patient has uncontrolled T2DM (<9% vs. ≥9%) for frequency monitoring 
during randomization. CCHS will provide the following data abstracted from their medical 
records  from 6 months prior to enrollment through 9 months after enrollment: 1) HbA1c 
values (point of care test and lab serum  results ); 2) utilization of acute care, including 
hospitalizations and emergency department use; and 3) weight and height.  
 
c) Qualitative interviews .  
In-depth, semi -structured qualitative interviews of up to 90 minutes will be  
conducted with at least 25 (or until saturation)  between weeks 12 and 24 of the study . We 
will interview completers and non -completers to understand barriers to study participation. 
The interviews will be  grounded in a phenomenological perspective that centers 
understanding participant experience, combined  with content analysis to allow focus on 
specific domains of interest. We will include questions about  perceived health benefits (or 
lack thereof) due to the intervention, reasons for intervention adherence or  non-
adherence, preferences for meal and grocery box design, barriers and facilitators to 
program  participation, pos itive and negative intervention experiences, and suggestions for 
implementation.  Interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed.  
 
d) Administrative records from POH . POH will provide the following information:  
o Records of receipt of delivered food. POH will provide administrative records of weekly delivered food for each participant.  
 
4) Randomization   
72 participants  will be randomized  1:1 to the intervention and control arms . Given the 
small sample size, we will not stratify randomization; however, our lead statistician will monitor frequencies of sex at birth and poor diabetes control (A1c < 9%, vs. ≥ 9%)  in 
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  10  each randomization arm. Significant imbalances may be corrected by temporarily shifting 
the randomization scheme to preferentially recruit participants into the arm with the 
underrepresented characteristic. Details of the randomization method is stored securely 
in REDCap. Randomization based on a computer -generated assignment will occur after 
the participant has provided informed consent and completed baseline assessments.   
5) Sample size    
We will enroll 72 adults with T2DM 1:1 to intervention or control, such that each study arm will  
have 36 people.  This sample size balances  organizational capacity to implement the 
intervention within R21 cost and time constraints, with our goal  to assess feasibility and 
preliminary impact in this population. As a feasibility trial, this study is not  powered to detect 
impact on our primary outcome, HbA1c; however, effect sizes from this study will be used to 
power a possible future full -scale trial of the NU -DSMP intervention, if the study deems it is  
feasible, acceptable, and preliminarily effective.    
6) Framework  
The superiority hypothesis testing framework  will be used , testing whether exposure to the 
intervention results in better outcomes than exposure to the control arm. Comparisons will be 
presented as differences between arms in changes in outcomes from baseline to follow- up.  
7) Statistical interim analyses and stopping guidance  
a. Information in interim analyses specifying what interim analyses will be carried out and listing time points  
i. None planned   
b. Any planned adjustment of the significance level due to interim analysis  
i. No  
c. Details of guidelines for stopping the trial early  
i. None  
  
8) Timing of final analyses   
Analysis is planned to begin in June 2022  upon completion of all field data collection in May 
2022, when the 12-week  follow- up of all participants is done. Analysis to evaluate the durability 
of the intervention will commence after the end of 24 weeks  of follow -up (August 2022 ).   
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  11  7) Timing of outcome assessments    
Research staff will administer surveys  at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks , and 24 weeks  in both 
study arms . Data will be collected within a window period around each data collection time point 
of up to 1 month.    
Section 4: Statistical Principles    
1) Confidence intervals and P Values  
a. Level of statistical significance.  No significance testing will be conducted unless 
required by a journal. We will report 95% confidence intervals and exact p- values (or 
p<0.001).  
b. Description and rationale for any adjustment for multiplicity and, if so, detailing how 
the type I error is to be controlled.  The primary outcomes were established in the  
protocol, and thus no adjustments will be made for multiplicity.  
c. Confidence intervals to be reported. 95% confidence intervals will be reported alongside 
exact p -values.  
  
2) Adherence and protocol deviations   
a. Definition of exposure to the intervention and how this is assessed including 
extent of exposure:  
Adherence to the intervention will be assessed through the following mechanisms:  
i. Case management: Attends at least the first case management session  (out of 
3)  
ii. Meals : Receives meals at least 5 0% of intervention weeks (>= 6 weeks of 
meals) .   
iii. Groceries: Receives at least 1 grocery box  
b. Description of how adherence to the intervention will be presented  – Adherence 
to the intervention will be presented through a brief description in the narrative 
summarizing the percent of weekly engagement with meal deliveries  (out of 12 weeks) , 
% of grocery boxes received (out of 3 boxes) , and % of food reported eaten, as well as 
% of case management sessions attended (out of 3) .  
c. Protocol deviation. The following are pre- defined minor protocol violations:   
i. Participants that for any reason are not seen within the visit window (up to 1 
month later).   
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  12  ii. Investigators miss giving a questionnaire or a section of the questionnaire to 
the participant.  
The following are pre- defined major protocol violations:  
i. Participants that are mistakenly enrolled in the study without meeting the 
inclusion criteria.   
ii. Participants in the control arm receiving meals or groceries from Project  
Open Hand during the active intervention period (baseline to 3 months).   
iii. Participants for whom informed consent was not obtained prior to any study -
specific procedures.  
iv. Lapse in study approval   
The number (and percentage) of participants with major and minor protocol deviations will be 
summarized by arm with details of type of deviation provided. The participants that are included 
in the ITT analysis data set will be used as the denominator to calculate the percentages. No formal statistical testing will be undertaken.  
  
3) Analysis populations.  
a. Intention- to-treat.  The primary analysis will be intent to treat (ITT). The ITT analysis 
will include all participants in both arms who were enrolled and completed all baseline assessments, regardless of if they received the intervention or not.   
b. Per protocol.  A secondary analysis will be per -protocol, including control participants 
with baseline and follow -up evaluations who did not have any major protocol 
violations, and intervention participants with baseline and follow -up evaluations who 
adhered to the intervention (i.e., attended at least the first case management 
session , received 1 out of 3 grocery boxes , and received  home -delivered meals  at 
least 50% of weeks in intervention period), and no major protocol violations.   
Section 5: Trial Population  
1) Screening Data    
a. Participants  will be recruited  from Contra Costa Health Services  (CCHS) , a safety -net 
county health system serving low -income individuals in Contra Costa  County  in the San

baseline characteristics.   
Section 6: Analysis   
1)  Outcome definitions   
Primary Outcome Measures:  
1. Hemoglobin A1c.  We will collect HbA1c from the medical record at  twelve  weeks and 
twenty -four weeks , The change in HbA1c  levels (%)  from baseline to twelve weeks by study 
arm will be reported .  
2. F ood security.  Food insecurity will be measured with the 10-item adult module  USDA 
Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM), validated in many populations. The 
score ranges from 0 to  10. Higher scores indicate higher severity of food insecurity.  The 
change in the food insecurity scores from baseline to twelve weeks  by study arms will be 
reported.  
Secondary Outcome Measures:  
1. Glucose control . The change in the proportion of participants with glucose control, defined as 
HbA1c <9%, from baseline to twelve weeks  by study arms will be reported . 
2. Low  food security . Food security as a binary response will be assessed , identifying a 
participant having low or very low food security or food security ( vs. food security or marginal 
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  16  food secure) by study arm. The change in the proportion of participants having food security 
from baseline to twelve weeks by study arm will be reported.  
3. Health -related quality of life (HRQL).  Health -related quality of life will be measured using the 
Summary Index of Unhealthy  Days collected via the CDC Healthy Days scale. This scale asks 
the number of days in  the past 30 days the person felt physically or mentally unwell. The 
summary index  then estimates the number of recent days when a person's physical and 
mental health was good (or better) and is calculated by subtracting the number of unhealthy 
days  from 30 days. The change in healthy days from baseline to twelve weeks by study arm  
will be reported.   
4. F ruit and vegetable consumption. Dietary information using the Dietary Screener 
Questionnaire (DSQ) will be collected.  The DSQ obtains information on the frequency of 
consumption of fruits and vegetables. These responses are then converted to cup equivalents 
per day using a scoring algorithm based on the NHANES 24- hour recall.  The change in  fruit 
and vegetable  consumption (servings/day) from baseline to twelve weeks by study arm will be 
reported.  
5. A dded sugar consumption . Dietary information using the Dietary Screener Questionnaire 
(DSQ) will be collected.  The DSQ obtains information on the frequency of consumption of food 
items with added sugars.  These responses are then converted to teaspoon equivalents per 
day using a scoring algorithm based on the NHANES 24- hour recall. Added sugars 
consumption (teaspoon equivalents per day ) from baseline to twelve weeks by study arm will 
be reported.  
6. D epressive symptoms.   The 8- item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -8) will be used to 
evaluate depressive symptoms. The PHQ -8 score ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores 
indicating higher levels of depression. The change in PHQ -8 scores from baseline to twelve 
weeks by  study arm will be reported.  
7. D iabetes self-efficacy . The 8- item Diabetes Self -Efficacy scale will be used to assess 
confidence in one's  ability to manage numerous self -care behaviors. The scores ranges from 
8 to 40, with higher scores indicating more confidence in self -managing their diabetes. The 
changes in the scores from baseline to twelve weeks by study arm will be reported.  
 
Other Pre -specified Outcome Measures:  
 
1. Durability of HbA1c after intervention end. To evaluate durability of changes, if any, in 
HbA1c after the intervention ended, the change in HbA1c levels (%) from 12 weeks to 24 weeks by study arm will be reported.  
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  17  2. Durabili ty of glucose control  after intervention end. To evaluate durability of changes, if 
any, in glycemic control after the intervention ended, the change in the percent of 
participants with HbA1c levels less than 9% from 12 weeks to 24 weeks by study arm will 
be reported.  
3. Durabil ity of health-related quality of life after intervention end.  To evaluate the durability 
of changes, if any, in health-related quality of life, the change in healthy days from 12 
weeks to 24 weeks by study arm will be reported.  
 
2) Analysis methods   
a. Preliminary/Descriptive analyses.  Frequency tables for all variables and measures of 
central tendency and variability for continuous variables will characterize the sample and 
be stratified by randomization arm to check for non- equivalence. If the two arms differ at 
baseline on any covariates, the Rubin causal model (e.g., propensity scores, double-
robust estimation)  will be used  to obtain the desired marginal effect estimates under the 
counterfactual assumption of balanced arm. Although the computerized da ta collection 
protocol and the presence of an interviewer should minimize missing data, the analyst 
will examine patterns of non- response, and inspect distributions of mediating and 
outcome variables to identify outlying or unusual values and assess distributional characteristics. V alidity and reliability of scale constructs via confirmatory factor analysis 
and internal consistency  will be verified .  
  
b. Analyses for Aim 2 (Diabetes and other health  and behavioral  outcomes):  The 
intervention is intended to improve clinical and other health and behavioral outcomes 
suggested by our intervention model. Although we are not powered to detect changes in 
HbA1c, we will test the preliminary hypothesis that the NU- DSMP  intervention will lead 
to improved (i.e., lower) mean HbA1c (primary outcome). For the primary analysis, an intent -to-treat analysis  will be performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  
implemented as a linear regression of the follow -up HbA1c closest to the 12- week 
assessment date on a categorical variable for randomization arm,  baseline HbA1c  and 
the number of days between the baseline and follow -up HbA1c value. This model was 
selected  to maximize use of available medical record HbA1c data.  
 
Secondary outcomes (collected via survey  at 12 and 24 weeks ) will be analyzed using 
the Stata mixed procedure assessing whether the intervention resulted in differentially 
improved changes from baseline to twelve weeks  in the primary outcome. The model will 
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  18  specify mixed (i.e., fixed and random) effects, be estimated by maximum likelihood, use 
all the longitudinal data, and account for variability among and within and individuals 
using an exchangeable covariance structure. The fixed effects specified will be arm 
(intervention or control), visit (baseline or six months), and their interaction as a product 
term. The random effect will be individuals. The model is equivalent to a repeated-
measures or differences -indifferences model. The interaction term estimates  the 
difference- in-differences. A fully fixed -effects model (with individuals as a fixed rather 
than random effect) and an analysis of covariance with the outcome at 12 weeks 
regressed on the outcome at baseline and arm will be examined as robustness check s.   
  
Additional analyses will be done to a) check robustness if the two arms differ at baseline 
by controlling for the propensity score (or the covariates that were important in the 
propensity score); and b) adjust for medication use.  
  
For primary and secondary outcomes, Box -Cox transformations will be used to correct 
for skewness if needed.   
  
c. Analyses for aim 3 (process evaluation ). 
Quantitative process evaluation data (structured interview and administrative data) and qualitative data (interviews and weekly team meetings) will be analyzed separately and then compared to cross -validate findings and generate lessons learned. Qualitativ e data 
analysis will be performed using content coding procedures to identify key themes using 
Dedoose software. Emergent themes will be identified and coded inductively . Coding 
consensus will be considered when transcripts achieve ≥90 percent coder agreem ent.  
 
3) Sensitivity analysis  
a. No sensitivity analyses will be done beyond those described above.  
  
4) Subgroup analysis  
a. Additional models and statistical interactions (i.e., product terms) will be performed to 
identify  characteristics of individuals who most benefitted from the intervention, such as  
biological sex, food insecurity, poor T2DM control (A1c ≥ 9), and insulin use.  
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  19  5) Missing data  
The study will use several strategies to account for and address missing data. Missing data will 
be categorized into missed individual questions and missed visits.  
a. Missed individual questions:  Multiple imputation will be used to address incomplete data 
under the weak assumption that incomplete data arise from a conditionally missing- at 
random  mechanism (MAR) rather than the missing- completely -at-random process 
assumed by ad hoc methods such as listwise deletion. Auxiliary variables will be 
included to help meet the MAR assumption and sensitivity analyses will be conducted with weighted multiple imputation to assess the MAR assumption. Information on percent of questio ns missing and imputed will be reported for each variable as appropriate in 
study manuscripts.   
b. M
issed visits:  When a participant misses a visit, this will be noted in the study register, 
and no data will be imputed for this participant for that visit.   
  
6) Additional analyses   
a) Durability of health benefits:  To assess whether any improvements in primary  or secondary 
outcomes were sustained in the intervention arm, researchers  will estimate effects of the 
intervention on outcomes measured at 24 weeks  using the same statistical modeling 
techniques as the main outcomes measured at 12 weeks . Mixed models specifying two visit 
fixed effects  will be used , one for differences between baseline and twelve weeks and one 
specifying differences between twelve and twenty -four weeks . The rand om effect will be 
individuals.  
 
7) Harms  Research will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the U.S. 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 CFR (Part 50 – Protection of Human Subjects and 
Part 56 – Institutional Review Boards), and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
  a) Data safety: P articipant confidentiality will be prioritized following  strict guidelines on 
privacy. For the proposed study, all data will be collected in private and be handled as confidentially as possible within the law. For interviews  and medical record data collected as 
part of the  study, participants will be assigned a unique study identification number, and the 
participant’s name or other public identifiers (e.g., phone number, address) will not be included with any data. All consent and other material with personal identifiers (e .g., 
recruitment and follow -up tracking  documents) will be kept separately from all data sources. 
NU-DSMP Protocol and Analysis Plan  20  The project manager will keep consent materials in a locked cabinet in a locked office and/or 
in a password protected file on an encrypted computer. Research assistants and support staff will be trained on procedures for maintaining privacy and will sign a  pledge of 
confidentiality. All electronic records (computer, online, audio- recorder) will be password  
protected and encrypted to prohibit illicit access. When these procedures are followed, it is highly unlikely that any information revealed by participants during the study will be disclosed to the analyst or anyone outside the research team.   
  
b) Adverse events. The PI  will report all serious events and problems having to do with 
participant safety to UCSF’s Human Research Protection Program within ten working days. 
All serious adverse events and events associated with the study participation will be 
reported in writing. Dr. Palar  will annually provide a discussion of any problems noticed 
during the previous year of the study to the UCSF Human Research Protection Program during the annual review. Participants will be provided with information on how  to contact 
the study staff to report serious adverse events and adverse events associated with study participation.  Field staff will be trained to collect information about serious adverse events 
that will be sent to the study principal investigators. All serious adverse events related to the 
study, will be reported by arm. No formal statistical analysis will be done.  
8) Statistical software   
The following software systems will be used in the analysis: 1) Stata SE version 14 [College 
Station, TX: StataCorp LP]; Stat Transfer 14.

2. Action Steps after  Consent Call  
3. Action Steps after Consent & BL complete  
4. Randomize  
5. Orientation Call  & Scheduling Assessments  
6. Assessment Calls  
7. Closing steps  
 
Update the Tr acking database & Coversheet as needed after each step  and point of contact . 
 
General Note: Individuals are “Lost to Follow Up” if RAs have attempted to contact them three 
times, using at least 2 different methods of contact (vm/text/email), over 3 weeks. If the 
individual contacts after that, proceed with their next steps. Update the recruitment tracking 
doc accordingly.  
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
Daily To Do:  
1. Check iKinnect@ebpi.org  for new emails (particularly fro m Calendly ) and voice messages  (received via 
email)  
2. Check SurveyMonkey for new entries in Referral form  and Eligibility screen  
a. Update the Summative Eligibility  Tracking database  with new entries  in both ‘Referrals 
Tracking’ and ‘Referrals Received’ tabs  
b. Skip to step 2 if there is a new eligibility screen entry  
3. Check the day of the week folder in Box  (i.e., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for follow ups needed that day  
4. Check Eligibility Tracking  Database  ‘Referrals Received’ tab for any follow up needed  
a. Note: referrals who have not had initial point of contact don’t have coversheets yet, so RAs 
need to monitor the tracking database  
 
Weekly To Do  for Experts : 
1. Send email update to Experts on how many referrals were received from their teams  
 
On Fridays:  
• Check all other daily folders for any stragglers (coversheets that were not in the proper folder).  
• Do follow ups as needed and place coversheet in appropriate folder for the following week  
o Send reminder emails/texts to participants that have assessments o n the following Monday.  
• Review the Pending folder and tracking sheet to determine what is needed for the following week and 
sort into folders accordingly  
• Move all coversheets in Friday folder into pending if no follow up is needed the next week, or if 
comp leted move it to the ‘Complete’ folder.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
Step 1: Initial Call / Eligibility screen  / Roll into Consent Walkthrough  
1. Parents interested in participating may schedule an appointment for a phone call  via Calendly  to learn 
more about the study via the  website:  www.ikinnectapp.com

Great, thank you!  
 
Describe app and goal of study  
o We have created an app called iKinnect  to help parents set expectations and reward teen’s 
positive behavior s and to help  parents monitor their teen’s whereabouts.   
iKinnect RCTs Protocol – Parents / Youth  
 
3 
V3 | April 1, 2019  • Describe study participation briefly  
o If you were to participate in the study, we would ask you and your teen to use iKinnect or 
another a pp called Life360 for 12 weeks. And we would interview you a few times throughout 
the study to get your feedback.   
• Describe payment  
o You will be able to earn up to $240 and your teen  will be able to earn up to $140  
• Does this still sound like something you’d  like to do?  
o If interested, do screen on the phone and roll into consent if eligible ( 8 mins)  
o Do you have a little more time  to go through our quick eligibility and consent with me  right 
now ? If your teen can be with you that would great, or with your perm ission we can call them at 
a different time to go over the same information.  
▪ If Yes, go to the eligibility  
▪ If No, explain RA will send text or email with link to screen and ask to complete as soon 
as possible  
 
Eligibility  
Note to RA: make sure to be actively reviewing the answers as you enter them so you can tell parent at the end 
if they are eligible or not  
 
• Parent Eligibility questions  
• Teen eligibility questions   
• In addition to other eligibility criteria, if Yes to arrested / jail or juvenile detention center / 
juvenile justice syst em questions AND/OR scores 6+ on Achenbach, they are eligible  
• If eligible, go to Consent  
• If ineligible, let them know they are not eligible to participate based on the answers in the survey, 
thank them for their time and end call  
• If they want to know why, explain reason they were ineligible  
• If eligible clarify what kind of services teen is  receiving  
• “In our eligibility screen, you said that your teen is currently receiving services for problem 
behaviors. Could you describe the type of services they are  receiving?  (i.e., 
MST/FFT/Strengthening Families/High Fidelity Wraparound services) ”  
• Make sure we have their full mailing address  
 
Consent  walk through:  
<< send them email or text with link  to consent (email template is in ikinnect email) >>  
I just sent you an email /text  with the link to the consent form. If you want to fill it out /review  as we talk, I can 
give you a second to pull that up . Or after we go through all the detai ls during our call today I will send you a 
text to get your written consent to formally enroll in the study.   
 
Describe participation  
• You and your teen will be randomized to use iKinnect or Life360  after the next steps for enrollment are 
completed, and we will be helping you to get setup with the app when we get to that point.  
• If you’re randomly assigned to use iKinnect, with your permission, we’ll reach out to your therapist to 
get their feedback. If you’re okay with this, please sign the release form that I will send to you 
separately after this call.  
iKinnect RCTs Protocol – Parents / Youth  
 
4 
V3 | April 1, 2019  • There are 4 phone calls & surveys, the 1st one is right now, then we’ll do one once a month during your 
12-week participation  
 
Describe payment  
• You’ll be  paid up to $240, and your teen will be paid up to $140; we’ll send you a check after each 
survey is completed and the consent form lists the amount for each of these.  
• Because it is very important for the research to get the surveys completed on time, we will be able to 
provide 2 bonuses. For you, each bonus will be $30 and for TEEN each bonus will be $20  
o You will get the 1st bonus when you complete 3 out of the 4 surveys  
o And the 2nd bonus when all 4 surveys are completed  
• The checks will be made out to yo u, PARENT, and will be mailed from Chase Bank, so please keep eye 
out for Chase envelopes.  
 
Risks  
• The consent form also includes  minor  potential risks involved with participation, but I will verbally go 
through them here and explain what we will be doing to minimize these risks  
o The minor potential risks include the following: you and/or your teen may feel uncomfortable 
sharing your opinions during our phone calls, you may disagree about how to use the app , you 
may feel uncomfortable about using the app in a public space, and the others have to do with 
confidential ity, privacy, and feeling pressured to participate.  
▪ Right away, I want to let you both know that both of your participation in the study, at 
all times, are completely voluntary. You should never feel pressured to do anything in the 
study that you do not want to do.  
▪ Regarding the phone calls we do, as I mentioned before, we w ill only be asking for your 
feedback about your experience with the app. We will not ask for personal stories . We 
will however encourage you to tell us everything that is on your mind –positive and 
negative feedback - because that will be extremely helpful for us as we try to make 
improvements to iKinnect.  
▪ In terms of your use of the app – whether that is iKinnect or Life360 – we will ask you 
both to use the app on a regular basis, whatever that means to you. After your next 
steps are done, we will schedule another call to orient you to the various feature i n the 
app that you’ll be using, but from there you will be able to decide how/when/where you 
want to use the app.  
▪ To safeguard confidentiality and privacy, we will be assigning both you and your teen 
with unique st udy identification numbers. These study ID  numbers will be associated to 
the feedback you provide – whether that is verbal over the phone or the answers you 
select in the survey questions – in this way we are de -identifying your information  so it is 
basically not traceable back to you . The surveys  will also ask for the last four digits of 
your cell phone number just to make sure we know who filled out the survey and make 
sure to send you the payment.  
• Your participation will not affect your legal status or any services you may be receiving  
• <say thi s if didn’t say it while explaining minor potential risks> Both you and TEEN’s  participation are 
completely voluntary  at all times , and you can choose to decline /stop at any time.  
• Finally, We will also ask for your agreement on something call the HIPAA Authorization, which is 
something we’re required to get because this is a research study involving people and we collect 
information that is considered “protected health information”. For us we would only have your 
iKinnect RCTs Protocol – Parents / Youth  
 
5 
V3 | April 1, 2019  name/address/phone number, demographics, and that your youth is receiving services. The 
authorization just gives us permission to disclose PHI if we are required to do so for auditing purposes. 
This information is federally protected f rom being used in any kind of legal proceeding and it is 
essentially only accessible by the research staff.”  
 
• Now that you know more about the study, are you still interested?  
o If Yes, Get parent’s consent for teen : PARENT, do you give permission for your t een to 
participate in our study?  
▪ Would  it be okay for us to contact  your teen separately ? Or would you prefer it to be at a 
time when you will also be there?   
• If yes  to contacting teen separately , 
o What is the best way to reach the teen?  
o We’ll give them a call later today, if you see them before that time, please 
let them know I’ll be calling  
 
Let them know Next Steps:  
• As I mentioned  earlier, I will send you   
o A text with a consent statement , if you don’t have any questions and understand everything we 
talked about today,  would you be able to take a look at that and send a text response back 
while I’m on the phone with you?  Please let me know right away if you have any questions or 
concerns . 
o <<if they want to review consent>> an email with the link to the consent form, which has 
everything we just talked about here. Please take a look at that with TEEN and provide your 
electronic signature s together . 
• In the email, there is a link that wil l take you to the first set of study surveys I mentioned earlier. You 
will need your Study ID number for this. If you have something to write on, I can tell it to you now.  
o If driving or otherwise can’t take down the ID number, let them know you will text i t to them  
o To get you and your teen speedily through the enrollment process and ready to go for the 12 
weeks, can we plan to do our next call later this week/early next week? This just means that 
your baseline survey and your teen’s baseline survey will nee d to be completed before we do 
that call.  
o This next call will be so that we can walk you through setup of the app that you will be asked to 
use in the study and will take about 15 -20 minute long  
 
 
Go to Step 2 for Action Steps  
 
 
Assent Call with Youth / consent with 18 youth adult  
• Go through the Youth Assent Form with them (don’t need to say it word for word or in that order)  
o Main points:  
▪ Participation is completely voluntary  
▪ Payment information  
▪ App randomization  
▪ Baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 + brief phone call interviews  
▪ Potential minor risks and how we minimize them  
iKinnect RCTs Protocol – Parents / Youth

V3 | April 1, 2019  ▪ Answer questions  
o RA fill out the form on SurveyMonkey  
▪ Ask and get Verbal answers:  
• Do you understand that your participation is completely voluntary?  
• If you are willing and interested, do you want to participate in our study?  
▪ If parent sent text consent, also send Text Consent language to teen  and get their 
written consent  
• I will send you an email/text right after this with the link to your first survey, which will take about 15 -
20 minutes. Do you think you’ll have time to do that tonight?   
o <if orient ation call was scheduled with parent already > Our next call with you, me, and your 
parent is scheduled for xx/xx at TIME. You will need to complete these surveys before then, do 
you think that’s doable?

has an iphone  
 
Call Script : 
Hi ____, this is _____ from the iKinnect study. Thank you again for your participation! I’m calling today to help 
get you set up with the app  you’ll be using for the research . We have done the random assignment for you 
and your teen, you will both be using <<iKinnect/Life360>> during your participation.  
 
If randomly assigned to iKinnect and has a service provider  (case manager, therapist, etc) , make sure we 
have the service provider’s contact information – get from parent and record in eligibility tracking database  
 
 
Steps to Downloading iKinnect and getting set up:  
1. Go to app store / play store    
iKinnect RCTs Protocol – Parents / Youth  
 
10 
V3 | April 1, 2019  2. Search iKinnect  (spell it for them)  
3. Install the app  
a. Make sure they say yes if message pops up asking to use location services (must say yes to it 
pulling location even when app is not in use , i.e., Always ) – this is more for iPhones (I think)  
b. And yes to notifications question if it pops up  
4. Open app  
5. Parent Create new account by clicking Sign Up  
6. Complete all profile/account set up pages  
a. After parent completes their profile setup, iKinnect will ask for Youth’s  phone number  
7. Teen will receive a text message prompting them to download iKinnect  
a. Go through same process as parent – install app and create new account  
8. Stay on the phone with them and help them set up a challenge card  – do not rush because they will 
need  to be using these settings for the 12 weeks  
a. Make sure teen accepts the challenges when created  
b. Make sure they both know where everything is  
 
Steps to Downloading Life360 and getting set up:  
1. Send parent the guide   
2. Go through each step of setup with them  
3. Go through steps with youth user and make sure they are connected with parent in the app  
4. Make sure they each know that free version is the one they can use and what to look out for when the 
app asks them to upgra de to premium  
 
For All:  
Great, so we are all set up now. We will consider this week to be Week #1 for the study. Before we get off the 
phone, I would love to schedule the three study calls with you and YOUTH . Each call would take about 10 -15 
minutes and wo uld be done individually, so I would talk with you PARENT and then with TEEN, or vice versa.  
 
Scheduling  
1. The week the app is downloaded is considered “Week 1”  
a. If it’s a Friday, consider making the next week “Week 1”, especially if iKinnect, to allow dyad to 
have the full 4 weeks of experience with the app before first interview  
2. Schedule a call for Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 assessments in the respective weeks  for Parent and 
Teen separately  
3. Send the confirmed dates and times to the participant for fut ure reference  using the template email 
(this also has the tamper proof attachments if applicable)  
4. After scheduling, log all the dates and times into the Coversheet / tracking database / your calendar 
and update Calendly  to block out those times.  
 
 
Thank you both very much! I will send reminders when it gets closer to our appointments. But feel free to call 
or text me if you run into any techn ical difficulties before then.  
 
Thank you, have a great day!

Voicemail Script:  
Hi ____, this is ____ from the iKinnect study. I’m calling for our study call scheduled at X:XX today. Please give 
me a call back  here at xxx -xxx-xxxx  if this time still works for you. If not, let me know another time that will 
work  for you this week. I’ll also send you a quick email/text in case that  is easier for you. Thanks!  
 
Call Script : 
 
Hi ____, this is ____ from the iKinnect study. Thanks again for your participation! I’m calling today for your 
<<Week 4, 8, 12>> study appointm ent. Is it still a good time for you?  
 
Great! Today I will be going over a list of questions about your experience using <<iKinnect/Life360>> over the 
phone and then I will send you the link to your study surveys afterwards.  
 
<<Administer the Semi -Structured Interview, taking detailed notes during conversation; exclude any personal 
identifying information such as names/locations>>  
 
Thank you for answering those questions! I’ll go ahead and send you an email/text <<their preference>> with 
the li nk to your surveys for today. We expect these surveys will take 15-20 minutes to complete. You’ll also 
need your Study ID for these surveys. If you have something to write on, I can tell it to you now to make sure 
you have the right number. <<we want to be  able to tell them verbally, but if they don’t have anything to write 
on/with: I can text it to you >>. 
 
If you run into any technical difficulties or have any questions as you go through the survey, please don’t 
hesitate to call or text me back here.  
 
You can expect to receive a  <Parents: $40 for week 4; $ 50 for week 8; $ 60 for week 12 parents  | Youth: $25 > 
check in the mail within the next 30 days. It will be coming from Chase Bank so please make sure to keep an 
eye out for that.  
 
I just want to double check that we have the correct mailing address for you. We have <<get address from 
eligibility tracking d atabase>>.

For Week 4 & 8:  
Our next appointment will be on Month Day @ Time Time  Zone. I will remind you when it gets closer to that 
time, but if you need to reschedule, please let me know at any time. Thank you!  
 
If Week 12 interview, check how many surv eys they completed on time and remind them about bonuses:  
Today was the last study call, your participation will end after you complete the final set of surveys. Thank you 
very much for all your time in participating and completing these survey, we know it  does take a lot of time 
and we really appreciate your help! Your free access to iKinnect will start after you and TEEN complete the 
week 12 survey, we will send you an email  to let you know when it starts . Thank you!  
 
 
6. Text or email link to Week 4, 8, 12 survey s 
7. Monitor SM for completed survey  
8. Follow up via text/email (participant’s preferred method) every day that week until complete  
9. Update Coversheet/ tracking database  when complete  and fill out ‘PaymentRequests’ tab of tracking 
database

Step 7: Closing Steps  
 
1. Make sure all bonus payments are requested  
2. Make sure to get all parent/youth participants 3 months access to iKinnect  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
Data Analysis : Regarding the handling of data , procedures will be similar to those in previous 
studies  conducted by the PI (Dimeff) for the managing, entering, filing, and analysis of data. 
Data are monitored  through a data tracking system from the beginning of a gi ven assessment 
through completion. Data will be  entered online using an encrypted, secure online assessment 
tool such as RedCap. Missing values are coded  as to reason missing (e.g., ‘subject unable to 
be located,’ ‘subject refuses to answer,’ etc.). All da ta are  cleaned for logic and other types of 
errors using SPSS. With regards to dropouts and missing data, we plan  to gather data for all 
participants at all time points (including from those who stop using VW). This will allow us  to 
conduct primary analyse s on the intent -to-treat sample. To minimize missing data, we have 
included built in  incentives (i.e., bonus payments for completing three and again for completing 
all four time points). To the  extent there is question skipping or missed assessments, the 
software and analysis method we have chosen  provides several options for the handling of 
incomplete data. Preference will be given to those methods for  which the assumptions (e.g., 
Missing at Random) are plausibly met and that have the least biased paramete rs. 
 
Analysis Strategy . We will use the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), a regression -based 
approach designed  to overcome the limitations and criticisms of ANOVA. It provides greater 
flexibility in that it can analyze a  variety of commonly encountered outcom e distributions (e.g., 
continuous, count) and can calculate robust  standard errors which are less sensitive to 
skewness. Specifically, we will conduct our repeated -measures  analyses using a version of 
GLM called Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), whic h do not rely on the  overly restrictive 
(and often incorrect) assumptions made by Repeated Measures ANOVA about the covariance  
matrix that can lead to misspecification. Like Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), GEE has an 
advantage over  ANOVA in that can test the use of different assumptions of the covariance 
matrix to determine the one best  fitting the data; it can also include participants who are missing 
data at some time points. We will use the SPSS  statistical package version 23 and GEE for all 
hypotheses concerning outcomes for parents and youth. For  each outcome, we will specify the 
correct distribution and compare fit indices to identify the covariance matrix  best fitting the data. 
All hypotheses relate to change over time, and so the multiple time -points will be treated in  the 
GEE analyses as nested within the individual. Also, we will treat intervention condition and time 
as categorical, dummy -coded predictors; the control condition and baseline scores will serve as 
the reference  points. The parameter of interest will be the Time X Condition interaction, and the 
Type III statistic will serve  as an omnibus test of whether the two conditions differed in change 
over time. Regression coefficients will  indicate at which follow up time p oints the conditions 
showed differential change from baseline.  
 
Statistical Power Considerations . We conducted power analyses focused on the ability to 
detect statistical  significance on the key parameter of interest, the Time X Condition interaction. 
Power  analyses assumed equal  size groups, p ≤ .05, power of .80, and two -tailed tests. 
Otherwise, findings from our pilot study guided  assumptions. In that study, we found an average 
effect size of Cohen’s d = .42 (a magnitude between low  medium and low), and b etween -time 
point correlations ranging from .36 - .81 (average r = .57). To ensure that  we enroll a sufficiently 
large sample, we computed our power calculations using the pilot study numbers that  would 
require the largest enrollment. Specifically, we assu med correlations of .36 and a desire to 
detect a  smaller effect size of f = .15 (similar to d = .30). Using GP ower’s utility for the GLM, we 
found that we would  need a total sample size of 80. To account for the possibility of attrition 
(20%), we increased  to a target  enrollment of 100.

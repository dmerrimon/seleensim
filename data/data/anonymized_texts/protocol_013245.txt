Secondary  
Effectiveness 
Endpoints  • Primary Patency at 30 days:  Defined as the absence of occlusion of the stent 
graft1 without prior clinically -driven major re -intervention2 of the stent graft 
at 30  days.  
• Primary Patency at 6 months: Defined as the absence o f occlus ion of the 
stent graft1 without prior clinically -driven major re -intervention2 of the stent 
graft at 6  months.  
• Secondary Patency at 6 months: Defined as the absence of occlusion of the 
stent graft1 with or without prior clinically -driven major re -intervention2 of 
the stent graft at 6 months. Occlusion is determined by duplex ultrasound 
data.  
• Limb Salvage at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months: Defined as percentage of subjects 
with freedom from above -ankle amputation of the index  limb. 
• Wound Healing at 3, 6, 9, a nd 12 mo nths: Defined as percentage of subjects 
with completed index wound  healing  
• Deterioration in Renal Function at 6 months: Defined as a > 25% increase in 
serum creatinine after using iodine contrast agents, without another clear 
cause for kidney  injur y. 
• Techn ical Success: Defined as percentage of subjects with technical success, 
defined as completion of the endovascular procedure and immediate 
morphological success with successful placement of the arterial and venous 
catheters in the desired location in the li mb, and ability to place the stent 
graft. 
• Procedural Success: Defined as percentage of subjects with a procedural 
success, defined as combination of technical success, and absence of all- cause 
death, above -ankle amputation or clinically driven majo r re-intervention2 of 
the stent graft at 30  days.  
1 Occlusion is defined as absence of flow on color Doppler, and/or absence of flow  
on angiographic images (conventional or CT).  
2  Clinically -driven major re -intervention is defined as the creation of a new  
surgical bypass, the use of thrombectomy or thrombolysis (i.e., procedures  done  
in the setting of lost primary -assisted patency), or major surgical revision such as a 
jump graft or an interposition graft performed for occlusion of the stent graft.  
Follow -Up 
Schedule  Measures of safety and effectiveness will be assessed through hospital discharge, 
at 30  and 60  (+/- 7) days,  at 3, 6, and 9 months (+/ - 2 weeks), and at one year (+/ - 
4 weeks) and 2 years (+/ - 4 weeks) post -procedure. The study will be complet ed 
and c losed after all subjects have either met a primary endpoint, or completed 
the 2 year follow -up requirements.  
Primary Patient 
Population In this first pilot study, the patients selected will be the “no hope” CLI patients, 
those that have been deter mined to  be ineligible for conventional surgical or 
endovascular options due to severe vascular disease.

Pre-Operative 
Inclusion Criteria  1. Subject must be > 21 and < 95 years of  age 
2. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic critical limb ischemia, defined as any  of 
the following clinical assessments coupled with hemodynamic evidence of 
severely diminished arterial inflow of the index limb (e.g., absent pulse(s), TcPO2 < 30 mm  Hg): 
a. Rutherford Classification 5, ischemic  ulceration  
b. Rutherford Classification 6, severe ischem ic ulcers or frank 
gangrene  
3. Subject has been assessed by the principal investigator, and reviewed by the Independent Safety Committee (ISC), and it was determined that no conventional distal bypass surgical or endovascular therapy for limb salvage is feasible due to the absence of a suitable distal target  artery.  
4. Proximally, the Target In -flow Artery at the cross- over point must be 
treatable with a 3.5 – 4.0 mm stent after pre -treatment (by visual 
estimate), and be <50%  stenosed.  
5. Prior stent(s) to the Targe t In-flow Artery are  allowed.  
6. Planned minor amputation of target extremity within 30 days after the index procedure is  allowed.  
7. Subject is willing and able to sign the informed consent  form.  
8. Subject has an adequate support network to ensure that su bject is

1.0. Introduction  
1.1 Background and  Rationale  
In the absence of treatment, Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) may progress to critical limb ischemia 
(CLI), which is characterized by profound chronic pain, and extens ive tiss ue loss that restricts 
revascularization options and frequently leads to amputation. CLI is estimated to have an incidence 
of approximately 50 to 100 per 100,000 per year and is associated with mortality rates as high as 20% 
at 6 months after  onset . 
 
Inter ventional radiologists have been aggressively trying to treat CLI by attempting to open up 
Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO’s) or bypassing them in the sub -intimal space using such products as 
the Medtronic Pioneer catheter which tunnels a wire into the sub-i ntimal space at the CTO and then 
attempts to re- enter the vessel after the occlusion. Once a wire is in place, one can place a stent to 
provide a bypass conduit passed the occlusion. More conventional approaches to treating PAD are 
also used in CLI  treatme nt once (if) a wire gets across the occlusion. These conventional methods 
include PTA, Stenting and more recently drug eluting balloons and stents.  
 
From the amputee -coalition.org website, the following are some statistics regarding the CLI problem : 
 
• There are nearly 2 million people living with limb loss in the United  States  
• The main causes of limb loss are dysvascular disease – including diabetes (54%), trauma 
(45%), and cancer (less than  2%).  
• Approximately 185,000 amputations occur in the United States each  year.  
• Hospital costs associated with having a limb amputated totaled more than $6.5 billion in 
2007  
• Survival rates after an amputation vary based on a variety of factors. Those who have amputations due to vascular disease (including peripheral arterial disease and diabetes) face 
a 30 -day mortality rate reported to be between 9 - 15% and a long-term survival rate of 60% 
at 1 year, 42% at 3 years, and 35- 45% at 5  years.  
• Nearly half of the people who lose a limb to dysvascular disease will die within 5 year s. This is 
higher than the 5 -year mortality rate experienced by people with colorectal, breast, and 
prostate  cancer.  
Of people with diabetes who have a lower -limb amputation, up to 55% will require amputation of 
the second leg within 2 to 3 years.  
 
The Lim Flow approach to treating CLI involves the concept of venous arterialization and this 
procedure has been performed surgically for many years and the first clinical surgical cases were  
reported in the early 1900’s. Numerous small series of clinical trials have been published over the 
year using a surgical approach and a recent meta- analysis article summarized this work. The 2006 
Meta Analysis article from the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery titled:

“Meta -analysis of the clinic al effec tiveness of venous arterialization for salvage of critically 
ischemic limbs.”  
Had the following results and conclusions:  
 
Results:  A total of 56 studies were selected for comprehensive review. No  
RCTs were identified. Seven patient series, comprising 228 p atients, matched the 
selection criteria. Overall 1 -year foot preservation was 71% (95% CI: 64 -77%) and 
1-year secondary patency was 46% (95% CI: 39 -53%). The large majority of 
patients in whom major amputation was avoided experienced successful wou nd 
healing, disappearance of rest pain and absence of serious complications.  
 
Conclusions: On the basis of limited evidence, venous arterialization may be 
considered as a viable alternative before major amputation is undertaken in 
patients with 'inoperable ' chroni c critical leg ischemia.  
 
The purpose of this first pilot clinical study is to test the LimFlow concept for creating an Arterio - 
Venous (AV) fistula in the Below The Knee (BTK) vascular system using an endovascular, minimally invasive approach. 
1.2 Summary of Findings from Previous  Studies  
1.2.1.  Pre- clinical  studies: 
Extensive in vitro bench, in vivo animal, and cadaver studies have been successfully performed with 
the LimFlow System and verification testing for the catheter has been completed. Testing on the  
device included comprehensive design verification and validation testing. The following testing was 
completed on the LimFlow devices:  
• Biocompatibility  testing  
• Mechanical testing  
• Packaging  testing  
• Shelf -life testing  
• Sterilization  validation  
• Preclinical animal  stud ies 
These tests were successfully completed and are described in more detail in the Investigator Brochure.  
1.2.2.  Clinical studies:  
A non- randomized prospective pilot study and a CE Mark study have been conducted with the 
LimFlow System, see Report of Pri or Inves tigations in the Investigator Brochure for details on the 
study and patient outcomes. These studies supported the CE Mark approval of the device on 
October 17, 2016. The subjects continue to be followed through 2 years post -procedure, and the

1.3 Risks and  Benefits  
The associated risks proposed in this study are similar to risks posed by other interventional and 
vascular surgery procedures. The benefit to the subjects enrolled in this study is the potential for 
impr oved blo od flow to the foot reducing or eliminating the need for major amputation.  
The potential benefit of reduced or no amputation of the foot greatly outweighs the standard  
endovascular/surgical risks associated with this procedure in this “no -hope” patient population who 
will have a major amputation if the LimFlow procedure is not attempted.  
 
1.3.1.  Risks  
The associated risks proposed in this study are similar to risks posed by other interventional and vascular surgery procedures.

device or the related procedures, and which may or may not require endovascular or surgical 
treatment in this clinical trial include:  
• Allergic  response 
• Arterial occlusion  
• Arterial thrombus  
• Arterio -venous fistula  (unplanned)  
• Bleeding/oozing from the puncture  site 
• Bruising at wound  site 
• Contrast -induced nephropathy and renal  failure

• Requirement for major amputation of index  limb  
 
1.3.2.  Benefits  
The benefit to the subjects enrolled in this study is the potential for improved blood flow to  the foo t 
reducing, but not necessarily eliminating the need for major amputation. The potential benefit of 
improved wound healing greatly outweighs  the standard endovascular/surgical risks associated with 
this procedure in this “no -hope” patient population who wi ll have a major amputation if the LimFlow 
procedure is not attempted.  
 
Specifically, risks to the patient are minimized due to:  
 
- The use of standard medical grade materials that have been thoroughly characterized and tested 
to assure  biocompatibili ty 
- Exten sive pre -clinical evaluation including in vitro bench testing, animal and cadaver study  
- The well established, standard nature of the endovascular procedures and techniques to be  used  
- The ability to quickly and safely remove the LimFlow System from the proc edure; the physician 
may elect to discontinue the use of the device at any time in favor of alternate  devices.  
- Frequent follow -up visits are conducted in the first year post -operatively to allow for systematic 
monitoring and surveillance of the ind ex limb,  allowing for early detection of hemodynamically 
significant stenoses in the graft that may occur in the absence of obvious  symptoms.  
- Potential subjects will be screened by the Independent Safety Committee to ensure that all 
subjects meet defined i nclusion /exclusion  criteria.  
- Investigators will receive device training and will be proctored for their first case, and then for as 
many cases as they deem necessary to perform the procedure proficiently.

investigator or a member of his/her staff should inform the patient about the study’s purpose and 
risks/benefits.  
Written informed consent must be obtained for all patients who are poten tial study candidates 
before any study -specific tests or procedures are performed. The wound shall be photographed, to 
include a metric ruler for adequate evaluation of the index wound/limb.  
Once the principal investigator concludes that all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met, 
the patients will be reviewed by an Independent Safety Committee (ISC) consisting of at least 2 
independent physicians with expertise in treatment of CLI patients. Once the ISC determines that a subject is n ot a candidate for conventional surgical or endovascular procedures for limb salvage, they 
may be enrolled in the study. See Section 10.2 Screening Responsibilities.  
Patients who give consent to take part in the study and subsequently do not meet the eligi bility 
criteria will not be enrolled.  
6.3. Visit  Schedule 
The study coordinator at the site should schedule the 30 -day follow -up visit before the subject is 
discharged post -procedure. Obtain contact information for subject’s significant other or caretaker(s) 
to ensure that subject will be able to comply with follow -up study visits. Study assessments to be 
performed at each visit are summarized in Table 1.

6.4 Study Procedures  
6.4.1 Enrollment  
Once any component of the LimFlow Stent Graft Sy stem is introduced into the body, the subject 
will be considered to be enrolled in the study and subject to all follow -up requirements. If the 
device is introduced but implantation is either not attempted or unsuccessful, subjects will be 
followed through 30 days for safety only, or through resolution or stabilization of any device - or 
procedure - related adverse events, whichever is longer. Those subjects will then be exited from 
the study and will not be replaced.

Page 20 of 38   
 6.4.2.  Intra -operative 
At a minimum, all subjects  must be started on dual anti -platelet therapy (DAPT) at least 1 week 
before the procedure or adequately pre -loaded with DAPT according to the institution’s practice. 
For consented subjects that meet the pre- operative eligibility criteria, record the relev ant data 
regarding their endovascular procedure. Record the following information:  
 
• Target In -Flow Artery (cross -over point), including proximal reference vessel diameter (RVD) 
and assessment of calcification or any other abnormalities  
• Target Out- Flow Vein  (cross- over point)  characteristics  
• Intra -operative anticoagulants administered, and corresponding ACT  levels  
• Pre- and post -procedural angiographic images showing flow to the  foot 
• Procedure start and finish  times  
• Total contrast amount  given  
• Total fluorosco py time for the  procedure  
• Documentation of any device- or procedure -related adverse  events  
• Technical  Success  
 
At the end of the endovascular procedure, with the procedural sheath in place and under 
fluoroscopic visualization, an injection of contrast will be made to assess the anatomy, placement 
and patency of the proximal, body and distal ends of the Stent Graft.  
6.4.3.  Post -operative  
After the LimFlow Stent Graft System is successfully placed, the access site and peripheral extremity 
should be closely monitored.  Dual anti-platelet therapy should be prescribed for a minimum of 3 
months post -procedure.  
All subjects will undergo a continuous wave doppler exam of the stent graft between 4 and 30 hours post -procedure. The exam is intended to verify the patency of the LimFlow stent graft and assess for 
acute stent graft thrombosis. Any findings of acute stent graft thrombosis must be reported to Sponsor within 24 hours of the exam and reported as an adverse event. The sponsor must notify the FDA by email of any cases of acute stent graft thrombosis within 5 days of the event.  
 
6.5 Follow -up 
Subjects should return to the clinic at 30 and 60 days (+/ - 7 days), at 3, 6, and 9 months (+/ - 2 
weeks), and then annually for up to 2 years following their endovascular procedure and th e 
peripheral limb/wound should be assessed.  
 
Routine surveillance of the wound and index limb will be performed during each follow -up visit, in 
accordance with ACC/AHA 2006 Peripheral Disease Guidelines. Examinations will include assessments of pulse, pain , Rutherford Classification, TCP0
2, wound healing status, medication 
regimen and any procedures or complications related to the index limb occurring since the last visit. The limb/wound will be photographed, displaying a metric ruler in the frames, and in enough detail 
to capture any change in wound status. Photographs are to include Anterior -Posterior (AP) photos of 
the dorsum of the foot including toes, medial and lateral projections and plantar.  
Duplex Ultrasound Exam Guidelines: A duplex ultrasound exam  will be performed at 1 , 2, 3, and 6 
month visits to assess the following:

 • Presence of any significant stenotic or occlusive lesions proximal to the AV fistula that may 
compromise  in-flow  
 
• Diameter of the stent graft proximal to the crossing point, just distal to the crossing point, 
proximal upper tibial, mid tibial and lower tibial  
• Flow volume measurements based on Diameter and Time Averaged Mean Velocity (TAMV) at the 
identical points stated above where diameter measurements were  made  
• Presence of flow in the outflow veins of the foot and flow volume measurements if  possible  
• Standard duplex ultrasound of the tibial arteries with particular reference to the presence of 
reverse  flow. 
Subjects should be instructed to promptly notify the investigator regarding any outside surgical 
referrals initiated by referring physicians caring for the subject’s wounds.  
NOTE: In the event that an index limb is determined to need a re- intervention or major amputation, a 
photograph of the wound and angiogram/images should be co llected prior to the procedure for 
event adjudication by the  ISC. 
 
6.6 Study  Exit 
Once the subject has a) completed the follow-up visits; b) has withdrawn consent to participate in 
the study; c) has met a primary study endpoint, or d) was enrolled but not able  to have the device 
implanted, they will be exited from the study provided they do not have any conditions that require continued follow -up. The date of exit, reason, and subject status should be recorded.

Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) will be used to capture data for the safety and performance analysis. Sites will be required to maintain source documentation, in accordance with GCP guidelines and 21 CFR 812 to substantiate all data collected.  
9.2. Site Data Monitoring and Quality  Control  
Primary data collection based on source -documented hospital chart reviews will be performed by the 
clinical research team, which may include sponsor or sponsor’s designees. CRFs will be completed 
and forwarded to the sponsor within 14 days of the procedure or scheduled visit. The sponsor will 
provide adequate source document worksheets for capture of study -specific data during the 
procedure and follow -up visits that may not nor mally be collected during routine  procedures.  
The clinical site will be monitored periodically by the sponsor’s personnel, or sponsor’s designee, for protocol adherence, accuracy of CRFs, and compliance to applicable regulations. Any observations of 
non-compliance will be reviewed with the principal investigator. Any evident pattern of ongoing non - 
compliance may result in corrective actions by the sponsor, including potential study suspension, as 
deemed appropriate by the sponsor.

The sponsor will review  significant new information, including unanticipated serious adverse events 
and ensure that such information is provided to the appropriate regulatory agencies, the 
investigators and to all reviewing IRBs as required by applicable regulations.  
 
 
10.0 Safe ty Oversight  
10.1. Safety: Complication Analysis and  Acceptance  
Revascularization catheter procedures are known to have inherent risks of complications. No new or 
additional complications or adverse events are expected due to the LimFlow portion of the 
procedure . 
10.1.1  Procedural  Complications  
If serious procedural complications or adverse events are observed, the events will be individually 
analyzed for root cause relative to the complete treatment procedure and then evaluated by the 
Independent Safety Committee and t he Principal Investigator. The sponsor will assess these events 
for expedited reporting requirements.  
10.1.2  Post -Procedural  Complications  
If serious complications or adverse events related to the procedure or device are observed during and through the 6 month fo llow -up, the events will be individually analyzed for root cause relative to 
the complete treatment procedure and then evaluated by the Independent Safety Committee and Principal Investigator. The sponsor will assess these events for expedited reporting requirements.  
 
10.2. Independent Safety Committee  (ISC)  
 
An Independent Safety Committee will act as the medical monitor for this early Pilot Study. The ISC will consist of at least two (2) physicians with experience in surgical and/or endovascular treatment of CL I patients, who are independent from the Sponsor and are not investigators in the study. 
Whenever possible, the ISC will review data in a blinded fashion (i.e., blinded to site and subject ID, 
follow -up period, etc.) to minimize any potential bias. Specific roles, responsibilities and processes 
will be described in a Safety Charter, which will be agreed upon by ISC members and published prior 
to commencement of the study.  
 
Screening Responsibilities:  
 
The ISC will review potential study candidates to evaluate their eligibility for the study, specifically to 
determine that no conventional distal bypass surgical or endovascular therapy for limb salvage is 
feasible due to the absence of a suitable distal target artery. Specific criteria to be evaluated by the 
ISC in this determination include, but may not be limited to:  
• Baseline angiograms/images to evaluate the status and patency of the distal arterial bed (i.e., tibial and peritoneal arteries, dorsalis pedis artery, and plantar arteries)  
• Wound  photographs  
• Medi cal history, including Rutherford  Classification  
• Clinical evidence of severe hemodynamic compromise in the index limb (e.g., TcPO2, pulse assessments)

Endpoint Assessment/Adjudication: 
 
Technical Success: The ISC will review the procedural angiograms to assess stent graft/limb 
patency post -procedure to determine Technical Success.  
Outcomes Adjudication: Reports of endpoint events will be reviewed and adjudicated, 
including but not limited to:  
• Major amputation of the index  limb  
• Stent graft occlusion and/or acute stent thrombosis (via DUS and/or angiographic 
documentation)  
• Death  
• Major and minor re -interventions of the index  limb  
• Contrast -induced  nephropathy  
• Wound healing (progression, completion,  confirmation). 
 
 
Ongoing Safety Overview:  
 
The ISC will also review safety data while the study is in progress, including reports of any serious device - or procedure -related adverse events and/or any reports of device malfunction or failure. 
During the study, the ISC will be asked to ensure that the rights and welfar e of the subjects are 
protected by providing recommendations concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the study based on review of safety data.  
 
10.3 Study Termination  
 
If LimFlow and/or the ISC and/or principal investigator determine t hat an event, or event rate 
presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, then the investigation or parts of the investigation presenting that risk shall be immediately revised or terminated. Termination shall occur not later 
than 5 working days after the spo nsor makes this determination and not later than 15 working days 
after the sponsor first received notice of the event. LimFlow will notify all participating investigators, 
and IRBs and the FDA of the termination of the investigation.  
 
 
11.0 Adverse Event R eporting  
11.1. General  Definitions  
An AE is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject whether or not it is considered to be device related. In addition, the definition of AE applies to any event with an onset post study procedure or to any unde rlying diseases, present at baseline that exacerbate in severity post study 
procedure. Therefore, an underlying disease that was present at the time of enrollment is not reported as an AE, but any increase in the severity of the underlying disease is to be reported as an 
AE. 
 
The following definitions for rating severity of adverse events will be used:

Page 24 of 38   
  
Mild:  Awareness of  signs or  symptoms,  but  easily  tolerated;  are  of minor  irritant 
type; causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms wou ld not 
require medication or a medical evaluation; signs or symptoms are  transient.  
 
Moderate:  Interferes   with   the   subject’s   usual   activity   and/or  requires  symptomatic 
treatment.  
 
Severe:  Symptom(s) causing severe  discomfort and significant  impact of  the subject’s 
usual activity and requires  treatment.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event which leads to:  
 
• Death due to any  cause  
• Life-threatening  condition  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization  
• Necessitates an intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body  structure  
• Results in congenital abnormality 
All SAE’s will be  reported.  
Device- Related Adve rse Event : an adverse event is considered to be device -related when, in the 
judgment of the investigator, the clinical event has a reasonable time sequence associated with use of 
the investigational device and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent dis ease or other procedures or 
medications. It is reasonable to believe that the device directly caused or contributed to the adverse event.  
Procedure -Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is considered to be procedure -related when, in 
the judgment of the i nvestigator; it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with the 
assigned study procedure and is not specific to the investigational device used. Other products, surgical techniques, or medications required specifically for the procedure are likely to have contributed to the occurrence of the event.  
Concomitant Medication -Related Adverse Event: an adverse event is considered to be concomitant 
medication related when, in the judgment of the investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with concomitant medications used in conjunction with the investigational device and is 
not otherwise specific to the investigational device (e.g. bleeding associated with anticoagulation 
medication).  
Pre-Existing Condition -Related Adverse Event: an adverse event is considered to be related to a pre - 
existing condition when, in the judgment of the investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is 
associated with the subject’s pre -existing condition and is not specific to the inves tigational device or 
procedure. Pre -existing conditions that are aggravated or become more severe during or after the 
procedure should be evaluated on a case -by-case basis to determine if the event may be more 
appropriately classified as device -related or procedure -related.

Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with the study device, if that effect, 
problem or death was not previously ide ntified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
Investigational Plan or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
LimFlow, or its designee, in cooperation with the investigator, will assess all adverse events considered to be serious and device -related for potential reportability to the FDA and other regulatory authorities 
as an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE).  
 
The investigator should follow all unreso lved serious adverse events until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, the subject has withdrawn consent, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  
For purposes of this study, the following events are not considered adverse events,  because they are 
normally expected to occur in conjunction with endovascular procedures / post -procedure, or are 
associated with customary, standard care of subjects undergoing these procedures:  
• Early post -operative pain (within 24 hours post -index proced ure) at the access site  
and/or related to position on procedure  table  
• Post -anesthesia/conscious sedation emesis, nausea, or headache (within 24 hours post - 
index  procedure)  
• Chest pain without associated ECG  changes  
• Hematocrit decrease from baseline not as sociated with hemodynamic changes, 
remaining above 30% and not requiring transfusion  
• Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following endovascular procedure, even if 
requiring  correction  
• Low grade temperature increase  (≤38.3° C/≤101°F) 
• Sinus bradyc ardia/tachycardia that does not require treatment or intervention  
• Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not require treatment or intervention  
This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the investigational sites for purposes of  adverse 
event reporting. The investigator at the investigational site should utilize his/her own clinical judgment in 
evaluating adverse experiences, and may decide that the above events should be reported as adverse 
events.  
 
11.2. Reporting of Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events  
 
11.2.1.  General Reporting Requirements (Serious & Non- Serious Adverse  Events)  
All potentially device - and/or procedure -related adverse events (AE) and all serious adverse events 
(SAE) will be reported and monitored from the time of treatmen t through the 6 month follow -up  
visit. Any SAEs related to the index limb will be reported and monitored throughout the 2 year 
follow -up visit. The report  should include:  severity, duration, action taken, treatment  outcome  and

relationship of the adverse experience to the study device, procedure, concomitant medications, pre- 
existing condition, etc. (i.e., unrelated, related or relationship unknown).  
In the case of serious adverse events, procedure and/or device observations and malfunctions, 
medica l record documentation (e.g. procedure notes, operative notes, discharge summary, relevant 
progress notes, imaging or lab studies) must be provided to sponsor or its designee.  
The following criteria must also be adhered to by the investigator in the case of serious adverse events:  
• The Adverse Event eCRF must be signed by the  investigator.  
• It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform their IRB of serious adverse events as 
required by their IRB procedures and in conformance with FDA and local regulatory requirements.  
 
11.2.2.  Reporting to  Sponsor  
All serious device - and/or procedure -related adverse events and any device malfunctions or failures 
should be reported by the investigator (or designee) to the sponsor, within 24 hours of learning of 
the adverse event or failure via phone or email contact. The LimFlow contact information for reports and questions  is:

11.3.  Device Failures and  Malfunctions  
Device  performance will be evaluated by the treating physician. All performance data will be 
captured on the electronic case report forms.  
Device Failure: A device has failed if it does not perform according to labeling and negatively impacts the treatment while used according to the labeling.  
Device Malfunction : A device malfunction is an unexpected change to the device that is 
contradictory to the labeling and may or may not affect device performance.  
All reported device malfunctions or failures of the LimFlow Stent Graft System are required to be 
documented in the eCRF. In the event of a suspected observation or device problem, refer to the 
Manual of Operations for further instructions. Device failures and malfunctions should also be 
documented in the subject’s  medical record.

NOTE: Device failures or malfunctions are NOT to be reported as adverse events. However, if there is 
an adverse event that results from a device failure or malfunction, that specific event would be 
recorded in the CRF.  
 
 
12.0 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
12.1. Site Training  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its representative will provide instructional material to the study site, as appropriate:  
• Instruct the investigators and study personnel on the protoco l, the completion of the CRFs, 
and study  procedures  
• Communicate regularly with site personnel via mail, email, telephone, and/or fax 
• Make periodic visits to the study  site. 
12.2. Physician  Training  
All investigators participating in this clinical trial are skilled in vascular interventional procedures and the use of the competitors’ endovascular catheters. The Site Initiation will include procedural 
relevant workflow and instruction for the LimFlow System. All treating physicians will have 
experience with the Lim Flow system in cadaver and animal labs prior to treating the first subject, or 
LimFlow will provide a trained physician or clinical specialist to proctor the investigator’s first cases, until the investigator is comfortable with the procedure.  
 
12.3. Audits and  Inspections  
The principal investigator for the site will also allow representatives of the governing IRB, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other applicable regulatory agencies to inspect all study records, CRFs, and corresponding p ortions of the subject’s office and/or hospital medical 
records at regular intervals throughout the study. These inspections are for the purpose of verifying 
adherence to the protocol, completeness and exactness of the data being transcribed onto the CRF, 
and compliance with FDA or other regulatory agency regulations.  
The principal investigator for the site will inform the sponsor or sponsor’s designee in advance if they are to be audited or inspected by any regulatory agencies. The sponsor will also inform  the site if 
they are made aware of a pending audit or inspection by a regulatory  agency.  
 
12.4. Independent Safety Committee (ISC) Member  Training  
All ISC members will be trained to the protocol, the procedure/device, the Safety Charter, and the documentation r equirements prior to commencement of duties for this trial.  
 
 
13.0 Ethical Considerations  
13.1. Trial Conduct & the Declaration of  Helsinki

13.2. Institutional Review Board  (IRB)  
A copy of the protocol, proposed Informed Consent form, other written patient information and any 
proposed advertising material must be submitted to the Institutional Review Boa rd (IRB) for written 
approval prior to use. A copy of the written IRB approval of the protocol and Informed Consent form 
must be received by the sponsor, before recruitment of patients into the study and shipment of investigational product.  
The investigato r must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB as well as any 
required regulatory agencies, for all subsequent significant protocol amendments and significant changes to the Informed Consent form. The investigator should notify the IRB of  deviations from the 
protocol or SAEs and UADEs occurring at the site and other SAE/UADE reports received from the sponsor in accordance with local procedures.  
The investigator will be responsible for obtaining annual IRB approval and renewal throughout th e 
duration of the study. Copies of the investigator’s reports and the IRB continuance of approval must be sent to the sponsor.  
 
13.3. Provisions for Maintaining  Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of subjects will be maintained throughout the study. A unique identif ication code will 
be assigned to each subject participating in this study. Any data that may be published in abstracts, 
scientific journals, or presented at medical meetings will reference a unique subject code and will not 
reveal the subject’s identity. The Sponsor and their CRO representative will make every reasonable effort to protect the confidentiality of the subjects participating in the study.  
 
13.4. Provisions for Compensation in Case of  Injury  
On the conditions that a subject follows the directions of t he study investigators in charge of this 
study, and in a case a subject is physically injured due to the trial procedure given under the plan for 
this study, the sponsor will pay the medical expenses for the treatment of that injury.  
The sponsor will not provide payment for management of the normally expected consequences of 
the treatment of a subject. Subjects will not be reimbursed or compensated for participating in the study, except for modest reimbursement for travel costs related to attendance of foll ow-up visits.  
By signing the Informed Consent Form, a subject will not waive any of his/her legal rights or release the parties involved in this study from liability for negligence.  
13.5. Emergency  Actions  
The sponsor accepts the right of the investigator to dev iate from the protocol in an emergency when 
necessary to safeguard the life or the physical well being of a study subject. The investigator must give notice of any emergency deviations and justification for the deviation to the sponsor and the IRB 
as quick ly as possible after the episode, in any event no later than 24 hours after the emergency.

Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 7 of 29 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this s tatistical analysis plan (SAP) is to describe the analysis variables and 
statistical procedures that will be used to analyze and report the results f rom a Phase 2 study 
evaluat ing the safety and efficacy of baricitinib , a JAK1/JAK2 selective inhibitor, in  patient s 
with moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis . This SAP is based on the amended protocol, Protocol 
I4V-MC-JAHG( d), which  was approved on 24 June 2016.  
Changes to the protocol that impact the design, the data collected, or the statistical methods and 
that occur after the finalization of this SAP may require amendment of the approved SAP. 
Similarly, changes to the planned analysis variables and/or statistical methods described in the 
approved SAP may also require amendment of the SAP.  
The formats for the tables, listings, and figures described in this SAP are provi ded in a 
companion document. Changes to the formats of these reports that are decided  after the 
finalization of the SAP will not require an amendment. In addition, any additional supportive or 
exploratory analyses requested after SAP approval  will not require amendment of the SAP. 
These additional analyses will be described in the clinical study report (CSR).  
Please see the study protocol for details about the study design, procedures, and schedule of 
assessments and see the electronic case report form (eCRF) for details about variables collected and their possible values.

1.3 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled using a 4:3:3 randomization scheme for placebo, 
2 mg baricitinib , or 4 mg baricitinib, respectively. Assuming a drop-out rate no greater than 20%, 
approximately 96 patients will complete the study.  
This sample size provides 90% power to detect a 35% difference in EASI-50 between placebo and either the 4 -mg baricitinib  using a 2-sided chi-square test with alpha = 0.05. 
2 General Statistical Methodology and Conventions 
CHORUS  will designate a provider to generate the statistical analyses detailed in this SAP. All 
computations for statistical analyses will be performed us ing SAS® software, Version  9.3 or 
later. All SAS  programs used in the production of statistical summary outputs will be validated 
with independent programming prior to finalization. In addition, all program outputs will be 
independently reviewed. The validation process will be used to confirm that all data manipulations and calculations were accurately done. Once validation is complete, a senior 
statistical reviewer should perform a final review of the documents to ensure the accuracy and 
consistency with this plan and consistency within tables. Upon completion of validation and quality review procedures, all documentation will be collected and filed by the project statistician or designee.  
Before implementation of p arametric methods of analysis, the distribution of analysis variables 
will be examined to determine if model assumptions are satisfied . Transformations or 
nonparametric methods of analysis may be used if warranted. However, in some cases, nonparametric analysis may be the initially proposed method due to the expected distribution of 
response. Whenever alternative methods of analysis are required, the description of the new method along with the rationale for its use will be documented in the CSR. 
The eCRF d ata for all patient s will be provided in Standard Data Tabulation Model ( SDTM ) 
datasets. Any additional data listing supplied as part of the CSR will be sorted by investigative 
site and patient  identification number, and patient s will be identified in the listings by the 
investigator number concatenated with the patient  number. 
2.1 Randomization Schedule and Unblinding Plan  
This is a double-blind study in which the patient s, investigator, and study site personnel will be 
blinded to treatment allocation. PAREXEL International will be responsible for building the 
interactive response technology (IRT) system that randomly assigns study treatments to patients.  To preserve the blinding of the study, only a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the 
randomization table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. A limited group 
may have access to unblinded treatment information to ensure the safety of patients in the study. 
Another small team of Lilly scientists (project statistician, statistical analyst, pharmacokineticist, 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 10 of 29 research physician , medical director, and global patient outcome scientist) will have access to the 
unblinded treatment information just before the last patient has completed their Week 12 visit. 
Their review of the unblinded data will facilitate planning of future studies. They may communicate unblinded findings to a small number of other Lilly personnel to facilitate business decisions, but not to those who are involved in the conduct of the study who would be involved in direct site contact and assessment of blinded clinical outcomes. A list of all those individuals who become unblinded prior to study completion will be maintained by the unblinded statistician . This process w ill ensure that data integrity is maintained while patients are still 
receiving blinded therapy.  
Once the last patient completes Week 16 , thus blinded study treatment, and all data management 
data activities have been completed – data entered, coding completed, and all queries resolved – 
the Chorus Asset Manager and Statistician will approve PAREXEL to release the randomization 
schedule to the reporting team. A dditional Lilly personnel as well as steering committee 
memb ers may also be unblinded to commence reporting of results from the treatment period. Site 
personnel and those Lilly personnel who are involved in the conduct of the study who would be involved in direct site contact and assessment of blinded clinical outc omes and patients will 
remain blinded until the study completes. 
Emergency unblinding of site personnel may be performed through the IRT system.  This option 
may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient ’s treatment 
assignme nt. All calls resulting in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by the IRT 
system.  
2.2 Analysis Populations 
The analyses  for efficacy will be based on the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle (Gillings and 
Koch 1991) , which seeks to preserve the ben efits of randomization and avoid the issue of 
selection bias . The ITT population is defined as all randomized patient s, and analyses based on 
the ITT population will utilize  the treatment s assigned  at randomization .  
Safety will be analyzed using the Safety Population . The Safety population is defined as all 
randomized patient s who received at least one dose of a randomly assigned study treatment. 
Safety analyses will utilize the treatment that the patient  received.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be an alyzed using the PK Population . The PK population is 
defined as all patients who received at least one dose of baricitinib and provided at least one 
post-dose PK sample . Pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed using the treatment that the 
patient  received.  
2.3 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
Analys is of the primary response endpoint , EASI -50, will include all randomized patients and 
utilize a non-responder imputation (NRI) analysis. A ll patient s who discontinue study treatment 
at any time prior to the time point of interest, or discontinue from the study for any reason, will 
be defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis.  Randomized patient s without at least 1 post-
baseline observation will also be defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis.  Secondary and 
exploratory efficacy responder analyses will also utilize NRI analyses  and all randomized 
patients .  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 11 of 29 For the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints and clinical laboratory endpoints that are 
collected longitudinally , a last  observation analysis will be performed by carrying forward the 
last post- baseline assessment. These last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses guarantee 
the maximum number of randomized patients who were as sessed post -baseline, will be included 
in the analyses . In addition, for many of the efficacy endpoints, mixed effect model repeated 
measures (MMRM) analyses will be performed to mitigate the impact of missing data, which 
will be assumed to be missing at r andom during the study. 
If only a missing or partial date for AEs or concomitant medications  is available and a complete 
date is required for calculati ons, the following algorithms will be applied:  
• For the start date:  
− If year, month, and day are missing then use the minimum of the patient 's first visit date or the consent date.  
− If either only month or month and day are missing then use January 1.  
− If only day is missing, impute the first day of the month.  
• For the end date:  
− If year, month, and day are missing then use the patient 's last visit date.  
− If either only month or month and day are missing then use December 31.  
− If only day is missing then use the last day of the month.  
− Do not expand the record past the patie nt's last visit.  
The original missing o r partial date, the imputed complete date, and the i ndicator variable that  
indicate s which dates were imputed will be retained in the database.  
Analyses of the safety endpoints, many of which are incidence based, will include all patient s in 
the safety population, unless specifically stated otherwise.  
2.4 Adjustment for Multiple Centers 
The study randomization is stratified by country of the investigative site , and only investigative 
centers from Japan and the United States ar e included in the study. The number of patients to be 
randomized in each country is not fixed, so there may be low enrollment in one of the countries. 
The stratification variable  “country” will n ot be included in the statistical model by default . If 
there are at least 15 patients enrolled in each country, analyses  that include a fixed effect for 
country may be performed as exploratory analyses. 
2.5 Interim Analysis and Adjustment for Multiplicity 
There were no planned formal interim analyses for this study. The interim review of the ongoing 
study data, that is described in Section  2.1, does not include any alpha-spending nor will any 
modifications of the current study be contemplated. 
The primary efficacy analyses include separate comparisons of each baricitinib arm to the 
placebo arm. To control the type 1 error rate for the primary efficacy analyses, these separate 
comp arisons will be performed in a stepwise fashion. The 4- mg baricitinib arm will be compared 
with the placebo arm; if this test is statistically significant at level α = 5%, then the 2- mg 
baricitinib arm will be compared with the placebo arm; again using α = 5%.  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 12 of 29 Because this is a phase 2 study, no other adjustments for multiplicity will be made for statistical 
tests.  
2.6 Coding of Concomitant Medications and Adverse Events 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA™) , and c oncomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary.  The most recent version of these dictionaries at the time of database lock will 
be used for reporting. The version of the dictionary used for reporting will be provided in the CSR.  
2.7 Definition of Study Time Points 
Study baseline for a patient will extend from the date of informed consent until the date of first 
dose of randomly assigned study medication. For efficacy, safety and background charac teristics, 
the baseline value of a parameter will be the last measurement of that parameter during the baseline period.  
The post -baseline period will start on the date of first dose of randomly assigned study 
medication. Study day will be defined as  
Study Day = Date –Date of 1st dose+1*if (Date >= Date of 1st dose). 
The last part of the equation indicates that 1 is added if the date of collection /observation is 
greater than or equal to the date of first dose of randomly assigned study medication. This forces 
all post- baseline events to have a positive value and all dates prior to first dose to have a value 
less than  0. 
2.8 Reporting Conventions 
This section details the general conventions to be used for the statistical analyses . Departures 
from these g eneral conventions will be provided in the specific detailed sections of this analysis 
plan. The following conventions will be applied to all data presentations and analyses:   
• Data will be summarized for the following groups : 
− Overall, Placebo, 2mg LY, 4mg  LY will be used for patient accounting and disposition 
− Placebo, 2mg LY, and 4mg LY for all presentations except patient accounting and disposition 
• Continuous variables will generally be summarized by the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum.  Exceptions to these conventions will be specifically noted . Categorical 
variables will be summarized by the number and percentage of patients within each category . 
• All mean and median values will be formatted to one more deci mal place than the measured value.  
• Standard deviation values will be formatted to two more decimal places than the measured value.  
• Minimum and maximum values will be presented with the same number of decimal places as the measured 
value.  
• The number and percent of responses will be presented in the form XX (XX  %), where the percentage is in 
parentheses . Percentages will be rounded to the nearest percent . In the case of a frequency of zero, the 
frequency and percentage will be presented as 0 rather than 0 (0%).  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 13 of 29 • All summary tables will include the analysis population sample size (i.e., number of patients) in each treatment 
group.  
• Date variables will be formatted as ddMMMYY for presentation.  
2.9 Changes to the Planned Analyses 
2.9.1 Changes to the Planned Analyses in the Protocol 
• There was a typo for the analyses of continuous secondary efficacy endpoints . The level for the confidence 
intervals should have been 95%, rather than 90%. The correction has been implemented in this SAP.  
3 Patient Accounting and Disposition 
3.1 Patient Accounting  
For each study center t he number of patient s in the ITT, Safety and PK populations will be 
provided overall and by randomized assignment. The date of the first patient visit and the last 
patient visit for each study center will also be provided. These dates and patient totals will also 
be summarized for the whole study and by country.  
A list of protocol violations that could potentially impact the analysis of the study will be 
determined during the conduct of the study by study team members who are blinded to assigned study treatment. The number and percentage of patient s with each violation will be tabulated 
overall and by randomized treatment assignment. 
3.2 Study Disposition 
The disposition of all random ized patient s will be presented. The number of patient s randomized 
and the number of patient s in the Safety Population will be presented overall and by treatment 
group. In addition, the reason for study discontinuation will be tabulated by treatment group 
using the list of reasons provided in the eCRF. This report will be generated for both the overall 
population and for patients enrolled in Japan. 
4 Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data, baseline characteristics , and atopic dermatitis history will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by randomized treatment assignment. These summaries will be based on the ITT population and will be generated using both the overall population and for patients 
enrolled in Japan. Randomized patient s who are missing measurements of the baseline variable 
being analyzed will not be included in the summary for that variable. 
Unless otherwise specified, F- tests from the analysis of variance ( ANOVA) model with a fixed 
effect  for randomized treatment group will be conducted  for continuous variables. These tests 
will be based on the Type  3 sum of squares. Categorical variables will be analyzed using the 
general association chi-square tests . If the number of patient s in a category is less than 5 for 
either randomiz ed group, Fr eeman -Halton  exact tests will be used instead of the chi -square test.  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 14 of 29 4.1 Demographics 
Demographic variables collected prior to randomization include date of birth, sex , race, and 
ethnicity . Age at study entry, age group (Age < 65 years , Age ≥ 65 years ), sex, and race will be 
summarized and reported. Age at study entry will be based on the age of the patient  on the date 
the informed consent is signed. Age at study entry will be analyzed as a continuous variable 
while age group is analyzed as a categorical variable. Sex  will also be analyzed as a categorical 
variable. Patient  race will be captured using multiple racial categories  (i.e., American Indian or 
Alaskan Native, Asian, Black  or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander , 
and White ), and Race will be reported using a chi -square test and these categories along with a 
‘Multiple’ category for those patients who identify more than one race category. The response 
for ethnicity  could be Hispanic or Latino, or Non-Hispanic or Latino. Ethnicity will be analyzed 
as a categorical variable.  
4.2 Baseline Anthropometrics  
Patient  height and weight will also be collected prior to randomization. Both variables will be 
reported in metric units (height in cm and weight in kg) and will be analyz ed as continuous 
variables along  with Body Mass Index  (BMI ; in kg /m2). Body mass index will also be analyzed 
categorically using the categories obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2). 
4.3 Baseline Habits  
The alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine habits for each patient  will be collected during the baseline 
period. The number and percentage of patient s who consume alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will 
be tabulated for each treatment group using the ITT population. In addition, among those patient s 
who currently smoke descriptive statistics of the number of cigarettes per day will be provided by treatment group. No statistical inference will be performed for the habits variables , and this 
report will only be produced for the overall population.  
4.4 Atopic Dermatitis History 
The date of atopic dermatitis diagnos is along with the types of prior therapies received will be 
collected during the screening period. The types of prior therapy will be collected using the following categories:  hydration plus topical steroids and/or antibiotics (Category 1), systemic steroid s and/or phototherapy (Category 2), cyclosporine and/or other immunomodulators 
(Category 3). Patients could have received treatments from more than one category.  
Time since diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, in months, will be descriptively  summarized and 
analyzed as a continuous variable . Since patient s could have received treatments from multiple 
categories, each category will be analyzed separately as a categorical variable. In addition, the number and percent of patients who reported alopecia areata in th eir medical history will be 
compared between treatments using the general association Mantel -Haenszel  or Freeman -Halton 
statistic .

Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 15 of 29 5 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be defined as medications , other than triamcinolone 0.1% cream, 
taken  on or after the date of first dose of randomly assigned study treatment. This includes all 
medications initially taken prior to the date of first dose of randomly assigned study medication 
but with a stop date that is either missing or after the date of first dose of randomly assigned 
study medication. Those medications where the stop date is documented as prior to the date of first dose of randomly assigned study medication will be classified as prior medications . The 
prior medications will not be included in any summary reports. 
The reporting of concomitant medications will be by WHODD preferred drug name ( often the 
generic drug name). The report of all concomitant medications taken during the study will be 
prepared by treatment using the s afety population, and the number and percentage of patients 
who received each concomitant medication  will be presented .  
6 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses for this study will be based on the findings from clinical tools (EASI, 
SCORAD, and IGA) and patient  reported outcomes (DLQI, Itch NRS, and POEM) t hat assess 
the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis , the symptoms related to atopic dermatitis , or the 
impact on the patient ’s quality of life (QOL). In addition, data from wearable actigraphy devices 
will be analyzed to assess sleep/wake patterns and changes in nocturnal itch  patterns . All of these 
assessments will be collected longitudinally during the study.  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population. Reports will be generated for the o verall population, and many of the reports will also be produced using only patients enrolled 
in Japan. The method of analysis or statistical technique employed to address missing data will be described  separately for each variable. Presentations of efficacy will include the number of 
patient s with data at each time point plus related statistics derived from the analysis.  
Assessments performed at Visit 2 will be considered the baseline measurements. If t he Visit 2 
assessment for a clinical tool or patient  reported outcome is missing, then the Visit 1 assessment, 
if it exists, will be considered the baseline measurement. If a patient  has no assessment of a 
clinical tool or patient  reported outcome prior to the initiation of study treatment, then the patient  
will be excluded from the efficacy analysis of that variable at the given time point. 
6.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis will be the based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI),  
which is a valid and internally consistent clinical observation tool that has adequate intra-observer reliability, intermediate inter -observer reliability, and adequate responsiveness. 
The EASI assesses  objective physician estimates of  two dimensions of atopic dermatitis  – 
disease extent and clinical signs – by scoring  the extent of disease (percentage of skin affected: 0 
= 0%; 1 = 1 -9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100%) and the 
severity of four clinical signs (erythema, in duration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) 
each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at four body sites (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). H alf scores are allowed . Each body site 
will have a score that ranges from 0 to 72, and the final EASI score will be obtained by weight-
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 16 of 29 averaging these four scores (using multipliers 0.2 for head and neck and upper limbs and 0.3 for 
trunk and lower limbs). Hence, the final EASI score will range from 0 to 72 for each time point. 
The EASI will be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-randomization, plus 
at the early termination visit, if applicable. At each of the post- baseline visits the EASI will be 
computed, and the EASI score will be compared with the EASI score obtained at baseline to 
obtain the proportion of reduction.  
The primary efficacy measure will be the proportion of moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis 
patient s achieving a 50% reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity I ndex , or EASI-50, after 16 
weeks of treatment. The primary analysis will be performed using a Non- Responder Imputation 
(NRI) analysis. All patients with a less than 50% reduction in the EASI at Week 16, plus all 
patient s who either discontinue study treatment or discontinue from the study for any reason at 
any time prior to Week 16  will be defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis. Randomized 
patient s without at least 1 post-baseline observation of EASI will also be defined as non-
responders for the NR I analysis.  
The proportion of patients achieving EASI -50 in the placebo arm will be compared to the 
proportion of patients in each of the baricitinib arms (2 mg and 4 mg) using a two-sided chi-
square test with alpha=0.05. To control for multiplicity testing will be performed in a stepwise 
fashion. First, the 4- mg baricitinib arm will be compared with the placebo arm; if this test is 
statistically significant, then the 2 -mg baricitinib arm will be compared with the placebo arm.  
The number and percent of patient s, based on an NRI analysis,  with a 50% reduction in EASI 
will be presented for each treatment arm at each time point including the patient ’s last 
assessment, which should be either Week 16 or the early termination visit. The p-values for the pairwise chi -square tests from the NRI analyses will also be tabulated.  In addition, a bar chart 
that shows the percentage of patients with a 50% reduction in EASI for each treatment arm at each time point including the patient’s last assessment will be presented. The figure displays will be generated for the overall population and by country – United States and Japan.  
6.1.1 Analyses in Support of Primary Efficacy 
Non-responder imputation analyses that assess the EASI -75 and EASI-90, i.e., proportion of 
moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis patients achieving a 75% (or 90%) reduction in the E ASI, 
will also be conducted. P-values from Fisher’s exact test may be used due to the potential for low 
response rates.  
Observed cases  analyses of EASI -50, EASI -75 and EASI-90 will also be conducted using Chi-
square of Fisher’s Exact Test . 
6.1.2 Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Efficacy Variable 
The NRI analysis of EASI -50, as well as EASI -75 and EASI-90, will be repeated using a logistic 
regression model with fixed effects for treatment  and country. Odds ratio estimates and the Wald 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for the pairwise comparisons of baricitinib to placebo.

Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 17 of 29 6.2 Secondary  Efficacy Analyses 
6.2.1 Change and Percent age Change in EASI  
Change and percent age change from baseline for EASI will be derived for each patient at each 
post- baseline visit (Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16).  Descriptive statistics for the value, change and 
percentage ch ange will be tabulated for each time point.  
Missing assessments will assumed to be missing at random and separate mixed effects model 
repeated measures (MMRM) analyses will be performed to compare the baricit inib treatment 
arms and placebo for the actual and percent change from baseline. For both change and percent 
change from baseline the MMRM model will contain fixed effects for treatment, visit, and 
country and the treatment -by-visit interaction plus the baseline value and baseline- by-visit term 
as covariates . Patient  will be nested within treatment, and t he covariance structure among the 
repeated measurements for a patient  will be assumed to be common across patient s and modeled 
using an unstructured 5x5 matrix. Satterthwaite’s approximation will be  used to estimate 
denominator degrees of freedom. The significance of differences in least- square means will be 
based on Type III tests using the observed population margins. The  analyses will be performed 
using the SAS procedure PROC MIXED.  
The tabular output for these MMRM analyses will present the least squares means, standard 
errors and 95% confidence intervals and p -values for each main effect marginal. Pairwise 
contrasts of the least squares means between  the randomized treatment arms  will also be 
provided at each time point using LSMESTIMATE statements .  
For both endpoints plots of the least squares mean ± standard error estimates for changes in 
EASI  over time will be provided by randomized treatment. These plots will be provided for t he 
overall population and for each country.  
Finally, a last observation analysis will be performed for both change and percent change using 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for treatment  and country plus 
the baseline value as a covariate. Tabular output for these ANCOVA analyses will present the least squares means, standard errors and 90% confidence intervals and p-values for each main effect marginal. Pairwise contrasts of the least squares means will also be provided for randomized treatment arms at each time point.  
6.2.2 SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) 
To determine disease severity the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)  index uses the rule of 
nines to assess disease extent (head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; 
anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%; and hands 2% ) and evaluates six clinical 
characteristics – erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification and 
dryness  – each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). 
SCORAD also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss with visual analogue 
scales (VAS) where 0 is no itch (or no sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or 
sleeplessness) . These three aspects: extent of disease (A: range 0 -102) , disease severity (B; range 
0-18) and subjective symptoms (C: range 0 -20) will be  combined using, A/5 + 7*B/2 + C, to 
give a maximum possible score of 103.4.  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 18 of 29 The SCORAD will  be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-randomization, 
plus at the early termination visit, if applicable. At each of the post- baseline visits the SCORAD 
will be computed, and the SCORAD score will be compared with the SCORAD score obtained 
at baseline to obtain change and percent change from baseline.  Descriptive statistics for the 
SCORAD value and the subjective assessments of pruritus and sleep loss and the respective 
changes from baseline will be tabulated for each time point using the overall and by-country populations. 
The MMRM and ANCOVA analyses described in Section 6.2.1
 will be performed to compare 
the baricit inib treatment arms and placebo for change and percent change from baseline in the 
SCORAD score , and change from baseline in the pruritus and insomnia assessments. The tabular 
outputs for the MMRM and ANCOVA analyses described will be provided. 
6.2.3 Investigator’s Global Assessm ent 
The Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) uses the clinical characteristics  – erythema, 
infiltration, papulation, oozing and crusting – as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. 
The IGA  consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = 
almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease and 5 = very severe disease).  
The IGA will be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-randomization, plus at the early termination v isit, if applicable. At each of the post- baseline visits the IGA will be 
computed, and the IGA score will be compared with the IGA score obtained at baseline to obtain change from baseline.  Descriptive statistics for the value and change from baseline will be 
tabulated for each time point using the overall and by-country populations. 
An IGA [0,1] responder is defined as a patient with a post- baseline score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost 
clear) , and an IGA [0,1] responder with a 2-point drop is a responder whose change from 
baseline is at least 2 points . An IGA  [0] responder is defined as a patient with a post- baseline 
score of 0 (clear). At each post- baseline time point and the last observation the number and 
percent of IGA  [0,1] responders both overall and those with at least a 2 -point drop from baseline 
will be compared between each baricitinib arm and placebo using a two -sided Fisher’s Exact test 
at level α = 0.05. A similar analys is will be performed for IGA [0].   
In addition, a bar chart  that shows the percentage of  IGA [0,1] responders with a 2-point drop in 
each treatment arm and at  each time point including the patient’s last assessment will be 
presented. The figure will be generated for the overall population and by country. Analyses will also be performed for change from baseline at each post -baseline time point and 
for the last observation. Comparisons between each baricitinib arm with placebo will be based on 
chi-square statistics using the row mean scores option. The number and percentage of patients 
having change from baseline scores (range: -5 to 5) will be tabulated for each treatment arm and 
each time point. The associated p -values at each time point will also be presented for each 
pairwise comparison. 
6.2.4 Dermatology Life Quality Index 
The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  is a simple, patient -administered,  10-question, 
validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 19 of 29 daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. The recall period 
of this scale is over the “last week.” Response categories  include “not at all,”, “a little”,  “a lot,” 
and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively and unanswered or “not relevant” responses scored as 0 . For question 7 t he response categor y ‘yes’ is scored 3 , 
while a ‘no’ response’ is scored as 2, 1, or 0 based on the follow-up question response “a lot”, “a little”, or “not at all” respectively . The  DLQI total score  will be obtained by summing the  scores 
from the 10 questions with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 30. If any one of the 
10 questions is unanswered, that question is scored as 0. However, if 2 or more questions are not answered then the DLQI score will not be calculated.  
The DLQI will be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-randomization, plus 
at the early termination visit, if applicable. At each of the post- baseline visits the DLQI total 
score will be computed along with the change from baseline. Descri ptive statistics for the value , 
change from baseline will be tabulated for each time point.   
The MMRM and ANCOVA analyses described in Section 6.2.1
 will be performed to compare 
the baricit inib treatment arms and placeb o for change from baseline in the DLQI total score. 
A DLQI  responder is defined as a patient with a 4 -point or greater decrease from baseline in the 
DLQI total score . At each post- baseline time point and the last observation the number and 
percent of DLQI  responders will be compared between each baricitinib arm and placebo using a 
two-sided Fisher’s Exact test at level α = 0.05. This analysis  will be performed using only  
patients with a baseline DLQI total score greater than or equal to 4 points.  
Individual domain DLQI scores may be analyzed in post- hoc analyses.  
6.2.5 Itch Numerical Rating Scale 
The Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): The Itch NRS is a patient -administered, 11 point 
horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 representing “worst 
itch imaginable.” The patient  indicates the o verall severity of itching that best describes the 
worst level of itching in the  past 24 hours.  
The Itch NRS will be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post- randomization, 
plus at the early termination visit, if applicable. At each of the post- baseline visits the Itch NRS  
score will be computed along with the change and percent change from baseline. Descriptive 
statistics for the value and changes from baseline wi ll be tabulated for each time point.  
The number and percent of patients with an Itch NRS  score of 0 “no itch” will be compared 
between the baricitinib arms and the placebo arm at each time point including baseline using an 
NRI analysis . Patients who either discontinue study treatment or discontinue from the study for 
any reason will be defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis for all assessments that were 
not collected . Randomized patients without at least 1 post- baseline observatio n of Itch NRS  will 
also be defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis. The proportion of patients with no itch in 
the placebo arm will be compared to the proportion of patients in each of the baricitinib arms (2 mg and 4 mg) using two- sided Fisher’s ex act tests with alpha=0.05. The number and percentage 
of patients with no itch will be presented for each treatment arm at each time point including the patient’s last assessment. The p -values for the pairwise Fisher’s Exact test s will also be 
tabulated.  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 20 of 29 In addition, a bar chart that shows the percent of patients with no itch for each treatment arm at 
each time point including the patient’s last assessment will be presented. The figure display will be generated for the overall population and by country.  
The MMRM and ANCOVA analyses described in Section 6.2.1
 will be performed to compare 
the baricit inib treatment arms and placebo for change from baseline in the Itch NRS  scores . The 
tabular outputs for the MMRM and ANCOVA analyses described will be provided.  
6.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
6.3.1 Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure 
The Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)  is seven -item patient- administered tool that 
focuses on the atopic dermatitis experienced by the patient . This tool has a one week recall 
period. E ach question is scored on a five point scale (0 = no days; 1 = 1-2 days; 2 = 3-4 days; 3 = 
5-6 days; 4 = every day) , with a total score rang ing from 0 to 28. If a single question is left 
unanswered, then that question is scored as 0. If more than one question is unanswered, then the 
tool is not scored. 
The POEM score will be calculated  at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-
randomization, plus at the early termination visit, if applicable. At each of  the post- baseline visits 
the POEM score will be compared with the POEM score obtained at baseline to obtain change 
and percent change from baseline.  Descriptive statistics for the value , change and percent change 
from baseline will be tabulated for each t ime point.  
The MMRM and ANCOVA analyses described in Section 6.2.1  will be performed to compare 
the baricit inib treatment arms and placebo for change from baseline in the POEM score. The 
tabular outputs for the MMRM and  ANCOVA analyses described therein will be provided. 
The POEM score can be banded as follows:  
• 0 to 2  = Clear or almost clear  
• 3 to 7  = Mild eczema  
• 8 to 16  = Moderate eczema  
• 17 to 24  = Severe eczema  
• 25 to 28  = Very severe eczema  
At each time point, baseline and post- baseline,  the banded POEM score will be compared 
between each baricitinib arm and placebo using chi -square statistics with the row mean scores 
option. The number and percentage of patients in each band on the scale will be tabulated for 
each treat ment arm and each time point. The associated p- values at each time point will be 
presented for each pairwise comparison.  A bar chart  that shows the distribution of patients 
among the bands for each treatment arm at each time point including the patient’s last 
assessment will be presented.  
Exploratory analyses may examine individual POEM items.

Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 21 of 29 6.3.2 Analyses for Actigraphy Device data 
Hypoallergenic wrist watch -like devices will be worn by the patients throughout the study. A 
total of three devices will be  worn – one device captures activity and sleep while two high-
resolution devices, one worn on each arm, determine nocturnal scratching. Data from the devices 
will be used to summarize sleep/wake patterns and quantify nocturnal scratching events.  
Data from the actigraphy devices will be downloaded at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-
randomization, plus at the early termination visit, if applicable. Reproducibility of the data from day-to-day is fairly high, so results from the seven days prior to each download will be averaged 
to derive the response variables. Data from baseline will be available as part of the Week 1 download. At each of the post- baseline visits  change from baseline will be computed for each of 
the response variables.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be done, for example evaluating area under the curve to compare treatment groups.  
6.3.2.1 Analyses for Sleep/Wake Patterns  
At each time point the following parameters will be analyzed: average number of 
sleep 
disturbances per night-hour, duration of sleep, time of initial disturbance after sleep onset (WASO) , 
onset latency, wake time, percent of time awake, number of wake bouts, fragmentation and sleep 
efficiency . The MMRM analysis described in Sect ion 6.2.1  will be performed to compare the 
baricit inib treatment arms and placebo for change from baseline for each of the variables. The 
tabular outputs for the MMRM analyse s will be provided. 
6.3.2.2 Analyses for Nocturnal Scrat ching  
Three variables will be computed to assess nocturnal scrat ching – the average number of 
scratching events per night, the average time spent actively  scratching during the night, and the 
average number of scratching events per hour. The MMRM analysis described in  Section 6.2.1  
will be performed to compare the baricit inib treatment arms and placebo for change from 
baseline for each of the nocturnal itching variables. The tabular outputs for the MMRM analyses 
will be provided. 
6.3.3 Analyses for Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report 16 
The Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report  16 (QIDS- SR16) is a self -
administered 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of 
depression. The QIDS-SR16 scale is used to assess the potential impact of treatment on new onset or changes in depression, thoughts of death, and /or suicidal ideation severity. A patient is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they h ave felt for the past 7 days. There 
is a 4 -point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3. The 16 items corresponding to 9 depression 
domains are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severity. The d omains assessed by the instrument include: (1) sad mood, (2) 
concentration, (3) self-criticism, (4) suicidal ideation, (5) interest, (6) energy/fatigue, (7) sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia), (8) decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and (9) psychomotor agitation/retardation.  The score is derived by adding the 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 22 of 29 following nine numbers – results from questions 5 (depressed mood), 10 (concentration), 11 
(worthlessness/guilt) , 12 (suicidal ideation) , 13 (decreased interest) , 14 (decreased energy)  plus 
the highest scores from questions 1-4 (sleep) , 6-9 (weight/appetite changes ), and 15-16 
(psychomotor changes) , respectively.  If any single question is left unanswered, then that 
question is scored as 0. 
The QIDS -SR16 will be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-
randomization, plus at the early termination visit, if applicable. At each of the post- baseline visits 
the QIDS -SR16 domain scores and total score will be calculated , and the scores will be 
compared with the respective baseline score to obtain  change and percent from baseline. 
Descriptive statistics for the value and changes from baseline will be tabulated for each domain 
and total score and at each time point.  
The QIDS -SR16 total score will be categorized as follows: 
• 0 to 5  = No depression  
• 6 to 10  = Mild depression  
• 11 to 15  = Moderate depression  
• 16 to 20  = Severe depression  
• 21 to 27  = Very severe d epression  
At each time point, baseline and post-baseline, the level of depression will be compared between 
each baricitinib arm and placebo using chi -square statistics with the row mean scores option. The 
number and percentage of patients in each depression level  will be tabulated fo r each treatment 
arm and each time point. The associated p -values at each time point will be presented for each 
pairwise comparison. A bar chart  that shows the distribution of patients among the bands for 
each treatment arm at each time point including the  patient’s last assessment will be presented. 
The table and figure displays will be generated for the overall population and for patients 
enrolled in Japan. 
6.3.4 Exploratory Subgroup Assessment of Response 
Subgroup assessments of response based on patient  and disease characteristics  will be performed 
on an ad hoc basis. Reviews of the data will include evaluations of potential prognostic and predictive disease characteristics  with specific interest in how these prognostic factors impact the 
EASI score. If a potential prognostic factor merits further consideration the exploratory analyses 
will at least include an NRI logistic regression analysis of the EASI -50 after 16 weeks where 
treatment, country and the potential factor are included in the model. 
7 Safety Analyses 
All analyses of safety including the extent of exposure to study medication will be performed using the s afety population. Reports will be generated using the overall population, and some 
reports will be repeated using only patients enrolled in Japan.  
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 23 of 29 7.1 Study Medication Exposure and Treatment Compliance 
7.1.1 Extent of Exposure 
Extent of exposure will be derived as:  
Extent of Exposure  = Date of 1st dose of study medication  –Date of last dose of study medication  +1, 
where study medication considers only the study tablets. Extent of exposure will be descriptively 
summarized for each treatment arm.  
Patients in this trial will also be given triamcinolone 0.1% cream as a concomitant therapy. The 
use of the cream will commence at the time of th e first study visit and will continue throughout 
the treatment period of the study. The amount of triamcinolone 0.1% cream used will be derived for both the baseline period and the treatment period. In both c ases the usage will be normalized 
to a 30 day period, i.e.  
Triamcinolone average monthly usage = total  weight  (in grams )dispensed −total  weight (in grams ) returned
duration  (in days )of study  period /30 days. 
The baseline period will commence on the date that the triamcinolone 0.1% cream is first dispensed and end on the day prior to the date of first dose of randomly assigned study treatment. The treatment period will commence on the date of first dose of randomly assigned study treatment and end on the date of last treatment period visit, i.e. usually the earlier of the date of 
the Week 16 clinic visit or the date of the early termination visit. For both study periods, triamcinolone average monthly usage will be descriptively summarized for each treatment arm using the overall and by-country populations. If warranted after review of the data, additional analyses of select efficacy variables that incorporate the triamcinolone average monthly usage as a covariate in the statistical model may be considered.  
7.1.2 Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance with the randomly assigned study medication will be evaluated at every 
clinic visit, so that the clinical site can reinforced the importance of treatment compliance with the patient. A patient will be considered significantly noncompliant if he or she misses more than 20% of the prescribed doses during the study, i.e. compliance < 80%. Similarly, a patient will be considered significantly noncompliant if he or she is judged by the investigator to have intentionally or repeatedly taken more than the prescribed amount of medication, i.e. compliance ≥ 120%. Persistent non-compliance can result in the patient being discontinued from the study. 
For the purpose of analysis only the overall treatment compliance will be summarized. Treatment 
compliance will be derived as  
Treatment Compliance = total  number  of tablets  dispensed −total  number  of tablets  returned
total  number  of tablets  expected. 
The total number of tablets expected will be equal to the number of days between the date of first dose of randomly assigned study treatment and the date of the patient’s last treatment period visit.  
Treatment compliance will be descriptively summarized for each treatment arm. In addition, the number and percentage of patients whose compliance < 80% or ≥ 120% will also be presented 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 24 of 29 for each treatment arm. Treatment compliance summaries will be produced using the ITT 
population. 
7.2 Adverse Events 
AEs will be collected from the day the patient  gives informed consent until 30 days after the 
final dose of study drug or until resolution of all serious adverse events (SAEs).  Only those AEs  
that emerge or worsen after the date of first dose of randomly assigned study medication, i.e. 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE),  will be reported . Adverse events with a missing start 
date will also be classified as TEAE.  
Summaries of TEAE  will include the number of patient s with at least one TEAE  for each 
treatment arm. When reporting by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) , the reports 
will present the SOC  in alphabetical order; while PTs within the SOC will be presented in order 
of overall decreasing frequency of occurrence in the combined baricitinib arms . A patient  with 
multiple TEAEs (different PTs) coded to the same SOC  will be counted only once for that SOC , 
but will be counted each time for different PT s within that SOC. A patient  with separate events 
of the same PT (different start/stop dates) will be counted only once in the frequency tables for 
that PT. 
TEAEs  will be reported  using the treatment that the patient  received .  
No statistical testing will be performed for comparisons  of TEAEs . 
An o verview  of all TEAE s will also be provided by treatment group using the types of AEs  
defined in the following subsections . 
7.2.1. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
TEAEs  will be summarized by SOC and PT for each treatment arm. In addition, a presentation of 
TEAE preferred terms in decreasing frequency in the combined baricitinib treatment arms will be provided.  
7.2.2. Treatment Related TEAE 
Every AE will be assessed  by the investigator for its relationship to the randomly assigned study 
medication. The subset of TEAE considered by the investigator as related to study treatment will be called treatment related TEAE.  
Treatment related TEAE will be summarized  for each treatment arm by SOC and PT and by 
decreasing frequency in the combined baricitinib arms.  
7.2.3 Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
An SAE is an AE that met one or more of the following criteria:  
• death  
• initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization  
• a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 25 of 29 • persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  or 
• considered significant by the investigator for any other reason  
Serious TEAEs  will be summarized for each tre atment arm by SOC and. A listing of all SAE 
will also be provided. The listing will be sorted by treatment arm, country, patient ID and study 
day of onset. 
7.2.4 TEAE Resulting in Death 
If there are any TEAE that result in death, then a listing of all deaths will be provided. The listing 
will be sorted by treatment arm, country, patient ID and study day of onset. 
7.2.5 TEAE Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation 
For every AE in the eCRF the investigator indicates whether the action taken with respect to the study medication was dose not changed or drug withdrawn.  
The TEAE that lead to study drug discontinuation will be summarized for each treatment arm by 
SOC and PT and by decreasing frequency in the combined baricitinib. A listing of the TEAE that 
lead to study drug discontinuation will also be provided. 
7.2.6 TEAE by Maximal Severity 
Every  AE will be  graded by the investigator as mild, moderate, or severe, so for each patient the 
greatest severity observed can be obtained by comparing the severity of all of a patient’s TEAE that share the same SOC or PT. A table of TEAE by maximal severity will be prepared for each treatment arm by SOC and PT.  
7.2.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events or laboratory results of special interest include infections; myelosuppressive events of an aemia  (haemoglobin decreased) , leukopenia (white blood cell count decrea sed), 
neutropenia (neutrophil count decreased), lymphopenia (lymphocyte count decreased), thrombocytopenia (red blood cell count decreased), thrombocyt haemia (platelet count increased) ; 
hyperlipid aemia  (lipids increased) ; hypercholesterolemia  (cholesterol increased); and elevations 
in hyper transaminasaemia (aminotransferase increased)  and hyperbilirubinemia  (bilirubin 
increased) . All TEAE for which the PT contains any of the above terms or that belong to the 
SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ will be conside red an AE of special interest. The TEAE of 
special interest will be summarized for each treatment arm by SOC and PT and by decreasing frequency in the combined baricitinib arms.  
7.3 Clinical Laboratory Results 
Blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry and urine samples for urinalysis will be collected at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-randomization. Blood samples for fasting lipid profiles will be collected at baseline and Week 16 post-randomization, and blood samples for immun oglobulins will be collected at baseline and Week s 8 and 16 post-randomization. If a 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 26 of 29 patient decides to discontinue early from the study, samples for each of the parameters will be 
collected prior to discontinuation. 
Analyses of laboratory values will be p roduced using the measurements collected the scheduled 
time points. The unscheduled assessments will only appear in data listings. An exception will be 
made for the analyses of the last measured values which for patients who do not have a 
measurement at Week 16 will be derived using the last collected scheduled or unscheduled measurement.   
7.3.1 Descriptive Statistics over Time 
At each of the post -baseline visits the change and percent change from baseline for each every 
quantitative clinical laboratory pa rameter will be derived . Descriptive statistics for the value and 
changes from baseline will be tabulated for each time point for each treatment arm.  
7.3.2 Shift tables and Categorical variables 
The grading of each laboratory parameter as low, normal or hi gh will be compared from baseline 
to Week 16 and to the last observation, which should be the Week 16 or early termination visit, Shift tables will present the number and percent of patients who started in a category (low, normal, high) at baseline and cat egory at the end of the study. Similarly, shift tables for the 
categorical urinalysis parameter will also be produced.  
Shift tables comparing baseline to the other time points in the study may be generated if warranted after data review.  
Additional shift tables will be constructed for the liver parameters – alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ), and total bilirubin 
(TBili).  For each of the transaminases the number of patients with any post- baseli ne elevation 
exceeding 3 times the upper limit of the normal range ( 3xULN ) will be counted by treatment 
arm. The counts of patients will be reported using subsets defined by the patients’ baseline 
transaminase values; i.e. ALT ≤ 1xULN, 1xULN < ALT ≤ 2xULN. The analyses of ALT and AST elevations will also be performed using 5xULN and 10xULN For TBili the number of patients with any post- baseli ne elevation exceeding 2xULN will be counted by treatment arm 
using the subsets TB ili ≤ 1xULN and TB ili > 1xULN. For ALP the number of patients with any 
post-baseline elevation exceeding 1.5xULN (also 2xULN and 3xULN) will be counted by treatment arm.  
7.4 Vital Signs and Weig ht 
The vital signs pulse and blood pressure will be assessed at baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 post-randomization, plus at the early termination visit, if applicable. Except for the Week 1 visit, weight will also be collected. At each of the post- baseline visits the vital signs and weight 
change from baseline will be computed . Descriptive st atistics for the value and change from 
baseline will be tabulated for each time point.  In addition, the number and percentage of patients 
with a systolic blood pressure reading either ≤ 90 mmHg or ≥ 160 mmHg  or a change 
≥20 mmHg, with a diastolic blood pre ssure reading either ≤ 50 mmHg or ≥ 100 mmHg or a 
change ≥10  mmHg,  or with a pulse either < 50 bpm or > 100 bpm or a change ≥15 bpm will also 
be presented by treatment group at each time point.

Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 27 of 29 No statistical analyses are planned. Any clinically significan t findings should result in a 
diagnosis to be reported as an AE. If warranted by additional review of the data further analyses 
will be performed. 
7.5 Biomarker Results 
Skin biopsies, serum, plasma, and whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples for non- genetic 
biomarker research will be collected  where local regulations and external review boards allow . 
The analyses of biomarkers will be presented for the overall population and by country. Analyses of biomarkers are exploratory object ives, so additional post- hoc analyses may be added if review 
of the data indicates such analyses are warranted.  
7.5.1 Skin biopsies  
Skin biopsy samples from atopic dermatitis lesions and adjacent normal tissue will be collected to study biomarkers related to atopic dermat itis and/or related to the mechanism of action of 
baricitinib. Samples will be collected at baseline and at Week 16. An additional sample from the 
lesion will be collected at Week 4. The tissue biomarkers to be collected include IL -4, Ki67, 
K16, and epidermal thickness. Change and percentage change from baseline for each parameter will be derived for each patient at each post -baseline visit for each type of tissue for each patient. 
Descriptive statistics for the value, change and percentage change will be tabulated for each time point.  
7.5.2 Blood biomarkers 
Peripheral blood and serum samples will be collected at baseline and at Weeks 4 and 16. The blood biomarkers to be collected include eosinophils, IL-4, IL-5, IL -10, IL -12, IL -13, IL -19, IL -
31, CCL17/TAR C, IgE, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interferon gamma (IFH -g). Change 
and percentage change from baseline for each parameter will be derived for each patient at each post- baseline visit for each type of tissue for each patient. Descriptive statistics f or the value, 
change and percentage change will be tabulated for each time point. Descriptive statistics for the maximal post- baseline change and percent change will also be presented.  
7.5.3 Filaggrin genotyping  
A blood sample for genotyping of filaggrin  will be collected at baseline (Visit 2) . The percent 
wild type will be descriptively summarized for the overall population. Scatterplots of filaggrin  
genotype with the change and percent change in EASI after 16 weeks of treatment will be presented along wit h the associated Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be provided for the 
overall population. In addition, for each treatment group side- by-side box plots of the filaggrin  
genotype will be produced for the patients who did/did not achieve EASI- 50 after 1 6 weeks of 
treatment.  
7.5.4 Correlation between Baseline Biomarkers 
Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated for each pair of biomarkers. The baseline values of these biomarkers will be used for this analysis, and all patients with baseline biomarker 
Lilly  l CHORUS   I4V- MC-JAHG  
Baricitinib  Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.0 Confidential  Page 28 of 29 data will be included. A table of all pairwise correlations will be generated for the overall 
population. The pairwise scatterplots may also be produced if warranted based on review of the data and results.  
7.5.5 Biomarkers as Measures of Disease Severity 
Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated for each biomarker and efficacy variable pairing. The baseline values of the biomarkers (skin biopsy, blood biomarker, and filaggrin genotype) and the efficacy variables ( EASI, SCORAD, IGA, DLQI, Itch NRS, and POEM) will 
be used for this analysis. All patients with baseline biomarker data and efficacy data will be included. A table of all pairwise correlations will be generated for the overall population. The pairwise scatt erplots may also be produced if warranted based on review of the data and results. 
8 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Venous blood samples (approximately 5 mL per sample) for the measurement of baricitinib concentrations will be drawn at baseline (pre-dose and at 15-30 minutes post-dose) and Weeks 4  
(1.5-4 hours post-dose) , 8 (4 -8 hours post-dose) , 12 (pre -dose), and 16 (30-90 minutes post-dose) 
post- randomization, plus at the early termination visit, if applicable.  Plasma samples from 
patients on active treatment will be assayed for baricitinib using liquid chromatography and 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) .  
Baricitinib concentrations will be summarized by treatment and time window using summary statistics  (n, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation [CV], minimum, median, 
maximum, geometric mean, and geometric CV ). 
A population PK analysis will be performed separately and reported in a population PK report.  Exposure-response relationships between the primary and select secondary efficacy endpoints and plasma exposure may also be explored. 
9 Health Outcome Psychometric Analyses 
A separate analysis plan (GPORWE 2016-0067) describing the psychometric analyses of the Itch 
NRS and POEM as well as responder definition will be provided by Lilly Global Patient Outcomes and Real World Evidence.

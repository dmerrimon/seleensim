Arm B objectives  
 
 Dose escalation phase I part  
Primary objective  
­ To determine the safety profile and tolerability  
 in patients  with AM L 
Secondary objectives  
­ To determine  the PK profile of , 
and potential metabolites  
­ To evaluate the anti- leukemic activity of  
Exploratory objectives  
­ Exploratory ob jectives for Arm B will be further defined.  
Methodology:  
This phase I/II trial is designed as follows: 
- Arm A:  evaluating the combination of S64315 with azacitidine  in the frame of a phase I/II trial and designed 
in two parts: 
• A dose escalation phase I part: a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with escalation with 
overdose control (EWOC) will be used to guide  the dose escalation of the combination. 
• An expansion phase II part with two sub-arms A1 and A2 previously described. A Bayesian two- stage 
adaptive design with one interim analysis for futility will be performed in each sub- arm. 
- Arm B:  in the frame of a dose 
escalation phase I part. This arm will also be supported by a BLRM with EWOC.  
 
Dose escalation  methodology and dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment in Arm A  
The BLRM will  be used to estimate the MTD(s) and/or the RP2D based on the occurrence of DLT (defined in 
section  4.1.3.5 ), including the  S64315 lead- in dose (LID) period and the first cycle of treatment . 
Toxicities are assessed according to NCI- CTCAE v5.0.  
The MTD is defined as the highest dosage of S64315 in combination with azacitidine that is unlikely (<  25% 
posterior probability) to cause DLT in more than 33% of the tr eated patients up to the end of cycle 1 . A maximum 
of 6 DLT -evaluable patients may be initially enrolled at a dose level, and a minimum of 3 DLT -evaluable patients 
must be treated at a given dose level before a new higher dose level may be evaluated. More than 6 DLT -
evaluable patients may be treated in a cohort at dose levels considered safe according to the BLRM with overdose 
control in order to better characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, or preliminary clinical activity of S64315 
in combination with azacitidine . A minimum of 6 DLT -evaluable patients must have been evaluated at the dose 
level considered to be the MTD, and before treating patients with this dose in the Phase II part of the study.  
Only the dose of S64315 will be escalated. The first S64315 weekly full tested dose will be 50 mg; azacitidine 
will be administered at a fixed dose (75 mg/m²/day for 7 days)  in each cycle of treatment. A panel of S64315 
doses from 25 mg (dose - 1) to 250 mg may be tested according to the dose allocation of the BLRM. Intermediate 
doses may be proposed depending on available results during the study.

Before testing a new dose level, an EoC meeting between the sponsor and the investigators will take place to 
discuss the DLTs, overall safety, PK, PD anti -leukemic activity observed in all patients, and to decide jointly 
the next dose level to be tested. Increments will not exceed 100% of the previous dose. A DSMB will review the 
data before each EoC meeting and provide recommendations . 
For more details, see section 10.2. 
 
Expansion phase II part methodology  
The multi sub -arm expansion phase II part will s tart once the RP2D (MTD or suitable lower dose) of the 
combination Arm A has been determined  during the dose escalation phase I part . A Bayesian two -stage design 
with one interim analysis for futility will guide the decision for each sub- arm and will be divided into two stages: 
stage 1 and stage 2.  
During stage 1, patients will be enrolled and treated at the corresponding RP2D. At the end of stage 1, a Bayesian 
interim analysis for futility will be performed based on CR rate assessment.  
According to futil ity interim analysis result in each sub -arm (A1  and A2), recruitment could be:  
­ Stopped, if results on CR rate are considered futile  
­ Continued if results on CR rate are considered not futile. In that case, one additional cohort of patients will 
be enrolled in stage 2 until the predefined end of study.  
For more details, see section 10.3. 
Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis during dose expans ion as described  in section 10.3.2 . 
Number  of included patients  
Arm A 
­ Dose escalation phase I part: a pproximately 30 patients  
­ Expansion phase II part: approximately 50 patients per sub -arm (up to 1 00 overall)

within 4 weeks before  the first IMP administration.  
For concomitant medication (prohibited or to be us ed with caution) , refer to section 6.3. 
Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs)  
Arm A 
S64315 (test drug) and azacitidine administered in combination are both IMPs.  
Dose and treatment schedule  
 
 S64315 lead -in dose period  
The lead -in dose period will last 2 weeks. S64315 LID1 will be administered on D -13 at 25  mg and LID2 on D -
6 at 50 mg. LID1 and LID2 doses will be fixed all along the study.  
 
 Combination t reatment period  
A treatment cycle will consist of 28  days for patients t reated with S64315 in combination with azacitidine during 
the dose escalation phase I part : 
­ Weekly schedule for S64315 on CxD2, CxD9, CxD16 and CxD23 
­ Daily schedule for azacitidine from CxD1 to CxD7 followed by a 21- day rest period  
S64315 will be administered via intravenous ( IV) infusion over at least 2  hours.  
The dose escalation will only concern S64315 during the combination treatment period. The starting dose will 
be 50 mg once weekly and doses up to 250  mg may be explored. For more details, see Table  (4.1.3.3 ) 1. 
Azacitidine will be administered at 75  mg/m² via subcutaneous (SC ) injection, daily for 7  days from D1 to D7 
of each cycle followed by a rest period of 21 days.  
On days of concomitant administration of S64315 and azacitidine (CxD2), azacitidine should be administered  
2h (±10 minutes (min)) prior to S64315.  
For each cohort, if a dose/treatment combination schedule has not been tested yet, a one -week safety window 
should be observed between C1D2 of the first patient and C1D2 of subsequent patients in the same cohort. If  no 
medically important or life -threatening toxicity occurs during the one -week observation period, the subsequent 
patients will be allowed to  start treatment without further delays between subsequent patients . 
Depending on the risk of the potential drug-d rug interaction (DDI) between the IMPs or emergent safety issues, 
the dose of either or both IMPs may be modified.  
Alternative dosing schedules may be further explored based on the observed clinical safety data, PK/PD data 
and non- clinical data (in vitro, in vivo, PK/PD modelling data).  
In the expansion phase II part,  patients will be treated at the RP2D (MTD or suitable lower dose) of S64315 in 
combination with azacitidine identified during the dose escalation phase I part.  
Arm B  
are  the IMPs.  
Dose and treatment schedule  
The dose and administrative schedule should be detailed via an amendment  
 
Prophylaxis, IMP administration/readministration criteria in Arm A phase I/II  are defined hereafter. They 
will be further defined for Arm B via an amendment.

Azacitidine  Page :  
Anti -emetic prophylaxis  
Anti- emetic  prophylaxis is strongly recommended prior to S64315 infusion and azacitidine administration to 
mitigate the risk of gastro -intestinal side effects. For more details, see section 8.2.8.1. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis  
TLS prophylaxis is required during each administration of IMPs for patients with active disease, in case of intra -
patient dose escalation to a new assi gned dose and in case of readministration after IMP interruption ≥ 28 days. 
TLS preventive strategies will start the day before the first S64315 infusion of the LID period. In addition to the 
recommendations described in the protocol, management of TLS wil l be based on international guidelines and 
published criteria ( Cairo, 2010 ). For more details see section 8.2.9 . 
Infusio n related reaction (IRR) prophylaxis  
IRR prophylaxis is proposed prior to S64315 infusions. For more details, see section 8.2.10 . 
IMP administration/readministration criteria  
Criteria to fulfil before each S64 315 administration  
­ Before each S64315 infusion, all biological parameters should be checked in order to detect any toxicity (see  
Table (4.1.3.5) 1 and Table  (8.12) 1 ). 
­ Patients with Grade ≥ 2 hypo/hypercalcemia and/or hypo/hypermagnesia and/or hypo/hyperkalaemia despite 
attempts at medical correction  should not be treated with S64315  
­ Patients with white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 10  G/L despite attempts at medical correction should not be 
treated with S64315. Hydroxycarbamide or leukapheresis may be used to reduce the circulating blast count 
before and throughout the study. WBC count must be checked twice a week during the LID period in order 
to maintain  the WBC < 10 G/L 
­ AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN (except for LID1: AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN)  
­ Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x ULN, except for patients with known Gilbert’s syndrome, who are excluded if 
total bilirubin > 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN  
­ In the case of  an S64315 interruption ≥ 28 days, its readministration must be preceded by a lead- in dose 
period (except for patients in CR/CRi) . For more de tails, see section 6.1.2.  
Criteria to fulfil before each first azacitidine administration (i.e. CXD1)  
Patients should be monitored for haematological toxicity and r enal toxicities. A delay in starting the next cycle 
or a dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity and/or renal toxicity may be necessary according to 
azacitidine E.U. SmPC (see Table  (8.12) 2). WBC, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelets, serum creatinine, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum bicarbonate will be assessed befo re starting the next treatment cycle.  
Comparator: Not applicable  
Duration of treatment  
The planned duration of combination treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, treatment 
failure or patient/physician decision.  
­ In case the patient becomes eligible for transplant, patient treatment discontinuation should be left to the 
investigator’s decision  
­ In case of myelosuppression within the context of non- active AML, a 4 -week interruption of administration 
of one or both IMP(s) will be  allowed for bone marrow recovery at the investigator’s discretion after 
discussion and approval from the Sponsor

If one drug is permanently discontinued, both drugs should be discontinued. A patient should be withdrawn from 
the study if one of the IMPs is interrupted for more than 28 consecutive days for any reason. However, for 
patients with LVEF decline, IMP interruptions of up to 35 consecutive days are permitted.  
If the patient is  benefiting from the study treatment according to the investigator’s judgement and if it is in the 
patient’s best interest to continue the combination of S64315 with azacitidine , the patient may remain on study 
treatment.  
A patient must discontinue the combination if the toxicity recurs with the same or worse severity after resumption 
of dosing, unless the investigator decides it is in the patient’s best interest to continue the comb ination of IMPs 
and upon documented agreement with the Sponsor.  
For each patient, once a dose reduction has occurred, the dose may not be re -escalated during the subsequent 
cycles unless in the opinion of the investigator it is in the patient’s best intere st to continue S64315, and upon 
documented agreement with the Sponsor.  
Criteria for treatment discontinuation during the LID period:  
­ If the patient cannot receive the LID2 or the first S64315 C1D2 dose due to an AE, the S64315 infusion 
(either LID2 or C1D2 ) may be postponed by 1 to 5 days. If the LID2 is postponed for more than 2 days 
(5 days maximum), the C1D2 dose may not be postponed for more than 2 days. If S64315 C1D2 is postponed, 
azacitidine C1D1 dose should be postponed as well, whenever possible.  
­ If the AE is not recovered within this time period, the patient must be withdrawn from the study.  
This study may be temporarily halted or prematurely discontinued at any time for any sufficient ly reasonable 
cause. Stopping rules are described in correspondi ng sections  4.4.1 , 4.4.2 , 8.12, 10.2.8  and 10.3. 
The end of trial is defined as the date of the last follow -up visit of the last patient, including a phone contact, or 
the date of the last contact attempt if the last patient is declared los t to follow -up. 
Criteria for evaluation  
 
Evaluation criteria in the dose escalation phase I part of Arm A are defined hereafter . They will be updated 
for the expansion phase II part for sub -arms A1 and A2 according to results observed in the phase I part and 
for the dose escalation of Arm B  according to the results of Arm A via an amendment . 
Efficacy measurements  
­ All patients will be evaluated for response based on the ‘Diagnosis and management of AML in ad ults: 2017 
ELN recommendations from an international expert panel ( Döhner, 2017)  (see Appendix 5).  
­ A full blood count and a blood film examination, a bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and/or a bone marrow 
biopsy (BMB) (according to local medical practice)  will be assessed for treatment response at defined time 
points.  
For more details see section 7. 
Safety assessmen ts 
Safety assessments will include:  
­ Incidence of DLTs  
­ Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 
­ Recording of any change or addition of a new concomitant treatment  
­ Laboratory tests: haematology with differential, blood biochemistry, thyroid function, blood coagulation, 
urinary analysis, hepatitis markers, TLS monitoring, cardiac markers follow up  
­ Complete physical examination, ECOG performance status, vital signs measurements

2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
2.1. Acute myeloid leukaemia  
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)  is the result of a multistep transforming process of 
hematopoietic precursor cells, which enables them to proceed through limitless numbers of cell cycles and  to become resistant to cell death. Increased proliferation renders these cells 
vulnerable to acquiring mutations and may favour leukemic evolution. Deregulated cell cycle 
control contributes to increased proliferation in AML and favours genomic instability, a prerequisite to confer selective advantages to particular clones in order to adapt and independently proliferate in the presence of a changing microenvironment  (Schnerch, 2012) . A 
number of chromosomal and molecular genetic abnormalities has been described in this disease. Sub-classification based on these abnormalities guides prognosis  (Döhner, 2017) . 
The yearly incidence of AML in European adults is 5- 8 cases per 100  000 (Fey, 2013) , 4.2 cases 
per 100,000 in US (Society AC. Cancer Facts & Figures, 2016)  and 3.9 cases per 100,000 
people in Australia (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2012) . Outcome for patients are 
poor with a  5-year survival rate of 26.9%. Untreated patients succumb to AML within weeks 
(Institute NC. Cancer Stat Facts: AML, 2017;  Maldonado, 2015) . 
The incidence of AML increases approximately by 10- fold with age, from 1.3 cases per 100,000 
people under 65 years of age to 12.2 cases per 100,000 in those over 65 years of age (De Kouchkowsky, 2016) . AML is the most common acute leukaemia in the adult population, and 
largely affects older patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years. Approximately 1/3 of all new diagnoses are aged 75 years and over (Institute NC. SEER Stat Facts Sheets: AML, 2016) . In the elderly population, outcome is dismal with less than 5% survival at 5- years 
compared to a rate of 40% in younger patients ( Alibhai, 2009) . Long- term survival rate remains 
low with a median overall survival estimated at 7.0 months (Meyers, 2013) . This is driven by 
the aggressive clinico -pathologic features of AML compounded with the comorbidities and 
frailty of this population. 
The standard initial management for fitter patients with minimal comorbidities is intensive 
chemotherapy; older, less fit patients tolerate this poorly, resulting in limited effective treatment options (Cortes, 2019;  Kantarjian, 2012) . Historically, these patients have been referred for 
palliative or supportive care or treated with single -agent hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or 
low-dose cytarabine (L DAC) , which have modest response rates.  
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    32/173  AML is a biologically complex tumour with high rates of drug resistance. The goal of therapy 
is to reduce tumour burden and to re -establish normal bone marrow function and 
haematopoiesis. Evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) places the patient at ris k of 
relapse and short -term survival (Pettit, 2016) . The central tenet of treatment is to cytoreduce 
with induction therapy while allowing the patient to emerge in a condition to tolerate subsequent more intensive consoli dation therapy, which may include allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT). Patients who do not receive consolidation therapy relapse within 6-9 months. 
Initial treatment decisions are based on age, performance status, prior myelodysplast ic 
syndrome and prior cytotoxic therapy. Standard induction therapy for patients under the age of 60 usually consists of cytarabine and 
daunorubicin regimen. Overall outcomes for standard induction therapy are disappointing with complete response (CR) rate between 60 -80% (Murphy, 2017) . Half of those who do not reach 
complete remission experience fatal complications related to bone marrow aplasia or impaired recovery of normal haematopoiesis and the remaining population develop chemotherapy resistant disease.  
Older patients present a particular challenge in the management of AML. In this population, 
AML is characterized by unfavourable karyotypes and higher mutational burden. Furthermore, 
the incidence of secondary AML, rel ated to prior MDS or prior chemotherapy is higher in this 
population where current standard of care regimen may be difficult to tolerate, and treatment -
related mortality may exceed expected anti -leukemic response. 
Allogeneic HSCT, the only realistic hope of cure for these patients, is an option for a minority. Only patients with low tumour -burden and a long remission period (response 
rates  > 12 months) appear to benefit from this treatment. Despite the curative intent, outcomes 
in these patients are sub -optimal. In a long- term follow -up study of post -allogeneic HSCT in 
AML and MDS patients, the reported relapse rate was 42% at 5  years (Finke, 2016) . Besides 
allogeneic HSCT, no curative treatment exists for p atients with relapsed AML. This is even 
more challenging in older patients, who usually experience short remissions (< 1 year) and are often considered unfit to tolerate intensive treatments (Ferrara, 2004) . 
Due to the hi gh rates of relapse or recurrence in AML, there is a great need for effective salvage 
therapies.  
In recent years, much has been learned about the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of AML, and the clonal architecture of both de novo and secondary AML has begun to be unravelled.  
Genetic studies in AML have revealed a variety of mutated or overexpressed proteins that, alone or in combination, contribute to leukemogenesis. New targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting these proteins are in development for treatmen t of AML.  Since the past year, several novel 
agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with AML. Indeed I, 2017, the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin, the antibody- drug conjugate 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CPX -351 (liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine), and the IDH2 
inhibitor enasidenib were approved. In 2018, other 4 new compounds were approved: the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib, the FLT3 inhibitor new generation gilteritinib, the first in class Hedghog pathway glasdegid, and the Bcl -2 inhibitor venetoclax. The latter received a granted accelerated 
approval in November 2018 in combination with azacitidine, decitabine or low -dose cytarabine 
(LDAC) for the treatment of newly -diagnosed AML in adults who are age 75 years or older, or 
who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy in the frame of a phase I/II . 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    33/173  This recent U.S. FDA approval of venetoclax with HMAs or LDAC in patients with AML who 
are previously untreated and older or unfit for chemotherapy has resulted in a promising therapy for these patients (DiNardo, 2018; Wei, 2019) . 
Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular basis for particular subtypes of AML and despite four new drugs approved for patients with FLT3 mutant, IDH2 mutant, CD33 positive AML, t-AML, and AML- MRC  (Wei, 2017) , a significant proportion of AML patients 
cannot be treated. New therapies are clearly needed, and in particular , there is a need to develop 
targeted therapies that avoid the use of cytotoxic drugs, many of which are also known mutagens. 
2.2. Overview of S64315 (Mcl- 1 inhibitor)  
S64315 background 
One of the cardinal features of cancer is a dysregulation of apoptosis (Hanahan, 2011)  
(Hanahan, 2011) Apoptosis is a physiological vital process for the maintenance of homeostasis 
in multicellular organisms, but it is also involved in a wide range of pathological processes, including cancer.  
The regulation of apoptotic cell death is primarily controlled by the complex interactions of the 
Bcl-2 family of proteins  (Kim, 2006; Kale, 2018) . The Bcl -2 family comprises both pro (such 
as Bax, Bak, Noxa, PUMA, Bim, and Bid) and anti -apoptotic members, the latter (such as Bcl -
2, Bcl -xL, Bcl -w, Mcl -1 and Bfl -1/A1) are often overexpressed in cancer cells allowing a 
deregulated survival ( Adams, 2018) . 
Small molecule selective Bcl- 2 family inhibitors induce apoptotic cell death by releasing pro -
apoptotic members  (Tse, 2008;  Danial, 2004;  Green, 2004) . Pharmacological inhibition of 
antiapoptotic Bcl -2 subfamily members in cancer has emerged as one of the strategies to induce 
apoptosis and cause tumour regression (Zhang, 2007) . 
Mcl-1 (induced myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein) was the second member of the 
Bcl-2 family discovered (Kozopas, 1993) . Mcl -1 is highly expressed in a variety of human 
cancer cell lines, human haematopoietic,  lymphoid cancers and solid tumours  (Quinn, 2011)
. 
Mcl-1 overexpression is exploited by cancer cells to evade cell death, i.e. to survive, and as a 
mechanism for developing resistance to diverse chemotherapeutic agents ( Akgus, 2009)  Mcl-1 
plays a crucial role in cell differentiation, regulation of apoptotic cell death, and has been shown 
to be critical to the development and maintenance of AML, making it an attractive therapeutic target in this disease.  
In line with this observation, molecules targeting Mcl -1 such as S64315 (also named MIK665) 
are expected to be active in combination with conventional therapies (Hata, 2005) . 
2.2.1. Non clinical data  
Pharmacology 
S64315 (MIK665) is an innovative Bcl -2 Homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic compound which 
selectively inhibits Mcl-1, a prosurvival member of the Bcl- 2 family proteins.  
S64315 is a synthetic small molecule which binds selectively to Mcl -1 with a very high affinity 
(IC
50 range 3 -6 nM in a displacement assay ) and with low affinity to Bcl-2 and Bcl- xL. 
In vitro, the ability of S64315 to inhibit cell growth was investigated in a panel of 
haematological cell lines including AML, lymphoma and multiple myeloma human cell lines. Most of the cell lines tested was sensitive to S64315, with IC
50 below 100 nM. 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    34/173  In vivo , S64315 administered IV induced a rapid dose -dependent apoptotic response and tumour 
growth inhibition in an AML xenograft model. These data show that the in vitr o potency of 
S64315 against haematological cell lines well translates to potent in vivo  activity.  For details, 
please refer to S64315 Investigator’s Brochure. 
S64315 was assessed for its off -target activity on receptors, enzymes and ion channels; 
however, the values obtained show that inhibition of the latter is unlikely in a clinical setting. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism In preclinical IV studies, S64315 displayed a very high plasma protein binding across species 
(fraction unbound (fu) in plasm a < 0.1% in mouse, rat, monkey and human) with more than 
80% of the drug distributed in plasma. There was no concentration- dependency observed for 
rat, monkey and human plasma. 
In a mouse distribution study using non- radiolabelled S64315, high liver exposure was 
observed with low to moderate uptake into muscle and adipose tissue and very low brain 
exposure. 
In vitro , cross -species metabolism studies showed a moderate to high in vitro  predicted hepatic 
clearance in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human. Based on human hepatocyte data, S64315 is 
mainly metabolised through oxidative routes by CYP3A4 (50%) and CYP2C8 (20%). Direct glucuronidation of S64315 contributes to S64315 clearance for 30% or less. There is a moderate drug- drug interaction (DDI) risk when combining S64315 with CYP3A4 perpetrators and a low 
risk with CYP2C8 perpetrators. 
Based on rat excretion data, renal clearance is predicted to be minor (less than 0.1% of the 
administered dose is excreted as unchanged S64315 within urine). The risk of DDI will have to be further investigated in clinic.  
Toxicology 
Preclinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology data do not indicate a risk for QTc prolongation 
or arrhythmogenicity based on the hERG assay, monkey telemetry studies, and ECGs evaluated in the 4- week  GLP study in monkeys. There were no appreciable effects on CNS function or 
change in seizure threshold nor were there any effects on respiration observed in any study. 
S64315 was devoid of in vitro  and in vivo  genotoxic potential. 
In addition to the haematotoxicity, the principal target organs of toxicity following repeated 
S64315 administration (whatever the schedule of administration, either once weekly during 4 weeks or every 2 to 3 days during 2 weeks) to rats and monkeys include: bone marrow 
(depletion, hypocellularity), lymph organs (depletion and atrophy), liver (hepatocellular single -
cell necrosis/apoptosis), gastrointestinal tract (epithelial cell single cell necrosis/apoptosis), pancreas (acinar cell single- cell necrosis/apoptosis), heart  (increased staining of 
cardiomyocytes for cleaved caspase 3), testes (germ cell depletion), ovary (granulosa cell single- cell necrosis/apoptosis), skin (localized degeneration and cutaneous inflammation), eye 
(corneal degeneration and opacity and cataract s). 
All these changes showed recovery after a 4 -week dosing period. 
For details, please refer to S64315 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 
2.2.2. Clinical data  
As of September 5
th, 2019 (IB cut -off date), three clinical studies were ongoing in patients with  
haematological malignancies . 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    35/173  ­ Two phase I studies with S64315 as a single agent in patients with: 
 AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) conducted by Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier (CL1 -64315-001). Thirty -eight ( 38) patients  have been treated in 
this study with dose ranging 50-500 mg of S64315 as a weekly intravenous infusion. The 
dose of 500 mg was identified to be toxic, cardiotoxicity being the dose- limiting toxicity 
(see IB section ‘Guidance for Investigator 7.11.6. Cardiovascular’) and 300 mg has  been 
established as the highest safe dose allowable by the EWOC criterion. No objective response w as observed across the dose range, even though pharmacodynamics effects 
with bone marrow blast reduction were observed in 10/25 patients. Following the asses sment of the benefit -risk of S64315 as single agent in AML/MDS patients, i.e. no 
objective response observed whereas toxic dose reached (i.e. 500mg), it was decided to definitively discontinue the development of S64315 in monotherapy in AML/MDS patients an d therefore to discontinue the CL1-64315- 001 study. Taking into account  the 
mechanism of action, the role of the other BH3 mimetics proteins and the heterogeneity of the BCL2 family member’s expression in AML, further development of S64315 in combination is considered in AML. 
 Lymphomas and multiple myeloma (MM) conducted by Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
(CMIK665X2101). T hirty -one (31) patients ha ve been treated since the start of the study . 
The benefit -risk assessment of MIK665 as single agent in MM  and lymphoma indication 
is currently under evaluation while the study is not recruiting new patients. 
­ One phase Ib study with S64315 in combination with a Bcl -2 inhibitor (venetoclax) in 
patients with AML conducted by Institut de Recherches Internationale s Servier (CL1 -64315-
002). T welve (12) patients ha ve been treated since the start of the study.  The benefit -risk 
assessment of S64315 in combination with venetoclax in AML patients is still considered favourable providing that additional safety measures, e specially towards cardiac safety 
monitoring have been implemented. 
The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) (in ≥  15% of the patients) irrespective of 
the relationship to the study drug involved the SOC gastrointestinal disorders and the SOC inves tigations. The most frequently reported preferred terms among gastrointestinal disorders 
were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and, among investigations, troponin I increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) increased. The most frequent severe AEs independently from the relationship to the study drug were febrile neutropenia, anaemia and neutropenia.  
For more details on S64315 global safety, please refer to the last version of the IB (e.g.  
section  7: Guidance for investigator). 
Pharmacokinetic properties Preliminary PK data from the single agent  studies were analysed by population PK modelling 
and were adequately described by a 3 -compartment model with linear clearance estimated to 
15.9 L/h. High level interpretation based on the preliminary PK data and population PK modelling shows 
low to moderate variability (~30%) on exposure metrics (C
max, AUC). Exposure appears to 
increase proportionally with the dose, independently of the time and to be comparable between CMI K665X2101 and CL1-64315- 001 studies. Exposure is quickly decreasing after end of 
infusion implying that AUC
24h is comparable to AUC tau, deviating less than 5%.

samples Figure (2.3.2) 1. The combination mostly induces synergistic activity, even in samples 
resistant to azacitidine.  
Figure  (2.3.2) 1 - Ex vivo activity of S63845 in combination with azacitidine in primary AML samples 
 
 
Ficoll purified AML cells were exposed to drugs over a period of 48 hours. Viability was de termined by cellular 
exclusion of SYTOX Blue Dead Cell Stain. Analysis was performed in 34 independent donors and 4 representative 
AML samples were represented.  
Finally, the combination of S63845 and decitabine was tested in in vivo AML patient derived 
xenografts  (PDX) as shown in Figure (2.3.2) 2. This combination induces more activity when 
compared to the single agents.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    38/173  These data suggest that when S63845, tool compound of S64315, and decitabine are 
concomitantly administered, the Mcl -1 inhibitor may enhance the effect of the HMA in 
relapsed/refractory and treatment naive AML patients. This further supports the evaluation of 
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti -leukemic activity of 
S64315 in combination with azacitidine in a clinical study. 
2.3.3. Azacitidine clinical data  
Azacitidine is a n HMA commonly used in the treatment of AML. It is approved by the FDA 
and EMA. According to E.U SmPC, azacitidine is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
who are not eligible for HSCT with  AML with 20 -30 % blasts and multi -lineage dysplasia, 
according to World Health Or ganisation (WHO) classification and  AML with >30% marrow 
blasts according to the WHO classification.  
Myelosuppression is the main dose -limiting toxicity for azacitidine. The risk is higher during 
the first 2 cycles and decreases when the patient’s haematological function is restored. Less than 5% of patients required drug discontinuation due to haematological side effects. Close 
monitoring for haematological toxicity is recommended, including nadir counts, and supportive care provided when required. Doses for subsequent cycles should be adjusted based on nadir counts and haematological response (see E.U. azacitidine SmPC). Myelosuppression may lead to neutropenia and an increased risk of infection. Serious adverse reactions such as sepsis, including neutropenic sepsis and pneumonia, were repo rted in patients receiving azacitidine. 
Infections may be managed with the use of anti -infectives plus growth factor support (e.g. G -
CSF) for neutropenia. 
The most common non -haematological side effects are injection site reactions, nausea, 
vomiting, fatig ue, and diarrhoea/ constipation. The gastrointestinal adverse reactions are to be 
managed symptomatically with anti- emetics for nausea and vomiting, anti -diarrhoeals for 
diarrhoea, and laxatives and/or stool softeners for constipation. Severe hepatic failure has been reported in patients with extensive disease and 
hypoalbuminemia. Therefore, azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours. 
No clinically relevant difference in the frequency of adverse reactions was noted be tween 
subjects with normal renal function compared to those with renal impairment. Nevertheless, 
patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and/or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney, as some rare cases of renal tubular dysfunction have been reported. 
2.3.4. Expected overlapping toxicities  
Based on preclinical data from both drugs, clinical data from azacitidine as a single agent in 
monotherapy as well as preliminary clinical data available from ongoing studies with S64315, bone marrow and lymphoid organs are identified as primary target organs for toxicity; overlapping myelosuppression may be observed. The risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has also to be considered. Other overlapping toxicities such as gastrointestinal disorders may be 
observed (see section 8 for toxicity prophylaxis). 
Even if pharmacology investigations indicate the potential for synergistic toxicity, no dedicated 
combination toxicity study had been considered since the safety of azacitidine is well known. The measures implemented, including clinical monitoring and described in the section 8 of this 
document are deemed sufficient to mitigate the risk and to predict clinical dose adjustments.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    39/173  2.3.5. Pharmacokinetics and metabolism  
When coadministered, in vitro  results show an inhibition of hepatic efflux (P -GP) of S64315 
by azacitidine. With limited in vitro /in vivo  information for azacitidine, population based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations have been performed to quantify this impact. PBPK 
simulations show a very limited DDI risk between azacitidine and S64315 with concomitant administration. Thus, from a PK point of view, there is no recommendation of starting dose adaptation due to DDI risk.  
2.3.6. Starting dose rationale & administration schedule 
In the study CL1-64315- 001 assessing S64315 as a single agent in a weekly schedule without 
lead-in dose period, doses from 50 to 500 mg were tested. Based on all the DLT data collected 
since the beginning of the study across 38 evaluable patients with AML or MDS, 500 mg was 
identified to be a toxic dose and 300 mg was the highest dose considered safe by the statistical model i.e. BLRM with EWOC criterion. Nevertheless, considering the global safety observed at 300 mg (except DLT), it was decided not to overpass S64315 weekly dose of 250 mg . 
 
­ Arm A evaluating the combination of S64315 with azacitidine in the frame of a phase 
I/II trial  
 Dose escalation phase I part 
The choice of the starting dose of S64315 in the A rm A is based on the first clinical data 
(safety and PK profile) from the administration schedule assessing weekly S64315 as a 
single agent, taking into account the anticipated activity , the limited DDI risk between 
S64315 and azacitidine and the potential risk of overlapping toxicity regarding the haematotoxicity and GI toxicity . Thus, following a conservative approach, the started  
dose of S64315 proposed to assess the combination of S64315 and azacitidine will be 
50 mg once a week  as full tested dose . The dose escalation will be preceded by a 2 -week 
lead-in dose (LID) period of weekly S64315 at a fixed dose of 25 mg for LID1 and 50 mg 
for LID2.  
The introduction of the LID period with fixed low doses of S64315 aims:  to allow an early detection of patients with cardiac sensit ivity to S64315 and to prevent 
subsequent administrations with higher doses to these patients 
 to improve the overall tolerance to S64315 
 to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) 
 Azacitidine  will be administered via subcutaneous injection at the dose of 75 mg/m², 
daily from day 1 to day 7, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28- day cycles), 
according to the current E.U SmPC. 
With regards to the administration schedule of the combination, there is an interest to administer azacitidine before the targeted dose of S64315 in order to sensitize the tumour cells to  S64315 (Caenepell, 2018) . For this reason, the administration schedule starting 
from cycle 1 onwards, over 28-day cycles is, as follows:  Azacitidine  daily administered via a subcutaneous injection, from day 1 to day 7 (D1 to 
D7), followed by a rest period of 21 days 
 S64315 administered intravenously weekly, on day 2, day 9, day 16 and day 23 (D2, D9, D16, D23) 
 Expansion phase II part  
The dose of S64315 tested during the expansion phase II part will be the MTD/RP2D identified during the dose escalation phase I part, whichever the sub -arm (A1  or A2).

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    41/173  2.4.2. Rationale for the combination of a Mcl- 1 inhibitor and a Bcl -2 inhibitor  
Given its selectivity fo r BCL -2, an intrinsic mechanism of venetoclax resistance is due to 
increased AML blast dependency on the anti -apoptotic proteins, BCL -xL and MCL -1. In the 
phase II trial of venetoclax monotherapy in relapsed/refractory AML patients, both BCL -xL 
and MCL -1 expression levels were negatively correlated with response to venetoclax 
(Konopleva, 2016) . A numbers of novel therapies tested in pre -clinical models in combination 
with venetoclax have demonstrated synergistic e ﬀects by downregulating MCL -1 expression 
(Sillar, 2019) . 
Indeed, azacitidine has also been shown to reduce MCL -1 expression (Tsao, 2012) . Hence, 
directly targeting MCL -1 makes logical sense in combination with a Bcl -2 inhibitor in AML. 
As proof of concept, a recent study investigated the role of BCL -2 and MCL -1 in AML survival 
by combining inducible lentiviral vectors expressing BH3- only proteins and venetoclax to 
differentially target anti- apoptotic BCL -2 family members, BCL -2 and MCL1 emerged as 
critical and complementary proteins regulating cell survival in acute myeloid leukaemia. Dual 
targeting of BCL -2 and MCL1, but not either alone, prolonged survival of leukaemia -bearing 
mice. Targeting BCL -2 and MCL -1 improved survival in a mouse xenograft model, whereas 
other combinations including BCL -2/BCL -XL/BCL -W or MCL -1 alone, did not. Hence, 
combining venetoclax with an MCL -1 inhibitor is an exciting prospect for the treatment of 
patients with AML (Teh, 2018) . 
In pre -clinical studies, we have demonstrated the anti -leukemic efﬁcacy of a novel BCL -2 
inhibitor S55746 which demonstrates synergistic pro-apoptotic activity in combination with the 
MCL1 inhibitor S63845 (related analogue of S64315). Activity of the combination was caspase 
and BAX/BAK dependent, superior to combination with standard cytotoxic AML drugs and active against a broad spectrum of poor risk genotypes, including primary samples from patients with chemoresistant AML. Co -targeting BCL -2 and MCL -1 was more effective against 
leukemic, compared to normal hematopoietic progenitors, suggesting a therapeutic window of activity. Finally, S55746 combined with S63845 prolonged survival in xenograft models of AML  Figure (2.4.2) 1. Combined S55746 and S63845 suppresses leukaemia in vivo in NRG -
SG3 patient -derived xenograft models of AML but not normal hematopoietic cells in bone 
marrow of engrafted mice.  
Figure  (2.4.2) 1 - Combined targeting of BCL -2 and MCL -1 improves the survival of mice  
xenografted with human AML  
 
These results suggest that targeting both BCL2 and MCL1 using small molecule inhibitors to suppress human AML in vivo may have less severe adverse effects on normal bone marrow 
hematopoietic function than standard cytotoxic drugs (Moujalled, 2019) .

4.1.3. Dose escalation phase I part procedure for A rm A  
The following sections are applicable for the A rm A  dose escalation phase I part. They will be 
updated for A rm B  dose escalation phase I part, according to the results of A rm A.  
4.1.3.1. General points  
The sponsor will be responsible for the coordination of the clinical trial and will provide regular 
updates to the centres on the study progress.  
The dose escalation phase I part will be conducted in clinical centres which have a proven expertise in phase I studies in oncology. Multicentre study will allow improving patient’s recruitment.  
During the dose escalation phase I part, at each new d ose level , the IMPs will be firstly 
administered to one patient. If no medically important or life -threatening toxicity occurs during 
a 1 week observation period, the subsequent patients will be allowed to start treatment without 
further delays between subsequent patients. The dose increase between two dose levels will be guided by the observed toxicities. 
A specific monitoring of potential cardiac, haematological, liver, etc. toxicities will be set up 
as described  in section  8. 
4.1.3.2. Dose administration schedules  
The initial schedule will consist of a 2 -week S64315 lead- in dose period followed by a 28-day 
cycle with the combination, i.e. a weekly regimen for S64315 and a daily regimen for azacitidine over 7 days. 
Alternative dosing schedules based on the observed clinical safety, PK/PD data and non- clinical 
data (in vitro, in vivo, PK/PD modelling data) may be further explored. They should be 
integrated in the protocol via an amendment. 
S64315 will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion over at least 2h once every week, as 
follows: 
­ 2-week lead -in dose period i.e. fixed lead -in dose 1 (LID1) of 25 mg on D -13 and fixed 
lead-in dose 2 (LID2) of 50 mg on D-6 
­ followed by the combination treatment period over 28-day cycles , i.e. on CxD2, CxD9, 
CxD16 and CxD23 
The starting dose will be 50 mg. A panel of dose from 25 mg ( -1) and up to 250 mg could be 
explored according to the dose escalation process of the BLRM. F or more details, please refer 
to Table (4.1.3.3) 1.  
A minimum of 5  days between two infusions of S64315 is required. 
An infusion could be postponed in case of 1- day delay and should be discussed with the Sponsor 
in case of 2 -day delay, for any reason other than medical / toxicity. 
Azacitidine  will be administered during the combination treatment period at 75  mg/m² via 
subcutaneous (SC) injection, daily for 7 days, i.e. from CxD1 to CxD7, followed by a rest 
period of 21 days (28- day cycle).  
On days of concomitant administration of S64315 and azacitidine (CxD2), azacitidine should be administered  2h (±10 min) prior to S64315.

 4.1.3.3. Dose escalation scheme  
An adaptive Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose control (EWOC) will 
be used to guide the dose escalation of S64315 in combination with azacitidine.  The dose 
escalation will only concern S64315. 
All available data on DLTs (assessed from the LID period and up to the end of cycle 1) will be 
used for updating the model. Before making a decision regarding dose escalation, the minimum 
number of patients required from a cohort must have been treated with one cycle of the combination and be  fully evaluable for treatment -related toxicities according to the minimum 
requirements for inclusion in the Dose -Limiting Toxicity Evaluable Set (DLTES) (see 
section  4.1.3.5). If a patient is not eligible for inclusion in the DLTES, this patient must be 
replaced.  
The dose allocation methodology is detailed in section 10. 
A maximum of 6 DLT -evaluable patients may be initially enrolled at a new dose level, and a 
minimum of 3 DLT -evaluable patients must be treated at a given dose level in order to begin 
treatmen t of patients at a new, higher dose level. To better characterize the safety, tolerability, 
PK, PD, or preliminary clinical activity of S64315 in combination with azacitidine, more than 
6 DLT -evaluable patients may be treated in a cohort. If the starting d ose of the combination is 
not well tolerated, a dose level -1 will be considered. Intermediate doses may be tested , if 
needed. For more details, please refer to  Table (4.1.3.3) 1. A minimum of 6 DLT evaluable 
patients  must have been evaluated at the dose considered to be the MTD, and before treating 
patients with this dose in the Phase II part of the study. 
Table  (4.1.3.3 ) 1 - Provisional dose levels of S64315  
Dose level  Proposed dose*  Increment from previous dose  
-1** 25 mg -50% 
1 50 mg Starting dose  
2 100 mg 100%  
3 200 mg 100%  
4 250 mg 25% 
*It is possible for additional and/or intermediate dose levels to be added during the course of the study. Cohorts can be add ed 
at any dose level below or at the MTD in order to better understand safety, PK or PD  
**No dose reduction below dose level -1 is permitted for this study  
4.1.3.4. Intra -patient dose escalation  
Intra -patient dose escalation of S64315 is not permitted at any time within the first 4 cycles of 
treatment. After Cycle 4 is completed, individual patients may be considered for treatment at a dose of S64315 higher than the dose initially assigned. For a patient to be treated at a higher dose of S64315, he/she must have tolerated its originally assigned dose for at least the last 4 cycles of therapy prior to the intra -patient dose escalation (i. e. he/she must not have 
experienced any S64315- related or S64315/ azacitidine -related toxicity CTCAE Grade ≥  2 at 
the originally assigned dose). Moreover, the newly assigned higher dose with which the patient 
is to be treated must have been validated, i.e. it should be a dose lower than the dose of the combination currently tested and considered safe according to the EWOC criterion at the time of the decision to escalate the dose of the patient. S64315 dose increase can occur as often as deemed necessary. For any further increase after the initial intra- patient dose escalation, the 
same rules should be applied.

 Consultation and agreement with the Sponsor must occur prior to any intra -patient dose  
escalation. Data from the first cycle of treatment at the new dose levels will not be formally 
included into the statistical model describing the relationship between doses combined and occurrence of DLT. However, this data will be incorporated into the clinical assessment of safety within a dose escalation EoC meeting.  
4.1.3.5. DLT definition  
A dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a clinically significant adverse event graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI CTCAE) v5.0, observed following the administration of the test drug, assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications, considered at least possibly related to the test drug by the investigator and that meets any of the criteria included in Table (4.1.3.5) 1. 
For each patient, an  assessment  of DLT  will be performed at the end of the first cycle  of 
treatment , through C1D28. This assessment will  include all toxicities observed starting from 
the LID period through C1D28. Only DLTs occurring during the LID period + C ycle 1 will be 
included in the Bayesian logistic regression model  (BLRM)  that estimates the relationship 
between dose and DLTs. However, monitoring for  DLTs that occur after C ycle 1 will continue , 
in case there is evidence for delayed or cumulative toxicity.  
Table  (4.1.3.5 ) 1 - Toxicity criteria according to NCI CTCAE grading

4.1.3.6. DLT management  
Study treatments must be delayed for any patient who experienced a DLT. Conditions to resume 
treatment are described in section 8.12. 
All DLT will be reported to I.R .I.S. within 24h via the DLT form in the electronic Case Report 
Form  (eCRF). The eCRF ‘Adverse Event’ page should then be filled in, without waiting for the 
results of the clinical outcome or of additional investigations. When data of the DLT form are 
submitted, an e- mail will be immediately and automatically sent to the sponsor.  
If the eCRF is unavailable when the investigator is informed of the DLT, he/she should: 
­ report the DLT on a paper ‘DLT form’  
­ send the form by fax immediately to I.R.I.S. at the fol lowing number: +33.1.55.72.50.04 
As soon as the eCRF becomes available again, the investigator must enter the data in the eCRF . 
4.1.3.7. Decision process and decision rules  
Before testing a new dose level during the dose escalation phase, an EoC meeting between the  
Sponsor (Therapeutic Area Oncology and Immuno Oncology, Medical Safety Leader, 
Methodology Department and Clinical Pharmacokinetics department), the coordinator and the investigators will take place to discuss the toxicities in terms of DLTs, safety data,  the PK and 
available PD and the preliminary efficacy data observed in all patients. This meeting will support the decision to escalate to the next dose level of the treatment, to decide jointly of the next dose level to be tested, the go/no go for the expansion phase II part. 
If a dose/treatment schedule has not yet been tested, a one -week period should be respected 
between the C1D2 of the first patient and the C1D2 of subsequent patients of the cohort  
(between the first and the second infusion in patient of S64315 at the full tested dose). If no 
medically important or life -threatening toxicity occurs during the one -week observation period, 
the subsequent patients will be allowed to  start treatment without further delays between 
subsequent patients . 
A template of ‘Dose allocation meeting minutes’  is available in Appendix 6 . 
A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up and will review the safety data before each EoC meeting and provide recommendations to the Spons or. 
4.1.4. Expansion phase II part for sub- arms A1  and A2  
The RP2D of S64315 in combination with azacitidine  and its administration schedule will be 
defined according to results observed in the dose escalation phase I part in terms of safety, activity  and, if ap propriate, PK data.  
 
The expansion phase II part will be divided in two distinct parts according to a Bayesian two -
stage design: stage 1 and s tage 2 . 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     62/173 
 A futility analysis will be performed at the end of s tage 1 for sub- arms A1  and A2 based on the 
rate of CR observed after 4 cycles of combination treatment. This analysis will support the 
decision to stop the evaluation of the combination or to continue the evaluation during the s tage 
2. The rationale for the expansion phase II part design is described in section 2.3.7. 
Up to 50 patients will be treated  in each sub -arm (A1 and A2) at the RP2D as follows (more 
detail on this topic is provided in section 10.5.2 and Appendix 8): 
­ Twenty -three patients will be treated in the first stage of analysis; if there is evidence that 
the CR rate is < 20% (if there are fewer than 5/23 patients who achieve a CR), treatment will 
be stopped in the relevant arm  
­ If there is evidence that the CR rate >= 20%, 27 additional patients will be treated to better estimate the rate of CR.  
After at least 4 patients have been treated during dose expansion at the RP2D, if the obs erved 
rate of DLT through the end of Cycle 1 exceeds 33% (including the patients treated at this dose 
during dose escalation), the BLRM will be updated to determine whether the RP2D still satisfies the EWOC principle. If the RP2D is estimated to have a ≥25% posterior probability of generating excessive toxicity (DLT rate between 33% and 100%) during the first cyc le of 
treatment, then enrollment to the study will be paused. A risk assessment will be conducted by the DSMB, the investigators and sponsor, and consideration will be given to reducing the RP2D.  
In addition, monitoring will continue for DLTs that may occur after the first cycle of treatment. 
After at least 4 patients have had the opportunity to receive a second cycle of treatment, if the posterior probability is greater than 25% that the true rate of DLT occurring after Cycle 1 
is >33%, enrollment to the study will be paused. Patients should have received at least three 
doses of S64315 from Cycle 2 to be evaluable, unless dosing was limited by the occurrence of a DLT. Evaluable patients treated at this dose during escalation will also be included in this assessment. The study will also be paused if the cumulative rate of Grade ≥3 treatment -related 
cardiac adverse events at the RP2D exceeds 20%. In either case, the safety of the RP2D will be re-evaluated by the DSMB, the investigators and sponsor, and consideration will be given to 
reducing the RP2D.   
More detail on this topic is provided in section  10.3.2. 
4.2. Measures to minimise bias  
During the study: 
­ International multicentre study  
­ Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded on site and analysed by a central reading CRO for 
ECGs tracings  
­ PK sample analyses will be performed in a specific central laboratory, which will minimise 
the variability of measurements  
­ PD sample analyses (protein and gene expression, gene alteration and determination of complex dissociation analysis) will be centrally stored and sent to a spec ific analytical centre 
for analyses, to minimise the variability of measurements  
­ Genes implicated in ADME analyses (optional) will be performed in a specific central laboratory

 4.4. Discontinuation of the study  
4.4.1. Premature discontinuation of the study or temporary halt 
This study may be temporarily halted or prematurely discontinued at any time for any sufficient 
reasonable cause. Stopping rules during the study are described in section  8.12 for any patient 
throughout the study, in section 10.2.7 for the dose escalation phase I part , in section  10.3 for 
the expansion phase II part  and in section 4.4.2. Moreover, the DSMB could also give 
recommendations, based on the review of the safety data, to suspend or to prematurely terminate the study/treatment arms in case of serious concerns about patient safety.  
After having informed the coordinator, the sponsor or the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or the Competent Authorities may terminate the study before its scheduled term. Two copies of the written confirmation will be dated and signed by the coordinator . The IRB/IECs and Competent Authorities will be informed according to 
local regulations. 
If the study is prematurely discontinued, the ongoing patients should be seen as soon as 
possible, and the same assessments as described in section 5.8 should be performed. 
Under some circumstances, the investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be 
followed, in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests.  
In case of study suspension (temporary halt), the study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance and data quality are addressed and satisfy the Sponsor, the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and Competent Authorities. 
4.4.2. Criteria for stopping or pausing the study  
The study will be paused and the health authorities will be notified  if:
 
­ Any death suspected to be related to S64315 occurs within 30 days of study treatment 
administration  
­ The observed cumulative rate of Grade ≥3 treatment -related cardiac adverse events at the 
RP2D (including patients treated in both dose escalation and dose expansion) exc eeds 20%, 
after at least 4 patients have been treated with S64315 in dose expansion  
4.4.3. Discontinuation of the study in the event of objective reached  
Not applicable 
4.5. Source data  
Patient’s medical file (e.g. ECG reports, clinical laboratory examination reports and all other 
patients’ examination results, copies of karyotype reports, requisition forms, registration forms, exam recording (and the result report when applicable) provided by the CRO to the centre, and the result report when applicable, will be considered as source documents. 
Source data and source documents of the centre should be clearly identified in a specific, 
detailed and signed document before the beginning of the study.

 5.5. Definition of women of childbearing potential and contraception methods  
Women of childbearing potential 
A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche 
and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization 
methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  
 
Contraception meth ods 
­ Definition of highly effective contraception methods for the study:  
Highly effective methods of birth control refer to those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. 
less than 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly, such as combined hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen- only hormonal contraception when associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, 
injectable, implantable), some intra uterine devices (IUD s), intrauterine hormone -releasing 
system (IUS), true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient), bilateral tubal occlusion, male sterilization (vasectomy).  
­ Definition of acceptable contraception methods for the study: 
Acceptable contraception methods for the study are those considered as highly effective methods, male or female condom with or without spermicide, cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide.  
5.6. Retest management during screening period  
A patient who has a laboratory result that does not satisfy the entrance criteria may have the 
test repeated providing that the investigator judges it relevant according to the patient previous result or medical history and if s/he considers laboratory abnormalities  are likely to be transient. 
Results of the test(s) repeated should be obtained within the allowed screening period. In this case the patient will not be required to sign another informed consent and the original patient identification number assigned by the investigator will be used. 
In any case, the last result available for each parameter must be considered for the patient 
inclusion. 
5.7. Additional information recorded at the inclusion visit  
Not applicable 5.8. Patient withdrawal  
5.8.1. Withdrawal criteria  
Information to be collected during the last visit of these patients is given in section  5.8.2. These 
follow- up modalities are used to ensure the efficacy and safety evaluation of all patients who 
received the IMPs.

 The reasons for premature discontinuation of IMPs are: 
­ Adverse events i ncompatible with continuation of one of the IMPs according to the 
judgment of the investigator, including no recovery in safety parameters. Criteri a for 
treatment discontinuation are implemented during the LID period in order to avoid treating 
a patient in  medical condition that could jeopardize his/her safety or interfere with the 
conduct of the study. If the patient cannot receive the LID2 or the first S64315 C1D2 dose due to an AE, the S64315 infusion (either LID2 or C1D2) may be postponed by 1 to 5 days . 
If the LID2 is postponed for more than 2 days (5 days maximum), the C1D2 dose may not be postponed for more than 2 days. If S64315 C1D2 is postponed, azacitidine C1D1 dose should be postponed as well, whenever possible . If the AE has not recovered within this time 
period, the patient must be withdrawn from the study. 
­ Pregnancy (for reporting, see section  8.9.2.3) 
­ Protocol deviation if it interferes with the study evaluations and/or if it jeopardises patient’s safety, e.g. any medical event requiring administration of an unauthorised concomitant treatment (see section 6.3 ) 
­ Disease  progression at the discretion of the investigator
 
­ Treatment failure, defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, MLFS  or PR  after at least 6 cycles 
of study treatment  
­ Non-medical reason  (to be thoroughly described) e.g. consent withdrawal, patient’s 
removal  
­ Other, physician decision (for reasons that cannot be included in any of the criteria listed above, for example: availability of a better therapeutic alternative for the patient)  
If the patient becomes eligible for transplant , patient treatment discontinuation should be left to 
the investigator’s decision . 
If the patient is  benefiting from the study treatment according to the investigator’s judgement 
and if it is in the patient’s best interest to continue the combination of S64315 with azacitidine, 
the patient may remain on study treatment.  A patient must discontinue the combination if the 
toxicity recurs with the same or worse severity after resumption of dosing, unless the investigat or decides it is in the patient’s best interest to continue the combination of IMPs and 
upon documented agreement with the Sponsor. 
If one IMP is permanently discontinued, both drugs should be permanently discontinued. A 
patient must be withdrawn from the study if one the IMPs is interrupted for more than 28 consecutive days from C1D2, for any reason. However, for patients with LVEF decline, IMP interruptions of up to 35 consecutive days are permitted. 
5.8.2. Procedure  
Upon discontinuation of the IMPs, the investi gator must: 
­ notify the Sponsor immediately by recording this information in the eCRF 
­ indicate the main reason, if there are several reasons  
Patients should return for the Withdrawal visit (WV) as soon as possible and up to 28 days of 
the last dose of IMP. If the decision to discontinue occurs at a regular scheduled visit, that visit may become the WV rather than having the patient returns for an additional visit. 
After the withdrawal visit, patients will continue in the follow -up period; the date of death and 
the progression date will be recorded in the eCRF, if applicable. Study discontinuation for 
another reason than disease progression will be recorded in the eCRF.

 In the case of premature withdrawal from the study due to an AE (event requiring imm ediate 
notification or not), the investigator must make every effort to collect the information relating 
to the outcome of the AE. If necessary, the information will be collected afterwards (see  
section  8.9). This information is recorded in the ‘AEs’ eCRF form. If the investigator cannot 
collect the information during a patient visit, he must collect it from the patient’s doctor in charge of his/her follow-up. 
If the study is stopped/one of the IMPs is discontinued as a result of an event requiring 
immediate notification, the procedure described in section 8.9.2.5 is to be implemented.  
The dispositions to be taken after the IMPs discontinuation are described in section 6.5. 
5.8.3. Lost to follow- up 
When the investigator has no news of the patient, he/she must make every effort to contact 
him/her or a person around him/her (phone calls, letters including registered ones, etc.), to establish the reason of the IMPs discontinuation and suggest to the patient to come to a withdrawal visit.  If all these attempts to contact the patient fail, the investigator can then declare 
the patient ‘lost to follow -up’. The investigator should document all these attempts in the 
corresponding medical file. 
6. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
The following sections are applicable for dose escalation phase I part of  Arm A  and. They 
could be refined for expansion phase II part ( sub-arms A1  and A2) according to results 
observed in the dose escalation phase I part, as well as for Arm B  according to the results of 
Arm A. They will be described in an amendment to the protocol. 
6.1. IMPs administered  
6.1.1. IMP administration schedule  
S64315 and azacitidine will be administered in combination in patients with AML. The 
administration schedule of the combination is detailed in section 4.1.3.2. 
Azacitidine  will be administered via SC injection, once a day over 7 days i.e. from CxD1 to 
CxD7, followed by a rest period of 21 days, over 28- day cycle during the combination treatment 
period, according to E.U. SmPC recommendations. S64315 will be administered via IV infusion over at least 2h, once a week, i.e. during the 2-
week lead -in dose period (on the days of LID1 and LID2) and then during the combination 
treatment period on CxD2, CxD9, CxD16, and CxD23 over 28- day cycle.  
As data will emerge during the study regarding clinical safety and PK data, the administration 
schedule and the infusion duration may be changed. Any change will be implemented through an amendment to the protocol. 
The assignment  of a patient to a particular cohort will be coordinated by the Sponsor. No 
randomisation will be performed in this study. Information about infusion duration as well as 
treatment schedule will be reported in the Patient Registration Form ( Appendix 2) . 
For IMP dose adaptations due to toxicities, please refer to section  8.12.

 6.1.2. Administration/re -administration criteria  
­ Criteria to fulfil before each S64315 infusion 
 Before each S64315 infusion, biological parameters should be checked in order to detect 
any toxicity (see Table (8.12) 1) 
 Patients with Grade ≥ 2 hypo/hypercalcemia and/or hypo/hypermagnesia and/or 
hypo/hyperkalaemia despite attempts at medical correction should not be treated with S64315 
 Patients with WBC ≥ 10 G/L despite attempts at medical correction should not be treated with S64315. Hydroxycarbamide can be used to reduce the circulating blast count before and throughout the treatment period 
 AST and ALT ≤  3 x ULN (except for LID1: AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN)  
 Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x ULN, except for patients with known Gi lbert’s syndrome, 
who are excluded if total bilirubin > 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN 
 In the case of an S64315 interruption ≥ 28 days, its readministration must be preceded by 
a lead -in dose period (except for patients in CR/CRi)  which is called additional Lead- In 
dose period. See Table (4.1.2) 1 for more details on safety assessments required.  
­ Criteria to fulfil before each first azacitidine administration (i.e. CxD1)  
Patients should be monitored for haematological toxicity and renal toxicities. A delay in starting the next cycle or a dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity and/or renal toxicity may be necessary according to E.U. SmPC (see Table (8.12) 2). WBC, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelets, serum creatinine, BUN and serum bicarbonate will be assessed before starting the next treatment cycle.  
6.2. IMP dispensing  
S64315 and azacitidine will be dispensed by the pharmacist/responsible of the healthcare establishment upon prescription of the investigator only. 
The investigator may only use the IMPs provided for the patients involved in the study and 
treated under his/her responsibility or that of a designated co-investigator. 
For each patient, the IMPs will only be dispensed during the study. Further instructions for the preparation and dispensation of S64315, as well as the description 
of the tubing and infusion sets compatible with S64315, are described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
All dosages of S64315 and azacitidine prescribed to the patient and all dose changes during the study must be recorded in the eCRF.  
The detachable portion of the label on the IMPs box must be stuck by the investigator/responsible person on an IMP label collection form or on the prescription form where the IMPs are dispensed by a pharmacist.  
6.3. Previous and concomitant treatments  
In general, the use of any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the care of the patient is permitted in this study, except as specifically prohibited. Concomitant medication administration could result in DDI that could potentially lead to reduced activity or enhanced toxicity of the concomitant medication, as of S64315 and/or azacitidine. 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version

includes the ‘guidance on use of co- medicatio ns for clinical study CL1-64315-004’ to be used 
as reference before prescribing any concomitant treatment to a patient.  Patients  must not have 
taken  calcineurin inhibitors for at least 4 weeks  before the first dos e of S64315 in order  to be 
eligible . 
Before  any new concomitant medication administration, the investigator should assess any 
potential DDI with S64315 and azacitidine (if applicable) using this concerned medication SmPC, from 7 days before the first IMP intake to 7 days following last IMP intake . For CYP3A4 
inducers comedications, t he wash out period is defined as at least 2 weeks.  For concomitant 
CYP3A4 inducer drugs with a long elimination half -life (> 40 h), a wash out period of 1 week 
and additional 5 half -lives must be applied before initiation of S64315 therapy.  Contraindicated 
comedication drugs with a long elimination half -life are flagged in the “Guidance on use of 
comedication for clinical study CL1-64315-004” that can be consulted in the eCRF. 
Regularly updated lists of the co- administered medications that should be contraindicated or 
used with caution will  be shared through the eCRF  during the clinical study. These lists are not 
exhaustive and only meant to be used as a guide  (for example, pro -drugs of the listed drugs 
should be considered as their active substance). The Sponsor should be contacted in case of any doubt. If  a medication appears on both ‘prohibited’ and ‘to be used with caution’ lists, the 
medication is prohibited.

After the withdrawal visit, a contact or telephone call will be done with the patients: 
­ every 3 months (±15 days) from the WV, up to 6 months, except in case of consent 
withdrawal for the dose escalation phase I part  
­ every 3 months (±15 days) from the WV, up to 12 months, except in case of consent withdrawal for the expansion phase II part

­ the patient’s survival 
­ the date of first disease progression 
­ the first line of therapy administered after withdrawal and its starting date  
8.2.5. Cardiac safety  
8.2.5.1. Central ECG recording  
In order to monitor the potential of S64315 infusion in combination with azacitidine to delay 
cardiac repolarisation, serial triplicate 12 -lead ECGs ( i.e. 3 ECGs within 10 min) will be 
performed for the measurement of the QT and QTc interval (correction according to F ridericia’s 
formula). 12 -lead ECG parameters with at least 3 to 5 QRS complexes for each lead will be 
evaluated by Core Reading Centre: HR, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, RR interval, corrected QT, using Fridericia’s formula. 
Three print -out ECGs will be produced with at least 6 complexes recorded for each. The ECG 
recordings will be centrally read by a CRO, specialised in cardiac monitoring. The CRO will 
provide a 12- lead digital recorder, will train and certify the centres in terms of equipment a nd 
will employ a trained independent cardiologist to read the ECGs. 
At each time point described in Table (8.2) 2, the triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after 
resting for 10 min prior to the recordings and in supine position. Predose ECG should be 
collected:  
­ within 7 days prior to inclusion and results available for inclusion 
­ after azacitidine injection and before S64315 infusion on CxD2 (day of coa dministration)  
­ with 24h prior to any other S64315 infusion

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     84/173 
 Detailed instructions on ECG recordings are provided in the ECG manual. 
In the event that an ECG abnormality is observed, additional examinations could be performed 
at the discretion of the investigator (e.g. a blood sample for ionogram (Na, K, Cl) in case of QTc prolongation). 
The management of the patient/the study treatment will be based on the local reading of the 
ECGs; all the ECGs will be sent by the site on a regular basis to the central read ing CRO. The 
final analysis of the QTc values throughout the study will be based on the central reading analysis.  
At inclusion visit  
The mean QTc will be calculated for each triplicate ECG according to Fridericia’s formula . If 
the mean QTc is > 450  ms in men or > 470 ms in women, then 3 other ECGs (in 10 min) should 
be repeated 3  h later. The mean QTc will be recalculated. If the abnormality is confirmed, the 
patient will not be included. 
During the study  
Triplicate ECGs will be carried -out at the time  points defined in Table (8.2) 2. The mean QTc 
will be calculated to detect a possible QTc prolongation. Toxicity grading of QTc interval 
prolongation is defined by the CTCAE v 5.0 as follows:  
Table  (8.2.5.1 ) 1 - Toxicity grading of QTc interval prolongation is defined by the CTCAE (v 5.0)  
Grade  Definition  
1 QTc 450 - 480 ms 
2 QTc 481 - 500 ms 
3 QTc ≥ 501 ms on at least two separate ECGs  
4 Torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia  
In the event of prolongation of the QTc interval according to Fridericia’s formula, management of treatments will be performed as explained in the  Table (8.12) 1. 
The recommendations described in the Table (8.12) 1 are not intended to supersede the clinical 
judgment of the investigator and the treating physician, who will determine the appropriate management for the patient. ECG abnormalities considered clinically significant by the investigator will be reported in the eCRF as adverse events.  
8.2.5.2. Echocardiography/ MUGA scan 
An echocardiography or a MUGA sc an will be performed during the study to assess cardiac 
function. The same technique (either echocardiography or MUGA) should be used throughout 
the study for a given patient. 
At inclusion visit, if LVEF is < 50%, the patient is ineligible.  
During the study, the management of decrease in LVEF is based on the measured LVEF and 
LVEF change from baseline described in  section 8.12. 
GLS assessment will be assessed during echocardiography, whenever possible (not mandatory), 
to follow left ventricular systolic dysfunction, at the time points already defined for 
echocardiography.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     85/173 
 8.2.5.3. Cardiac marker follow -up 
In order to monitor a potential cardiac toxicity, a cardiac marker assessment, including troponin, 
CPK -MB and BNP, will be performed at predose, 6h, 24h, 48 and 72h after S64315 EoI on the 
days of LID1 (D -13) and LID2 (D -6), C1D2 and C1D9 and at each pre -dose assessments fo r 
the following visits .  
Either troponin I or T assessment can be used, but it should be ultra -sensitive, whenever 
possible. The same subtype (either I or T) should be used throughout the study. If, for a given centre, both troponin I and T can be assessed, priority should be given to troponin I.  
In case of troponin increase observed after any of the first two S64315 infusions during cycle 1 (C1D2 or C1D9), it will be recommended to assess these cardiac markers at 48h and 72h S64315 EoI and after each subsequent S64315 infusions (before discharge and beyond, if needed) on a regular basis according to the investigator’s judgment. 
In case of troponin increase > 10xUNL  or a troponin increase consistent with the diagnosis of 
a myocardial infarction (Grade 3), the patient should discontinue study tre atment (see 
section  8.12).  
8.2.5.4. MRI assessment  
A cardiac MRI should be performed at the time of the event (as far as possible within 48 to 72h) 
in case of troponin increase > 10xULN or in case of troponin increase > ULN as sociated with 
clinical signs or LVEF decrease or ECG abnormality, to detect a potential acute structural effect related to S64315. Another cardiac MRI should be performed 5 or 6 weeks later, to detect any long-term damage related to S64315. 
In case of MRI abnormality in this context of troponin increase, the patient should discontinue 
study treatment (see section  8.12).  
8.2.5.5. 24-hour Holter assessment  
A 24 -hour Holter should be set -up in case of troponin increase >  10xULN (immediately once 
detected) or troponin > ULN associated with clinical signs or LVEF decrease or ECG 
abnormality to detect arrhythmia. Abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
investigato r and/or local cardiologist will be reported in the eCRF as adverse events. 
8.2.6. Hepatic safety  
Considering the results of the GLP toxicity studies showing some hepatotoxic effect of the drug, the hepatic safety will be closely monitored. An increase in serum liver enzymes should be followed by repeated testing including all the usual serum measures (at least ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing as follows: 
­ For isolated Grade 3 total bilirubin increase (> 3xULN) or isolated Grade 3 AST or ALT 
increase (> 5xULN), the patient should be weekly monitored, including LFT: albumin, ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin, fractionated if total bilirubin  > 2.0xULN, ALP, fractionated if 
ALP >  2.0xULN, and GGT, or more frequently if clinically indicated, until values have 
resolved to baseline or stabilised over 4 weeks  
­ For AST or ALT  > 3.0xULN combined with total bilirubin > 2.0xULN, repeat LFT as soon 
as possible, preferably within 48h from awareness of  the abnormal results, then with weekly 
monitoring of LFT, or more frequently if clinically indicated, until AST, ALT, or bilirubin values have resolved to baseline or stabilised over 4 weeks  
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     86/173 
 Clinically significant abnormalities should be carefully documen ted in the patient’s medical 
file. 
Additional tests to evaluate liver function such as INR (or biopsy if appropriate) may be 
performed as appropriate. Close observation and documentation also include: 
­ obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases, obtaining a 
history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription and herbal and dietary 
supplement preparations), alcohol use 
­ performing liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance or computerized tomography) to evaluate b iliary tract or liver disease  
­ ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; NASH; and biliary tract disease 
­ considering gastroenterology or hepatologist consultations 
The recommen dations towards the study according to the level and evolution of hepatic 
abnormalities are detailed in  section 8.12. 
8.2.7. Monitoring of infections that m ay occur with neutropenia  
A possible co- toxicity on bone marrow and lymphoid organs, identified as primary target organs 
for both compounds in the toxicology studies, should be considered. Therefore, WBC count should be closely monitored, and caution should be exercised in assessing the possibility of infections in the patients receiving S64315 in combination with azacitidine. 
Early initiation of empirical broad -spectrum antibacterial antibiotics is recommended in the 
event of fever. If fever persists for 4 to 7 days, an antifungal treatment should also be 
considered. Investigators should employ these agents in compliance with best medical practices 
and institutional guidelines and standards. Before initiating these treatments, the list of non -
authorized treatments must be consulted. For quinolone agents, besides the possible DDI, the possible risk of prolongation of the QTc interval must be assessed (refer to section  6.3 and 
‘Guidance on use of co-medication for CL1-64315-004 clinical study’). 
The use of recombinant hemopoietic growth factors, specifically prohibited in Cycle 1, may be 
used beyond Cycle 1 at the discretion of the Investigator. 
8.2.8. Gastrointestinal disorders  
8.2.8.1. Nausea and vomiting management  
Considering the GLP toxicity studies and the preliminary clinical data with S64315 (as of 
September 5, 2019, 23 (60.5%) and 19 (50%) out of 38 patients treated in the S64315 single agent AML and MDS study experienced nausea and vomiting respectively), nausea/vomiting prophylaxis is strongly recommended before each S64315 infusion. 
Dexamethasone administration is mandatory at least 1h before S64315 infusion on the days of 
LID1 and LID2, and on C1D2. 
Based on international guideline ( ASCO, 2011 ), this prophylaxis consists in a two-drug 
combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone, before each S64315 infusion, followed by 
dexamethasone maintenance for two days after each S64315 infusion. 
According to azacitidine E.U. SmPC, patients should be premedicated with anti -emetics for 
nausea and vomiting.  
The recommended prophylaxis is displayed in the Table (8.2.8.1) 1. 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version

 Table  (8.2.8.1 ) 1 - Treatments schedule for nausea/vomiting prophylaxis  
LID1 and LID2  Palonosetron 0.25  mg IV or 0.5  mg p.o.+ Dexamethasone 8  mg p.o. / IV 1h before each 
S64315 infusion, followed by dexamethasone 8 mg p.o. / IV during two day s after each 
S64315 infusion, as required  
CxD 1 Metoclopramide IV before azacitidine administration  
CxD 2 Palonosetron 0.25  mg IV or 0.5  mg per os (p.o.) before azacitidine  administration + 
Dexamethasone 8  mg p.o. / IV. 1h before S64315 infusion  
CxD 3 Dexamethasone 8  mg p.o. / IV. as required  
CxD 4 Dexamethasone 8  mg p.o. / IV. as required  
CxD 9 
CxD 16 
CxD 23 Palonosetron 0.25  mg IV or 0.5  mg p.o.+ Dexamethasone 8  mg p.o. / IV before each 
S64315 infusion, followed by dexamethasone 8 mg p.o. / IV during two days after each 
S64315 infusion, as required  
If palonosetron is not available, clinicians may substitute with a first- generation 5- HT3 
serotonin receptor antagonist (i.e. granisetron/ dolasetron/ tropisetron, to be used with caution 
according to ‘Guidance on use of co- medication for CL1 -64315-004 clinical study’). 
Limited evidence also supports adding aprepitant to the combination, if the above combination does not provide sufficient nausea/vomiting control. 
As a reminder, ondansetron is prohibited along the study due to the risk of QTcF prolongation 
(see ‘Guidance on use of co -medication for CL1 -64315-004 clinical study’). 
For patients who experience nausea and/or vomiting despite optimal prophylaxis, clinicians should re -evaluate emetic risk, disease status, concurrent illnesses, and medications and 
consider adding lorazepam or alprazolam or adding a dopamine antagonist to the regimen.  
Please refer to sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 for more information about the prohibited medications 
and the medications to be used with caution during IMP treatment. 
8.2.8.2. Diarrhoea management  
Considering the GLP toxicity studies and the preliminary clinical data with S64315 (17/38, 
44.7%) patients treated in the S64315 monotherapy AML and MDS study experienced 
diarrhoea), diarrhoea should be closely monitored. 
The patient should be instructed to contact the physician/other  study personnel in case of severe 
diarrhoea. In case of diarrhoea, management and treatment approaches should be implemented according 
to routine practice and applicable guidelines. In case no guideline is available, investigators should refer to ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diarrhoea in adult cancer patients .  
Guidance for diarrhoea management (ESMO, 2018) is summarised in Appendix 7. 
8.2.9. Tumour Lysis Syndrome management 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis is required during the administration of S64315 in 
combination with azacitidine for patients with active disease, in case of intra -patien t dose 
escalation to a new assigned dose(s) and in case of readministration after one or both IMPs interruption ≥  28 days. 
Even if only patients with low/intermediate risk of TLS are included, TLS prophylaxis for intermediary risk should be implemented for any patient considering the expected overlapping toxicity of the combination. TLS management will be based on institutional guidelines and published criteria (Cairo, 2010)  and on the recommendations described below . 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     88/173 
 Hydration 
Adequate hydration should be ensured for all patients according to routine clinical practice and 
international guidel ines ( Cairo, 2010) . 
In order to prevent the risk of TLS, hydration will be made mandatory during the LID period and during the two first infusions of S64315 at the full tested dose (LID1, LID2, C1D2 and C1D9). Patients should be encouraged to drink up to 1.5 to 2.0 L of water daily starting the day before the S64315 infusion, and 24 hours after. Intravenous fluids at 50cc/hour or higher are recommended to be administered for at least 12 hours prior to the S64315 infusion, then I V 
fluid should be continued according to the investigator’s judgement. The rate of IV fluids should be adjusted per clinical judgment. 
Anti- hyperuricaemic agents  
Allopurinol is recommended for patients with active disease throughout the study. Patients who  
develop laboratory TLS should receive rasburicase unless clinically contraindicated (Cairo, 
2010) . 
Laboratory assessments (see section 8.2.2).  
Before and following S64315 infusions during the LID period (LID1 on D -13 and LID2 on 
D-6): 
WBC, serum uric acid, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, serum potassium, serum creatinine 
and LDH must be monitored at the following time points: 
­ Prior to S64315 administration (LID1 and LID2 predose) 
­ 2h, 4h and 8h after S64315 EoI (LID1 and LID2) 
­ 24h (± 2h) after S64315 EoI (LID1 and LID2) 
Before and following the first azacitidine administration (C1D1) and first S64315 infusion 
(C1D2) of c ycle 1 : 
WBC, serum uric acid, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, serum potassium, serum creatinine 
and LDH must be monitored at the following time points: 
­ Prior to azacitidine first injection (C1D1 predose) 
­ 1h30 and 6h after azacitidine first injection (C1D1) 
­ After azacitidine second injection and prior to first S64315 infusion (C1D2) 
­ 2h, 4h and 8h after S64315 EoI (i.e. C1D2) 
­ 24h (± 2h) after S64315 EoI (i.e. C1D3) 
Beyond the first infusion of S64315 (applicable for all patients with a risk of developing TLS 
according to the investigator’s judgment): 
WBC, serum uric acid, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, serum potassium, serum creatinine 
and LDH must be monitored at the following time points: 
­ Prior to  each S64315 infusion (i.e. CxD9, CxD16, CxD23 predose) 
­ 2h, 4h and 8h after each S64315 EoI (i.e. CxD9, CxD16, CxD23) 
­ 24h (± 2h) after each S64315 EoI (i.e. CxD10, CxD17, CxD24) 
Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected promptly. 
Hospitalization  
To ena ble close in -patient TLS monitoring and management, patients must be hospitalized: 
­ at least 12h before the day of LID1 and for at least 24h after LID1 
­ at least 12h before the day of LID2 and for at least 24h after LID2 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     89/173 
 ­ at least 12h before C1D1 and for at least 24h after C1D2 S64315 infusion (including C1D1, 
C1D2 and C1D3) 
If a biological or clinical TLS develops, additional measures should be implemented according to guidelines (Howard, 2011) , including dialysis if clinica lly indicated.  
In case of intra- patient dose escalation, the patient will be hospitalized for at least 3  days. 
8.2.10. Infusion Related Reaction management 
As the risk of Infusion Related Reaction (IRR) is not yet well characterized, it is  challenging at 
this stage to propose a standardized prophylactic treatment before the first S64315 infusions. However, before S64315 infusion during LID period, cycle 1, and during following cycles at the investigator’s discretion according to conventiona l practices, patients should receive the 
following: 
­ Hydration: already planned in the frame of TLS prophylaxis (see section 8.2.9) 
­ Corticoids (dexamethasone): already  planned in the frame of nausea/vomiting prevention 
(see section 8.2.8.1) 
­ Additionally, according to investigator’s opinion, anti H1 and/or anti H2 could be 
administered before S64315 infusion 
­ Patient’s risk factors to develop IRR such as age -related factors, concomitant diseases (e.g. 
chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, severe atopic disease) and concomitant medications (e.g. β -adrenergic blockers and angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors), 
should be assessed before treating the patient 
In addition, patient vital signs (BP, HR, temperature) should be monitored as follows: 
­ during the LID period for each S64315 infusion: EoI, at least 2h and 24h after EoI (LID1 
and LID2) 
­ during Cycle 1 for each S64315 infusion: EoI and at least 2h after EoI (C1D2, C1D9, C1D16, C1D23) 
In case of occurrence, IRR management will be performed according to ESMO guidelines (ESMO, 2017) as presented in  Figure (8.2.10) 1 or according to local practice guideli nes. If the 
patient experiences an IRR of grade 1 or 2, the infusion rate should be immediately decreased by 50% of the initial rate without exceeding 3 hours of total infusion time or infusion immediately stopped according to the investigator judgment and based on the severity of 
symptoms. The patient’s vital signs (eg: blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, temperature) 
should be monitored every 15 minutes until the event has resolved. 
To allow better characterization of IRR, it is recommended to perform blood samplings for the 
measurement of tryptase levels optimally 15  min to 3h after the onset of the IRR. A new sample 
should be obtained from 48h to 72h after the onset of the event (ba seline value).   
With regards to rechallenge, the following guidelines should be considered: 
­ Grade 1 IRR: adequate prophylaxis should be implemented before each subsequent S64315 
infusion 
­ Grade 2 IRR: adequate prophylaxis should be implemented before each subsequent S64315 infusion

8.2.11. Specific COVID -19 situation 
In case of highly suspected COVID -19 infection (based on typical symptoms or typical chest 
CT scan images) or confirmed COVID -19 infection (based on positive COVID -19 biological 
testing), the study treatment(s) should be immediately interrupted.  
The study treatment(s) could be restrated if patient is asymptomatic for at least 15 days after 
the diagnosis or with a negative test. 
8.3. Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient participating in a 
clinical study, whether or not there is a causal relationship with the IMPs and/or experimental procedures, occurring or detected from the date the patient signs the information and consent form, irrespective of t he period of the study.

 An adverse event can therefore be:  
­ any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding from an additional 
examination such as lab tests, X -rays, ECG, etc.) which is deemed clinically relevant by the 
investigator 
­ any symptom or disease 
­ any worsening during the study of a symptom or a disease already present when the patient entered the study (increase in frequency and/or intensity), including the studied pathology 
­ and detected during a study visit or at an additional examination or occurred since the previous study visit (including relevant event reported in patient’s diary or safety evaluation scale)  
 
Of note: 
­ Any hospitalisation for administration of anti -tumo ur treatment and/or associated 
protocol (during or after th e study) or other care measures for cancer (e.g. overnight 
hospital stay to receive a blood or platelets transfusion), for social reasons, educational purpose (e.g. learning of diabetes management by the patient) or routine check- up should 
not be considered as an adverse event and should not be reported in the eCRF. 
­ The following procedures, whether planned before the study or not, whether leading to a hospitalisation or not, should not be reported in the eCRF and kept in the source data (or patient file):  therapeutic procedures related to a non- aggravated medical history (e.g. cataract 
extraction not due to an aggravation of the cataract during the study, haemodialysis sessions related to a renal insufficiency not aggravated during the study) 
 prophylactic procedures (e.g. sterilisation, wisdom teeth removal) 
 comfort procedures (e.g. cosmetic surgery) 
 control procedures of a pre -existing condition without aggravation (e.g. colonoscopy to 
control the remission of colon cancer) 
8.4. Definition of Serious adverse events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event that, at any dose: 
­ results in death  
­ is life -threatening
(1) 
­ requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
­ is medically significant(2) 
­ results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(3) 
­ is a congenital anomaly/birth defect(4) 
(1) Life -threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
(2) Any event that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but might 
jeopardise the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of these outcomes (for example: oedema or al lergic bronchospasm that required intensive treatment at home, blood dyscrasia, 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse). The investigator should exercise his/her scientific and medical judgement to decide whether or not such an event requires expedited reporting to sponsor.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     92/173 
 (3) Disability/incapacity in this context refers to any event that seriously disrupts the ability of the patient 
to lead a normal life, in other words leads to a persistent or permanent significant change, deterioration, 
injury or perturbation of the patient's body functions or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life.  
(4) Congenital anomaly or birth defect refers to the exposure to the IMP before conception (in men or 
women) or during pregnancy that resulted in an adverse outcome in the child. 
8.5. Definition of overdose 
This refers to any intake of a quantity of IMP or a product other than the IMP taken as part of 
the protocol (NIMP) which is above the maximum dose recommended in the study protocol, independently of the occurrence of any adverse event. 
The quantity should be considered per administration or cumulatively regarding the maximum 
dose recommended in the study protocol. For instance, if the study protocol requires a unique daily administration, one administration of twice the dose or two administrations of the full tested  dose on the same day should be both considered as overdoses. 
8.6. Definition of Adverse event of special interest  
Not applicable 
8.7. Definition of Events requiring an immediate notification (ERIN)  
An event must be notified immediately  (i.e. without delay and within 24h at the latest) to the 
sponsor if it is: 
­ a SAE  
­ an overdose of the IMP even if asymptomatic 
­ any intake of the IMP by a person around the patient 
­ a pregnancy  
8.8. Classification of an adverse event (seriousness, severity, causali ty, expectedness)  
It is important that the investigator gives his/her own opinion regarding the seriousness , the 
intensity  of the event as well as the cause- effect relationship  between an adverse event and 
the IMPs. This evaluation must be assessed by the investigator and reported in the AE form. In 
addition, the sponsor will be responsible for the evaluation the expectedness  of the event (see 
section  8.10).  
The Seriousness  should be evaluated according to international guidance (see definition in 
section  8.4, in accordance with ICH Topic E2A and DIRECTIVE 2001/20/EC OF THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 4 April).  
The severity  of all AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI CTCAE) on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5): 
­ Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated 
­ Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL
1 
 
1 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.

 ­ Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL2 
­ Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
­ Grade 5: Death related to AE  
The causal relationship  to the IMPs, to the experimental procedures or to disease progression 
must be assessed when reporting the AE in the AE form. Cases ticked ‘related’ by the 
investigator or judged by the sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the IMPs (AE linked to the mechanism of action of the test drug, etc.), will be considered as suspected Adverse Drug Reaction. In general, if a relationship between AE and drug is at least reasonably possible (i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out) it is to be considered as ‘related’. 
8.9. Reporting procedures  
8.9.1. Time frame for AE reporting  
Any event meeting the above mentioned definitions (see sections 8.3 to 8.7) must be reported 
to the sponsor on an adverse event form  if it occurred:  
­ before the first intake of the IMP, and after the signature of the ICF, for event associated with any procedure/condition required by the study protocol: procedure (BMA, blood samples, MRI, etc.), change or withdrawal of previous/concomitant treatment relating to the 
conditions of the protocol 
­ at any time after the first intake of the IMP up to the patient’s last study visit for all events  
­ after the patient’s last study visit:  
 up to 30 calendar days after the patient's last study visit for all ERINs, regardless of the supposed role of the research (IMP or experimental procedure) 
 irrespective of the time of onset after the end of the study for all SAEs related to the research (IMP or experimental procedure)  
Of note, events occurring between the signature of the ICF and the first administration of the IMP for which the investigator does  not consider an association with any pr ocedure/condition 
required by the study protocol must be reported as medical history or as signs or symptoms related to the studied disease in the dedicated eCRF form.  Fatal event, related or not to the 
resear ch, occurring between ICF signature  and before first IMP administration , must be 
reported on AE form.  
 
 
2 Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking  
medications, and not bedridden.

8.9.2. Responsibilities of the investigator 
For any adverse event and special situation mentioned above the investigator must: 
­ Note in the patient's medical file  the date on which he/she learned of the event (at a follow -
up visit or a telephone contact with the patient or a third person, …) and any other relevant 
information which he/she has learned of the event 
­ Assess the event in terms of seriousness, intensity and causality  
­ Report the event to the sponsor  using the AE form (in case of ERIN, the reporting should 
be done immediately) 
­ Document  the event with additional useful information 
­ Ensure the follow- up of the event 
­ Fulfil his/her regulatory obligations to the  Competent Authorities and/or to the IRB/IEC, 
in accordance with local regulations  
Moreover, the investigator must report to the sponsor and/or to the IRB/IEC and/or to the Competent Authorities in accordance with the local regulation, any new information that might 
materially influence the benefit -risk assessment of the test drug or that would be sufficient to 
consider changes in the test drug administration or in the overall conduct of the clinical investigation. 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     95/173 
 8.9.2.1. Documentation of the event  
The investigator must ensure that all events are well documented. In particular for ERIN, he/she 
should provide the sponsor, as they become available, with anonymized copies of the 
documents which provide additional useful information, such as hospital admission reports, reports of further consultations, laboratory test reports, reports of other examinations aiding diagnosis, where possible, the results from pre -test drug assessments should be appended for 
comparison with the results obtained under test drug, or the autopsy report, if autopsy is performed.  
8.9.2.2. Follow- up of adverse events  
The investigator must ensure that follow -up of the patient is appropriate to the nature of the 
event, and that it continues until resolution if deemed necessary. 
Any change in terms  of diagnosis, intensity, seriousness, measures taken, causality or outcome 
regarding an adverse event already reported must be written up in a new complete evaluation 
of the event documented on the ‘Adverse event’ page previously created for the event. 
If the adverse event has not resolved at the patient's final visit in the study, the patient must be 
followed up suitably and any information on the outcome of the event will be noted on the 
‘Adverse Event’ page previously created for the event. An adverse event ongoing at the time of a participant's death is considered to be Not Recovered. 
If the patient’s follow -up is not done by the investigator him/herself (hospitalisation, followed 
by a specialist or the patient's general practitioner, etc.), the investigator will do everything to 
establish/maintain contact with the person/department in charge of the patient’s follow-up.  
8.9.2.3. Special situations (pregnancy, overdoses, intake of IMP by a person around the patient)  
Pregnancy  
If a female patient in the study becom es pregnant, the investigator must: 
­ stop immediately the IMPs  
­ report it on an ‘Adverse Event’ page as well as on the specific paper pregnancy form (1st age) 
to be notified immediately (ERIN)  
­ contribute to the follow -up of this pregnancy and provide the sponsor with information 
concerning this follow -up (notably using the 2nd page of the specific paper pregnancy form)  
If the partner of a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the pregnancy should not be reported in the eCRF. The investigator should immediately  contact the sponsor (contact 
details provided in the investigator’s study file) who will inform him/her about the procedure to be followed 
Overdose of IMP  
­ In case of overdose, the investigator should report it on an ‘Adverse Event’ page to be notified immediately (ERIN)  
­ Overdose should be followed- up to ensure that the information is as complete as possible 
with regards to:  dose details (number of units, duration, etc.) and, if multiple overdose, details regarding other medicinal products or substance 
 context of occurrence, i.e. intentional (suicide attempt, other reason) or accidental (error in prescription, administration, dispensing, dosage) 
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     96/173 
  related signs and symptoms (‘No related adverse events’ to be reported otherwise) 
 outcome 
­ In so far as possible, an additional PK blood sampling should be collected for assay of the 
taken IMP  
Intake of IMP by a person around the patient  
This event should not be reported in the eCRF. The investigator should immediately contact the 
sponsor (contact details provided in the investigator’s study file) who will inform him/her about 
the procedure to be followed. 
8.9.2.4. Recording m ethods in the eCRF  
Adverse events must be documented on the eCRF ‘Adverse Event’ page. 
In case of chronic disease:  
­ if the dis ease is known when the patient enters in the study, only worsening (increased 
frequency and/or intensity of the episodes/attacks) will be documented as an adverse event 
­ if the disease is detected during the study and if repeated episodes enable diagnosis of a 
chronic disease, the episodes will be grouped on the ‘Adverse Event’ page previously created for the event which will clearly describe the diagnosis  
8.9.2.5. Procedure for an event requiring an immediate notification  
In case of an event requiring an immediate n otification, the investigator must:  
­ immediately  after being informed of this event, fill in  the patient's medical file  as well as 
the eCRF ‘Adverse Event’ page according to the general instructions available in the eCRF, 
without waiting for the results of the clinical outcome or of additional investigations. When data is submitted into Inform®, an e- mail will be immediately and automatically sent to the 
sponsor 
­ provide the sponsor (person designated in the contact details provided in the investigator’s study file), as they become available, with anonymized copies of the documents which provide additional useful information 
­ fulfil his/her regulatory obligations to the Competent Authorities and/or to the IRB/IEC, in 
accordance with local regulations  
If an adve rse event initially non -serious worsens and becomes a SAE, this must be reported 
immediately  on the eCRF ‘Adverse event’ page.  
In case the eCRF is unavailable when the investigator was informed of the ERIN, he/she should:  
­ Immediately  fill in a paper ‘Adverse event’ page  
 For serious event on a paper ‘Adverse event – Initial information’ page 
 For event initially non- serious on a paper ‘Adverse event – Initial information’ page, and 
the worsening leading to seriousness on a paper ‘Adverse event – Additional information’ 
page 
­ Immediately send them by fax or by e -mail to the person(s) designated in the contact details 
provided in the investigator’s study file or outside working hours, the 24- hour phone line 
(01.55.72.60.00 for a call from France, or +33.1.55.72.60.00 for a call from outside France, and/or the specific phone line as specified in the instructions provided to each centre) 
­ As soon as the eCRF becomes available, enter this information in the eCRF ‘Adverse Event’ page

 8.10. Responsibilities of the sponsor  
In accordance with international guidance, the assessment of the seriousness and the causality 
of adverse events are usually made by the investigator but falls also under sponsor’s duties, 
who is responsible for ensuring that all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions are 
reported to Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees.  
The sponsor will review the seriousness of the adverse events and the causality of (at least) the SAEs, whether reported by the investigator or upgraded by the sponsor. The causality and the seriousness may be upgraded (but never downgraded). Anonymized copies of documents providing useful information such as reports of further consultations, laboratory tests reports, reports of other examination aiding diagnosis may be asked for  the event assessment. If the 
assessments of the investigator and the sponsor are different, both will be reported in the clinical study report (CSR). 
In addition, the sponsor is responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected . An AE wi ll be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the IMPs. Independently of the regulatory obligations of the investigator, the sponsor must report the 
pharm acovigilance data and any new safety finding likely to affect the benefit /risk balance of 
the product, required in ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines and local regulations, to the appropriate Authorities, to all the investigators involved and to the patients involved, through the investigators, as mentioned in section 13.4. 
The concerned Authorities will be notified as soon as possible by the sponsor of the DSMB 
recommendations if any, where relevant for the safety of patients (i.e. modification or termination o f the study). 
8.11. Responsibilities of Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
Taken into account the innovative character of such a combination, the limited data from animal studies, the potential important safety risks associated with the administration of both IMPs, the vulnerability of the treated population, a DSMB will be set -up to review periodically the 
patients’ safety and efficacy data throughout the conduct of the study in order to ensure that the patients’ potential benefit is not compromised by safety concerns. 
In accordance with the DSMB charter and the rules for DSMB functioning, the DSMB is an 
independent group of experts who provides expertise and recommendations to the Sponsor. Their primary responsibility is to review safety  and efficacy data in the light of the benefit -risk 
ratio on a regular basis and after the last patient of each cohort has completed the first cycle of treatment. After each meeting they will provide written recommendations to the International Coordinator /Investigators and the Sponsor regarding the progress and conduct of the study 
(continuation, modification or termination). Indeed, the DSMB can recommend escalating, de -
escalating the doses or extending a given cohort to additional patients according to the adopted study design. The DSMB could also give recommendations on the possible modification of the study protocol based on the review of the safety and efficacy data and suspend or early terminate the study in case of serious concerns about patient safe ty. The DSMB members will ensure their 
availability in case of any required extraordinary meeting. 
The role and the composition of the DSMB are detailed in section 12.4.

 8.12. Management of treatment dose adaptations due to toxicities 
For patients who do not tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, dose interruptions  
and/or reductions are either recommended or mandated in order to allow patients to c ontinue 
the study treatments.  
Dose modifications recommendations for S64315 are summarised in Table  (8.12) 1.  
A patient must discontinue treatment with S64315 if, after treatment is resumed at a lower dose, 
the toxicity recurs with the same or worse severity, unless in the opinion of the investigator it is in the patient’s best interest to continue S64315, and upon documented agreement with the 
Sponsor. 
For each patient, once a dose reduction has occurred, the dose may not be re -escalated during 
the subsequent cycles unless in the opinion of the investigator it is in the patient’s best interest 
to continue S64315, and upon documented agreement with the Sponsor. 
When a patient meets the criteria for S64315 discontinuation described in the table, he/she must 
discontinue both IMPs. 
Dose modifications for azacitidine must be done according to azacitidine E.U. SmPC (see 
Table (8.12) 2 ). 
These dose changes must be recorded in the eCRF.

 Table  (8.12) 2 - Criteria for interruption and re- initiation of azacitidine  
(see E.U. azacitidine SmPC)  
Dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity  
Haematological toxicity is defined as the lowest count reached in a given cycle (nadir) if platelets ≤ 50.0 x 
109/L and /or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1 x 109/L. 
Recovery is defined as an increase of cell line(s) where haematological toxicity was observed of at least half 
of the difference of nadir and the baseline count plus the nadir count (i.e. blood count at recovery ≥ nadir count 
+ (0.5 x [baseline count – nadir count]).  
Patients without reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. WBC ≥ 3.0 x 109/L and ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, and 
platelets ≥ 75.0 x 109/L) prior to the first treatment 
If haematological toxicity is observed following azacitidine treatment, the next cycle of the therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 14 days, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, i f recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, the dose should be reduced 
according to the following table. Following dose modifications, the cycle duration should return to 28 days.  
 
Nadir counts  % Dose in the next cycle, if recovery* is not 
achieved wi thin 14 days  
ANC (x 109/L) Platelets (x 109/L)  
≤ 1.0  ≤ 50.0  50% 
> 1.0  > 50.0  100%  
*Recovery = counts ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count – nadir count])  
Patients with reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. WBC < 3.0 x 109/L or ANC < 1.5 x 109/L or platelets 
< 75.0 x 109/L) prior to the first treatment  
Following azacitidine treatment, if the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets from that prior to treatment is ≤ 50%, or greater than 50% but with an improvement in any cell line differentiation, the next  cycle should not 
be delayed and no dose adjustment made.  
If the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets is greater than 50% from that prior to treatment, with no 
improvement in cell line differentiation, the next cycle of azacitidine therapy should be delayed until the platelet 
count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 14 days, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, bone marrow cellularity should be determined. If 
the bone marrow cellularity is > 50%, no dose adjustments should be made. If bone marrow cellularity is 
≤ 50%, treatment should be delayed and the dose reduced according to the following table:  
 
Bone marrow cellularity  % Dose in the next cycle if recovery is not achieved withi n 14 days 
 Recovery* ≤ 21 days  Recovery* > 21 days  
15-50 %  100%  50% 
< 15%  100%  33% 
*Recovery = counts ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count – nadir count])  
Following dose modifications, the cycle duration should return to 28 days.  
Dose adjustment due to non -hematologic toxicities:  
Renal abnormalities and electrolyte imbalance:  
- If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mmol/L occur, the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next cycle.
 
- If unexplained elev ations in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to ≥ 2- fold above baseline 
values and above upper limit of normal (ULN) occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values  return 
to normal or baseline and the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next treatment cycle.

9.3.1. Mandatory assessments 
Tumour samples will be analysed at the mol ecular and cellular levels as well as to determine 
how baseline biomarker values/levels and changes from baseline may relate to exposure, 
clinical outcomes, and resistance. Potential predictive markers of efficacy will also be explored. 
In addition, MRD (Ivey, 2016)  assessment will be explored for detection, as well as the 
quantification, of residual leukemic cells and their clonal evolution. 
Participation in the CL1 -64315-004 study implies a systematic participation in the mandatory 
investigation. All patients will have to consent to this investigation by signing the main 
information and consent form for participation in the study. In addition, in case of consent withdrawal, related samples will be destr oyed after mandatory assessment is completed. 
In this investigation, the analysis of an association between the biomarkers  (BCL -2 family 
member genes, proteins and other genes of interest ), the investigated disease ( AML) and the 
treatment response will be assessed. For this purpose, samples from all patients will be collected in order to extract DNA, RNA and/or proteins and to analyse biomarkers (such as variations of DNA, proteins and RNA characteristics). Overall validated results of the biomarkers assessment may be transmitted to the patient upon his/her request at the end of the study. There will be no communication of individual results neither to the investigator nor to the patient unless these results are proven to impact the therapeutic strategy.  
While the goal of the biomarker assessments is to provide supportive data for the clinical study, 
there may be circumstances when a decision is made to stop a collection, or not perform or discontinue an analysis due to either practical or strategic reasons ( e.g. inadequate sample 
number, issues related to the quality of the sample or issues related to the assay that preclude analysis, impossibility to perform correlative analyses, etc.). Therefore, depending on the results obtained during the study, sample collection analysis may be omitted at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
9.3.1.1. Sampling and storage 
Archived  and newly obtained tumour samples but also blood samples will be collected before 
and during treatment with S64315 in combination with azacitidine upon disease progression to 
investigate the effect of the combination.

 ­ Archived and/or newly BMB: 
An archiv ed tumour sample, Formalin- Fixed Paraffin -Embedded (FFPE) block, or unstained 
slides if it’s not possible to obtain FFPE block, is requested from all patients before screening, 
if available. The BMB main anatomo -pathological characteristics will be collecte d via the 
eCRF. If needed, corresponding copies of anonymized pathology reports should be sent to the Sponsor by fax or email to the following number / address: +33.1.55.72.50.04 / CL1-64315-004@servier.com. An additional archived  sample may be requested i f the original sample 
provided is of insufficient quantity or quality to complete the planned analysis. All FFPE blocks and unstained slides will be stored and sent at approximately +4°C. 
­ Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) samples and blood samples: 
The BMA main  anatomo -pathological characteristics will be collected via the eCRF. If needed, 
corresponding copies of anonymized pathology reports should be sent to the Sponsor by fax or 
email to the following number / address: +33.1.55.72.50.04 / CL1 -64315-004@servier .com. 
BMMCs (bone marrow -derived mononuclear cells) or fixed/lysed cells and PBMCs (peripheral 
blood- derived mononuclear cells) or fixed/lysed cells collections from BMA and blood samples 
respectively are requested for all patients at various predose time points as described in Table (9.3) 1. PBMCs and BMMCs (or fixed/lysed cell) samples will be stored at approximately ≤ -70°C on site before shipment and sent on dry ice. 
­ Saliva:  
Patient’s saliva will be collected as defined in  Table (9.3) 1. Patient’s saliva kit will be stored 
on site before shipment and sent at ambient temperature. ­ Karyotype for AML patients: 
The main chromosomal abnormalities will be collected via the eCRF. If needed, copies of  
anonymized karyotype reports should be sent to the Sponsor by fax or email to the following 
number / address: +33. 1.55.72.50.04 / CL1 -64315- 004@servier.com, if performed at the 
following time points: diagnosis, baseline (before the first infusion of S64315) and at disease progression. 
The samples will be stored during the study in a logistic platform/central laboratory. Then, the 
samples will be kept deep frozen (except for biopsy samples) in a central bio-repository specialized in storage of biological samples until further notification from the S ponsor and may 
be retained up to 25 years after study closure. 
9.3.1.2. Labelling and shipments  
All sample collection information must be entered as required on the appropriate sample 
collection eCRF page( s) and requisition form(s). Detailed instructions for the collection, 
handling, and shipment of tumour or other samples are outlined in the laboratory manual for the study. 
All tubes will be produced by the logistic CRO, and will be clearly labelled with t he centre 
number, the patient number, date and hour of collection. Samples will be single coded with a 
number and thus will not carry any personal identifiers.

 Samples will be sent to the logistic CRO to be stored until their analysis by different analytic al 
laboratories depending on their aim: 
­ on dry ice for PBMCs and BMMCs (or fixed/lysed cells) from blood and BMA samples 
respectively  
­ at +4°C for archived and/or newly obtained tumour samples (BMB) 
­ at ambient temperature for patients’ saliva samples  
9.3.1.3. Biomarker assessments  
­ Archived and/or newly BMB 
Collection of the archived  samples may allow monitoring of the changes potentially occurring 
in Bcl -2 family member’s expression, between the time of the collection of archived  and newly 
obtained BMB . This co uld allow assessing  potential Bcl -2 family member’s expression changes 
due to prior therapy. 
Newly BMB will be collected for exploratory analysis of potential predictive biomarkers of 
efficacy (response and non- response) which include but are not limited to expression of Bcl -2 
family proteins or other proteins related to cancer. 
Additional biomarkers or methods may be utilized if indicated by new findings from the 
literature as well as from I.R.I.S. internal data.  
­ BMA samples and blood samples 
BMMCs and PBMCs isolated from BMA and blood (or fixed/lysed cells) samples respectively will permit exploratory analysis of:  
 Predictive markers of efficacy (response and non- response) which may include, but are 
not limited to expression of Bcl -2 family proteins, genomic alterations of BCL -2 family 
member genes and other genes related to cancer using technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), 
 MRD and residual leukemic cells clonal evolution. 
Moreover, PBMCs isolated from blood samples will also be collected prior to and after dosing of S64315, on the time points indicated in Table (9.3) 1 to allow assessment of 
pharmacodynamics biomarkers.  A dose -dependen t decrease of B -cells counts following S64315 treatment has been observed in 
toxicological studies in rats. Moreover, based on literature, hypomethylating agents do not significantly reduce the B -cell population (N. Daver et al. Leukemia (2018)). Therefore , 
absolute count of t otal and B lymphocytes will be assessed locally as potential surrogate 
response marker s for MCL1 inhibition.  
 
For patients who have disease progression after demonstrating clinical benefit, tumour samples 
may be collected and used to evaluate determinants of resistance and outcome as described above. Refractory tissue samples containing tumour (i.e. blood, BMA or BMB) will be compared to pre- treatment biopsy samples.  
Additional markers or methods may be utilized if indicated by new findings from the literature as well as from Sponsor’s internal data.

 ­ Saliva  
For gene alteration analysis, patient’s saliva will be used as a comparator to allow identification 
of somatic DNA variants in tumour. 
­ Karyotype 
The changes in karyotypes of AML patients related to S64315 treatment will be evaluated by comparing karyotypes at diagnosis or at baseline and at progression.  
The samples may be used after the end of the study for other genomic assessments in relation 
to the test drug or the disease (AML) not specified in the protocol in light of new scientific 
knowledge or technology but will not be used for the elaboration of a DNA bank. 
9.3.1.4. Transfer of analytical results  
Final analytical results will be transferred to Data  Management according to section  12.2. 
9.3.2. Optional assessments 
During the trial, in addition to the biomarkers specified above, exploratory biomarker research 
may be conducted on any remaining BMA, tumour and/or blood samples. These studies would extend the search for the potential of other relevant biomarkers for S64315 in combination with azacitidine effects and/or safety. This may also include research to help develop ways to detect, monitor and/or treat cancer. These additional investigations would be dependent upon clinical outcome, reagent and sample availability. 
Participation in the  CL1-64315-004 study does not imply a mandatory or systematic 
participation in these optional investigations. All voluntary patients will have to sign a specific 
informed consent form for optional retrospective genomic biomarker analyses . The consent 
given to these assessments can be withdrawn at any moment without compromising the participation in the overall clinical study investigations. In additio n, in case of consent 
withdrawal, related samples will be destroyed before any optional assessment is completed. 
The samples will not be used for any investigations not specified in this protocol or for the 
elaboration of a DNA bank. 
If the patient agrees,  the remaining biological samples from blood, bone marrow or tumour may 
be stored for up to 25 years and further analysed to address scientific questions related to the 
S64315 compound and/or cancer. This may also include research to help develop ways to detect, monitor or treat cancer. A decision to perform such exploratory biomarker research studies will be based on outcome data from this study or from new scientific findings related to the drug class or disease, as well as reagent and assay availability.

 9.4. Pharmacogenomics measurements  
In order to improve the knowledge of factors influencing S64315 pharmacokinetics in humans 
and in accordance with the guideline ‘Guideline on the use of pharmacogenetic methodologies in the pharmacokinetic evaluation of medicinal products’ ( Guideline EMA -
EMA/CHMP/37646, 2009), an analysis of genetic variations among patients is recommended. This investigation focuses on genes encoding proteins involved in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) will be requested if a high inter -individual variability would 
be observed in pharmacokinetics data not explain by other factors (as gender, age, body weight, etc.). Therefore, depending on the results obtained during the study, sample analysis may be 
omitted at I.R.I.S. discretion. 
Participation in the CL1 -64315- 004 study does not imply a mandatory or systematic 
participation in the optional investigation. All voluntary patients will have to sign a specific 
informed consent form for optional genomic biomarkers (ADME genotyping) analysis . The 
consent given to this assessment can be withdrawn at any moment without compromising the participation in the overall clinical study investigations. In addition, in case of consent withdrawal, related samples will be destroyed before any optional assessment is completed. 
The samples will not be used for any investigations not specified in this protocol or for the 
elaboration of a DNA bank.  
Overall results of the pharmacogenomics ADME biomarkers assessment may be transmitted to the patient upon his/her request at the end of the study. There will be no communication of individual results neither to the investigator nor to the patient. 
9.4.1. Sampling and storage 
One blood sample (2 mL) per patient will be collected into an EDTA K3 tube according to the 
study centre’s practice at C1D1 azacitidine predose. The accurate sample collection date and 
time must be recorded on the requisition forms  and entered on the sample collection eCRF page. 
The blood sample will be immediately stored on site before shipment and sent on dry ice. 
9.4.2. Labelling and shipments  
Each sample tubes will be clearly labelled with a double identification (aliquot number, 
Sponsor ’s name, country code, centre number, protocol number and patient number) and will 
be shipped with a requisition form. Samples will be single coded with a number and thus will not carry any personal identifiers. 
The whole blood samples will be stored on si te before shipment at approximately  ≤ 70°C and 
sent on dry ice to the appropriate logistic CRO that will store the samples at approximately  
≤-70°C at reception, until shipment to the laboratory for DNA extraction and analysis. The 
extracted remaining DNA s amples will then be shipped and kept deep frozen in a central bio-
repository specialized in storage of biological samples or not until further notification from the 
Sponsor and may be retained up to 25 years after study closure. 
The samples may be used aft er the end of the study for ADME genomic assessments in relation 
to the IMPs not specified in the protocol in light of new scientific knowledge or technology. After a maximum period of 25 years after the end of the study or on the simple demand of the 
patient to the investigator, all DNA extracts stored at a central bio -repository will be destroyed.

Management; otherwise no data will be transferred.  
10. STATISTICS  
This part will describe the planned analysis for the A rm A  and the sub -arms A1  and A2. 
Arm  B will be introduced through an amendment and the associated statistical part will be 
defined later.  
10.1. Overall consideration  
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT(s)), the RP2D and to investigate the clinical activity of the 
combination of S64315 with azacitidine in patients with AML. 
The dose escalation phase I part will be followed by an expansion phase II  part into two sub-
arms: A1  and A2. A DSMB will assess the overal l data of the study and provide 
recommendations on the conduct of the study (see  section 8.11).  The statistical analyses 
corresponding to the dose allocation processes will be carried out using R  software with the 
rjags R package ( Rjags R ) by the Center of Excellence Methodology and Valorisation of Data  
of I.R.I.S. 
10.2. Dose escalation phase I part  
10.2.1. Dose escalation phase I part consideration s 
An adaptive Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose control (EWOC) will 
be used to guide  the dose escalation phase I part and estimate the MTD(s) based on occurrence 
of DLT until C1D28 ( Neuenschwander, 2008;  Babb, 1998).  
The BLRM is a well -established method to estimate the MTD in patients  with cancer. The 
adaptive BLRM will be guided by the escalation with overdose control principle to control the risk of DLT in future patients on study. The dose recommended by the model at any stage of the trial is based on the entire history of all available DLT information from previous cohorts as opposed to only the number of DLTs observed in the last group of patients. Moreover, historical data/co -data can also be used to enrich the prior of the BLRM. Operational 
characteristics of the design are presented in  Appendix 8. 
This study is currently planned to administer S64315 once a week during a 28-day cycle in 
combination with azacitidine, with a lead -in dose period of 2 weeks for S64315. 
Based on the emerging clinical safety and PK data, other dosing schedules may also be assessed in this study. If the decision is made to switch to a different dosing schedule a new model and its operating characteristics will be communicated via a new document similar to Appendix 8  
along with the documentation provided as formal notification of the change in dosing schedule (e.g. minutes of the corresponding dose escalation meeting, etc.), or it will be explicitly indicated in such documentation with suitable rationale that the new regimen has no changes to the initial model.

 The MTD/R P2D will be based on: 
­ The MTD estimated by the B LRM model stated above and 
­ An overall clinical assessment of all available safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary 
activity data  
10.2.2. Statistical model  
This part contains a quick presentation of the model; more details about the model and 
assumptions are presented in Appendix 8, as well as the operational characteristics of the chosen models. 
A 5-parameter adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model guided by the escalation with 
overdose control principle (EWOC) will be fitted o n DLT  during LID period and during Cycle 
1 data to make dose recommendations and estimate the MTD/ RP2D for the combination of 
S64315 (agent 1) and azacitidine (agent 2, fixed dose). 
The model has three components: 
­ S64315 single agent toxicity, represented by parameters α1
 and β1  
­ azacitidine single agent toxicity, represented by parameters α2 and β2  
­ the interaction between S64315 and azacitidine, represented by parameter η12 
The two single agent dose-DLT relationships are modelled as in a single agent study: 
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝜋𝜋1(𝑑𝑑1)�=  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝛼𝛼1)+  𝛽𝛽1  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝑑𝑑1/𝑑𝑑1∗ ),𝛼𝛼1> 0,𝛽𝛽1> 0 
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝜋𝜋2(𝑑𝑑2)�=  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝛼𝛼2)+  𝛽𝛽2  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝑑𝑑2/𝑑𝑑2∗ ),𝛼𝛼2> 0,𝛽𝛽2> 0 
where π1(d1) is the probability of DLT if S64315 is given as a single agent at a total weekly 
dose of d1 and π2(d2) is the probability of DLT if azacitidine is given as a single agent at a total daily dose of d2. 
The parameter α1 (respectively α2) is then the single -agent odds of a DLT at the reference dose 
for S64315 (respectively azacitidine), and β1 (respectively β2) is the increase in the log-odds 
of a DLT by a unit increase in log- dose for S64315 (respectively azacitidine). As there is only 
one tested dose of azacitidine and this tested dose is chosen as the reference dose, log(d
2/d2*) = 
0 and β 2 will not be estimated. Then, the model is simplified fro m a 5 -parameter model to a 4 -
parameter model.  
The dose-DLT relationship of the combination of S64315 and azacitidine is modelled as: 
𝑂𝑂𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑂(𝜋𝜋12(𝑑𝑑1,𝑑𝑑2)))  =𝜋𝜋12(𝑑𝑑1,𝑑𝑑2)
1
− 𝜋𝜋12(𝑑𝑑1,𝑑𝑑2)
=   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝜂𝜂12𝑑𝑑1
𝑑𝑑1∗𝑑𝑑2
𝑑𝑑2∗)�𝜋𝜋1(𝑑𝑑1) +  𝜋𝜋2 (𝑑𝑑2) − 𝜋𝜋1(𝑑𝑑1)𝜋𝜋2(𝑑𝑑2)
(1−  𝜋𝜋1(𝑑𝑑1))(1−  𝜋𝜋2(𝑑𝑑2))� 
This study is currently planned to administer S64315 once weekly with a 28 -day cycle preceded 
by a LID period of 2- weeks, with one infusion of 25 mg on D -13 and one infusion of 50 mg on 
D-6. Azacitidine will be administered at 75  mg/m² via SC injection, daily for 7 days, from D1 
to D7 followed by a rest period of 21 days (28 -day cycle). However, based on the emerging 
clinical safety and PK data, other dosing schedules may also be assessed in this study.

 If the decision is made to switch to a different dosing schedule before determination of the MTD 
in the planned schedule, then the initial total weekly S64315 dose will be a dose that has previously been tested and that is considered safe according to the EWOC criterion. Unless otherwise justified, it will be assumed that different schedules can have different effects on 
patient safety and dose allocation based on the new schedule will then be guided by a new model. 
The new model and its operating characteristics would be communicated via a new document 
similar to Appendix 8 along with the documentation provided as formal notification of the 
change in dosing schedule (e.g. minutes of the corresponding dose escalation meeting, etc.), or it would be explicitly indicated in such documentation with suitable rationale that the new regimen has no change to the initial model. 
The MTD is the highest dose of the combination treatment that is unlikely (< 25% posterior 
probability) to cause DLT in more than 33% of the  treated patients during the LID period and 
the first cycle of S64315 treatment in combination with azacitidine.  
10.2.3. Provisional dose levels 
This study currently plans and expects to complete dose escalation of S64315 in combination with azacitidine with the p rovisional dose levels described in  Table (10.2.3) 1. 
Table  (10.2.3 ) 1 - Provisional dose levels  
Dose level  -1 1* 2 3 4 
Weekly dose of S64315 (mg)  25 50* 100 200 250 
*Starting dose level according to the power prior obtained by integrating all data from weekly  
S64315 in the single agent CL1 -64315 -004 study validated at the last EoC meeting  
Intermediate dose levels could be added during the course of the study. 
Azacitidine will be administered at a fixed dose of 75  mg/m² via SC injection, daily for 7 days, 
from D1 to D7 followed by a rest period of 21 days (28- day cycle).  
S64315 full starting dose will be 50 mg. This  dose is considered safe (i.e. fulfilling the E WOC 
criterion) according to the power prior obtained by integrating all data from the weekly schedule 
of S64315 as a single agent in CL1-64315- 001 study validated in an EoC meeting (see 
Appendix 8 for details on power prior calculation and power prior obtained from single agent 
study data as of 26 November 2019). 
10.2.4. Prior specifications  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for all model parameters, 
which includes the single -agent parameters for S6 4315 (α1, β1), for azacitidine (α2, β2), and 
the interaction parameter (η12). A weakly informative prior will be used for S64315 prior and data from study CL1-64315- 001 will be used to enrich this same weakly informative prior. 
Details on the derivation of  the weakly informative prior that will be used are provided in 
Appendix 8. A weakly informative prior will be used for azacitidine.

 10.2.5. Integration of data from CL1-64315-001 study as co- data  
Available clinical data from CL1 -64315- 001 study will be used to enrich the weakly 
informative prior used in our combination, in a down weighted fashion. The power prior 
obtained after integration of the previous study data will be used as prior information for S64315: it will be derived at the time of evaluation of each once a week cohort in combination with azacitidine, based on all data from the weekly monotherapy schedule (study CL1-64315-001) validated in an EoC meeting at that time.  
The given data will be incorporated through down-weighti ng using the following weight ‘w’ 
(Chen, 2006; Neuenschwander, 2010)
: 
𝑤𝑤=  1
1+2𝑛𝑛𝜏𝜏2/𝜎𝜎2 
where n is the sample size of external data, σ is the ‘outcome standard deviation’ for one observation and τ is the between- trial standard deviation. While σ is the standard deviation of 
all external data which include several dose levels, 𝜎𝜎
2 can be approximated by variance of 
log(α). For this dose escalation, σ was then chosen as 2 and τ  was set as 0.25 to correspond to 
moderate between -trial variability.  
See Appendix 8 for details on power prior calculation and the power prior obtained study 
CL1-64315-001 data as of 26 November 2019. 
10.2.6. Dose proposed by the model  
The dose allocation will start at the dose combination of 50 mg and 75 mg/m2 respectively for 
S64315 and azacitidine.  
A maximum of 6 DLT -evaluable patients  may be initially enrolled at a dose level, and a 
minimum of 3 DLT -evaluable patients must be treated at a given dose level before a new higher 
dose level may be evaluated . 
All available data on DLTs, assessed starting from the LID period to C1D28 will be used for 
updating the model. Before making a dose allocation decision, all patients from a cohort must: 
­ have been treated with LID1 and LID2, 3 out of 4 S64315 infusions and 5 out of 7 azacitidine 
injections or 
­ have had a DLT within the LID period or the f irst cycle  
If a patient is not eligible for inclusion in the Dose -Limiting Toxicity Evaluable Set (DLTES), 
she/he must be replaced.  
If a DLT occurred at LID1, the DLT will be considered as relative to 25  mg of S64315 in 
monotherapy. If a DLT occurred at LID2, the DLT will be considered as relative to 50 mg of S64315 in monotherapy. In that case, the patient will be replaced to ensure t he minimal number 
of patients needed in the cohort at the full tested dose . Those DLTs will be considered for dose 
recommendation during the EoC meeting.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     118/173 
 At any time during the study, if DLTs occur in the first 2 evaluable patients of a cohort (whether 
it happened during the LID period or cycle 1), the BLRM could be updated in order to re -
evaluate the current dose level before enrolment of any additional patients in the cohort. Once each cohort of patients is completed, the dose recommendation by the model will be based on posterior summaries including the mean, median, standard deviation, 95% -credible interval, 
and the probability that the true DLT rate for each dose lies in one of the following categories: 
­ [0,16%) under-dosing 
­ [16%,33%) targeted toxicity 
­ [33%,100%] excessive toxicity 
Following the principle of EWOC, after each cohort of patients, the dose combinations fulfilling 
the EWOC criterion (i.e. it is unlikely (<25% posterior probability) that the DLT rate at the dose falls in the excessive toxicity  interval) will be identified by the model. A dose not fulfilling 
the EWOC criterion cannot be recommended.  
In addition, admissible dose  increments  for the next cohort will not exceed 100% of the previous 
dose of S64315. 
The set of allowed doses for the next cohort is thus defined as the intersection between the dose 
levels admissible according to this protocol (escalation rule defined above) and the dose levels allowed by the model (EWOC criterion fulfilled). The dose recommendation made by the adaptive BL RM should then be regarded as guidance and information to be integrated with a 
clinical assessment of the toxicity and activity profiles observed, so that a dose is selected for the next cohort among the allowed doses. 
 
More than 6 DLT -evaluable patients may be treated in a cohort at dose levels considered safe 
according to the BLRM with overdose control in order to better characterize the safety, 
tolerability, PK, PD, or preliminary clinical activity of S64315 in combination with az acitidine . 
10.2.7. Dose allocation process 
Once evaluation of a given dose level has been completed, and before testing a new dose level, 
an EoC meeting between the Sponsor (Therapeutic Area Oncology and Immuno Oncology, Medical Safety Leader, Methodology Departme nt and Clinical Pharmacokinetics Department)  
and the investigators will take place to decide jointly the next dose level to be tested according to: 
­ the admissible doses allowed by the BLRM (based on single agent study CL1-64315-001 
data through the power prior)  
­ all safety data  
­ PK data 
­ PD data 
­ activity data  
The dose allocation process is described in Figure (10.2.7) 1.

10.2.8. Final recommendation and stopping rules  
Dose escalation will continue until identification of the MTD or suitable lower dose levels for 
the expansion phase II (RP2D). This will occur when the following conditions are met: 
1. at least 6 patients have been treated at this dose  and are evaluable for the DLT  
2. one of the following conditions is fulfilled: 
a. the posterior probability of targeted toxicity at this dose exceeds 50% and is the highest 
among potential doses or b. a minimum of 18 patients have already been treated and evaluable for the DLT on the 
dose escalation of Arm A  
3. it is the dose recommended for patients, either per the model or by review of all patient

 Of note, the dose escalation phase I part could be stopped earlier by a joint decision from the 
sponsor and the investigators during a dose escalation meeting, by taking into account the model 
estimations and a global assessment of the safety, PK, PD and preliminary activity data. Note that it is possible that the MTD may not be reached in some situations  and a suitable dose level 
may be defined as a recommended dose for the phase II dose expansion part after evaluation of all data collected during the phase I dose escalation part.  
10.3. Expansion phase II part  
10.3.1. Expansion desi gn 
The expansion phase II part will be performed at the MTD or suitable lower dose levels (RP2D) 
in order to gain more information about the overall safety and tolerability of S64315 in combination with azac itidine in A rm A, to provide additional PK and PD  data and to provide 
preliminary activity data.  
Therefore, an expansion phase II part will be performed at the final recommended dose (RP2D) and schedule of administration in order to better evaluate anti -tumour activity and cumulative 
toxicity if any of S64315 in combination with azacitidine in sub- arms A1 /A2. New patients will 
be enrolled in a two- stage expansion  phase II  part with a Bayesian interim analysis for futility 
at the end of s tage 1 in each arm.  
During s tage 1, in each arm, patients will be enrolled and treated at the corresponding RP2D. 
The interim analysis for futility will occur when the  patients included in s tage 1 have completed 
at least 4 cycles or early discontinued.  Of note, the recruitment could be stopped before the 
interim analysis if  the minimal number of responders is impossible to be me t. 
Then, a Bayesian analysis will be performed on the  rate of CR. Decision rules will be based on 
clinical threshold defined on the posterior distribution of the rate of CR  (see section 8.5 for 
details on the deter mination of sample size).  
According to results of futility interim analysis performed at the end of s tage 1, the expansion 
phase II part could be: 
­ Stopped, if results on the rate of CR  are considered futile 
­ Continued if results on the rate of CR  are consid ered not futile. In that case, additional 
patients will be enrolled in s tage 2  
10.3.2. Criteria to re -evaluate the RP2D during the expansion phase  
Subjects in the dose expansion phase will be followed for DLT (as defined in section 4.1.3.5).  
After at least 4 subjects have been treated during dose expansion at the RP2D, i f the observed 
rate of DLT through the end of Cycle 1 exceed s 33% across  (including the patients treated at 
this dose during dose escalation) , the BLRM will be updated to determine whether  the RP2D 
still satisfies the EWOC principle. If the RP2D is estimated to have a ≥25% posterior probability 
of generating excessive toxicity (DLT rate between 33% and 100%) during the first cyle of 
treatment, then enrollment to the study will be paused. A risk assessment will be conducted by 
the DSMB, the investigators and sponsor, and consideration will be given to reducing the RP2D.  
S64315   Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     121/173 
 In addi tion, monitoring will continue for DLTs that may occur after the first cycle of treatment. 
After at least 4 subjects have had the opportunity to receive a second cycle of treatment, if the 
posterior probability (based on a beta -binomial distribution, using a Jeffrey prior) is greater than 
25% that the true rate of DLT occurring after Cycle 1 is >33%, enrollment to the study will be paused. Subjects should have received at least three doses of S64315 from Cycle 2 to be evaluable, unless dosing was limited by the occurrence of a DLT. Evaluable patients treated at this dose during dose escalation will also be included in this assessment. The study will also be paused if the cumulative rate of Grade ≥3 treatment -related cardiac adverse events at the RP2D 
exceeds  20%.  
In either case, the safety of the RP2D will be re- evaluated by the DSMB, the investigators and 
sponsor, and consideration will be given to reducing the RP2D.   
If the assessment of all available data warrants a change in the RP2D, 23 subjects will be treated 
at the new RP2D in each arm involved. These subjects will be monitored as reported above.  
10.4. Statistical analysis 
A Statistical Analysis Plan will be written after finalising the protocol and definitively completed before the first d atabase lock. These specifications will detail the implementation of 
all the planned statistical analyses in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. 
The statistical analysis will be mainly descriptive. It will be carried out using SA S software 
by I.R.I.S. Pole of Expertise Methodology & Data Valorisation and/or designated CRO. 
The study data will be analysed and reported in the CSR once the study is terminated (at the 
end-of-study, defined as the date of the last follow -up of the last patient). However, some 
intermediate analyses might be performed during the conduct of the study.

 10.4.4.3.1. Dose escalation phase I part 
CR rate, BOR and ORR will be analysed on the SS1 by dose level, overall and per population 
(relapsed/refractory and 1st line) depending of the number of patients. They will be evaluated 
according to the investigator assessments of response during the treatment period. They will be described using proportion and the corresponding exact binomial 95% confidence interval will be provided. 
The survival function of the time -dependent parameters will be estimated via Kaplan -Meier 
curve. In addition, 95% confidence interval for median duration will be computed depending 
of the number of observations 
10.4.4.3.2. Expansion phase II part  
The prim ary endpoint Complete Re mission  rate will be analysed on the  SS2 and on the PPS 
depending of the number of patients per treatment status. 
Patients without post- baseline assessment will be considered as non -responders. 
The Complete Remission  rate will be de scribed using proportion along with the corresponding 
exact binomial 95% confidence interval. Bayesian statistics based on the posterior distribution 
will also be provided. 
The secondary endpoints, ORR, BOR, DOR, OS, PFS and DFS will be analysed on the SS2  
and on the PPS, overall and per treatment status (R/R and 1
st line) depending of the number of 
patients per treatment status.  
BOR will be described using proportion along with the corresponding exact binomial 95% 
confidence interval. 
The distribution of the survival endpoints (OS, DOR, DFS and PFS) will be estimated with the 
Kaplan -Meier product -limit method. Summary statistics (median, 95% confidence interval) and 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be presented.  
All endpoints will be evaluated according to the investigator assessments of response during the period of interest. 
10.4.4.4. Biomarkers  
The relationship between the expression level of Bcl -2 family members, genomic alterations of 
Bcl-2 family member genes and other cancer -related genes in blasts (from blood and bone 
marrow samples) as well as target -engagement biomarker and the antineoplastic activity of 
S64315 in combination with azacitidine could be studied using descriptive statistics  if relevant,  
and quantitative systems pharmacology analyses. The relationship between the biomarkers just 
mentioned and S64315 toxicity could also be studied using descriptive statistics. 
10.5. Determination of sample size  
No formal statistical power calculations to determine sample size were performed for this study. 
Overall, a maximum of 180 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation phase I part of Ar m 
A (up to 30 patients)  followed by sub- arms A1 and A2 (50 per sub- arms, up to 150 patients 
overall) .
 
10.5.1. Dose escalation phase I part 
During the dose escalation phase I  part, the cohort size will be between 3 and 6  evaluable 
patients. At least 6 patients will be treated at the MTD/RP2D level, as described in section  10.2. 
S64315   Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     126/173 
 According to the simulations performed, at leas t 18 patients should be considered evaluable in 
the dose escalation  phase I  part to have reasonable operating characteristics for the 
determination of the MTD. However, in some situations, the MTD/ RP2D could be declared 
with fewer patients.  
10.5.2. Expansion phase II part  
In the expansion phase II part, up to 50 patients will be enrolled in each sub- arm (A1 and A2) 
at the RP2D. In each of these arms, there will be two stages:  
­ 23 patients are planned to be included in s tage 1 based on the following Bayesian rules for 
futility: the posterior probability of CR rate <20% must be lower than 60% (i.e. > 4 (so at 
least 5) responders /2 3 patients) to consider there is enough evidence of S64315 in 
combination with azacitidine act ivity to enrol a new cohort in s tage 2  
­ In case of no futility at the end of s tage 1, 27 additional patients are planned to be included 
in stage 2. This number of patients ensures detecting enough evidence of S64315 in 
combination with azacitidine activity based on a posterior probability of CR rate >20% 
greater than 70%. Moreover, this number of patients has been identified to ensure a minimal precision of 23% around the CR rate 
10.6. Pharmacokinetic analyses and PK/PD analysis 
10.6.1. Pharmacokinetic interpretation  
The dataset needed for the final analysis will be prepared by extraction from the clinical 
Business Intelligence Department using SAS® program and following the clinical PK project manager specifications. The non- compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA) wi ll be 
performed by the Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacometrics Department using PhoenixWinNonlin
® version 6.4 or later or Excel  2010 on the individual plasma concentration-
time data of S64315 and azacitidine after the IV administration of S64315 and SC administration of azacitidine.  
For S64315 and azacitidine preliminary NCA analysis, the theoretical administration and sampling times will be used.  
The exact administration and sampling times will be used for the final NCA analysis for S64315 and azacit idine. 
Descriptive statistics, tables and figures will be generated using SAS 9.2
® and Excel® 2010. 
The NCA will be performed according to operating manual (OPM) of clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacometrics Department.  
Any suspicious concentration will  be investigated and kept in the PK analysis if possible. All 
excluded concentrations will be justified in the report. 
For each patient, the following parameters will be calculated on the individual plasma 
concentration -time profiles of azacitidine: C
max, tmax, AUC last, AUC τ, AUC, t last, C last, t1/2, z, 
CL and Vd.  
For each patient, the following parameters will be calculated on the individual plasma concentration -time profiles of S64315: C
inf, tinf, AUC last, AUC τ, AUC , tlast, Clast,, t1/2,z, CL and 
Vd. 
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, min, median, max, coefficient of variation) will be calculated for these PK parameters as well as on concentrations -time profiles using SAS and 
Excel
®.

 S64315 plasma concentrations from the present study that could be pooled with data from 
previous studies will be analysed by popula tion approach, described in a separate Data Analysis 
Plan, in order to assess S64315 PK and to investigate potential sources of variability through a covariate analysis.  
10.6.2. PK/PD interpretation when applicable  
Any potential PK/PD relationships with activity, efficacy and safety will be investigated 
through an exploratory analysis, and if relevant, a PK/PD Data Analysis Plan will be set up. 
Description of analyses will be done in a separate PK/PD protocol. PK/PD relationship will be assessed for clinical and biological efficacy endpoints including: 
­ Clinical response according to (Cheson, 2003)  
­ Biological response: bonne marrow blast decrease 
­ Blood markers: WBC, neutrophils, platelets 
­ Any other clinically relevant endpoint 
PK/PD relationship will be assessed for clinical and biological safety endpoints including: 
­ Cardiac events following narrow and broad definition s as in section 8.2.5 
­ Plasma troponin I and troponin T 
­ Left ventricular ejection fraction  
­ Neutrophil count 
­ Hepatic safety parameters (i.e. AST, ALT)
 
­ Any other clinically relevant endpoint 
Assessment of the PK/PD re lationship for listed safety endpoints will be updated after each new 
cohort completion, when assessment of PK/PD relationship for efficacy will be performed at 
the end of dose escalation.  
PK and relevant biomarker data may also be analysed in a Quantitati ve Systems Pharmacology 
analysis, which will be described in a separate protocol.

12.4. Supervisory committees  
The DSMB will be composed of 3 members expert in haematology, 
gastroenterology/hepatology and cardiology. One of these experts will be the chairperson of 
this committee and his/her role is to coordinate, lead the DSMB meetings and  deliver the 
minutes of the meetings to the Sponsor.  
According to the protocol design, the DSMB will meet after the last patient of each cohort has 
completed Cycle 1 during the dose escalation phase I part and then every 3 months , according 
to the recruit ment rate , during the expansion phase II part. The eCRF should be completed for 
each patient on an ongoing basis and mandatorily after the last visit of Cycle 1. Extraordinary meetings may also occur during the conduct of the study in case of any event 
requiring the DSMB recommendations. The DSMB recommendations and meeting minutes 
will be shared immediately with all Investigators/sites.  The final recommendations from the 
DSMB will be made available before each EoC meeting during the dose escalation phase (see section  4.1.3.3).  
An initial or kick -off DSMB meeting will be performed before the study start to agree on the 
DSMB charter, which will define the quorum that must be in attendance for the validity of the 
meeting, the format and content of the data to be reviewed, the frequency and the modalities of the meetings (teleconferences, face- to-face meetings or email exchanges), the timelines and 
format of the minutes.  
The DSMB charter will provide extended details on the composition and the role and responsibilities of the DSMB, as well as the organization of the DSMB meetings. 
DSMB recommendations will be forwarded to the IRB/IEC / Competent Authorities on an 
expedited basis only if relevant for the safety of patients.

 13.3. Participant information and informed consent  
In any case, the patient (and/or his/her legal representative, when required) must be informed 
that he/she is entitled to be informed about the outcome of the study by the investigator. 
The investigator or a person designated by him/her is to collect written consent from each 
patient before his/her participation in the study. Prior to this, the investigator or his/her delegate must inform each patient of the objectives, benefits, risks and requirements imposed by the study, as well as the nature of the IMPs. 
The patient will be provided with an ICF in clear, simple language. He/she must be allowed 
ample time to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. 
Two original copies per ICF must be completed, dated and signed personally by the patient and 
by the person responsible for collecting the informed consent. The patient will be given one and the second will be kept by the investigator. 
If the patient is unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed 
consent discussion. The patient must give consent orally and, if capable of doing so, complete, sign and personally date the information and consent form. The witness must then complete, 
sign and date the form together with the person responsible for collecting the informed consent. A copy of the ICF in the language(s) of the country is given in the ‘Par ticipant information and 
consent form’ document attached to the protocol. 
13.4. Modification of the information and consent form 
Any change to the ICF constitutes an amendment to this document and must be submitted for 
approval to the IRB/IEC(s), and if applicable to the Competent Authorities.  
A copy of the new version of the ICF in the language(s) of the country will be given in the amendment to the ‘Participant Information and consent form’. 
Such amendments may only be implemented after written approval of the IRB/IEC has been 
obtained and compliance with the local regulatory requirements, with the exception of an amendment required eliminating an immediate risk to the study patients.  
Each patient affected by the amendment must complete, date and sign two original copies of the new version of the ICF together with the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. He/she will receive one signed original amendment to the ICF. 
14. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
14.1. Study data  
A 21 CFR Part 11- compliant electronic data capture system is going to be used for this study. 
An eCRF is designed to record the data required by the protocol and collected by the 
investigator. 
The eCRF will be produced by I.R.I.S. in compliance with its specifications. The investigator 
or a designated person from his/her team will be trained for the eCRF use by the sponsor . 
Data entry at the investigator’s site will be performed by the investigator or by the designated person from his/her team after completion of the patient’s Medical File . 
Upon entry, data will be transmitted via the Internet from the study centre to the study database.  
S64315   Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential     132/173 
 The investigator or the designated person from his/her team agrees to complete the eCRF, at 
each patient visit, and all other documents provided by the sponsor (e.g. documents relating to the IMP management, etc.).  
Data recorded directly in the eCRF and considered as source data (see section  4.5) must be 
collected immediately in the eCRF. The other eCRF forms must be completed as soon as possible following each visit. 
All corrections of data in the eCRF must be made by the investigato r or by the designated person 
from his/her team using electronic data clarifications according to the provided instructions. All 
data modification will be recorded using the audit trail feature of Inform® software, including date, reason for modification and identification of the person who has made the change. 
In order to ensure confidentiality and security of the data, usernames and passwords will be 
used to restrict system access to authorised personnel only, whether resident within the investigator’s sites, the sponsor or third parties. The investigator or co- investigator must attest 
the authenticity of the data collected in the eCRF by entering his/her username and password after the last visit of the patient and, as much as possible, either before starting a new level dose 
or at the time of yearly cut-off for DSUR (Development Safety Update Report). 
Data will be verified in accordance with the monitoring strategy defined for the study. After 
comparing these data to the source documents, the m onitor will request correction / clarification 
from the investigator using electronic data clarifications that should be answered and closed as quickly as possible. 
Data can be frozen during the study after their validation. However, the investigator has t he 
possibility to modify a data if deemed via a request to the sponsor. After the last visit of the patient, the investigator or co -investigator must attest the authenticity 
of the data collected in the eCRF by entering his/her username and password. After  the database lock, the investigator or an authorized member of his/her team will  have to 
download from the eCRF an electronic file containing patient data from his/her centre for 
archiving it in the study file (see section 14.3).  
14.2. Data management 
Data is collected via an eCRF and stored in a secured database.  
For data collected in the eCRF,  I.R.I.S. Clinical Data Management  is responsible for data 
processing including data validation performed according to a specification manual describing the checks to be carried out. As a result of data validation, data may require some changes. An electronic data clarification form is sent to the investigator who  is required to respond to the 
query and make any necessary changes to the data. 
For data transferred from dedicated providers (central reading ECG, central laboratory, PK, PD 
and PG analysis), I.R.I.S. Clinical Data Management  is responsible for data transfer: centralised 
laboratory, central reading centre provide electronic transfer of computerised data to I.R.I.S. Clinical Data Management. Data is transferred according to a transfer protocol issued by I.R.I.S. data manager.  
I.R.I.S. Medical Review Department  is responsible for data coding including: 
­ medical / surgical history, adverse events and procedures using MedDRA, 
­ medications using World Health Organization, Drug Dictionary (WHO-Drug). 
The coding process is described in a specification manual.

 The i nvestigator ascertains he/she will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under 
no circumstances should the investigator contact the sponsor or its representatives monitoring 
the study, if any, to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no deviations are permitted. If the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by the sponsor and approved by the IRB/IEC it cannot be implemented. All important protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR. 
When data validation is achieved, a review of the data is performed according to the sponsor 
standard operating procedure. When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the IMP codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis.  
14.3. Archiving  
The investigator will keep all information relevant to the study for at least 25  years after the 
end of the study, or more if specified by the local regulation. 
At the end of the study, the investigator or an authorized member of his/her team  will download 
an electronic copy of each patient’s data from the eCRF and should keep it in a reliable, secure 
and durable location. The file in cludes all data and comments reported in the eCRF, the history 
of all queries and signatures and the full audit trail reports.  
The file must include appropriate restrictions (password protection) and adequate protection 
from loss, physical damage or deterioration for the duration of the archiving period. 
15. INSURANCE

Preamble 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including  
research on identifiable human material and data.  
 The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all othe r relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles 
General Principles  
3. The De claration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing m edical 
care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve prevent ive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research i s subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.

 8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and i nterests of individual research subjects. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal an d regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. 
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential pre ventive, diagnostic 
or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured. 
Risk, Burdens and Benefits  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
 Medical research involving human subjects may only be  conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects. 
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predic  Adams risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research 
in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. 
Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher. 
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
 When the risks are found to outweigh the  potential benefits or when there is conclusive 
proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop the study.

 Vulnerable Groups and Individuals  
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and ma y have an increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection. 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsi ve to 
the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-
vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.  
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, pote ntial 
conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the  research 
is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. After the end of  the study, the researchers must submit a final 
report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information.

 Informed Consent  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical 
research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees. 
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study 
provisions and any other relevant aspects of  the study. The potential subject must be 
informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual pote ntial subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in 
writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek informed consent  from the legally authorised representative. These 
individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek i nformed consent from the legally 
authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative.

 31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversel y affect the patient -physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention 
is necessary to determine the efficacy or safet y of an intervention 
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, 
or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions 
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need a n intervention 
identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process. 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results 
35. Every research study involving human subje cts must be registered in a publicly accessible 
database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of researc h. Researchers have a 
duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the  principles of this Declaration should not 
be accepted for publication.

 Unproven Intervention in Clinical Practice  
In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or 
alleviating suffe ring. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

1. Dose escalation phase I part – ARM A: Operating characteristics of the  Bayesian 
Logistic R egression M odel ( BLRM ) 
1.1. BLRM details – prior specifications  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for all model parameters, which include the single -agent parameters for S64315 (α1, β1) and those for azacitidine (α2, 
β2), and the interaction parameter (η12). Derivation of these priors is provided in the following subsections. 
1.1.1. Prior for S64315 
The bivariate normal prior for the BLRM parameters ( α
1, β1) is based on clinical knowledge. 
1.1.1.1. Prior specification  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for the two model 
parameters: α and β. 
The same weakly informative prior as the one used in CL1 -64315- 001 study will be used and 
also data from CL1 -64315- 001 study will be used to enrich this same weakly informative prior 
(see section 1.1.1.2 for details ). 
The weakly -informative prior bivariate normal prior for the model BLRM para meters (log(α), 
log(β)) with a reference dose level of 1400mg is obtained as follows : 
­ The median DLT rate at the S64315 reference dose (1400 mg) was assumed to be 20%, i.e. 
mean (log(α1))=log(0.25) 
­ A doubling in dose was assumed to double odds of DLT, i.e.  mean (log(β))= 0 
­ The standard deviation of log (α) was set to 2, and the standard deviation of log(β) to 1, 
which allows for considerable prior uncertainty for the dose- toxicity profile  
­ The correlation between log(α) and log (β) was set to 0  
Table (1.1.1.1) 1 summarizes these p rior parameters . Table (1.1.1.1) 2 describes the prior 
obtained for S64315 agent. The effective sample size (ESS) calculated at each dose level is less 
than 2 patients (weakly- informative prior).

1.1.1.2. Integration of CL1-64315-001 study data as co- data  
Available clinical data from CL1 -64315- 001 study of the present study will be used to enrich 
the weakly informative prior used for S64315, in a downweighted fashion. The power prior 
obtained after integration of the CL1 -64315- 001 study data will be used as prior information 
for S64315. 
The CL1-64315-001 study data will be incorporated through down- weighting using the 
following weight “w” (Chen, 2006; Neuenschwander, 2010) : 
𝑤𝑤=  1
1+2𝑛𝑛𝜏𝜏2/𝜎𝜎2 
where n is the sample size of external data, σ is the “outcome standard deviation” for one  
observation and τ is the between -study standard deviation. While σ is the standard deviation 
of all external data which include several dose levels, 𝜎𝜎2 can be approximated by variance of 
log(α). For this dose -escalation, σ was then chosen as 2. The between -study standard 
deviation τ was set at 0.25 to correspond to a moderate between- trial variability, as a similar 
frequency of administration of S64315 is planned in the two studies. All once a week monotherapy data ( CL1-64315- 001 study) validated in an End of Cohort 
meeting at the time of assessment of a cohort from combination S64315 and a zacitidine will be 
considered to assess this cohort. For information, the once a week monotherapy data available as of 26 November 2019, date of 
the last EoC meeting, are presented in Table (1.1.1.2) 1. Of note, based on these data, the highest 
allowed dose of S64315 in monotherapy in the once a week escalation in monotherapy is 300 mg, the highest dose tested being 500 mg.

Note: none of the doses meet the overdose criterion (more than 25% chance of excessive toxicity) with the power prior 
information only.  
The starting dose of S64315 for the combination with az acitidine is 50  mg. This dose is indeed 
considered safe according to the power prior calculated (see Table (1.1.1.2) 3 above). 
1.1.2.  Prior for azacitidine 
The normal prior for the BLRM parameters (α 2, β2) of the dose -DLT relationship of azacitidine 
is defined as a weakly -informative prior. The information available on a zacitidine (e.g. SmPC) 
have been used to define the prior parameter alpha. As there is only one dose for a zacitidine, and 
as the reference dose is equal to this only dose, there is no estimation of β 2, then there is now 
only one parameter estimated for this agent. However, a prior has been defined anyway on β 2 
to keep the opportunity to add another dose of a zacitidine, if the matter  appears in the future.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    158/173  With a reference dose level of 75 mg/m2, the prior parameters are obtained as follows: 
­ The median DLT rate at the a zacitidine reference dose ( 75 mg/m2) was fixed such that the 
mean DLT rate at this dose , with the considered standard deviation, was equal to 8%, leading 
to a median DLT rate of 2.3, i.e. mean(log(α 2)) = log (0.023/0.977) (see prior distribution in 
Table (1.1.2) 2) 
­ A doubling in dose was assumed to double odds of DLT, i.e. mean(log(β 2)) = 0  
­ The standard deviation of log(α 2) was set to 2 which allows for strong prior uncertainty for 
the dose-toxicity profile of a zacitidine  
­ The correlation between log(α 2) and log(β 2) was set to 0

1.1.3. Prior for interaction parameter 
A normal prior distribution for the interaction parameter η 12 is derived to reflect the current  
uncertainty about the toxicity profile of the combination of S64315 and a zacitidine: 
• η12 is normally distributed and centred  on 0 (reflecting an assumption of no PK drug-
drug interaction a priori) 
• 97.5 th percentile of η 12 is selected such that there is a 2- fold increase in odds of DLT due 
to interaction compared to independence at the dose combination (50 mg of S64315, 75 
mg/m2 of azacitidine), allowing for enough uncertainty in case an interaction exists  
Consequently, the mean and standard deviation of the normal prior distribution for η 12 turn out 
to be 0 and 9.902 respectively. Table (1.1.3) 1 summarizes this prior parameter. Table (1.1.3) 2 shows the prior median and 
95% credible interval for the interaction term exp(η
12(d1/d1*)(d2/d2*)) = exp(η 12(d1/d1*) (as

1.2. Operating characteristics  
1.2.1. Introduction 
This section presents the operating characteristics illustrating the precision of the design in 
estimating the MTD under various assumed true dose- toxicity relationships.  
S64315  Amended Clinical study protocol no CL1- 64315 -004 - Final Version 
 
© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    161/173  1.2.3. Simulation parameters  
For each dose combination- DLT scenario, 5000 clinical trial replications were generated using 
R software vers ion 3.4.1 on a x86- 64 architecture on a Linux OS. The MCMC estimation is 
obtained using Rjags R package with 5000 burnin and 10000 iterations on 2 chains (5000 each), 
per scenario. Each clinical replication is numbered from SimulationNumber = 1 to 5000. The 
seed used for data generation is 1234*SimulationNumber and the seed used for MCMC estimation is 1 for chain 1 and 2 for chain 2. 
The following trial simulation parameters were used: 
­ Cohort size: 3 
­ Starting dose: 50 mg of S64315 combined to 75 mg/m
2 of azacitidine  
The dose allocation rule used in the simulations is the dose having the highest posterior 
probability of the DLT rate falling in the targeted interval [16%, 33%) among the admissible doses fulfilling EWOC (note that in practice any admissible dose fulfilling EWOC could be 
recommended).  
1.2.4. Evaluation metrics  
Operating characteristics were reviewed for the simulations to compare the relative performance of the design under each true dose -DLT relationship. The following metrics were:  
­ Probability of recommending as the MTD:  an undertoxic dose level combination, i.e. a dose combination with true probability of DLT in the under-dosing toxicity interval [0%, 16%) (sponsor risk) 
 a targeted dose l evel combination, i.e. a dose combination with true probability of DLT 
in the targeted toxicity interval [16%, 33%) (correct final decision) 
 an overtoxic dose level combination, i.e. a dose combination with true probability of DLT in the excessive toxicity  interval [33%, 100%] (patient risk) 
­ Average number of patients per trial exposed at: 
an undertoxic dose level combination, as defined above a targeted dose level combination, as defined above an overtoxic dose level combination, as defined above 
­ Summary of the total number of patients per trial (average, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile)  
­ Average total number of DLTs observed per trial 
1.2.5. Operating characteristics of the design  
Operating characteristics of the final design are reviewed to investigate performance of the 
model under each true dose -DLT scenario. Table (1.2.5) 1 summarises the results from the 
simulations performed according to the rules defined in section 1.2.3. Table (1.2.5) 2 details the 
selection probability of each dose combination in each scenario.

Overall, the BLRM with the specified prior is performing reasonably well in all pre -specified 
scenarios: the performance is good in scenario b and c (the most likely), with a high chance to 
select the right dose while minimizing the probability of overtoxi city, and correct in scenarii a, 
d and e, yet less likely. 
In scenario a, only the highest dose combination falls into the target interval and this dose is 
recommended 67% of the time. By looking more in detail at the probabilities of selection of each dos e combination in Table (1.2.5) 2, we can see that the dose combinations (200 mg of 
S64315, 75 mg/m
2 of azacitidine) – 12% true toxicity rate, and (100 mg of S64315, 75 mg of 
azacitidine) – 9% true toxicity rate, both close to the target interval, are often  recommended. 
The scenario a is unlikely as the data from the CL1 -64315- 001 study already collected are more 
toxic. The minimum number of patients that could trigger a stopping rule is also low (18) so that the escalation may stop before reaching the highest dose, even without seeing toxic data. In practice the stopping rule could be “ignored” in this situation, to pursue escalation.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    164/173  1.3.  Hypothetical dose allocation scenarios in early cohorts 
Aside from the overall operating characteristics studied above, the design should make 
reasonable decisions during a study based on the observed DLTs. After completion of a given cohort, the dose allocation for the subsequent cohort will depend on the recommendation of the model and medical review of all available data.  
Some scenarios to illustrate on -study dose allocation are presented in Table (1.3)  1. These 
scenarios assume that the first cohort will include 5 patients and then each cohort has 3 valuabl e 
patients and the next recommended dose is based on the dose escalation rules defined in section  1.2.3. However, during the study, it may be possible to include 3 to 6  patients by cohort 
and to add new provisional dose levels.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    166/173  Overall,  the dose recommendation leads to decisions that are in agreement with clinical sense. 
In general, when no DLTs are observed on 3 patients in a dose level, the decision is to increase 
the dose combination. When 1 DLT is observed on 3 patients in a dose level combination, the decision is to stay at the current dose level combination. When more than 1 DLT is observed on 3 patients in a dose level, the decision is to decrease the dose level. 
2. Expansion phase  II part  
2.1. Introduction Once the RP2D (MTD or su itable lower dose) has been determined, new patients will be 
enrolled in a two- stage expansion phase II part in three sub- arms A1  and A2. A Bayesian 
interim analysis for futility will be performed at the end of the first stage in each sub -arm. The 
followin g methodology will be applied for each the three sub- arms.  
During stage 1, the patients will be enrolled and treated at the corresponding RP2D (identified 
during the dose escalation phase I  part). One interim analysis for futility will occur when:  
­  All patients included in stage 1 have completed at least four cycles or early discontinued 
­ The CR s reached during this time must be confirmed 
Then, Bayesian analysis will be performed on CR r ate. Decision rules will be based on clinical 
threshold defined on the posterior distribution of CR r ate (see section 2.3 determination of 
sample size for details).  
According to results of futility interim analysis performed at the end of stage 1, the expansion 
phase II part could be: 
­ Stopped, if results on CR rate  are considered futile 
­ Continued if results on CR rate  are considered not futile. In that case, one additional cohort 
of patients will be enrolled in stage 2 and treated at the corresponding RP2D 
2.2. Methodology 
2.2.1.  Bayesian approach The observed response is a binary variable, either a success or failure outcome from the 
administered treatment. With n being the number of observed patients, the number of observed responses s, is a binomial variable (n, π), where π is the probability of response. 
Let π, a random variable with the prior distribution Beta(a,b) where a and b>0. The values of a 
and b are fixed at the beginning of the trial (see 2.2.3 Prior specification for details). The mean 
and the variance of the Beta(a,b) distribution are given by E(π )=a/(a+b) and 
Var(π)=ab/((a+b)²(a+b+1)).  
After n patients are included into the trial, the posterior distribution of the probability of response, is given by Beta(a+s,b+n- s), with its mean defined by E(π)=(a+s)/(a+b+n).  (25 mg – 75 
mg/m2)) 
Note: Decision for each agent, E = Escalate, S = Stay, D = Deescalate  
P(Target) NDL: Posterior probability that the true DLT rate for the next recommended dose lies in the 
targeted interval [16%, 33%)  
P(Overtox) NDL: Posterior probability that the true DL T rate for the next recommended dose lies in the 
excessive toxicity interval [33%, 100%]

Stop for futili ty if there is a high probability that the estimated response rate is lower than a 
minimal response rate threshold.  
That is, P(π ≤ RL|data)>τ  where RL is a minimal response rate threshold, fixed before the 
beginning of the trial by clinical development te am. 
τ is chosen to be enough restrictive for further stop if flagrant futility is observed, but not too 
much to allow the possibility for activity analysis at study end, by including more patients in 
stage 2.  
2.2.3. Prior specification  
In a Bayesian framework, a prior distribution needs to be defined. In this situation, we choose 
a Jeffreys prior, a non-informative prior distribution, e. g. a=0.5 and b=0.5. 
2.3. Operating characteristics  
2.3.1. Clinical and Statistical assumptions  
According to the information given by the clinical development team, the response rate is 
partitioned as follows: 
• [0%; RL%): No activity on CR rate– results are considered futile 
• [RL%; 100%]: improvement on CR rate – results are not considered futile - one additi onal 
cohort of patients will be enrolled in stage 2 The thresholds 
RL have been defined from literature and given the current information, will be 
the same for the three sub -arms:  
Table (2.3.1) 1 - Choice of response rate threshold RL  
Threshold RL References  
20% (Schuh, 2017)  
The susmentionned threshold might evolve given the information available before the start of 
phase II part, independently for sub- arms A1  and A2, based on more recent published data if 
available. In a Bayesian framework, threshold needs to be defined on the posterior distribution, as 
previously explained for the dose -escalation part appendix. In our case, it is defined  as the 
minimum probability to observe less than the fixed threshold CR rate. In our case, if the 
probability of observing CR rate <
 RL% is over the threshold of 60% (P( CR rate <  RL %) > 
60%), we will declare results as futile.  
2.3.2. Simulations parameters  
5000 clinical trials under several scenarios were generated using R software version 3.4.1 on a x86-64 architecture on a Linux OS. Several scenarios will be investigated in order to perform 
a sensitivity analysis on the number of patients to enhance the performance of the model.

2.3.3.1. Probability to stop for futility according to t rue response rate  
Results of 5000 clinical trials with a true response rate RL were simulated assuming a binomial 
distribution with parameters ( 𝑛𝑛1, RL) with 𝑛𝑛1 corresponding to the number of patients in stage  1. 
For each clinical trial, the posterior probability of true response rate < RL is compared to the 
threshold of 20%. Then, among the 5000 simulations, the probability to stop for futility at 
interim analys is (i.e. the probability that the posterior probability of true response rate < RL is 
over 60%) is calculated . Results are presented in table below for different value of 𝑛𝑛1.

A minimal number of 23 patients have been fixed to ensure enough evidence for futility analysis in a Bayesian framework with a vague prior. 
For clinical trials simulated with true response rate equal to 
RL, the probability to stop for futility 
at interim is maximized  with 𝑛𝑛 1= 23 patients in stage 1. These probabilities are equal to 50%. 
Thus, considering 𝑛𝑛 1= 23 patients in stage 1 allows to obtain good operating characteristics for 
a futility analysis.  
The same calculations as above were performed for clinical trials simulated with different true 
response rate (from 0% to 100%). Results are presented below for 𝑛𝑛1= 23 patients for stage 1.

© I.R.I.S - 14 October 2022 - Confidential    169/173  According to graphic representations, with 𝑛𝑛 1=23 patients enrolled in stage 1, the probability 
to stop for futility at interim rapidly decreases for true response rate above the threshold RL., 
with a slope of - 4.7 at RL. Moreover, probability to stop for futility at interim analysis is less 
than 14% f or true response rate equal to RL + 10%.

6 (26.1%)  0.2708 [0.1361; 0.4277]  0.2253  0.7747  
The futility decision will be overpassed if we observe at least 5 responders out of 23 patients 
during stage 1. In that case (5 responders/23 patients), the posterior probability for true response rate to be ≥20% is equal to 60%  which provides enough evidence for non- futility of the d  in the 
context of interim analysis.  
Thus, according to all analyses presented above, with n 
1 = 23 patients in stage 1, the operating 
characteristics of the design are conside red sufficient and do not justify a further increase in the 
sample size for stage 1.  
2.3.4. Operating characteristics of the design for stage 2  
In case
 of no futility decision at interim analysis, one additional cohort of patients will be 
enrolled in stage  2 and treated at the corresponding RP2D . In the following sections, the 
operating characteristics of the design will be checked in case of enrolment of 27 additional 
patients in stage 2 ( 𝒏𝒏𝟏𝟏 = 27), giving an overall sample size of n= 𝒏𝒏𝟏𝟏+𝒏𝒏𝟏𝟏 = 50 patients for the 
expansion phase II part . 
2.3.4.1. Operat
ing characteristics according to true response rate  
The same simulation analyses as the ones performed for stage 1 have been done. 
Results of 5000 clinical trials with a true response rate RL (same as stage 1) were simulated 
assuming a binomial distribution of parameters ( n, RL), with 𝒏𝒏 =𝟓𝟓𝟓𝟓, corresponding to the 
overall number of patients of expansion phase II part, e.g. first 23 patients included at stage 1 
and then 27 more.  The posterior probability of true response rate > RL is compared to different 
thresholds (70%, 80%), for the overall number of subject 50. Then, among the 5000 simulations, the probability that the posterior probability of true response rate > 
RL is over the 
threshold is calculated, with RL=20% . Results are presented in table below .

Considering a threshold of 70% (respectively 80%), there is 25% probability (respectively 17% 
probability) that the posterior probability of true response rate be greater than RL, for clinical 
trials simulated with a true response rate equal to the futility boundary RL.  
Same calculations were performed for clinical trials simulated with different true response rates (from 0% to 100%). Results are presented below for n=50 patients and for 70% boundary. 
Figure (2.3.4) 1 - Probability for P(CR rate > RL) > 70% at study end according to the true CR rate 
 
According to graphic representations, with 𝑛𝑛 =50 patients for the expansion phase II part, the 
chance that the posterior probability of true response rate be greater than RL, rapidly increases 
for true r esponse rate above the threshold RL: these probabilities reach 80% for true response 
rate equal to RL + 10%. 
According to these results, we consider that 50 patients for expansion phase II part provide enough evidence for activity. 
2.3.4.2 Justification based on p recision of the estimate 
Moreover, the length of the credibility interval has also been checked with 50 patients included 
for the expansion phase II part per sub -arm. 
50 patients enrolled in the expansion phase II  part per sub- arm ensure a maximal length of the 
90% credibility interval on the posterior distribution (i.e. a minimal precision) of 23% around the estimated response rate at each sub -arms end.  
2.3.4.3. Conclusion for overall number of patients in expansion phase II part  
Thus, according to all analyses presented above, n = 50 patients for each sub -arm of the 
expansion phase II part allow to have sufficient operating characteristics of the design for activity assessment, so N=150 overall for the expansion phase II part.

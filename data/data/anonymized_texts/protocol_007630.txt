hospitalization.  
Note: Planned hospitalization for a 
preexisting condition, or a procedure 
required by the CIP , without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered 
a serious adverse event. In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the 
individual remained at the hospital or 
emergency ward for observation and/or 
treatment (usually involving an overnight 
stay) that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or an 
out-patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospitalization are adverse 
events. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other 
serious criteria, the event is se rious. 
When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalization ” occurred, the event 
should be considered serious.  
d. a medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
a) or b).  
e. any indirect harm as a consequence of 
incorrect diagnostic test results when used

reported that almost 32% of soft contact lenses were prescribed in a daily disposable 
modality. PRECISION1 is a new daily disposable silicone hydrogel conta ct lens with a 
material that combines high oxygen transmissibility with a low modulus of elasticity.  
PRECISION1 contact lenses are intended for the optical correction of refractive ametropia in 
persons with nondiseased eyes requiring subjects to wear spect acles for vision correction. 
The unique properties of PRECISION1 contact lenses provide precise vision, long lasting 
comfort and excellent  handling.  
5.2 Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall clinical performance of PRECISION 1 
contact lenses when compared to another commercially available daily disposable contact 
lens, Clariti 1 -Day.

Alcon – Business Use Only  5.3 Risks and Benefits  
Contact lenses may offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not wearing 
spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics of the contact lens in development 
are fe atures consistent with successful contact lens wear.  
PRECISION1 and Clariti 1 -Day contact lenses are for daily wear use under a daily 
disposable wear modality; further details on any known potential risks and benefits can be 
found in the package insert.  
PRECISION1 and Clariti 1 -Day contact lenses are not intended for use with a 
cleaning/disinfecting solution, and the biocompatibility with lens care solutions and any 
associated clinical effects are unknown.  
A summary of the known potential risks and benef its associated with PRECISION1 can be 
found in the package insert. Risks are minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria 
and study procedures, and through close supervision by a licensed clinician during exposure 
to the study lenses.  
The site pe rsonnel will educate subjects on proper hygiene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be instructed not to 
wear contact lenses while sleeping or swimming. The site personnel will also ad vise the 
subjects to remove contact lenses and return for prompt follow -up of symptoms, such as 
ocular discomfort, foreign body sensation, excessive tearing, vision changes, or hyperemia.  
There may also be unknown risks to use of these study contact lense s. Any risk to subjects in 
this clinical study will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study 
procedures, clinical oversight and monitoring .

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1  Study Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double -masked bilateral crossover, daily wear, 
multi -center clinical study. Habitual soft contact lens wearers will be randomized in 1 of the 
2 crossover sequences. Subjects and investigators will be masked. An unmasked study staff 
member will prepare the contact lenses for dispensing.  
Subjects will be expected to attend 3 visits : Screening/Baseline/Dispense Lens 1, Week 1 
Follow -up Lens 1, Week 1 Follow -up Lens 2/Exit. The total duration of a subject’s 
participation in the study will be up to 22 days . Subjects will be expected to wear their study 
contact lenses daily for at least 10  hours per day.  
On the day prior to visits 2 and 3 , subjects will be instructed  to wear the study lenses at least 
16 hours.

Adaptations  
An interim analysis will not be performed.  
7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/ Follow -Up 
Subjects will wear each study product bilaterally for approximately 1 week. The lenses will 
be provided by a qualified unmasked study staff member in such a manner that the subject 
and the investigator  remain masked to the lens type. The primary  variable  
will be assessed on approximately after 1 week of wearing each study product  
 
 
7.4 Rationale for Choice of C ontrol Product  
Clariti 1 -Day contact lenses were chosen as the control product because these lenses have the 
same  wear modality and replacement schedule.

11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the investigator  should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions  shown 
below and report as applicable : 
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take si nce your last study visit? ” 
In addition, c hanges  in any protocol -specific parameters  and/or questionnaires  evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by the investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the investigator , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected fr om the time of informed consent. Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
 
 
  
For ea ch recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator  must document all device deficiencies reporte d or 
observed with test and control product s on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must submit

12.4.1  Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)  
The primary objective of this study is to demonst rate noninferiority in distance VA when 
wearing PRECISION1 contact lenses compared to Clariti 1-Day contact lenses. The primary 
endpoint is distance VA with study lenses, collected for each eye in logMAR . 
12.4.1.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and alternative hyp otheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority:  
H0: µ(T) – µ(C) ≥ 0.05  
Ha: µ(T) – µ(C) < 0.05  
where µ (T) and µ (C) denote the mean distance VA for PRECISION1  and Clariti  1-Day, 
respectively, on the logMAR scale.  
12.4.1.2  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effect repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by visit interaction, period, and sequence. Within -
subject correlation due to eye and the crossover design  will also be accounted for in the 
model. Lens difference (PRECISION1 minus Clariti 1 -Day) and the corresponding one -sided 
95% upper confidence limit will be computed. Noninferiority in distance V A will be declared 
if upper confidence limit is less than 0. 05.

All data obtained in evaluable subjects/eyes will be included in the analysis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out for the primary and key exploratory effectiveness 
analyses.  
12.6 Safety Analys es 
The safety endpoin ts are:  
• AEs  
• Biomicroscopy findings  
• Device Deficiencies  
 
There are no safety hypotheses planned in this study. The focus of the safety analysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters.  
All AEs occurring  from the time a subject signs informed consent to study exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (frequencies and percentages) for 
ocular and nonocular AEs will be presented by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities

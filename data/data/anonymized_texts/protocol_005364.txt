Exclusion criteria:  
1. Diagnosis with a coagulation disorder other than Haemophilia  A 
2. Severe liver or kidney disease (alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate 
transaminase (AST) levels >5 times of upper limit of normal, creatinine >120

Test Product, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
Human -cl rhFVIII is a purified B -domain deleted FVIII glycoprotein that is synthesised  by 
a genetically  engineered human embryonic  kidney cell line (HEK  293F). Human -cl rhFVIII 
will be provided in single  use vials  containing  a nominal  potency of 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 
International Units (IU) each of freeze -dried recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) concentrate to be 
reconstituted in 2.5 mL of water for injection. Full vials are to be injected, preferably -  
except for recovery investigations.  
Human -cl rhFVIII should be used for intravenous injection only (maximally 4 mL/minute).  
Dose:  
Prophylactic treatment is recommended, but finally, it is the decision of the responsible 
treating physician whether patients will be treated prophylactically or on -demand. Patients 
may switch f rom on- demand to prophylactic treatment, or from prophylactic to  on-demand 
treatment during the course of the  study. 
Prophylactic treatment:  
Patients will be treated prophylactically with a recommended dose of 20- 50 IU FVIII/kg 
body weight (BW).  
Starting prophylaxis with the first bleeding episode (BE) is highly recommended.  
The frequency of treatment will depend on the patient’s clinical situation. For example, 
prophylaxis may be initiated with every other day injections (in order to keep the FVI II 
trough level >1%), or with once weekly injections, followed by twice and three times 
weekly, and every other day treatment. In cases of inadequate response, Human -cl rhFVIII 
administration  frequency or dose adjustments can be considered at Investigator’s  discretion. 
On-demand treatment:  
In case of any bleed, the patients can be treated on -demand. The dosage and duration of 
treatment of spontaneous or traumatic bleeds depend on the location and the extent of 
bleeding as well as on the clinical situation o f the patient. Dosage recommendations are 
given as follows:  
• Minor  haemorrhage:  20-30 IU FVIII/kg  BW to achieve  an intended target  peak  level 
of about 40% to 60%. Repeat dose every 8- 24 hours until BE is  resolved.  
• Moderate to major haemorrhage: 30- 40 IU FVI II/kg BW to achieve an intended 
target peak  level  of about  60% to 80%. Repeat  dose every  6-24 hours  until BE is 
resolved.

• Major to life -threatening haemorrhage: initial dose of 40 -60 IU FVIII/kg BW to 
achieve an intended target peak level of 100% to 120%. Repeat dose of 20- 50 IU 
FVIII/kg BW every 6 -12 hours until BE is  resolved.  
Surgical prophylaxis : 
The dosage and duration of treatment with Human- cl rhFVIII will depend on the type of 
surgery and the patient’s individual incremental recovery. Dosage recommendations are 
given as follows:  
• Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25 -30 IU FVIII/kg BW starting within 
3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of >30%. Repeat 
one dose every  12-24 hours  if needed.  Trough levels  should be maintained  at ≥ 30%.  
• Major surgeries: 40 -60 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve 
an intended target peak  level  of approximately  100%. Repeat  if necessary  after 6-12 
hours initially and for at least 6 to 14 days until healing is complete and recurrence 
to regular prophylactic treatment is possible. Trough levels should be maintained at 
> 50%.  
Recovery investigation (optional) : 
Patients  will receive  40 IU FVIII/kg  BW for in vivo recovery  evaluation. Blood samples are 
taken at baseline, 15 minutes and 1 hour after the IMP  administration.  
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) (if applicable):  
Patients who develop a clinically significant and non- transient inhibitor will be offered to 
start ITI with the Investigational Med ical Product (IMP).  
The modified Bonn Protocol for inhibitor elimination is recommended:  
• Low responders (<5 Bethesda Units [BU]) should receive 50 -100 IU FVIII/kg BW 
daily  or every  second  day. In case the inhibitor  increases  to 5 BU or more,  the patient 
should switch to the high responder regimen.  
• High responders ( ≥5 BU) should receive 100 -150 IU FVIII/kg BW every 12 hours. 
Once the inhibitor is eliminated (<0.6 BU), the FVIII recovery is ≥ 66% of normal, and the 
half-life of FVIII is at least 6 hours, a continuous reduction of about 10% of the initial ITI 
dosage  shou ld be initiated,  until the patient  has reached  a prophylactic  treatment regimen  of 
30-50 IU FVIII/kg BW every other  day. 
Any other ITI approach is possible.  
All treatment details, including the needs of bypassing agents, and the further development 
of the inhibitor titre need to be documented.  
Batch Number(s):  
Several batches of Human -cl rhFVIII will be used.  
Duration of Treatment:  
The patients  should stay in the study for 100 exposure  days (EDs)  and for a maximum period 
of 5 years from  screening.  
In patients who develop FVIII inhibitors  and start ITI treatment,  the maximum length of ITI 
will be 36  months.

Study Outcome Parameters (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):  
Primary endpoint  
Immunogenicity:  
Inhibitor activity will be determined by the modified Bethesda assay (Nijmegen 
modification), using congenital FVIII -deficient human plasma spiked with Human- cl 
rhFVIII at the following time points:  
• At baseline (Screening  Visit)  
• Every 3- 4 EDs until ED  20 
• Every  10-12 EDs or every  3 months  ± 2 weeks,  (whichever  comes  first)  from  ED 20 
to ED  100 
• At study completion  
• Any time in the case of a suspicion of inhibitor  development.  
In case of a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor re -testing using a second separ ately drawn 
sample should be performed.  
 
Secondary endpoints  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy of prophylactic treatment: The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the prophylactic 
treatment will be assessed based on the frequency of spontaneous break -through bleeds 
under  prophylactic  treatment.  The dates and times  of study drug infusions,  details of dose(s) 
and product  batch  numbers  used for the prophylactic  treatment will be documented. Details 
of any BEs occurring under prophylactic treatment will be documented. Study drug 
consumption data (FVIII IU/kg per month, per year) per patient and in total will be 
evaluated.  
Efficacy  of treatment  of bleeds:  The efficacy  of Human -cl rhFVIII  in the treatment of bleeds 
will be assessed  based  on an objective  haemostatic  efficacy  scale.  Details  of the bleed  (type, 
site and severity of the bleed, and the start and end date and time of the bleed), the amount 
of Human -cl rhFVIII needed and the number of injections necessary to stop the bleed will 
be documented.  
Efficacy  of surgical  prophylaxis : The efficacy  of Human -cl rhFVIII  in surgical  prophylaxis 
will be assessed based  on: 
• Overall efficacy assessment (taking the intra - and post -operative assessment into 
account)  after the end of the surgical  prophylactic  treatment phase,  done  together  by 
the surgeon and the  haematologist.  
• Average and maximum expected estimated blood loss com pared to the actual 
estimated blood loss. 
In addition, the location, severity, and type of surgery will be documented. Expected and 
actual duration of surgical procedure and details of administered dose(s) of Human -cl 
rhFVIII (pre-, intra - and/or post -operatively) will be recorded. FVIII plasma levels (pre -,

intra-, and post -operatively) will be measured. Details of concomitantly administered 
products (except standard anaesthesia) along with a brief narrative describing the outco me 
of the intervention will be recorded.  
Safety:  
Vital signs : Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature will be 
assessed at screening, 3 -monthly and at study completion. In case IMP is injected at study 
site during these visits, one  pre- and one post -treatment control is obligatory.  
Safety laboratory parameters: The following routine safety laboratory parameters will be 
tested at screening, and at 3 -monthly ( ± 2 weeks) control visits: haematological parameters 
(red blood cell count, white  blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit,  platelet  count)  and 
clinical che mistry (ALT, AST, serum creatinine). Samples are analysed in the local 
laboratory.  
Tolerability: The occurrence of any adverse event (AE) will be monitored throughout the 
study.  
 
Additional analyses  
Recovery investigation (optional): A recovery investigati on is recommended to be 
performed. This can be done with the first Human -cl rhFVIII administration, or within the 
first three  months  after treatment  start with Human -cl rhFVIII , in any case in a non-bleeding 
patient.  A dose of 40 IU FVIII/kg  BW will be administered  and the in vivo recovery will be 
calculated from the FVIII levels before infusion and the peak level obtained from the 15 
min and 1 hour post -infusion samples. Recovery investigations are recommended to be 
repeated approximately every 6 months . 
FVIII gene mutation analysis (mandatory) . 
Immunogenotyping (optional): HLA -typing, immune response gene profiling and FVIII 
ethnic haplotype. Immunogenotyping will be performed in order to investigate genetic 
factors that might influence / predict development of FVIII inhibitors. Blood samples 
(EDTA) required for this analysis can be obtained at any time during the study.  
RNA  expression  analysis  (optional):  RNA  expression  analysis  will optionally be performed 
in order to provide an understanding of the transcript activity of the genes involved in 
immune responses that may be responsible for FVIII inhibitor formation in patients 
receiving exogenou s FVIII. RNA expression analysis will also be optionally performed on 
patients undergoing ITI to provide information on the transcript activity of genes involved 
in immune  tolerance.  The analysis will be carried  out using a customised  PAXgene  protocol 
in which RNA samples will be obtained by using commercially available PAXgene RNA 
blood collection tubes and centrally created customised microfuge  tubes.  
In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products (optional): Immunogenicity of Human -cl 
rhFVIII will optionally be assessed by culturing peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMC) 
(including a positive  control)  with Human -cl rhFVIII . The nature  of T cell response  will be 
assessed by analysing cytokine expression (measured in a multiplex format) and T cell 
proliferation.

Epitope mapping (optional): Epitope mapping is optionally performed in patients who 
developed an inhibitor against FVIII and started an ITI.  
In addition to these, samples available from patients who later on developed an inhibitor 
and started  ITI, and from  an inhibitor negative  control  group will be tested:  already  available 
plasma samples from ~20 PUPs included into the study in Ukraine and Moldova, which 
were drawn prior to the first exposure to FVIII are planned to be analysed in retrospect.  
Additional health economic parameters: the resource use of patients treat ed with Human - 
cl rhFVIII  is examined  – and, if the size of the subgroups  allows,  the resource use of patients 
treated prophylactically or on -demand. In case patients develop an inhibitor, the resource 
use is examined in this subgroup. Parents will be asked  to fill out a short  “Additional  Health 
Economic Evaluation” questionnaire on a quarterly basis starting from the Screening visit,  
which asks about their time commitments, and productivity loss.  
Summary of Study Procedures and Statistical Analysis Pl an: 
Study Procedures:  
All administrations of Human- cl rhFVIII , the occurrence of bleeds, the occurrence of AEs 
and the administration of concomitant medication during the entire study period will be 
thoroughly documented to assess the exposure to FVIII, th e efficacy in the prevention of 
and the treatment of bleeds, and the overall safety and tolerability.  
Screening Visit : 
Patients’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be informed about the study details and will be 
required to give their written informed consent before any investigations and assessments 
can be performed. The following will be documented/assessed:

The Investigator will hand out the patient diary and instruct the patient/legal guardian how 
to document details of treatment with Human -cl rhFVIII , bleeds, AEs and concomitant 
medication.  The patient/legal  guardian will receive a sufficient  amount  of the study product 
for home  treatment (in cooling boxes, if appropriate)  and will be instructed  on how to store 
and administer it. Details of home treatment (parents’ home treatment training, the 
involvement of the general practitioner or a study nurse is  documented).  
Follow -Up Visits (every 3 -4 EDs until ED 20):  
The patients  will visit the study site every  3-4 EDs until 20 EDs have  been  reached.  At these 
visits, patients’ body weight will be checked, and blood samples will be obtained for  FVIII 
inhibitor  screen  and optionally  RNA expression analysis  (after  a wash -out period of at least 
2, preferably 3 days after the previous IMP administration). IMP injection is possible after 
blood sampling. 
At these visits,  the patient  diary  will be reviewed  (any IMP injection, any bleed)  in order  to 
transfer data into the Case Report Form (CRF). The occurrence of AEs and changes in 
concomitant medication will be checked and documented.  
Follow -Up Visits (every 10- 12 EDs):  
After ED 20 has been  reached  and until 100 EDs,  patients  will visit the study site every  10- 
12 EDs. At these visits, patients’ body weight will be checked, and blood samples will be 
obtained for FVIII inhibitor screen (after a wash -out period of at least 2, but preferably     
3 days after the previous IMP administration). IMP injec tion is possible after blood 
sampling. The patient diary will be reviewed (any IMP injection, any bleed) in order to 
transfer data into the CRF. The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant medication 
will be checked and  documented.  
3-Monthly ( ± 2 week s) Follow -Up Visits (calculated from Screening Visit):  
If appropriate, the above described follow -up visits may be combined with the regular 
quarterly (every 3 -months ( ± 2 weeks)) Follow -Up visits, where some additional 
investigations  will be performed:  the safety  laboratory  parameters will be assessed  and – in 
case IMP is injected after blood sampling –  vital signs will be measured pre - and 30- 60 
minutes  post-injection.  
At these visits, patients’ body weight will be checked, and blood samples will be obtained 
for FVIII inhibitor screen (after a wash -out period of at least 2, but preferably 3 days after 
the previous IMP administration). The patient diary will be reviewed ( any IMP injection, 
any bleed) in order to transfer data into the CRF. The occurrence of AEs and changes in 
concomitant  medication  will be checked  and documented. The Additional  Health  Economic 
Evaluation will be completed by the parents/legal  guardians.  
Once every 6 months a physical examination is performed.  
If the optional in vivo recovery investigation is done, it is recommended with the first 
Human -cl rhFVIII  administration,  or within  the first three  months  after treatment start with 
Human -cl rhFVIII, i n any case in a non- bleeding patient. Controls approximately once 
every 6 months are recommended. Recovery visits should be timed so that they coincide 
with other study visits whenever possible. The in vivo recovery will be calculated from  the

FVIII plasma levels before infusion and the peak level obtained from the 15 minutes and 1 
hour post -infusion samples.  
In case the patient did not require any IMP from screening until the 3 -Monthly Follow -Up 
visits durin g the first year, the blood sampling (inhibitor screen, safely laboratory) after 3 
and 9 months is optional. After 6 and 12 months a sample is mandatory.  
ITI Patient Follow -Up: 
Patients who develop an -  non-transient - inhibitor and do not agree to start an ITI will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Patients developing an inhibitor and starting ITI will be closely monitored, once their 
parents / legal guardians have been informed abou t the ITI treatment details and gave their 
written consent before ITI initiation. Depending on the development of the inhibitor: a bi - 
weekly (later on monthly to 3- monthly) inhibitor titre testing is considered appropriate.  
Optional epitope mapping can be  performed once the inhibitor is detected.  
Optional RNA expression analysis can be performed alongside the inhibitor testing at 
initiation  of ITI, 2 and 4 weeks after ITI initiation,  and then on a monthly  basis until month  
6. This may give information  on motifs  predicting  success that should be evident  in the first 
6 months and give mechanistic information on immune -tolerance.  
Once  the inhibitor is eliminated,  a normalised  recovery  and half-life are expected  during  the 
continued ITI. Patient  observation including testing visits is recommended according to 
progress of the ITI. Samples to test the recovery are recommended to be drawn at baseline 
and 15 minutes post -injection. For the half -life evaluation, the following sampling time 
points are recommended: baseline, 15 minutes, 3, 6, 9, 12, (24) hours  post-injection.  
Patients  will complete  study participation  after a complete  success of the ITI (inhibitor- free, 
normalised recovery and half -life), or after a maximum ITI period of 36  months.  
Surgical Visits:  
Study subjects may undergo surgical interventions during the course of the study. 
Depending on the type of surgery, subjects may be hospitalis ed or not (in case of certain 
minor surgeries with low risk of post- operative bleeding) at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Details of surgery, Human -cl rhFVIII dosing, expected and actual blood loss, 
concomitant treatment (including need for additional  blood transfusions), and lab 
investigations will be documented, as well as details of hospitalisation (start and end date, 
regular ward, intensive care unit stay).  
Completion Visit:  
For each patient, the study is completed once 100 EDs have been reached, or after a 
maximum of 5 years’ study participation - from screening.  
Patients  undergoing an ITI complete  the study  after a successful  elimination  of the inhibitor, 
but after a maximum ITI period of 36  months.  
At these visits, patients’ body weight will be checked, and blood samples will be obtained 
for FVIII inhibitor screen (after a wash -out period of at least 2, preferably 3 days after the 
previous IMP administration) and the safety panel. Vital signs will be  checked and a 
physical examination will be performed. The occurrence of AEs and changes in 
concomitant medication will be checked and documented.

Statistical Analysis:  
No inferential analysis involving formal testing is planned in this non- controlled trial. The 
sample size is determined by a CHMP guideline. Consequently, no formal sample size 
estimation is performed.  
The statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be descriptive.  
An interim analysis is planned to be conducted after 50 patients have achieved at least 50

1 INTRODUCTION  
Haemophilia A is an inherited gender -related coagulation disorder in which affected males do 
not produce functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in sufficient quantities to achieve 
satisfactory haemostasis. Therefore, patients suffer from b leeding diathesis. Most bleeding 
episodes (BEs) occur in joints and muscles. Without adequate treatment these repeated haemarthroses  and haematoma lead to long- term sequelae with severe disability. Other  bleeding 
sites, although less frequent but more severe, are the central nervous system, the urinary or 
gastrointestinal tract,  eyes and the retro -peritoneum.  Hence,  affected  patients  are at high risk to 
develop major  and life-threatening bleeds after surgi cal procedures, even  after minor  ones such 
as tooth extraction.  
The optimal effective treatment of the disorder is the replacement of FVIII by using FVIII 
concentrate  either obtained by fractionation  of human  plasma  or manufactured  by recombinant 
DNA techn ology. However, the occurrence of inhibitory antibodies against the infused FVIII 
is a major clinical complication in the treatment of Haemophilia A. It is not known whether recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products carry an enhanced immunogenic risk and whether  there 
are differences between rFVIII products in their relative immunogenicity  (1). 
All commercially available recombinant rFVIII concentrates are exclusively produced in 
hamster cells, either in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (e.g. Kogenate FS) or in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells (e.g. Advate, ReFacto). The intrinsic immunogenicity of current rFVIII products may be increased due to incorporation of non -human glycan structures during 
post-translational protein processing in mammalian cell lines.  
Human -cl rhFVIII is a B -domain deleted rhFVIII expressed in genetically modified human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. Using a human cell line for the expression of rFVIII ensures that non- human immunogenic epitopes are absent, in contrast to rFVIII expressed in 
hamster cells. For example, N -glycolylneuraminic acid, which is reported to be antigenic in 
man (2) and present  in recombinant  glycoproteins  expressed  by CHO cells (3), was not detected 
in Human -cl rhFVIII. Furthermore, the antigenic carbohydrate epitope Galα1,3Gal, which has 
been reported to be present in recombinant proteins such as full -length FVIII from BHK cells 
(4), is not present in Human -cl rhFVIII either. The use of a human cell -line for the expres sion 
of rFVIII is expected to provide a more genuine human glycosylation pattern than achieved with murine cell -lines. This may result in an improved function and reduced immunogenicity 
of the rFVIII expressed from human cell-lines.  
Clinical data on effica cy and safety of Human -cl rhFVIII in the targeted indications in 
previously treated patients (PTPs) are available. Since paediatric patients may respond differently to FVIII treatments than adults, European Medicines Agency (EMA) CHMP guidelines (5) specif y that paediatric studies should be conducted within the clinical 
investigation program  of FVIII  products. Moreover,  the clinical  development  strategy  for FVIII 
products in paediatric patients should follow a stepwise approach, in order to gain experience in older patients before investigations are initiated in younger patients. Study GENA -03 was 
assessing efficacy, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic profiles and safety of Human -cl rhFVIII 
in paediatric  patients  between  2 and 12 years.  With  the availability  of 6 months’  treatment  data 
from more than 20 previously treated children, and with having finished all baseline pharmacokinetic assessments, the present study has been designed to investigate the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of Human -cl rhFVIII , in previously untreated patients 
(PUPs) with inherited severe Haemophilia  A.

A summary of findings from non -clinical as well as clinical investigations can be found in the 
Clinical Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1 Rationale for Conducting the  Study  
 
The occurrence of an antibody against factor VIII, a so called inhibitor, is the most important 
complication  in haemophilia  treatment.  Inhibitors  occur  in up to about  30% of PUPs  with severe 
haemophilia, usually within the first 50 exposure days (EDs) to a FVIII concentrate. As specified in the CHMP Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Recombinant and Human Plasma -Derived  Factor  VIII Products  (CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009)  (5), clinical  trials  in PUPs 
are required depending on the type of factor  VIII product  (e.g. novel  modified  proteins  to extend 
half-life).  
This clinical study is designed in compliance with the requirements set up in the CHMP 
guideline (CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) (5). At the time when this study in children is  planned 
to be started (in the course of the 4
th quarter 2012), pharmacokinetic, efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity data from further studies with Human -cl rhFVIII in PTPs will be available 
(including a children study, as required by the  guideline).  
The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII, to assess the 
efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII during prophylactic treatment, in the treatment of bleeds, and in 
surgical  prophylaxis, and to assess the safety  and tolerability  of Human -cl rhFVIII  in PUPs  with 
severe Haemophilia A (FVIII coagulation activity [FVIII:C] <1%) over 100 EDs and for a 
maximum period of five years from screening.  
Additionally  health  economics  data are increasingly  requested  by decision  makers in healthcare. 
This is because resources are scarce and there is a need to achieve the best outcomes possible within the resources available. Therefore, in addition to immunogenicity, efficacy and safety data of Human- cl rhFVIII re source use data will be collected. The resource use data that will 
be collected alongside this clinical trial could be linked to reference unit costs for a specific country of interest to obtain insight  in the average  cost of treatment  of a Haemophilia  A patient.  
Collecting resource use data can provide insight into the differences in resource use of prophylactic  administration  of Human -cl rhFVIII  against  on-demand therapy. Also,  data can be 
collected on resources (e.g. drug cost, monitoring cost) related to ITI for patients developing a clinically  significant  and non-transient  inhibitor. As is known from  literature  ITI therapy is very 
expensive and cost may substantially vary depending on inhibitor status and choice of ITI strategy, further details on ITI therapy and its related cost are of considerable interest. This study can generate insight into resource use of patients developing inhibitors versus patients without  inhibitors.  
1.2 Dose  Rationale  
 
Human -cl rhFVIII will be provided in single use vials containing a nominal potency of 250, 
500, 1000 or 2000 International Units (IU) each of freeze -dried rFVIII concentrate to be 
reconstituted in 2.5 mL of water for injection (WFI). Full vials are to be injected, preferably - 
except for recovery investigations. Hum an-cl rhFVIII should be used for intravenous injection 
only (maximum infusion speed: 4 mL/minute).  
The dose and frequency of treatment of Haemophilia A depend on the individual patients’ needs. As the current study will be conducted in PUPs, who will most likely be infants or  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018

young children, and the recommendations  in the published literature  are controversial,  no direct 
prophylactic  dosing specifications are made,  except  that the starting  dose should be 20-50 IU/kg 
BW. It is the Investigators’ clinical judgement that will guide dose and frequency adjustments 
based on individual patients’  needs.  
1.3 Benefit -Risk  Statement 
 
On the basis of data available for adult and children (PTPs), the half -life and the recovery of 
Human -cl rhFVIII  are similar  to other  already  licensed  rFVIII  preparations.  It can be concluded 
that Human -cl rhFVIII is efficacious in the prevention and in the treatment of BEs and during 
surgical prophylaxis in patients with inherited FVIII deficiency.  
Comparable to other rFVIII preparations, the following adverse drug reactions (ADR) may 
occur by using Human -cl rhFVII I: 
1. Allergic or anaphylactic types of reactions. Observed symptoms may include fever, 
chills, nausea, urticaria, pruritus, dizziness, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and – 
very rarely –  anaphylactic  shock.  
2. Development of antibodies (inhibitors) agains t FVIII.  
In conclusion, the hitherto existing clinical and pre -clinical data allow the conclusion that 
participating  in this study  does not represent  any additional  risk to the included patients  in terms 
of immunogenicity and safety.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Study  Endpoints  
 
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint -  Immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII 
Immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII is the primary endpoint. Inhibitor activity will be 
determined by the modified Bethesda assay (Nijmegen modification), using congenital FVIII - 
deficient human plasma, spiked with Human -cl rhFVIII, at the following time points:  
• At baseline (Screening  Visit)  
• Every 3- 4 EDs until ED  20 
• Every 10- 12 EDs or every 3 months ±  2 weeks (whichever comes first) after ED 20 
until 100 EDs are  reached  
• Any time in the case of  suspicion of an inhibitor  development  
In case of a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor retesting, using a second separately drawn 
sample, should be performed. A FVIII inhibitor is defined as “positive”, if the retesting confirms the positive result, otherwise the result is considered as be ing “negative”.  
3.1.2 Secondary  Endpoint(s)  
3.1.2.1 Efficacy  
 
Efficacy of prophylactic treatment  
The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the prophylactic treatment will be investigated by 
calculating the frequency of spontaneous break -through bleeds under prophylactic trea tment 
(see Section 7.2.2.1). Study drug consumption data (FVIII IU/kg per month, per year) per patient and in total will be evaluated. The dates and times of study drug infusions, the details of dose(s), and the product batch numbers used for the prophylac tic treatment will be 
documented. 
Efficacy of treatment of bleeds  
The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the treatment of bleeds will be investigated by using a 4 - 
point ordinal haemostatic efficacy scale (see Section 7.2.2.2). Details of the bleed, the amou nt 
of Human -cl rhFVIII needed and the number of injections necessary to stop the bleed will be 
documented. 
Efficacy of surgical prophylaxis  
In surgical procedures, the following parameters will be documented:  
• Overall efficacy assessment (taking into account the intra-  and post -operative assessment) 
after the end of surgical  prophylactic  treatment phase,  done  together  by the surgeon  and the 
haematologist (see Section  7.2.2.3)  
• Average and maximum expected estimated blood loss, compared to the actual estimated 
blood loss  
• Details on surgical procedure (see Section 7.2.2.3): location, severity, type, expected and actual  duration 
• Pre-, intra -, and post -operative FVIII plasma levels, if  appropriate  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018  
14  
  
• Details of administered dose(s) of Human -cl rhFVIII given pr e-, intra - and/or post - 
operatively including dates, times and batch numbers  
• Details on concomitantly administered drugs, including all blood and blood product 
transfusions, excluding standard anaesthetic  drugs  
• Details on all wound haematomas in terms of c apturing, analysing, and reporting these, 
including any need for surgical  evacuation  
• Outcome of the intervention, described by means of a brief  narrative.  
 
3.1.2.2 Safety  
 
Safety and tolerability  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, standard laboratory 
parameters (red blood cells, white bleed cells, haemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, ALT, AST, 
creatinine), and by monitoring adverse events (AEs). 
 
3.1.3 Further Endpoint – R esource Use 
Following a review of economic literature in haemophilia the most relevant parameters (in 
terms of volume and cost) were selected for inclusion in the current study. The resource use parameters that will be collected
* and analysed are:  
• FVIII concentrates  
Prophylaxis  use or on-demand use, dose per kg body weight, the frequency of injection, 
duration of treatment, any change in treatment regimen, start date and stop  date.  
• Bleeding episodes: location, severity and  duration. 
• Inhibitor status, any change in FVIII use, use of other haemostatic agents, hospitalisation (including ward type) and its  duration.  
• ITI: ITI regimen details (regimen type, FVIII use, dose per kg body weight, the 
frequency of injection, start and stop date, other haemostatic agents, patients’ inhibitor 
levels.  
• CVAD: CVAD type, hospitalisation (including ward type) and duration, surgical  
procedures, complications due to CVAD use and management of the  complication.  
• Surgery prophylaxis: dosage and duration of treatment with FVIII for surgery 
prophylaxis including details on the type of  surgery. 
* The majority of the aforementioned resource parameters are collected as part of 
primary and secondary end points within the study. The same data will also be used to 
analyse resource use.  
• Non-medical resource use: The indirect costs brought about as a result of health care 
resource use should also be considered. Such costs include productivity losses of the parents (caregiver) and their opportunity costs arising through foregone time related to the child’s  disease.  
The related resource use data will be evaluated by incorporating four questions (employment, household tasks and ‘care’ time) in the patient diary.

3.2 Overall Study Design and  Plan  
 
This study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, multinational, open -label, non- controlled 
phase III study in 100 male PUPs (i.e. patients without any previous treatment with FVIII 
concentrates or other blood products containing FVIII) who are suffering from severe 
Haemophilia  A (FVIII:C  < 1%).  Around 40 centres worldwide  are planned  to participate  in this 
study.  
For each patient, the exposure to Human -cl rhFVIII, the efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in the 
prevention and the treatment of bleeds, the frequency of break- through bleeds in case of 
prophylactic treatment, the efficacy in surgical prophylaxis, and the overall safety and tolerability of Human -cl rhFVIII will be thoroughly assessed. In the co urse of the follow -up 
visits (i.e. every 3- 4 EDs until ED 20, then every 10- 12 EDs until ED 100), scheduled to be 
performed after the Screening Visit, FVIII inhibitor levels will be assessed for each patient. If 
appropriate, these visits may be combined wi th the additional regular 3 -monthly ( ± 2 weeks) 
follow -up visits, stipulating some supplementary investigations are performed.  
The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant medication will be checked and 
documented at each follow -up visit. A patient com pletes the study by reaching 100 EDs, or 
after a maximum study participation  period of 5 years from screening.  In patients  who develop 
FVIII inhibitors and start ITI treatment, the maximum length of ITI will be 36 months. In patients undergoing surgical interventions, treatment details will be documented for the pre -, 
intra-, and post -operative phase, respectively.  
The study is pl anned to start in the 4
th quarter of 2012 and continues until the 4th quarter of 
2018, except for those patients continuing Immune Tolerance Induction Therapy.

3.3 Discussion of Study  Design  
 
3.3.1 Study  Design  
The design of this study complies with the applicable European CHMP Guideline 
CHMP/BPWG/144533/2009 (5).  
Accordingly, a PUP study needs to be conducted for all novel factor VIII products, such as novel genetic constructs or modifications of the factor VIII  molecule, after availability of 
relevant PTP data, including data in pre -treated children.  
Corresponding studies have been initiated by Octapharma since early 2009. With the presence 
of 6 months’ treatment data from more than 20 children PTPs, and with ha ving finished all 
baseline pharmacokinetic assessments, a clinical study in PUPs will now be initiated.  
Human -cl rhFVIII  is intended as replacement  therapy in patients  with Haemophilia  A. Efficacy 
of treatment in this indication can be clearly distinguishe d from inactive  therapy.  
3.3.2 Control  Group(s)  
Not applicable.  
3.3.3 Target Parameters  
The following measurements and assessments are requested to be carried out, grouped by the 
different target parameters:  
Immunogenicity  
FVIII inhibitor screen  
Prophylactic Treatment  
Frequency of spontaneous breakthrough bleeds under three times weekly or every other day prophylactic treatment, and in case of surgical prophylaxis  
Efficacy  
Efficacy assessment at the end of each BE (based on the efficacy scale described in Section 7.2.2.2)  
Recovery Investigation  
In vivo recovery (calculated from the FVIII plasma levels before infusion and the peak level 
obtained from the 15 minutes and 1 hour  post -infusion samples)  
Safety  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature)  
Safety laboratory parameters (red blood cell [RBC] count, white blood cell [WBC] count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, alanine amino transferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], serum creatinine)  
Tolerability (occurrence of any AE will be mo nitored throughout the study)

4 STUDY  POPULATION  
4.1 Population Base  
 
Male patients (mainly new -borns or infants, although no age limitation is given) with severe 
Haemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1%), without any previous FVIII concentrate treatment o r any 
previous treatment with other FVIII- containing blood products will be enrolled into the study.  
In total, 100 PUPs will be enrolled by approximately 40 centres from around the world. 
4.1.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
In order to qualify for study enrolment, the foll owing criteria must be fulfilled before study 
entry:  
1. Male patients  
2. Severe Haemophilia A (FVIII:C <  1%) 
3. No previous  treatment with FVIII concentrates or other  blood products  containing  FVIII 
4. Voluntarily given, fully informed written and signed consent given before any study-  
related procedures are conducted (obtained from the patient’s parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s))  
4.1.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Patients will not be included if any of the following exclusion criteria are met:  
1. Diagnosis of a coagulation disorder other than Haemophilia  A 
2. Severe liver or kidney disease (ALT or AST levels >5 times of upper limit of  normal  
(ULN), creatinine >120 μmol/L)  
3. Concomitant treatment with any systemic immunosuppressive  drug 
4. Participation in another interventional clinical study currently or during the past 
4 weeks 
4.2 Prior and Concomitant  Therapy  
 
As this study is conducted in PUPs,  patients  should not have  received  prior  treatment with FVIII 
concentrates as per exclusion  criterion.  
4.2.1 Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant administration of therapies not interfering with the objectives of the study is permitted. Details of any concomitant therapies must be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  
Vaccinations are permitted prior and during the study, and immunisat ions should be given as 
recommended by the country standards. However – once treatment with IMP has started –  
vaccinations are recommended to be done after the 20
th ED. Additionally, a subcutaneous 
administration on a day without FVIII administration is re commended.  
Patients  may only receive anti-fibrinolytics  if this is medically  indicated  / standard  of care,  e.g. 
in the course of tooth extractions or other  surgeries.  
4.2.2 Forbidden Concomitant  Therapy  
No FVIII concentrates other than Human -cl rhFVIII must be administered (except for 
emergency situations).  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05

Patients permanently switching to another FVIII product within the study participation period 
will be assessed  as treatment failure s in the efficacy  analyses.  However,  there  are exceptions  to 
this rule. Patients will hence not be considered treatment failures in the efficacy analyses,  if: 
• the use of another FVIII concentrate was due to an emergency case (example: accident 
requiring tr eatment with FVIII without patient or intensive care unit [ICU] personnel) 
having access to Investigational Medicinal Product [IMP])  
• the IMP was not available for the patient  in time (example:  patient  experiences a severe 
bleed but does not have enough product available). 
The reason for a patient switching to another FVIII product should be clearly documented in 
the CRF (and patient diary, if appropriate).  
Patients may not receive immuno -modulating drugs (other than anti -retroviral chemotherapy), 
such as alpha- interferon, prednisone (equivalent to >10 mg/day), or similar drugs.  
For patients  who developed an inhibitor  and undergo an immune  tolerance  induction it is highly 
recommended not to be vaccinated during the  ITI. 
4.3 Withdrawal and Replacement of  Patients  
 
4.3.1 Premature Patient  Withdrawal  
Subjects  have  the right to withdraw  from  the study  at any time for any reason, without  the need 
to justify. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects in case of AEs, protocol violations, or for administrative reasons. Since an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study non- interpretable, the unnecessary withdrawal of subje cts must be  avoided.  
The Investigator will obtain all the required withdrawal details and document the reason(s) for discontinuation in the CRF. Should the reason for removal of a subject be an AE, the main specific event or laboratory test will be recorde d in the CRF, and the Investigator will make 
thorough efforts to clearly document the outcome. 
In case of a positive FVIII inhibitor but no ITI initiation, the subject has to be withdrawn from 
the study.  
4.3.2 Patient Replacement  Policy  
Patients withdrawn from the study after having started treatment with the IMP will not be replaced,  if they have  received  more  than 50 exposures  with the IMP.  Patients  with less than 50 
EDs need to be replaced.  
4.4 Assignment of Patients to Treatment  Groups  
 
As this is a single -arm st udy, assignment of patients to treatment groups is not necessary.  
4.5 Relevant Protocol Deviations  
 
In case of any major protocol deviation or violation, the Investigator and Octapharma will decide  on the further participation  of the patient  in this study after having discussed  all relevant 
aspects.

5 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S)  
5.1 Characterisation of Investigational Product(s)  
 
Human -cl rhFVIII is a B -domain deleted, human cell -line derived recombinant FVIII 
concentrate for intravenous use and will be provided in single use vials containing a nominal 
potency  of 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 IU each of freeze- dried  rFVIII concentrate  to be reconstituted 
in 2.5 mL of  WFI.  
Several batches of the product will be used in the  study.  
The final product  will be released  by the responsible  Octapharma  Quality  Control  Department, 
in accordance with a defined final product  specification.  
5.2 Packaging and  Labelling  
 
The open- label  study design  does not necessitate  the blinding of study  participants  or study site 
personnel with respect to treatment information. Thus, the IMP will be packed and labelled according  to local  regulations, together  with a pre-filled  syringe  containing 2.5 mL WFI (which 
will be transferred  to the product  vial),  1 disposable  syringe  (10 mL),  1 vial adapter,  1 butterfly 
needle and 2 alcohol swabs.  
Details regarding master labelling can be found in Appendix 1. 
5.3 Conditions for Storage and  Use 
 
The product has to be stored at 2 -8°C protected from light. The product must not be froz en. 
The Investigators must ensure that the investigational product is stored under appropriate conditions with restricted access. The Investigators will inform the patients’ parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of necessary storage conditions once the patients star t home treatment.  
5.4 Dose and Dosing  Schedule  
 
Prophylactic  treatment  is recommended,  but finally,  it is the decision of the responsible  treating 
physician whether patients will be treated prophylactically or on -demand. Patients may switch 
from  on-demand  to prophylactic  treatment,  or from  prophylactic  to on-demand  treatment during 
the course of the  study.  
Prophylactic  Treatment  
1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5 % to 2 %.  
In case prophylactic treatment is chosen, the patients will be treated with a recommended dose of 20- 50 IU FVIII/kg body weight (BW). 
Starting the prophylaxis with the first BE is highly recommended. 
The frequency  of treatment will mainly  depend  on the  patient’s  clinical  situation.  For example, 
prophylaxis  may be initiated  with every -other -day injections  (in order  to keep  the FVIII trough 
level  >1%)  or with once  weekly  injections,  followed  by twice  and three  times  weekly,  and every 
other day treatment. In cases of inadequate response, Human -cl rhFVIII administration 
frequency or dose adjustments can be considered at Investigator’s  discretion.

On-demand Treatment  
In case of bleeds, the patients can be treated on- demand. The dosage and duration of treatment 
of spontaneous  or traumatic  bleeds  depend on the location  and the extent  of bleeding as well as 
on the clinical situation of the patient. Dosage recommendations are given as  follows:  
• Minor haemorrhage (superficial muscle or soft tissue and oral bleeds): 20 -30 IU 
FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target peak level of about 40% to 60%. Repeat 
dose every 8 -24 hours until BE is  resolved.  
• Moderate to major haemorrhage (haemorrhage into muscles, into oral cavity; haemarthrosis, known trauma): 30- 40 IU FVIII/kg BW to achieve an intended target 
peak level of about 60% to 80%. Repeat dose every 6- 24 hours until BE is  resolved.  
• Major to life -threatening haemorrhage (intracranial, intra -abdominal, gastro -intestinal 
or intrathoracic bleeds, central nervous system bleeds, bleeding in retropharyngeal 
spaces or iliopsoas sheath, eyes/retina, fractures or head trauma): initial dose of 40 -60 
IU FVIII/kg  BW to achieve  an intended  target peak  level  of 100%  to 120%.  Repeat  dose 
of 20- 50 IU FVIII/kg BW every 6 -12 hours until BE is  resolved.  
Surgical Prophylaxis  
The dosage  and duration  of treatment  with Human -cl rhFVIII  will depend on the type of surgery 
and the patient’s individual incremental recovery. Dosage recommendations are given as follows:  
• Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25 -30 IU FVIII/kg BW starting within 3 
hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended target peak level of >30%. Repeat one 
dose every 12- 24 hours if needed. Trough levels should be maintained at  ≥30%.  
• Major surgeries: 40 -60 IU FVIII/kg BW within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an 
intended  target  peak  level  of approximately 100%. Repeat  if necessary  after 6-12 hours 
initially and for at least 6 to 14 days until healing is complete and recurrence to regular 
prophylactic treatment is possible. Trough levels should be maintained at  >50%.  
Recovery Investigation (Optional)  
A dose of 40 IU FVIII/kg BW (labelled potency) will be administered on the occasion of the 
recovery investigations. For the calculation  of recovery, the actual potency (measured using 
both chromogenic  (CHR)  and one-stage  (OS)  assays)  of Human -cl rhFVIII  will be used.  In vivo 
recovery will be calculated from the FVIII plasma level before infusion and the peak level obtained from the 15 minutes and 1 hour post -infusion samples. Recovery investigations can 
be done with the first Human- cl rhFVIII administration, or within the firs t three months after 
treatment start with Human -cl rhFVIII, in any case in a non- bleeding patient. They are 
recommended being controlled every 6 months  thereafter.  
Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) (if applicable)  
Patients who develop a clinically significant and non- transient FVIII inhibitor will be offered 
to start ITI with the IMP. Inhibitors that `disappear´ without any clinical signs or symptoms, where no FVIII dosing increase was required, and that turn to <0.6 BU within a period of 6 months after firs t detection are regarded as “transient”.  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018

The modified Bonn Protocol for inhibitor elimination is recommended:  
• Low responders  (<5 Bethesda Units  [BU])  should receive 50-100 IU FVIII/kg  BW daily 
or every second day. In case the inhibitor i ncreases to 5 BU or more, the patient should 
switch to the high responder  regimen.  
• High responders ( ≥5 BU) should receive 100- 150 IU FVIII/kg BW every 12 hours. 
Once the inhibitor is eliminated (<0.6 BU), the FVIII recovery is ≥ 66% of normal (defined as 
1 IU FVIII/kg BW raises the plasma FVIII activity by 1.5%), and the half- life of FVIII is at 
least 6 hours, a continuous reduction of about 10% of the initial ITI dosage should be  initiated, 
until the patient has reached a prophylactic treatment regimen of 30- 50 IU FVIII/kg BW every 
other  day. 
Any other ITI approach using Human- cl rhFVIII as the selected FVIII concentrate is possible. 
All treatment details and the further development of the inhibitor titre need to be documented.  
Patients who do not start ITI within one year after inhibitor detection are withdrawn from the 
study.  
5.5 Preparation and Method of Administration  
 
Human -cl rhFVIII will be provided in single use vials containing a nominal potency of 250, 
500, 1000 or 2000 IU each of freeze- dried rFVIII concentrate to be reconstituted in 2.5 mL of 
WFI.  
Prior to injection,  the solution must  have  reached  room  temperature,  without  taking any specific 
warming -up measures. The preparation should be administered within 3 hours after 
reconstitution at one single occasion. The solution is a clear or slightly opalescent colourless solution. Solutions  that are cloudy or have  deposits  must  not be used. Human- cl rhFVIII  should 
be injected intravenously by bolus injection (maximally 4 mL/min ute) by using aseptic 
technique.  
5.6 Blinding, Emergency Envelopes and Breaking the Study  Blind  
 
Not applicable.  
5.7 Treatment Compliance  
 
5.7.1 Drug Dispensing and Accountability  
A drug dispensing log will be kept up to date by the Investigator, detailing the dates, batch numbers, and quantities  of investigational  product  dispensed to each patient.  The inventory will 
be available to the Study Monitor in order to verify drug account ability in the course of the 
study. Patients’ parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  will be advised  to return  any empty  vials  and unused 
investigational product on the occasion of the study visits.  
Any unused investigational product not dispensed, or returned by the  patient, will be counted 
and returned  to the Sponsor. In certain  cases,  unused supplies  might  have  to be destroyed  at the 
study site. However, this is only applicable  after drug accountability has been  verified  and fully 
re-conciliated, and after written approval from the Sponsor has been obtained.  
The Investigator will ensure that such a disposition does not expose patients to risks linked to 
the investigational  product. The Investigator and the Sponsor  will maintain records  of any such 
alternate disposition to permit accurate drug  accountability.

5.7.2 Assessment of Treatment  Compliance  
Patients will usually undergo at -home treatment (treatment will likely be administered by 
parents/guardians due to the expected young age of the patients or by general practitioners or 
nurses). At the first visit, the Investigator will provide them with a sufficient amount of trial 
medication (in cooling boxes, if appropriate) and a diary. The Investigator will advise the parents/guardians  on how to fill in the diary. The diary  will include  detailed  written  instructions 
for all assessments to be made. Furthermore, the efficacy rating criteria and the criteria for assessing  the severity  of a bleed  will be explained. The Investigator  will emphasise  the necessity 
of a careful documentation of all treatment detai ls. The recording of at -home injections will 
include the date and time, dose, batch number, and reason for injection (i.e. prophylaxis, BE treatment). IMP is provided with tear- off labels that must be placed in the  diary.  
In case of treatment of BEs, the p atient’s parents/guardians will document the site and  severity 
of the bleed, the start and end dates and time, and carry out an efficacy assessment according to the explanation provided in the  diary.  
Study product administrations that are overseen by the I nvestigator (e.g. treatment in relation 
to the recovery investigations or in case of severe BEs treated at the study site), are to be documented in the patient’s journal (by the Investigator), as well as in the patient's diary (by the parents/guardians).  
In addition, the patient’s parents/guardians will record any concomitant medications taken 
during the study period in their diaries. 
For each follow -up visit at the study site, the parents/guardians must bring all diaries to be 
reviewed and validated by sit e personnel.  
 
6 STUDY  CONDUCT 
6.1 Observations by  Visit 
 
6.1.1 Screening (Visit  1) 
Parents/legal guardians have to be informed about the study details and have to give their 
written informed consent before any investigations and assessments can be performed. The following will be documented/assessed:  
• Check of inclusion-  and exclusion criteria  
• Demographics, including patient’s blood type and FVIII inhibitor risk factors  
• Medical  history 
• Vital signs  
• Height  
• Body weight  
• Physical  examination  
• Safety laboratory  parameters  
• FVIII:C (CHR and OS  assay)  
• FVIII inhibitor screen  
• FVIII gene mutation an alysis (mandatory, can be performed later during the  study)  
• Immunogenotyping (HLA -typing, immune response gene expression), (optional)  
• RNA expression analysis (optional)  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05

• In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products  (optional)  
• Epitope  mapping:  optional, available pre-treatment samples will be analysed  from study 
patients who later on developed an inhibitor to FVIII and started ITI. In addition, 
samples available from an inhibitor negative control group will be tested: already available plasma samples from ~20 PUPs included into the study in Ukraine and Moldova, which were drawn prior to the first exposure to FVIII are planned to be analysed in  retrospect.  
The Investigator will hand out the patient diary and instruct the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) on how to document details of treatment with Human -cl rhFVIII, bleeds, AEs and concomitant 
medication. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will receive a sufficient amount of study product for home  treatment (in cooling boxes, if appropriate)  and will be instructed  on how to store  and 
administer it. 
Immunogenotyping is suggested  to be performed  at screening;  however, it can be performed  at 
any point during the study. It is suggested that the sampling coincides with regular study visits whenever  possible.  
6.1.2 Procedures During the Follow -Up Part of the  Study  
Follow -Up Visits (until ED 20):  
The patients will visit the study site every 3 -4 EDs until 20 EDs have been reached. At these 
visits,  blood samples will be obtained for FVIII  inhibitor screen  and optionally  RNA expression 
analysis (after a wash -out period of at least 2, preferably 3 days after the previous IMP 
administration). Samples are analysed in the central  laboratories.  
At these visits, the patient diary will be reviewed (any IMP injection, any bleed) in order to transfer data into the CRF. The occurrence of AEs and changes in weight and concomitant medication will be checked and documented.  
Follow -Up Visits (after ED 20 until ED 100): 
After ED 20 has been  reached,  patients  will visit the study site every  10-12 EDs.  At these visits, 
blood samples will be obtained for FVIII inhibitor screen (after a wash -out period of at least  2, 
preferably 3 days after the previous IMP  administration).  
At these visits, the patient diary will be reviewed (any IMP injection, an y bleed) in order to 
transfer data into the CRF.  The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant  medication  will 
be checked and documented. Samples are analysed in the central  laboratory.  
Follow -Up Visits (every 3 months ± 2 weeks):  
If appropriate, the above -described follow -up visits may be combined with regular 3- monthly 
follow -up visits  (± 2 weeks),  stipulating some  supplementary  investigations  are performed:  the 
safety  laboratory parameters will be assessed  (samples are analysed  locally)  and vital signs  will 
be measured pre - and – in case IMP was injected –  30-60 minutes post -injection and the 
patient’s BW will be  measured.  
Once every 6 months a physical examination is performed.  
If the optional recovery investigation is done, it is recommended that it will be performed with the first Human -cl rhFVIII administration, or within the first three months after treatment start 
and every 6 months thereafter, in any case in a non -bleeding patient.  
Recovery  visits  should be timed  so that they coincide  with other  study visits  whenever  possible. 
The in vivo recovery will be calculated  from  the FVIII plasma  levels  before  infusion  and the

peak level obtained from the 15 minutes and 1 hour post -infusion samples. Samples are 
analysed in the central laboratory.  
In case the patient  did not require  any IMP from screening  until the 3-Monthly Follow -Up visits 
during the first year, the blood sampling (inhibitor screen, safely laboratory) after 3 and 9 
months is optional. After 6 and 12 months a sample is  mandatory.  
Additional Health Economic Evaluation:  
Parents / Caregivers will be asked to fill out a sh ort questionnaire as part of the patient diary 
that asks about their time commitments, and productivity loss.  
These questions  should be answered  by both parents  (if applicable)  on a quarterly  basis,  finally 
covering the entire study  period.  
• Do you currentl y hold a paid job? 
• Did your child’s Haemophilia A oblige you to be off work at any time in the past three 
months?  
• Did other people take over and perform your usual household tasks in the past three months in connection with your child’s Haemophilia A?  
• How much of the time you cared for your child in the past 3 months was specifically 
related to Haemophilia A? Consider time related to product administration, receiving 
education on home treatment, time related to hospital visit, physicians visits  etc. 
ITI Patient Follow -Up: 
Patients developing an inhibitor and not starting ITI will be withdrawn from the study, once it can be ruled out that the inhibitor is transient / not requiring ITI. Inhibitors that `disappear´ without  any clinical  signs  or symptoms,  where  no FVIII dosing increase was required,  and that 
turn to <0.6 BU within a period of 6 months after first detection are regarded as  “transient”.  
Patients developing an inhibitor and starting ITI will be closely monitored. Depending on the development of the inhibitor level: a bi -weekly (later on monthly to 3 -monthly) inhibitor titre 
testing  is considered  appropriate.  Optional  epitope  mapping can be performed  once  the inhibitor 
is detected (pre -ITI start), as close as possible after the peak in hibitor level, and after inhibitor 
eradication. These patients’ epitope mapping samples optionally taken at screening / prior to the first exposure to FVIII will also be analysed. Optional RNA expression analysis can be performed alongside the inhibitor te sting at initiation of ITI, 2 and 4 weeks after ITI initiation, 
and then on a monthly basis until Month 6. This may give information on motifs that predict success that should be evident in the first 6 months and give mechanistic information on immune -tolerance.  
Once the inhibitor is eliminated, a normalised recovery and half- life are expected during the 
continued  ITI. Patient  observation visits  including  inhibitor screen  and FVIII  measurements are 
recommended according to progress of the ITI. Samples to te st the recovery are recommended 
to be drawn  at baseline  and 15 minutes  post-injection.  For the half-life evaluation, the following 
sampling time points are recommended: baseline, 15 minutes, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 hours post - 
injection. No wash- out period needs to be respected prior to blood sampling; no ITI injection 
should be skipped prior to or during the half -life evaluation (last blood sampling should be 
performed before the next regular ITI dose is  injected).

Patients will complete study participation after a complete success of the ITI (inhibitor- free, 
normalised recovery and half -life), and the start of re gular prophylactic treatment, or after a 
maximum ITI period of 36 months.  
Surgical Visits:  
Study subjects may undergo surgical interventions during the course of the study. Depending 
on the type of surgery, subjects may be hospitalised or not (in case of c ertain minor surgeries 
with low risk of post-operative  bleeding)  at the discretion  of the Investigator. Patient’s  BW will 
be recorded within 12 hours before the start of surgery. Estimations of blood loss and duration of surgery will be recorded. Details o f Human -cl rhFVIII dosing, concomitant treatment 
(including need for additional blood transfusions, excluding anaesthetic drugs), AEs (if any) and vital signs  will be documented throughout  the surgery. Details of surgery, actual  blood loss, 
efficacy assessment, presence of wound haematomas and narratives of outcomes will be recorded after the surgery. 
Completion Visit:  
For each patient, the study is completed once 100 EDs have been reached, or after a maximum of 5 years study participat ion - from screening.  
Patients undergoing an ITI complete the study after a successful elimination of the inhibitor (“complete success” criteria see above), but after a maximum ITI period of 36 months.  
At this visit,  blood samples will be obtained for FVII I inhibitor  screen  (after a wash -out period 
of at least 2, preferably 3 days after the previous IMP administration) and the safety panel. Samples for FVIII inhibitor screen are analysed in the central  laboratory.  
The vital signs and a physical examination will be performed. The patient’s BW will be measured. The occurrence of AEs and changes in concomitant medication are checked and documented. 
At this visit,  the patient  diary  will be reviewed  (any IMP injection, any bleed)  in order  to transfer 
data into the  CRF.  
6.2 Duration of Study  
 
6.2.1 Planned Duration for an Individual  Patient  
The patients  should stay in the study for 100 EDs and for a maximum study  participation  period 
of 5 years from  screening.  
In patients who develop FVIII inhibitors and start ITI treatment, the study is complete after a 
successful ITI, but the maximum length of ITI will be 36 months.  
6.2.2 Planned Duration for the Study as a  Whole  
The study will be considered completed when all patie nts have terminated the planned 
observation period/Completion Visit. The total study period is scheduled to comprise 6 years. The study started  in the 1
st quarter  2013 and is planned to continue  until the 4th quarter  of 2018. 
6.2.3 Premature Termination of the  Study  
Both the Investigator and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. 
Should this be necessary, the required procedures will be arranged on an individual basis after 
review and consultation by both parties. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the 
Amended Study Protocol

Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients' 
interests.  
 
7 ASSESSMENTS AND  METHODS  
7.1 Background / Baseline  Information  
 
The following information will be captured upon enrolment:  
Demographics : sex, age, weigh t and height (calculated body mass index [BMI]), and ethnic 
origin, family history of haemophilia and family history of FVIII inhibitor development 
Medical history : obtained from existing medical charts and by interviewing the parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s) a nd by performing a physical examination  
Previous and concomitant medication: obtained from existing medical charts and by 
interviewing the parent(s)/legal guardian(s)  
Analysis of FVIII gene mutations : blood samples collected by the Investigator and analysi s 
performed by a central laboratory  
7.2 Efficacy/Immunogenicity  Assessments 
 
7.2.1 Assessments for Primary Endpoint  
The primary objective is to investigate the immunogenicity of Human -cl rhFVIII.  
Inhibitor activity will be determined centrally by the modified Bethes da assay (Nijmegen 
modification), using congenital FVIII- deficient human plasma spiked with Human -cl rhFVIII 
at the following time points:  
• At baseline (Screening  Visit)  
• Every 3- 4 EDs until ED  20 
• Every 10- 12 EDs or every 3 months ± 2 weeks (whichever comes first) after ED  20 
• At study completion  
• Any time in the case of a suspicion of inhibitor  development.  
In case of a positive inhibitor result, an inhibitor re -testing using a second separately draw n 
sample should be performed centrally. The definitions for thresholds are ≥ 0.6 to < 5 BU for a "low titre" inhibitor and ≥5 BU for a "high- titre" inhibitor.  
Patients who develop a non- transient inhibitor will have an option to start on ITI treatment. 
Patients  developing inhibitors  and not starting  ITI will be withdrawn  from the study.  Inhibitors 
that `disappear´ without any clinical signs or symptoms, where no FVIII dosing increase was required, and that turn to <0.6 BU within  a period  of 6 months  after first detection  are regarded 
as “transient”, and continue regular treatment within the study until they have reached ED 100 or a maximum period of 5  years..

7.2.2 Assessments for Secondary  Endpoints  
 
7.2.2.1 Prophylactic  treatment  
 
The following parameters will be  documented:  
• Dates and times of study product  injections  
• Details of dose(s) (in IU) and product batch  numbers  
• Details of BEs (if any) occurring under prophylactic  treatment  
Study drug consumption data (FVIII IU/kg per month, per year) per patient and in total (for 
patients on prophylactic treatment) will be evaluated.  
Efficacy Assessment of Prophylactic Treatment  
The efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in prophylactic treatment will be evaluated based on the 
frequency of spontaneous  breakthrough bleeds per months under three times weekly or every 
other day prophylactic treatment and will be calculated and assessed as excellent, good, 
moderate or poor:  
Excellent :        Less than 0.75 spontaneous BEs per  month  
Good:  Between 0.75 and 1 spontaneous BEs per month 
Moderate : Between more than 1 and 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month 
Poor : More than 1.5 spontaneous BEs per  month  
The time period for prophylactic treatment will comprise the time periods between first 
prophylactic treatment with Human- cl rhFVIII until the administration of the last prophylactic 
treatment + 2 days or completion  visit whatever  comes first)  minus  time periods  from  start of a 
surgery  until final assessment  of the surgery,  and minus  time period of on demand treatment,  if 
any. 
The frequency of treatment will mainly depend on the patient’s clinical situation and may  vary 
from every other day to once weekly injections. In cases of inadequate response, Human- cl 
rhFVIII administration frequency or dose adjustments  can be considered at Investigator’s 
discretion.  
The number of BEs counted for prophylactic treatment efficacy assessment will comprise all 
BEs starting during the time periods for prophylactic treatment defined above, i.e. BEs 
occurring between start of s urgery until final assessment of the surgery will not be included in 
the prophylactic treatment assessment.  
 
7.2.2.2 Bleeding  episodes  
 
For all BEs occurring within the study period, the following data will be documented:  
• Type of bleeding (spontaneous, traumatic, post -operative, other)  
• Site of bleeding 
• Start date and time of occurrence/of noticing the  bleed  
• Severity of the bleed (minor, moderate, major or life threatening, see Section 5.4)

32  
  
• Date and time of end of  BE* 
• Efficacy assessment at the end of the BE (definitions see below)  
• Deta ils of dose(s) and batch number used to treat BE (in  IU) 
• Dates and times of study product  injections  
* If the treatment  of a BE in one bleeding site is interrupted for more  than 48 hours, two separate 
BEs will have to be recorded; if another – in addition to  the original –  bleeding site is  affected, 
the events will be recorded as separate BEs at any  time.  
All above listed parameters will be documented by the parents (together with the Investigator 
in case of on- site treatments) in the patient's diary. Patients experiencing a major or life - 
threatening BE should preferably be treated at the study site.  
After the end of a BE the patient is intended to return to his regular prophylactic treatment 
regimen.  
Efficacy Assessment of Bleeding Episodes 
At the end of a BE, the following efficacy assessment will be made by the patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) (toge ther with the Investigator in case of on -site treatment):  
Excellent : Abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in  objective  signs  of  
bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single  infusion  
Good:  Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 
approximately 8 – 12 hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for 
complete  resolution  
Moderate : Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first 
infusion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution  
None : No improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more 
than 2 infusions for complete  resolution  
The assessment will be made at the end of a BE.  
 
7.2.2.3 Surgical  Prophylaxis  
 
In case surgical procedures are performed, the following data will be documented:  
• Location and type (planned or emergency) of  surgery  
• Severity of surgery (minor or major, definitions see  below)

• Pre-, intra -, and post -operative FVIII plasma levels (time -points see below)  
• Expected and actual blood loss (see  below)  
• All wound haematomas, incl. capture, analysis, and reporting, noting whether surgical 
evacuation is  required

33  
  
• Laboratory tests (haematology, chemistry: before and 24 hours after end of  surgery)  
• Details on concomitantly administered products including any blood/blood product 
transfusions but excluding drugs given for routine anaesthesia  
• Details of administered dose(s) of Human -cl rhFVIII given pre -, intra - and/or post - 
operatively (definitions see  below) including dates, times, and batch number  
• A brief narrative describing the outcome and efficacy of the  intervention  
• Overall  efficacy  assessment  at the end of surgical  prophylaxis  done  together  by the surgeon 
and the haematologist (definitions see  below) 
Classification of Surgeries  
Surgeries are defined as major if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Requiring general or spinal  anaesthesia  
• Requiring opening into the great body cavities  
• In the course of which hazards of severe haemorrhage is  possible  
• Requiring haemostatic therapy for at least 6  days 
• Orthopaedic interventions involving joints (ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, shoulder)  
• 3rd molar extraction or extraction of ≥3 teeth  
• Surgeries/conditions in which the patient's life is at stake  
The classification is made prospectively. All other surgeries are classified as minor.  
FVIII Plasma Level  
FVIII plasma level (both assays, local and central lab) will be documented at the following 
time-points:  
• Immediately (≤ 30 minutes) before and after pre -operative injection of study  drug 
• Immediately (≤ 30 minutes) before and after each intra -operative bolus dose (if any); not 
mandatory for minor BEs 
• Immediately (≤ 30 minutes) before and after eac h post -operative dose (if any); in case of 
major surgery: mandatory for the first 3 post- operative  doses  
Continuous infusion is not allowed in this study, only bolus injections are permitted.  
Estimation of Blood -Loss 
Prior to surgery, the surgeon will prov ide written estimates of the following: 
Volume (mL) of average expected blood loss for the planned surgical procedure, as it would 
be expected  for the same procedure  in a patient  with normal  haemostasis,  of the same sex, age, 
and stature.  
Volume (mL) of maximal expected blood loss for the planned surgical procedure as it would 
be expected  for the same procedure  in a patient  with normal  haemostasis,  of the same sex, age, 
and stature.  
Following the surgery, the actual blood loss will be estimated by the surgeon.

Definitions of Pre -, Intra -, and Post -Operative Doses 
A pre-operative  administration is  defined  as  any dose of Human -cl  rhFVIII applied  within 
3 hours prior to surgery start.  
An intra-operative  administration is defined as any injection of Human -cl rhFVIII applied 
during surgery. 
A post-operative  administration is defined as any dose of Human- cl rhFVIII applied after the 
end of the surgery (“end of surgery” is defined as “last suture”), for at least 2 days (minor 
surgeries), or for at least 6 to 14 days (major surgeries), respectively, until healing is achieved and recurrence to the regular prophylactic t reatment regimen.  
Efficacy Assessment of Surgical Prophylaxis  
Efficacy will be assessed at the end of surgery by the surgeon and post -operatively by the 
haematologist using the following scales:  
Intra -operatively (at the end of the surgery [= after last su ture]):  
• Excellent:  Intra -operative  blood loss was lower  than or equal  to the average expected  blood 
loss compared with the same type of procedure performed in a patient with normal 
haemostasis and of the same sex, age, and  stature.  
• Good: Intra -operative bl ood loss was higher than average expected blood loss but lower or 
equal to the maximal expected blood loss compared with the same type of procedure in a patient with normal haemostasis.  
• Moderate: Intra- operative blood loss was higher than maximal expected blood loss 
compared  with the same  type of procedure  performed  in a patient  with normal  haemostasis, 
but haemostasis was controlled.  
• None: Haemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor replacement 
regimen.  
Post-operatively:  
• Excellent : No post -operative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery. All post -operative bleeding (due to complications of surgery) was controlled with 
Human -cl rhFVIII, as anticipated for the type of  procedure.  
• Good: No post -operative bleed ing or oozing that was not due to complications of surgery. 
Control of post -operative bleeding due to complications of surgery required increased 
dosing with Human -cl rhFVIII  or additional  infusions, not originally  anticipated  for the type 
of procedure. 
• Moderate : Some post -operative bleeding and oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery; control of post- operative bleeding required increased dosing with Human -cl 
rhFVIII or additional infusions, not originally anticipated for the type of  procedure.  
• None : Extensive  uncontrolled  post-operative  bleeding and oozing. Control  of post-operative 
bleeding required use of an alternate FVIII concentrate.  
An overall efficacy assessment taking both the intra-  and post -operative assessment into 
account will be done together by the surgeon and the haematologist.  
The conclusion of the post -operative phase of a major surgery is defined as follows: date of

discharge, or at least post -operative Day 6, whichever occurs later.  
In the end of a surgical prophylactic treatment period the patient is intended to return to his 
regular prophylactic treatment regimen.  
7.3 Safety  Assessments  
 
7.3.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs  will be monitored and recorded throughout the study.  
7.3.1.1 Definitions  
 
Adverse event (AE) : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient receiving 
an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can the refore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP.  
Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintende d response to an IMP 
related to any dose. The phrase “response to an IMP” means that a causal relationship  between 
the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship  cannot  be ruled 
out. 
Other significant AEs : Any marked la boratory abnormalities or any AEs that lead to an 
intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant additional concomitant therapy.  
Withdrawal  due to AE/ADR:  Is a patient  whose  treatment  with IMP is discontinued because of 
an AE or ADR. Any such events will be followed up by the Investigator until the event is resolved or until the medical condition of the patient is stable. All follow -up information 
collected will be made available to the  Sponsor. 
7.3.1.2 Collection  
 
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, whether scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non- leading question such as 
“How have you been since the last visit / during the previous  study period?” In addition, the 
patient diaries (if applicable) will be checked by the Investigator for any documented event.  
Any AE or ADR  which  occurs  during the study will be noted in detail  on the appropriate  pages 
of the CRF.  If the patient  reports  several  signs  or symptoms,  which  represent  a single  syndrome 
or diagnosis, the latter should be recorded in the CRF. The Investigator responsible will grade the severity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non -serious or 
serious) and causality, as defined below (Sections 7.3.1.3, 7.3.1.4 and 7.3.2). The Sponsor is 
responsible  to assess the expectedness of each ADR (expected  or unexpected), as defined  below 
(Section  7.3.1.4). 
In the event  of clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  findings, the tests will be repeated  and 
followe d-up until they have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation is  available.  
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at a later sta ge unless they 
represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening).  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018  
36  
  
The Investigator responsible should always provide detailed information concerning any 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action( s), as well as any other 
observations or comments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the patients’ AEs or ADRs.  
7.3.1.3 Severity  
 
The intensity/severity of all AEs will be graded as follows:  
• mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with the 
patient’s routine  activities;  
• moderate : an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s 
routine  activities;  
• severe : an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s routine 
activities.  
Grading of an AE is up to the medical judgement of the Inves tigator and will be decided on a 
case by case basis.  
7.3.1.4 Causality  
 
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by the Investigator responsible:  
• probable : reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relat ionship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily 
highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the medicine and that could not reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the patient’s clinical  state.  
• possible : reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is 
uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or insufficient evidence. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administr ation of the IMP; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other  factors.  
• unlikely: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration. A n event which may have been produced by the patient’s clinical state 
or by environmental factors or other therapies  administered.  
• not related (unrelated) : events for which sufficient information exists to conclude that 
the aetiology is unrelated to the  IMP. 
• unclassified : reports  which  for one reason  or another  are not yet assessable,  e.g. because 
of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018  
37  
  
Classification of ADRs: 
ADRs will be classified by the Sponsor as either expected or unexpected:  
• expected : an AE that is listed in the “Reference Safety Information” of the current 
edition of the Investigator's  Brochure. 
• unexpected : an AE that is not listed  in the current  edition  of the Investigator's  Brochure, 
or that differs because of greater severity or greater  specificity.  
7.3.1.5 Outcome  
 
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows:  
1. recovered, resolved  
2. recovering, resolving  
3. not recovered, not  resolved  
4. recovered, resolved with  sequelae  
5. fatal 
6. unknown 
NOTE:  A patient’s  death  per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event  which  resulted  into 
patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within 4 
weeks after IMP treatment end, and without respect of being considered treatment -related or 
not. 
7.3.1.6 Action(s) taken  
 
AEs requiring action or therapy must be tre ated with recognised standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well- being of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
The action taken by the  Investigator must be documented:  
In general  
- none  
- medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started  
- test performed  
- other (to be  specified)  
On IMP  
- none  
- product  withdrawn  
- dose reduced 
- dose increased  
Amended Study Protocol 
No. GENA -05 CONFIDENTIAL  Version  05 
01-Feb-2018  
38  
  
The responsible Investigator will follow -up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the patient is stable, and all relevant follow -up information will be reported to the 
Sponsor. 
7.3.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in  death,  
• is life-threatening,  
• requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• is another important  medical  event.  
In addition, each FVIII inhibitor development is regarded as an SAE.  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the patient was — in the view 
of the reporting Investigator —  at immediate risk of death at the time of the e vent; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/reaction is serious in other 
situations: Important AEs/ADRs that are not immediately lif e-threatening or do not result in 
death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above, should also be considered serious. 
In addition, although not classif ied under the seriousness criteria, all suspected transmissions 
of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE. A suspected virus transmission means that 
virus antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission.

Waiver from SAE reporting requirement:  
The following SAEs do not require reporting in expedited manner : 
• Hospitalisation  for the treatment  of a (disease -related)  BE assessed  as unrelated  to IMP 
treatment.  
These exceptions/waivers  include  surgeries  that are elective  or planned, and prolongation of the 
existing hospitalisations due to economic or social reasons, but not medical reasons. These 
should not be considered as SAEs. 
7.3.3 Laboratory Safety Tests 
Blood Sampling  
The actual date and time of any blood sampling must be recorded in the CRF, on the label of the laboratory tubes and on the corresponding laboratory shipment forms. 
If several blood samples have to be taken at one time point, the blood sampling will be done in 
the fo llowing sequence:  
1. Haematology: RBC count, WBC count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count (EDTA  blood)  
2. Coagulation: FVIII plasma level and FVIII inhibitor control (citrated  plasma)  
3. Biochemistry: ALT, AST, serum creatinine  (serum)  
4. RNA expression analysis (optional) (whole blood, RNAse -free conditions)  
5. Immunogenotyping: gene mutation analysis (mandatory), HLA -typing, immune 
response gene profiling, FVIII ethnic haplotype determination (optional), (EDTA blood)  
6. In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products (optional) (citrated  blood)  
It is essential that blood sampling after the injection of Human -cl rhFVIII is done from the 
other arm.  
Blood samples taken  for citrate  plasma  will be centrifuge d after collection  for 15 to 20 minutes 
at 1500 to 2000 g (about 3000 rpm). Aliquots of the supernatant are subsequently transferred 
into the tubes provided by the central laboratory (pre -labelled with date and time point of 
sampling, type of sample, patie nt identification and study number) and stored, respectively 
shipped under adequate  conditions.  
EDTA Blood  
A 1 mL sample (or less, as required by the local laboratory) of EDTA blood will be collected 
for the measurement of haematology parameters (RBC count, WBC count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count). All haematology tests are to be done at the local l aboratory. 
A further 5 mL sample will be collected for the FVIII gene mutation analysis and the optional further immunogenotyping (HLA -typing, immune response gene profiling and FVIII ethnic 
haplotype analysis). The immunogenotyping will be done at the Uni versity laboratory of Prof. 
Johannes Oldenburg in Bonn, Germany. The blood samples will be stored at ≤ –70°C and 
shipped to the central laboratory on dry- ice.

Citrated Plasma  
For the analysis of coagulation factor and inhibitor screen, both performed in the central 
laboratory in the US, a maximum of around 2 mL of citrated blood will be collected. After collection and centrifugation, the plasma will be aliquoted into cryo -resistant tubes. Samples 
will be stored at ≤ -70°C and shipped to t he central laboratory on dry- ice. 
For analysis performed  locally,  e.g. at screening  and pre-, intra,  and post-surgery, citrated  blood 
as required by the local laboratory will be collected and processed in accordance with local requirements.  
From  patients  developing an inhibitor to FVIII,  and agree to participate  in the epitope  mapping 
sub-study, a further pre -ITI initiation 2 mL citrated blood sample (2 x 0,5 mL citrated plasma) 
is needed. After ITI initiation two further blood sampling time points are recommended: as close as possible after the peak inhibitor level, as well as after inhibitor eradication.  
Serum  
For the determination of clinical chemistry (ALT, AST, serum creatinine) a blood sample of about 0.5 mL (or less, as required by the local laboratory) will be collected. All tests are to be done at the local laboratory. 
Citrated blood  
If the (optional) analysis of immunogenicity of FVIII products ( in vitro T cell assay) is to be 
performed,  a blood sample of exactly  5 mL needs  to be collected.  Samples will be kept at room 
temperature  and are immediately  shipped  to Antitope  Ltd. at ambient temperature.  The samples 
must arrive at the central laboratory within 24 hours after collection.  
Whole blood (RNAse -free conditions)  
If the RNA expression analysis is performed, about 1.0 mL of blood will be collected into an sterile (RNAase & DNase- free) syringe and directly transferred into a customised PAXGene 
tube (provided by the central laboratory and pre -labelled with date and time point of  sampling, 
type of sample, patient identification and study number). Sample should be kept upright for a minimum of 2 hours at room temperature (18 –  25°C) following blood sampling (maximum 
time 72 h). Samples can be stored at - 20°C or –70°C and shipped to the central laboratory on 
dry ice. See Appendix 2 for a detailed sampling protocol.  
 
 
The “Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products conducted with the Paediatric Population” are followed during the conduct of GENA -05. The Committee 
recommends the below blood volume limits for sampling in neonates:  
Per individual, the  trial- related blood loss should not exceed 3 % of the total blood volume 
during a period of four weeks, and should not exceed 1% at any single time. The total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 ml/kg body weight; 3% is 2.4 ml blood per kg body weight.  
Time -points and required blood volume needs for laboratory parameters are as follows (all 
optional blood samplings are greyed out):

All treatment- emergent rise in AST or ALT to >3 x ULN will be followed by assessing liver 
function tests until their return to normal; or (in case of a priori increased values) until their 
return to the individual's baseline; or until a definite diagnosis is determined.  
If the abnormal values persist for more than 1 week, viral serology (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis 
C virus) and PCR testing will be performed by the local laboratory to rule out hepatitis B and  
C. In addition, PCR testing of the corresponding batches will be performed by the central lab.  
The Investigator  must  assess the clinical  significance  of abnormal  laboratory  values outside  the 
normal range as specified by the reference laboratory. Any clinically significant  abnormalities

should be fu lly investigated.  
Only laboratory abnormalities that have been rated as being clinically significant will be 
documented as AEs/ADRs. Clinically significant is defined as any laboratory abnormality that the Investigator feels is of clinical  concern, and/or  requires  medical  intervention and/or  follow - 
up. Additional  tests and other  evaluations  required to establish  the significance,  or aetiology of 
an abnormal  result  or to monitor the course  of an AE should be obtained if clinically  indicated. 
Any abnormal laboratory value that persists should be followed until resolution or for 14 days after the final study visit, whichever occurs first. Preferably, clinically significant lab abnormalities should be medically diagnosed and entered as  a diagnosis into the AE form, if 
not already present at  baseline.

All remaining  serum  and plasma volumes  will be labelled  and stored  as retention  samples at the 
central laboratory for at least 2 years after the completion of the study and until Octapharma’s 
written authorisation to destroy these  samples.  
7.3.4 Vital Signs and Physical  Examination  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temper ature) will be assessed at 
the following time -points: at screening, prior and – in case IMP was injected – 30-60 minutes 
after the end of the injection at 3 -monthly ( ± 2 weeks) visits, and prior and – in case IMP was 
injected – 30-60 minutes after the end of the injection at the completion visit. During surgical 
procedures vital signs will be assessed before, during and at the first post -operative day. 
A physical examination needs to be performed at screening, once every 6 months and at study completion.  
7.3.5 Other Relevant Safety  Information  
Post study related safety reports:  
Any ADR (i.e., any AE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP) that occurs after the completion of the study should be reported by the Investigator. The usual procedure for reportin g post -marketing safety information should be followed, but relation to the clinical 
study should be stated on the report.  
If a patient dies within 4 weeks after the last IMP administration, this should be reported as well, without being considered treatme nt-related or not.  
Overdose, interaction, abuse, misuse, medication error and lack of efficacy:  
The following safety  relevant  information  should be reported  as an AE or, if the reaction  fulfils 
one of the criteria for seriousness, as a SAE.  
Drug overdose:  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
Interaction:  
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product affects the activity of an IMP, i.e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be c learly identified as drug interaction.  
Misuse:  
Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside its described indication or outside the current state of the art medical practice (off -label -use). The reaction 
must be clearly identified as misuse.  
Medication error:  
Medicati on error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal 
product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, instructions for use/labelling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication error.

7.4 Other  Assessments  
 
7.4.1.1 Recovery investigation  (optional)  
 
A recovery investigation is recommended to be performed with the first Human -cl rhFVIII 
administration, or within the first three months after treatment start with Human -cl rhFVIII , in 
any case in a non -bleeding patient. A dose of 40 IU FVIII/kg BW will be administered and the 
in vivo recovery will be calculated from the FVIII levels before infusion and the peak level 
obtained from the 15 min and 1 hour post -infusion samples . Recovery investigations are 
recommended to be repeated approximately every 6 months.  
 
7.4.1.2 RNA Expression Analysis  (Optional)  
RNA expression analysis will optionally be performed in order to provide an understanding of 
the transcript activity of the genes inv olved in immune responses that may be responsible for 
FVIII inhibitor  formation  in patients  receiving  exogenous  FVIII.  RNA expression  analysis  will 
also be optionally  performed  on patients  undergoing ITI to provide  information  on the transcript 
activity of genes involved in immune tolerance. The analysis will be carried out using a customised PAXgene protocol in which RNA samples will be obtained by using commercially 
available PAXgene RNA blood collection tubes and customised microfuge tubes. This customised approach has previously been used in both a paediatric and animal study where samples volumes are limited (6),(7). The full protocol for this sub -study can be found in 
Appendix 2. 
 
7.4.1.3 Immunogenotyping (Partly  Optional)  
Immunogenotyping will be performed in order to investigate genetic factors that might influence development of FVIII inhibitors. It will include analysis of FVIII gene mutations, HLA- typing, immune response gene profiling and FVIII ethnic haplotype analysi s. FVIII 
mutation analysis is a required assessment, whereas HLA -typing, immune response gene 
profiling and FVIII ethnic haplotype are optional. Blood samples required for this analysis can be obtained at any time during the study, but it is recommended that they be obtained at the same time as the samples for scheduled study visits.  
 
7.4.1.4 In vitro immunogenicity of FVIII products  (optional)  
Immunogenicity  of Human- cl rhFVIII  will be assessed  by culturing peripheral  blood monocyte 
cells (PBMC) from the patients (including a positive control) with Human -cl rhFVIII. The 
nature of T cell response will be assessed by analysing cytokine expression (measured in a multiplex format) and T cell proliferation. Cytokines analysed will include IL -2, TNFα, IFNγ, 
IL-5, IL -6, IL-10, and IL -17 (TGFβ may also be included in an ELISA  format).  
7.5 Appropriateness of Measurements  
 
All measurements used for the assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII are in compliance with the requirements set up in the CHMP “Guideline on 
the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma -derived factor VIII products” 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) (5).

All FVIII inhibitor and FVIII plasma level samples obtained in the course of this study will be 
evaluated by an accredited central laboratory using validated methods and assays.  
If clinically indicated, FVIII and inhibitor testing can additionally be performed in the local laboratory. The results obtained locally will be recorded in the CRFs.  
 
8 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
8.1 Documentation of Data  
 
8.1.1 Source Data and  Records 
Source  data are defined  as all the information  related  to clinical  findings,  observations, or other 
activities in the study, written down in original records or certified copies of original records allowing reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical  study.  
The Investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g., case histories or patient fi les for 
each patient enrolled). Source records should be preserved for the maximum period of time required by local regulations. 
For each patient enrolled, the Investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the patient 
participates in this study.  
All data entered in the CRF must be supported by source data in the patient records with the exceptions listed in Section 8.1.2. 
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), Independent Ethics  Committee 
[IEC]/ Institutional Review Board  [IRB] review(s) and regulatory inspection(s), by providing 
direct access to source data/records.  
The Investigator may authorise  site staff (e.g., sub-Investigators, nurses)  to enter  study  data into 
the CRF. This must be documented in the “Delegation of Authority Log”, filled in and signed 
by the Investigator  responsible.  
8.1.2 Case Report  Forms  
For each patient enrolled, a CRF will be completed and signed by the Investigator or an authorised Co- Investigator. All forms will be filled out using an indelible pen, and must be 
legible.  
8.1.3 Changes to Case Report Form  Data  
Errors  occurring in CRFs  will be crossed  out without  obscuring the original  entry, the correction 
will be written alongside the initial entry, and the change will be initialled and dated by the Investigator or authorised study site personnel. When changes to CRF data are necessary following removal of the original CRF from the study site, any such changes will be documented on data clarification  / resolution  forms,  which  will be submitted  to the Investigator 
for signature. 
If reason  for the change  is not obvious,  then a reason  should be given. The Principal Investigator 
must,  as a minimum,  sign the final CRF  page  to attest the accuracy  and completeness of all the 
data. Once the data have been entered onto the database, they will be checked and any discrepancies will be raised an d returned to the Investigator for resolution. Data will be 
monitored and tabulated in accordance with the Data Management  Plan.

• Subpopulations of the ITT populations will  be 
• Subjects of each ethnic group 
• Subjects with ITI  treatment  
• Subjects with breakthrough bleedings, if appropriate  
• Subjects with surgical interventions, if appropriate  
• Subpopulations especially for inhibitor incidence  analysis:  
- Subjects with different FVIII gene  mutations  
- Subjects with/without family history of inhibitors  
- Subjects by classes of EDs prior to inhibitor  generation  
- Subjects by reason for treatment prior to inhibitor  generation  
- Subjects by intensity of treatment with/without peak treatment moments before 
inhibitor appearance (peak treatment moments defined as ≥3 subsequent days with FVIII dosing)  
- Subjects by classes of prophylactic treatment (amount and  frequency)  
• Population of s ubjects on prophylactic treatment schedule (PROPH):  All subjects in the 
ITT population who have at least one prophylactic  treatment  
• Per-protocol population of subjects on prophylactic treatment schedules (PROPH -PP): All 
subjects in the PP population who ha ve at least 100 EDs of treatment and who have no 
significant dosing or treatment errors, like e.g. unexplained interruptions of the prophylaxis with Human -cl rhFVIII  
• Population of bleedings (BLEED):  All documented bleeds -  except those occurring during 
and after surgery -  of subjects in the ITT population for  which  
• any amount of treatment with Human -cl rhFVIII is documented and which  
• start between first BE treated with Human -cl rhFVIII and the completion  visit.  
• Population of bleedings per protocol (BLEED -PP): All documented bleeds in the BLEED 
population of subjects in the PP  population.  
• Surgery population (SURG) : All documented surgical interventions of subjects in the ITT 
population for  which  
• any amount of Huma n-cl rhFVIII prior to, during or after the surgery is documented 
and 
• no other FVIII concentrate is documented within 24 hours prior to surgery. 
• Surgery per -protocol population (SURG -PP): All documented surgical interventions of 
subjects in the PP population for  which  
• any amount of Human -cl rhFVIII prior to, during or after the surgery is documented 
and 
• no other FVIII concentrate is documented within 72 hours prior to, during or after the 
surgery (until resuming regular prophylactic treatment or until discharge from hospital in case of a subject with on -demand treatment).  
The subject disposition, i.e. the  identification of significant violations to consider for the PP 
populations and the assignment of each subject, bleeding and surgery to these analysis 
populations, will be the joined decision of the trial statistician and the responsible medical 
expert pr ior to database lock.

The ITT population is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of immunogenicity data; 
the PROPH population is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of efficacy data on prophylaxis; the BLEED popula tion is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of 
efficacy data on bleedings and the SURG population is considered to be the most relevant for analysis of efficacy data on surgeries. To evaluate the robustness of the study results, efficacy analys es will also be done on basis of the respective PP population.  
9.2.2 Immunogenicity Analysis  Plan  
All recorded determinations of inhibitors against FVIII will be listed. The occurrence and 
cumulative incidence of inhibitors (inhibitor titre ≥ 0.6 and ≥ 5 BU respectively) will be 
presented  in total,  and as percentage of the analysis  population  with a 95% confidence  interval. 
If justified by the number of events, the time period until the first inhibitor activity will be 
tabulated and displayed graphically by means of a Kaplan -Meier plot of survival without 
inhibitor versus cumulative EDs, and a logistic re gression analysis of incidence rates of FVIII 
inhibitor development will be performed (prognostic factors: family history, weight, mean dose/ED, age, gene mutation defect, number of EDs before inhibitor development, age at first treatment, intensity of tre atment). Number of EDs before inhibitor development will be 
tabulated  for each patient  who develops  FVIII inhibitors.  Incidence of FVIII inhibitors  will also 
be presented grouped by ethnicity and FVIII gene mutations, incl. results of the immunogenotyping sub- study, if data are  available.  
Date from patients participating in sub -studies – RNA- expression analysis and the In vitro  
immunogenicity of FVIII products - will be evaluated by descriptive statistics.  
9.2.3 Efficacy Analysis  Plan  
Efficacy will be evaluated by descriptive statistics.  
• On bleeding rates (efficacy of prophylaxis) overall and by intensity of  prophylaxis  
• On efficacy assessments per bleed, basic bleed characteristics including severity, site 
and type 
• On efficacy assessments per  surgery  
• Recovery investigation (optional): a recovery investigation is recommended to be performed. This can be done with the first Human -cl rhFVI II administration, or within 
the first three  months  after treatment  start with Human- cl rhFVIII,  in any case in a non- 
bleeding  patient.  
The frequency  of bleeds,  the number  of infusions  needed  to treat a BE, the number  of EDs,  and 
study drug consumption data (FVIII IU/kg  per infusion, per BE, per month, per year)  per patient 
and in total will be evaluated.  Furthermore,  increased  and decreased  doses  of Human -cl rhFVIII 
used to treat individual BEs (frequency and relative magnitude of dose changes) will be evaluated, as well as changes in the doses per infusion and changes in the total dose used to treat subsequent BEs of the same type (e.g. elbow, knee, etc.) in the same  patient (frequency 
and relative magnitude of dose  changes).  
9.2.4 Safety Analysis  Plan  
All AEs occurring after initiation of study treatments (including events likely to be related to the underlying disease, or a concomitant illness or medication or clinical si gnificant 
abnormalities in laboratory parameters or vital signs) will be displayed in summary tables, listings and figures.

Incidences of AEs will be given as numbers and percentages of patients and infusions with:  
• Any AE. 
• Any serious  AE. 
• Any AE probably or possibly related to the trial  drug. 
• Any AE that begins within 24 hours of the end of an infusion.  
• Any severe  AE. 
• Any withdrawal due to  AE. 
• Any AE by MedDRA preferred term.  
• Any AE by MedDRA System Organ Class  (SOC).  
Summary tables for AEs will be given by SOC and preferred term. Additionally, AEs will be 
summarised  by severity  and relationship  to study treatment.  These summary  tables will  feature 
total counts and counts by age group, sex, prior EDs to Human -cl rhFVIII and total amount of 
Human -cl rhFVIII used prior to the AE to evaluate the need of further investigation of any 
apparent pattern or trend in AE  rates.  
The MedDRA coded terms and the corresponding original (verbatim) terms used by the Investigator will be listed.  
Vital signs  
Blood pressure (sys tolic/diastolic), heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature will be 
tabulated, and the sample characteristics will be presented by time point.  
Routine laboratory data  
Routine laboratory parameters (haematology, clinical chemistry) will be listed for all patients, using indicators for values outside the associated reference ranges. Changes from baseline (screening) will be provided where  appropriate.  
9.2.5 Resource Use Analysi s Plan 
The statistical analysis of resource use parameters will be descriptive.  
Continuous characteristics (i.e. drug usage, duration of hospitalisation, days lost at work, etc.) will be described in terms of mean/median/ standard deviation and range). Dic hotomous or 
categorical variables (i.e. number of hospitalisations, CVAD use, etc.) will be described by frequency tables and percentages.  
If applicable, results will also be presented per subgroup. 
Health economic modelling analysis with resource use parameters is planned at study closure.  
9.2.6 Handling of Missing Data  
In general, missing data will not be imputed: calculations pertaining to person- year 
computations will be based on observed values only. Only in case of missing BW, the last 
available weight measurement will be used for calculating the dose per kg bodyweight (last observation carried forward).

Appendix 2: RNA Expression Sub- Study 
 
Inhibitory antibody formation remains the greatest challenge in the management of severe 
haemophilia  A. The focus  of genetics studies  of inhibitor risk has been  on variations  / mutations 
in the inherited DNA sequences of the factor VIII (FVIII) gene (causative haemophilia mutation or FVIII wild type haplotype) and genes involved in the immune response (e.g. IL - 
10, TNF -α and CTLA -4). However, such DNA based technology only gives the baseline gene 
profile of the individual without taking into account the dynamic changes that will occur in actual gene expression around the time of exposure to a novel immunogenic stimulus. Quantitative assessment of transcribed messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) offers a way of measuring differential changes in gene activity in these circumstances. Although technology 
for assessment of mRNA expression has been available for some years, the arrival of next 
generation sequencing (RNA -Seq) offers the ability to perform high throughput analysis of 
gene transcript activity on small volumes of venous blood in the setting of an international clinical study. This technology offers the ability to sequence the gene transcript products of millions  of genes from  each clinical  sample.  This enables  an unbiased  assessment  of the genes 
involved in the immune  response  as well as other  potential  novel  biological  pathways  that may 
prove to be of key importance in the process of inhibitor  formation.  
 
This is the first clinical study to prospectively evaluate changes in gene expression around the time of exposure  to exogenous  FVIII  and during immune  tolerance induction. Measurement  of 
real-time changes in mRNA expression may give further insight into the complex dynamic 
proce sses and pathways involved with the aim of identifying “bio- signatures” that can predict 
those  at greatest  risk of inhibitor  formation  or failure  of immune  tolerance induction. Sampling 
of mRNA is feasible in a paediatric study as it only requires small volumes of venous whole blood. Due to instability in mRNA and changes in gene expression following phlebotomy, stabilisation is required at the point of collection (1,2,3). Modifications of commercially 
available stabilisation systems have been successfully trialled in both paediatric and animal studies demonstrating satisfactory mRNA yields whilst minimising required blood volumes (4,5).  
 
RNA Expression Analysis Sampling Schedule  
Formal written consent should be obtained at study entry for storage of whole blood (mRNA) samples for research purposes to investigate the mechanisms of inhibitor formation / immune tolerance.  
For a patient enrolled on this optional sub- study, peripheral venous blood samples will be 
collected on commencement of Human -cl rhFVIII treatment at the time points shown in table 
1. A screening sample (prior to first FVIII exposure) is necessary to proceed with follow up samples. If the screening sample is missed, do not collect subsequent follow up samples. However, these patients could still be enrolled in the ITI RNA -Seq study (see Table 2), 
with a new pre -ITI baseline sample and subsequent follow up samples.

RNA Expression Study Materials  
Investigation centres will be provided with centrally prepared customized PAXgene mRNA sampling tubes. The materials required for this study are as follows:  
1) Customized PAXgene mRNA sampling tube: sterile(RNAse / DNAse free) cryovial 
(4.5 mL volume) containing 2.76mL PAXgene reagent (ratio 1mL blood : 2.76mL 
reagent)  (provided)  
2) Sterile butterfly / winged infusion kit (not provided)  
3) Sterile 1mL syringe (not provided)  
4) Sterile gloves (not provided)  
5) Skin surface wipe (not  provided)  
 
RNA Expression Sampling Protocol  
1) Keep RNA expression sample tube at room temperature (18 –  25°C) prior to 
sampling. Do not re -use once  opened.  
2) Collect 1mL venous blood into a 1mL sterile  syringe using the local centre’s protocol 
for venepuncture, wearing sterile  gloves. 
3) Open PAXgene sample tube and directly transfer 1mL of venous blood following 
venepuncture into the PAXgene  tube. 
4) Close sample tube. 
5) Gently invert the customized PAXgene tube 8 to 10 times.  
6) Label sample with patient identifiable information / study number / and study time - 
point.  
RNA Expression Transportation and Storage Protocol  
1) Keep sample upright for 4- 6 hours at room temperature (18 – 25°C) following 
blood sampling, prior to freezing. Early freezing of samples will substantially 
decrease the RNA  yield. 
2) Freeze sample at –70°C in a wire rack (not a stryofoam tray as this may lead to sample tubes  cracking).  
Appendix 2  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 05 
01-Feb-2018  Amended Study Protocol No. GENA -05  
  
3) Transport frozen PAXgene stabilised RNA study samples to LabCorp (LabCorp 
Clinical Trials, Laboratory Services, 8490 Upland Dr, Ste. 100, Englewood, CO 
80112, USA) on dry ice. 
4) RNA Samples kept at - 70°C will be stable for a period of up to 60 months  (6). 
 
RNA Extraction and Transcriptosome Analysis  
All extraction, purification of RNA and next generation sequencing (RNA -Seq) will be 
performed  at The Genome  Centre,  John Vane  Science Centre,  United  Kingdom. Interpretation 
of results will be performed by Dr Paul Batty / Dr Daniel Hart in collaboration with the 
Bioinformatics Department at The Genome Centre, John Vane Science Centre, United Kingdom.

Exposure Therapy  8

2.  ABSTRACT    10 
 11 
Studies of active duty  service members have shown that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent 12 
condition and that service members who screen positive for PTSD are more than twice as likely to make a suicide 13 
attempt (Hoge et al., 2004; Nock et al., 2014). Research has shown that evidence- based PTSD treatments can 14 
reduce suicidal ideation (Gradus, Suvak, Wisco, Marx, & Resick, 2013; Bryan et al., 2016); however, it is challenging 15 
to provide these treatments to high- risk service members on an acute inpatient unit because they require more time 16 
and resources than are typically afforded during inpatients stays.  Written Exposure Therapy (WET)  is an evidence- 17 
based,  5-session treatment for managing PTSD ( Sloan et al., 2018) . WET , adapted for treatment of co- morbid PTSD 18 
and su icidality,  may overcome many implementation challenges  in an inpatient acute care treatment setting (e.g., 19 
minimal therapist -patient contact, nominal time needed to train therapists, treatment brevity, and low attrition) . 20 
Additionally, pi lot data indicate that WET  reduces suicidal ideation. To directly target suicidal risk and PTSD this 21 
study will use a new formulation of WET referred to as WET -for suicide, or WET -S, that includes crisis response 22 
planning (CRP) for suicide prevention to  the WET condition. W ET-S will be delivered in a condensed or “massed’ 23 
treatment format, consisting of at least one WET -S session each day.  24 
 25 
The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to  determine if five 60-minute sessions of Written Exposure 26 
Therapy for Suicide ( WET -S) reduces the presence, frequency, and severity of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, 27 
suicide gestures, suicide attempts, non- suicidal self -injurious behaviors, and re- hospitalization for suicidality and if 28 
WET -S reduces posttraumatic stress ( PTS) symptom severity among 124 service members and veterans admitted to 29 
an acute psychiatric inpatient unit for co -morbid suicide ideation  (SI) or attempt and PTSD or posttraumatic stress 30 
(PTS) compared with Treatment as Usual ( TAU). Treatment will be adm inistered during the acute inpatient stay and, 31 
if necessary, after discharge into outpatient behavioral health,  to complete the five sessions . Participants will be 32 
assessed at pre- treatment , post-treatment, and then 1- and 4-months after treatment completi on.  33

 36 
Purpose:   The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of five 60-minute sessions 37 
of Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide ( WET -S) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) compared with TAU in high- risk, 38 
suicidal service members , veterans , and DEERS eligible beneficiaries  with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or 39 
posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS S). 40 
 41 
Research Aims and Hypotheses:    42 
Aim 1 : Determine if Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide (WET -S) reduces the presence, frequency, and severity of 43 
suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, non- suicidal self -injurious behaviors, and re- 44 
hospitalization for suicidality  measured by the Self -Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI; Nock et al., 45 
2007) among service members ,veterans , and DEERS eligible beneficiaries   admitted to an acute psychiatric 46 
inpatient unit for suicidal ideation (SI) and/or attempt with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or posttraumatic 47 
stress symptoms (PTS S) compared with Treatment as Usual (TAU).  48 
Hypothesis 1. Compared with TAU  alone , WET -S + TAU will result in significantly greater reductions in 49 
suicide -related outcomes pre -treatment to 1- and 4- months follow -up. 50 
 51 
Aim 2: Determine if Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide (WET -S) reduces posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) 52 
severity measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM- 5 (CAPS- 5; Weathers, Blake, Schnur r, 53 
Kaloupek, Marx & Keane, 2013) among service members , veterans , and DEERS eligible beneficiaries   admitted 54 
to an acute psychiatric inpatient unit for suicidal ideation ( SI) or attempt and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or 55 
PTSS compared with Treatment as Usual ( TAU.)  56

  Page 2 of 14 Hypothesis 2. Compared with TAU  alone , WET -S + TAU will result in significantly greater reductions in 57 
PTSS severity from pre- to post -treatment, 1- month, and 4- month follow -up. 58 
 59 
Aim 3: Determine if reductions in posttraumatic stress  symptoms  (PTSS) severity  mediate the association between 60 
treatment condition and suicide- related outcomes (suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, non- suicidal self - 61 
injurious behaviors, and re- hospitalizations) measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM- 5 (CAPS- 62 
5) and the Self -Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI).  63 
Hypothesis 3. WET -S + TAU will demonstrate an indirect effect on suicide- related outcomes through greater 64 
reductions in PTS symptoms  as compared with TAU .  65 
 66 
4.  MILITARY RELEVANCE   67 
 68 
Currently, service members and veterans have unacceptably high rates of suicidal behavior and PTSD. The 69 
military’s immediate and long- term mission readiness would benefit from a brief, easily implemented, evidence- 70 
based intervention that meaningfully reduces the future risk of suicide among service members  with PTSD and 71 
improves morale. Active duty work and schedule demands require efficient treatment delivery models (e.g., 72 
treatment delivered in a condensed format of consecutive daily sessions) and psychiatric inpatient treatment 73 
focused on suicide risk stabilization is typically a short time period. Because WET -S is brief, easy to administer, and 74 
requires fewer resources and training to administer, it could very easily be scaled up and disseminated. This 75 
advantage would allow service members to engage in this therapeutic technique in a variety of settings (e.g., home, 76 
barracks, in theatre) with a high degree of privacy and a significantly reduced effort by already overburdened 77 
military mental health providers. This privacy and flexibility may help reduce stigma concerns. This project targets 78 
active duty military personnel at varying stages of psychiatric care: the inpatient stay, the high- risk p ost-discharge 79 
period, and the return to living within their military communities. WET -S can be disseminated easily across DoD to 80 
reduce suicidal behavior among service members  and veterans. Overall, although we expect that WET -S will prove 81 
useful to the general population, we believe this time- efficient, cost -effective, and easily implemented intervention 82 
holds special promise for improving the prevention of suicidal behavior among service members  and veterans . 83 
 84 
5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE    85 
 86 
Studies of active duty service members have shown that PTSD is a prevalent condition and that service members 87 
who screen positive for the disorder are more than twice as likely to make a suicide attempt (Hoge et al., 2004; Nock 88 
et al., 2014). Research has shown that evidence- based PTSD treatments can reduce suicidal ideation (Gradus, 89 
Suvak, Wisco, Marx, & Resick, 2013; Bryan et al., 2016); however, it is challenging to provide most of these 90 
treatments to high- risk service members on an acute inpatient unit because they require more time and resources 91 
than are typically afforded during inpatients stays. This means that those with PTSD who are at highest suicide risk 92 
are not receiving treatment for PTSD until they are discharged from the hospital and there is no available evidence to 93 
suggest that treatment as usual in inpatient psychiatric settings reduces the likelihood of suicide after  discharge.  94 
 95 
WET  is a 5-session treatment that is included in the 2017 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for managing PTSD 96 
(2017). WET is associated with large within- and between- group effect sizes that are comparable with other 97 
evidence- based PTSD treatments (Sloan, Marx, et al., 2018). Sloa n and colleagues (2012) examined the efficacy of 98 
WET relative to wait list (WL) comparison condition delivered to men and women who had a diagnosis of PTSD 99 
related to a motor vehicle accident. Intent to treat findings indicated a very large between group differences (Cohen’s 100 
d = 2.49 and 2.19 at post -treatment and 3- month follow -up, respect ively), with 91% of participants no longer meeting 101 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD 6 months following treatment (Sloan et al., 2012). Moreover, WET was associated with 102 
low attrition (n = 2; 9%) and high treatment satisfaction ratings. Next, WET was compared w ith Cognitive Processing 103 
Therapy for PTSD, a first - line PTSD treatment that is much more time intensive than WET, in a non- inferiority trial. 104 
Participants in both treatment s displayed a significant reduction in PTSD symptom severity (large within group ef fect 105 
sizes) .  However, a significant treatment condition difference in dropout  was also observed, with 39% dropout in CPT 106 
compared with 6% in WET (Sloan et al. (2018). Thus, WET may overcome many implementation challenges in an 107 
inpatient acute care treatment setting (e.g., minimal therapist -patient contact, nominal time needed to train therapists, 108 
treatment brevity, and low attrition). Preliminary data suggest that WET also reduces suicidal ideation. Specifically, 109 
secondary analysis of data from the WET vs.  CPT study  sample demonstrated that among those who received WET  110 
and who endorsed SI at baseline (n = 18 of 63; 28.57%), a significant effect of linear time was observed (B = 0.338, 111 
SE = 0.07, p<.001), indicating that participants were significantly less likely to endorse SI over time. Roughly half of 112 
those who endorsed SI  at baseline no longer endorsed SI 60 weeks later . 113

  Page 3 of 14 To directly target suicidal risk and PTSD among service members admitted to an acute psychiatric inpatient unit  the 115 
study will use a new formulation of WET referred to as WET -for suicide or WET -S that includes crisis response 116 
planning (CRP) for suicide prevention to the WET condition. CRP is a brief strategy that reduces suicide attempts 117 
among military personnel by 76% compared with typical suicide risk management strategies (Bryan et al., 2017a). 118 
CRP also  contributes to significantly faster reductions in suicide ideation (Bryan et al., 2017a), as well as immediate 119 
reductions in emotional distress and suicidal intent (Bryan et al., 2017b). WET -S aims to work synergistically by 120 
addressing trauma- related symptoms or cognitive- affective states (e.g., intrusive thoughts, self -blame, hyperarousal) 121 
that are both PTSD treatment targets and warning signs for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Bryan, 2016; Bryan, 122 
Grove, & Kimbrel, 2017). The development and review of CRP aims to support the regulation of these trauma- 123 
focused cognitive- affective states (among other patient warning signs) while the patient engages in trauma- focused 124 
treatment through the WET protocol.  125 
 126 
WET -S will be delivered in a condensed or “massed’ treatment format, consisting of at least one WET -S session 127 
each day. For some patients, two WET -S sessions per day may be considered with the objective  that the protocol 128 
is completed prior to discharge. Recent data support condensed formats version of evidenced -based cognitive 129 
behavioral therapies for PTSD work equally well as the spaced (weekly) version with significantly less dropout (Foa 130 
et al., 2018; Fredman et al., 2018; Peterson et al., 2018). Although primary data exist to support reductions in suicide 131 
risk with WET, it has yet to be tested with patients at high risk for suicide requiring inpatient hospitalization 132 
management. Therefore, as a part of risk management strategies for the experimental treatment of WET with this 133 
population we are including increased suicide risk monitoring and management by the inclusion of CRP in the WET 134 
condition (WET -S). WET -S will be delivered in five sessions, with the allowance of an additional two WET -S 135 
sessions, based on therapist judgment to support good end state functioning  and treatment goals to reduce PTS 136 
symptoms.  137 
 138 
Telehealth is an essential and safe mode of delivering mental health services, to include the delivery of exposure- 139 
based PTSD treatment17, 18. Telehealth is broadly defined as behavioral health services  that are delivered via 140 
communication technologies including telephone and clinical video teleconferencing. Because of the physical 141 
distancing recommendations in place with the COVID -19 pandemic, all assessment and treatment sessions for this 142 
study will occur using a computer or tablet talking over a secure line in real -time with the research staff using a 143 
computer in his or her office. The video telehealth platform used for these communications is HIPAA -compliant. 144 
While participants are in care at the CRDAMC inpatient unit, the computer or tablet will be provided by the staff to 145 
use for study procedures only. For sessions or assessment that occur after participants are discharged from inpatient 146 
care, participants will need to use a computer with high speed internet access (e.g., broad- band internet connection 147 
of at least 384kbps at 720 pixels) to support the telehealth platform. The computer must be equipped with speakers 148 
or a standard headphone jack to be able to hear and speak with the research staff. Participants will also need to 149 
have access to a private location with the ability to control access during assessment and treatment sessions to 150 
ensure your privacy and confidentiality.  If participant does not have access to a computer in a private location, t hey 151 
can come to the STRONG STAR offices located at the Shoemaker Center on Fort Hood and use a computer in one 152 
of our offices  153

6.  RESEARCH DESIGN   155 
 156 
The proposed randomized controlled trial will examine the efficacy of the WET -S + TAU compared with TAU alone 157 
among high- risk, suicidal service members and veterans with PTSD or PTS S admitted to the CRDAMC acute 158 
inpatient psychiatry unit for suicide risk.  Assessment and treatment session will be delivered via a HIPAA compliant 159 
video telehealth platform. The design overview of the study is summarized in Figure 1.  160

 215 
7.1.4. Description of the Recruitment and Prescreening Process .  Under a waiver HIPAA Authorization for screening, 216 
study staff will collaborate with CRDAMC staff to identify potential participants who have been admitted for suicide 217 
thoughts and/or suicidal behaviors  and that have symptoms of PTS as documented as part of  the admission 218 
assessments .  219 
 220 
7.1.5. Pre-Screening and Consent Process . A CRDAMC staff member will identify potential participants 221 
as part of their admission assessment of new patients. UTHSCSA STRONG STAR staff will attend the unit morning 222 
meeting via telephone. Following the morning meeting, a CRDAMC inpatient staff member will introduce the 223 
UTHSCSA STRONG STAR staff to the patient  via a HIPAA compliant video telehealth platform. Potential participants 224 
will be approached to consider participation in this study as soon as is practically and clinically feasible after their 225 
initial evaluation and stabilization.  An authorized and trained member of the research team will engage the pot ential 226 
participant in an interactive explanation of the study guided by the informed consent document (ICD). During the 227

  Page 5 of 14 psychiatry unit . The potential participant will be given a copy of the informed consent document (ICD) to read.  After 229 
the potential participant has read the ICD, they will be given the opportunity to discuss the research with family and 230 
friends.  Once the potential participant has reached a decision, a member of the study team will again review with the 231 
participant the purpose of study, duration of study, study procedures, the experimental components of the study, the 232 
potential risks and discomforts, the potential benefits, any alternatives to participation, protection of participant’s 233 
confidentiality, and the contact information for both the researchers and the regulatory bodies overseeing the 234 
conduct of the study to ensure the participant has an understanding of the study. If the individual is agreeable to 235 
participation , the informed consent document will be signed electronically or on paper form by the participant.  A 236 
clean copy of the informed consent form will be given to the patient.  During the course of the study, the research 237 
team will be available to answer any questions about the research, and  ongoing discussions will occur to ensure the 238 
participant’s questions and concerns are addressed. Baseline assessment for screening will occur after consent.   239 
 240 
7.1.6. Subject Screening Procedures . Once the informed consent is completed, participants will complete the 241 
baseline questionnaires and study interviews with the Independent Evaluator (IE) to ensure inclusion and exclusion 242 
criteria are met. The first choice will be for the participant to complete all measures online through a secured 243 
electronic  link. Interview assessments will be conducted using a HIPAA -compliant video telehealth platform.  In the 244 
event there are technical difficulties, consent and self -report assessment measures may be completed on paper.  245 
 246 
7.1.7. Compensation for participation .  Participants will not be compensated for participation.  247 
 248 
7.1.8. Treatment Procedures.    249 
 250 
Written Exposure Therapy -for Suicide (WET -S). Typically,  WET -S consists of 5 treatment sessions, each lasting 251 
approximately 60 minutes, with the exception of the first session which will last 90 minutes. Each session includes a 252 
written exposure exercise for participants randomized to the WET+TAU arm. The first s ession will consist of the 253 
therapist educating the participant about common reactions to trauma and providing information regarding the 254 
rationale of WET -S as a treatment for PTSD. The participant will then be given general instructions for completing 255 
the trauma narratives, specific instructions for completing the first session, and will then complete the first narrative 256 
writing session. Participants will be instructed to write about the same trauma experience during each session. This 257 
event will be the same event identified as the index trauma during the baseline assessment session. The importance 258 
of delving into their deepest emotions surrounding the trauma event is emphasized, as well as the importance of 259 
providing detailed information about the event. All  WET -S sessions will take place via a HIPAA- compliant video 260 
telehealth platform in a private room on the inpatient ward while being monitored by inpatient staff. The participant 261 
will be provided with the writing instructions and the provider will remain virtually connected with the patient while the 262 
writing session is completed.   Writing instructions begin with a focus on describing the details of the trauma and 263 
emotions and thoughts that occurred during the traumatic event and then change to a focus on the  meaning of the 264 
trauma event (e.g., what the event has meant to the person, how it has changed the way they view his or her life). 265 
Based on regular consultation between the treating therapist and supervising investigators, 1 to 2 additional WET -S 266 
sessions will be provided to ensure the rationale of WET -S as a treatment for PTSD is understood by the participant 267 
and to allow for a full course of WET -S sessions. WET -S will be delivered in a condensed or “massed’ treatment 268 
format, consisting of at least one WET -S session each day until the treatment is complete.  For some  participants , 269 
two WET -S sessions per day may be considered to complete the protocol prior to discharge  if possible . However, i f 270 
participants are discharged from inpatient care prior to completing the WET -S protocol, WET -S will continue  using a 271 
secure HIPAA -compliant video telehealth platform.  272 
 273 
 274 
WET -S treatment also includes the development and monitoring of a Crisis Response Plan (CRP) for suicide risk. 275 
Participants assigned to WET -S will complete the CRP prior to beginning their writing in session 1. Patient use of the 276 
CRP since the previous session will be briefly reviewed at the start of each WET -S session to manage safety and 277 
problem solve fluctuations in risk during treatment.  278 
 279 
Treatment As Usual (TAU).  The TAU condition consists of daily contact and patient centered care by the acute 280 
psychi atric inpatient unit provider team (e.g., psychiatrists, therapists, case managers, behavioral health techs). TAU 281 
includes initial psychiatric stabilization, nurse case management, medication management, psychoeducation groups, 282 
and discharge planning. Patients engage with the provider team daily  and have structured times for psychoeducation 283 
groups,  case management, medication management,  hygiene, and meals . 284

7.3.2.1  Instrumentation.  See the table in  Section 7.3 for a summary of the assessments and timing of 295 
administration.  A description of each of the assessments can be found at the end of this protocol.  Assessments will 296 
be administered via a secure HIPAA- compliant video telehealth platform, phone, in person, or electronic data capture 297 
using a secure link to the encrypted STRONG STAR database. Reasonable efforts will be made to collect all data as 298 
described in this protocol, but we expect some participants may not be able to complete part or all of any given fol low 299 
up assessment.  300 
 301 
7.3.2.2 Data Storage , Access and Protection  302 
Interviews and treatment sessions will occur using a secure HIPAA -compliant video telehealth platform. Data will be 303 
stored by an assigned participant code number so the data records can be viewed only by password- authenticated, 304 
authorized investigators and study personnel. Recordings will be labeled with participant's study ID number. Through 305 
our secured password protected server there is no option for the reviewers to download or otherwise sav e the 306 
recordings to their computers. Every member of the Research Team will be trained and monitored about how to 307 
handle and protect research records. Only authorized study staff, and members of the STRONG STAR Biostatistics 308 
and Data Management Core staff will have access to either the raw data or electronic study data. Any hard copies of 309 
data collected during treatment will be placed into a lock box which will be transported by car to the UTHSCSA 310 
STRONG STAR offices by a STRONG STAR staff member who will place it into the locked cabinets at the STRONG 311 
STAR offices.  312 
 313 
Data will be entered into the STRONG STAR password protected database housed on a secure UTHSCSA server 314

controls access to study data.  342 
   343 
Additionally, as a requirement of the funding of this study by the Military Suicide Research Consortium (MSRC), the 344 
research team is required to administer the MSRC Common Demographics (CDem) and Data Elements (CDE) and 345 
upload a limited data set (with dates but without other identifiers) as a SPSS file to the MSRC website housed at 346

 355 
7.4 Statistical Consideration   356 
 357 
7.4.1 Sample Size Estimation.  Based on our prior work, we expected WET -S to have a very large effect on both PTSD 358 
symptoms and suicide -related outcomes  over and above TAU. However, to be conservative given tempered 359 
expectations in this yet unstudied population, we powered the study to detect small to medium sized effects for the group 360 
by time interaction. Power was estimated using Repeated Measures and Sample Size computer software, accessible at 361 
https://rmass.org. Assuming subject level randomization, a quadratic design matrix for the time effect, a 1- tailed alpha 362 
level of .05, desired power of .80, equal sized treatment groups at  baseline, an overall expected 15% attrition rate, a 363 
stationary AR1 error correlation matrix starting at a modest r = .30, and desire to be able to detect at least a conventional  364 
small to medium sized effect (d = .35) at the final assessment, the desired total sample size we intend to recruit is N = 365 
124 (n = 62/group), a feasible recruitment goal given the targeted population.  366 
 367 
7.4.2 Primary (i.e., primary outcome variables) and secondary endpoints . The primary dependent variables for suicidality 368 
are the Self -Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) interview and the Depression Symptom Index -Suicidality 369 
Subscale (DSI -SS) self -report.  The primary dependent variables for PTS symptoms and PTSD are the Clinician 370 
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS- 5) interview and the PTSD CheckList -5 (PCL -5) self -report.  Secondary endpoints 371 
include associated psychopathology (severity scores on measures of depression, general anxiety, anger, and PTSD - 372 
related cognitions)  373 
 374 
7.4.3 Data Analyses.  To examine hypothesis 1 (determine if WET -S + TAU reduces presence (past month), frequency, 375 
and severity of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, and non- suicidal self -injurious 376 
behaviors and re- hospitalizations related to suicidality relative to TAU only and hypothesis 2 (determine if WET -S + TAU 377

19-290H Peterson Form BB 05- 17-22 U     
  Page 8 of 14 reduces PTS symptom severity relative to TAU only) , we will conduct intent -to-treatment (ITT) analyses including all 378 
randomized participants who attend at least the first therapy session. General or Generalized Linear Mixed Effects 379 
models, depending on the nature of the specific outcome, will be implemented for the primary ITT randomized 380 
comparison of total CAPS- 5 scores as well as SITBI variables of interest and number of subsequent inpatient 381 
hospitalizations for suicidal behavior. The planned statistical design includes fixed effects for treatment (between- 382 
groups), time (within- subjects), and the group by time interaction. This latter effect captures differences in changes over 383 
time between the groups; as such it is the effect of substantive interest in each of the models that will be examined. 384 
Advantages of the general(ized) linear mixed effects model include the ability to include cases with missing data 385 
(assumed missing at random), flexible specification of the covariance structure among the repeated measures, the ability 386 
to model nonlinear trajectories of change over time, and the ability to perform between- and within- groups contrasts both 387 
at and across assessments to examine significant group by time interactions. Prior to performing statistical analyses, the 388 
data will be inspected to determine the advisability of scale transformation to normalize distributions (where applicable) 389 
or reduce variance heterogeneity and to identify missing data, outliers, or other unusual features that may be influential. 390 
To test h ypothesis 3, growth curve modeling will be used to examine mediation. Specifically, treatment condition will be 391 
entered as a predictor of change in both PTS symptom severity and suicide related outcomes. To achieve mediation, 392 
WET -S +TAU would achieve superior reductions in suicide related outcomes and PTS symptom severity relative to TAU 393 
only. Finally, we will examine the indirect effect of treatment condition on suicide related outcome change via PTSD 394 
symptom change. Identification of an indirect effect would allow us to conclude that WET -S + TAU’s superior effect on 395 
suicide risk relative to TAU only is mediated by changes in PTS symptoms.  396 
 397 
7.7 C onfidentiality.   All video telehealth therapy sessions and interview assessments will be conducted in private offices 398 
in the CRDAMC acute inpatient psychiatry unit and then via video telehealth from a private location of the participant's 399 
choosing once the  participant is discharged from inpatient care. All assessment interviews and WET -S treatment 400 
sessions speaking with the therapist will be recorded  using an audio- recorder external to the HIPAA compliant telehealth 401 
platform. Recordings will be labeled with the participant’s study ID number.  402 
The recordings will be uploaded to a secure password protected server immediately after the session is completed.  The 403 
recording will then be deleted from the recorder. Study staff will be responsible to upload the audio- recording as soon as 404 
possible and then deleting the recording from the audio -recorder.  405 
 406 
7.7.1 Certificate of Confidentiality.   We are not seeking a Certificate of Confidentiality.  407 
 408 
7.7.2 Long Term Data Storage.  A STRONG STAR Repository has been approved by the UTHSCSA 409 
(HSC20100475H) IRB to enable the STRONG STAR Consortium to store specimens and data for future use. The 410 
STRONG STAR Repository  is a large comprehensive database of information, biological specimens and 411 
neuroimages related to the identification, assessment, and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 412 
insomnia, pain, and related behavioral health conditions.  All information entered into the STRONG STAR Repository  413 
will be extracted from primary datasets collected as part of IRB -approved studies, including this study, being 414 
conducted and /or supported in collaboration with the UTHSCSA STRONG STAR Consortium.  Study databases are 415 
established and maintained by the Data Management and Biostatistics Core of the STRONG STAR Consortium.  A 416 
unique, sequential alpha- numeric STRONG STAR ID will be assigned to each participant at the time of recruitment 417 
into this study. However, all Repository data will be identified with a different code number that can be cross linked to 418 
the original study code only through records maintained by the STRONG STAR Data Management and Biostatistics 419 
Core. At the conclusion of this study, participants who signed the consent to have their data placed in the STRONG 420 
STAR Repository  will be maintained under the UTHSCSA IRB -approved Repository protocol.  For participants who 421 
decline participation in the STRONG STAR Repository , at the conclusion of the study their data will be de- identified 422 
and the data maintained in the Repository without identifiers.  423

 425 
8.0 RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT  426 
 427 
8.1 R isks.    428 
 429 
Likely but not Serious (expected to occur in more than 1 in 5 participants): 430 
• Participating in mental health treatment and research might increase some symptoms and increase the risk 431 
of feeling emotionally uncomfortable in the short term, which might increase the desire for suicide 432 
temporarily. This increase is usually not severe, however, and does not last long. Preliminary work with 433 
these interventions suggest participants typically experience decreased emotional distress immediately 434 
afterwards.  435 
Version: 07-27-22 
Decreasing Suicide Risk among Service Members with Posttraumatic Stress Using Written Exposure Therapy  
 
19-290H Peterson Form BB 05- 17-22 U     
  Page 9 of 14 • Possibility of becoming emotionally upset or experiencing an initial increase of PTSD symptoms due to the 436 
discussion or journaling of traumatic events.  437 
 438 
Rare and Serious (expected to occur in less than 5 out of 100 participants):  439 
• With the handling of medical and research records there is always the possibility of a breach of 440 
confidentiality. However, every effort is made to protect the privacy of participants. Every member of the 441 
research team is carefully trained and monitored about how to store, handle, and protect participant records.  442 
• Assessment and therapy sessions that are conducted via video telehealth are subject to risks to 443 
confidentiality if others  in the CRDAMC inpatient ward or home or other location can hear what is being said 444 
during the encounter. To minimize this risk, while in the inpatient ward participants will be placed in a private 445 
room while monitored by a CRDAMC staff member when doing s tudy activities. When the patient is 446 
completing a video telehealth therapy session or assessment following discharge from the inpatient ward, 447 
participants will be encouraged to use headphones and to find a quiet area of the home to hold the 448 
encounter. Also, although video telehealth sessions are transmitted securely, there is always a risk that 449 
others (not affiliated with this research) could breach the network security systems and access the 450 
information. Ensuring that the participant has a virus protection on his or her computer will minimize this risk.  451 
• It is possible that technical difficulties will result in missing a scheduled treatment session. The research 452 
team will work closely with participants to solve technical problems to minimize missed treatment  time and 453 
also to re- schedule and conduct missed treatment sessions as soon as possible.  454 
 455 
Risks of Suicidality Thoughts and Behaviors or a PTSD Di agnosis regardless of Treatment.  One of the risks 456 
of suicidality thoughts and behaviors as well as PTSD both in and out of treatment is attempted suicide, which can 457 
result in death.   Prior research has shown that, following a suicide attempt, up to half of patients in treatment make 458 
another suicide attempt. If the suicide attempt occurs within the first year of t reatment, on average a patient will 459 
attempt suicide 2.5 times.   However, safeguards for protecting participants are planned as described below.  460 
 461 
Safeguards for Protecting Participants .  462 
 463 
Because encounters will be conducted through video telehealth while the participant is on the inpatient ward, a 464 
CRDAMC staff member will monitor the visit while also allowing for privacy. Following discharge, when engaged in 465 
video telehealth sessions, participants will be asked to provide the name, phone number and address of a participant 466 
support person who is at least 18 years of age, able to be contacted by phone and can arrive to the participant's 467 
location within 30 minutes in an emergency.  468 
 469 
Any indication that the participant is considering suicide will be handled following care facility SOPs and using 470 
processes developed by military and civilian consultants to the STRONG STAR Consortium. Trained clinicians and 471 
evaluators will assess history of suicide and current suicidal ideation using standardized me asures. Treatment that 472 
takes place while the participant is on the inpatient unit  includes standard procedures within the unit for managing 473 
suicide risk and is a treatment milieu focused on managing acute suicide risk.  Any treatment sessions or 474 
assessments  completed in outpatient care via video telehealth will follow standard suicide risk management 475 
procedures. CRDAMC acute inpatient psychiatric unit has a standard operating procedure for managing suicide risk 476 
after discharge that includes scheduled a written safety plan for patients and behavioral health appointments for 477 
follow -up care and medication management within CRDAMC outpatient Department of Behavioral Health.    478 
When participants are seen by study staff, severe suicidal ideation could also be addressed through the 479 
development of a Crisis Response Plan and/or referral to local resources for additional information.  Priority will be 480 
given to referring patients to the CRDAMC outpatient Department of Behavioral Health.  481 
 482 
Our study will mitigate risk for possible increased emotional distress by obtaining ratings of mood and suicidal intent 483 
on a recurrent bas is from all study participants  and taking action as clinically indicated. Preliminary data further 484 
suggest that the procedures used in this study are associated with immediate decreases in emotional distress and/or 485 
increases in positive emotions among high- risk military personnel.  486 
 487 
To mitigate risk associated with loss of confidentiality, we have ensured that all procedures and data storage 488 
methods are secure. Access to data is restricted to research staff on an as -needed basis, research staff are trained 489 
regularly in confidentiality and privacy issues, research staff participate in weekly supervision, and quality assurance 490 
checks are conducted annually.  491

Vanessa Green, D.O. will serve as the DoD Independent Research Monitor.  The duties of the research monitor shall 494 
be determined on the basis of specific risks or concerns about the research. The research monitor may perform 495 
oversight functions (e.g., observe recruitment, enrollment procedures, and the consent process for individuals, 496 
groups or units; oversee study interventions and interactions; review monitoring plans and UPIRTSO reports; and 497 
oversee data matching, data collection, and analysis) and report their observations and findings to the IRB or a 498 
designated official.  The research monitor may discuss the research protocol with the investigators, interview human 499 
subjects, and consult with others outside of the study about the research. The research monitor shall have authority 500 
to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects from a research protocol, and take 501 
whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the 502 
monitor’s report. Research monitors shall have the responsibility to promptly report their observations and findings to 503 
the IRB or other designated official.  504 
 505 
8.2 Potential Benefits.   Potential benefits of participation in this study may include a reduction in self -injurious thoughts 506 
and behaviors and PTSD symptoms over the course of therapy. Our primary goals are to treat participants to reduce long 507 
term suicide risk and to the point of symptoms reduction below the level of diagnostic criteria for PTSD. In addition, the 508 
knowledge gained from this study will serve to inform the most effective early interventions for the prevention and 509 
treatment of suicide risk and PTSD.  510 
 511 
8.3 Alternatives.  Mental health treatment for both suicidality and PTSD is available via video telehealth at CRDAMC 512 
through the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) including various forms of psychotherapy and drug treatments.  513 
Service members and veterans can access treatment for suicide risk and PTSD from the DBH as well as through Army 514 
One- Source and may be eligible for care at one of the Veterans Healthcare System facilities or clinics.  Not participating 515 
in the study is also an alternative.  516 
 517 
9.0  ADVERSE EVENTS, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, AND DEVIATIONS  518 
 519 
9.1   Adverse Events will be assessed and monitored according to the established STRONG STAR SOP and the IRB of 520 
record’s policies and procedures.  521 
 522 
9.2 Reporting Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSOs), and 523 
Deviations  to the Office of the IRB.  All adverse events, unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, 524 
and deviations will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with current IRB policy.  UPIRSOs 525 
and recurrent non- compliance with study procedures will be reported promptly to the IRB.  All adverse events that do not 526 
meet the UPIRSO criteria and deviations that are not non- compliance will be summarized at Continuing Review per the 527 
IRB of record’s policy.   528 
 529 
10.0 WITHD RAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION  530 
 531 
Participants may withdraw themselves from this study at any time and for any reason. Withdrawal from this study 532 
does not affect the participant’s eligibility for care or any other benefits to which entitled.  Participants who request to 533 
discontinue treatment, but who do not choose to withdraw from the study completely, will be asked to return for the 534 
post-treatment assessments. If a participant stops attending treatment sessions without notifying research staff, the 535 
therapist or project coordinator will make diligent attempts to contact the person to evaluate their status, attempt to 536 
re-engage them in the treatment, and encourage them to complete follow up assessments.   Research staff will also 537 
refer to appropriate outside resources if necessary.   Investigat or may choose to withdraw a participant after 538 
consultation with the treating therapist and other consultants as appropriate in instances not limited to:  539 
• Patient is noncompliant with treatment requirements  540 
• Patient is in need of more intensive treatment  541 
• Patient’s symptoms worsen significantly  542 
• Patient experiences a serious adverse event that is clearly related to the treatment  543 
• Unexpected unavailability of a treating therapist    544

15.0 Description of Assessments : 666 
1. Supplemental Demographic Form_v1.0 :  The Demographics Form queries eight standard demographics and 667 
military service information  not part of the Military Suicide Research Consortium (MSRC) Common 668 
Demographics (e. g., height, weight, military grade, type of military service, etc) .   669 
 670 
2. Military Suicide Research Consor tium (MSRC) Common Demographics : The MSRC Common Demographics 671 
(CDem) were developed by the MSRC.  As a requirement of funding, the research team is  required to administer 672 
these questionnaire  and upload a limited data set (with dates but without other patient identifiers) as a SPSS file 673 
to the MSRC website. The MSRC Common Demographics is a 32 item self -report questionnaire compromised of 674 
questions related to  standard demographics (race, gender, age) and military service information (e.g., rank) .    675 
 676 
3. Military Suicide Research Consortium ( MSRC ) Common Data Elements:  The MSRC Data Elements (CDEs) 677 
were developed by the MSRC.  As a requirement of funding, the research team is required to administer  these 678 
questionnaire and upload a limited data set (with dates but without other patient identifiers) as a SPSS file to the 679 
MSRC website. The MSRC CDEs is a 91 item self -report questionnaire compromised of questions related to 680 
self-injurious thoughts, behaviors and related psychopathology.  681 
 682 
 683 
4. Health Interview : The original Health Care Utilization (HCU) is a 16- item questionnaire developed in 2000 for Dr. 684 
Patricia A. Resick’s NIH grant, “Cognitive Processes in PTSD: Treatment II.” The questionnaire was based on 685 
the 1999 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The version that will be administered as part of the 686 
STRONG STAR Consortium has been modified to be of increased relevance to active duty service personnel. 687 
The measure includes items regarding use of  mental health services, current psychiatric medication, past 688 
psychiatric medication, hospitalization, and outpatient medical services, as well as items intended to assess 689 
changes in participants’ military status. Tobacco/nicotine use will also be queried.  690 
 691 
5. Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI): The SITBI (Nock, Holmberg, Photos, & Michel, 2007) is 692 
a structured interview assessing the presence, frequency, and characteristics of self -injurious and suicidal 693 
thoughts and behaviors. The SITBI will be administered by an Independent Evaluator, who will instruct the 694 
participants to answer the questions based on their entire lifetime of experience. The SITBI has shown high 695 
interrater reliability, test -retest reliability, and concurrent validity (Nock et al., 2007).  696 
 697 
6. Depressive Symptoms Index -Suicidality Subscale (DSI -SS):  The DSI -SS (Metalsky  & Joiner, 1997) will be used 698 
to assess current suicidal ideation. The DSI -SS is a 4 -item self -report measure of suicidal ideation that focuses 699 
on ideation, plans, perceived control over ideation, and impulses for suicide. It is being used as a core measur e 700 
in the Military Suicide Research Consortium. Scores on each item range from 0 to 3, with higher scores 701 
reflecting greater severity of suicidal ideation. Instructions will instruct the participants to respond based on the 702 
past two weeks (for baseline and follow up visits) or the past week (for interim assessment visits). A systematic 703 
review of measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors found that the DSI -SS had evidence of excellent internal 704 
consistency and concurrent validity (Batterham et al., 2014).   705 
 706 
7. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM- 5 (CAPS- 5; Weathers, Blake, Schnurr, Kaloupek, Marx, & 707 
Keane, 2012) : The CAPS- 5 is structured interview that assesses the DSM- 5 criteria for PTSD (Weathers et al., 708 
2013). Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and 709 
combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms. Additional items that are not 710 
included in the total score evaluate overall symptom duration, distress, impairment, dissociative symptoms, and 711 
global ratings by the interviewer. Validation studies are nearly complete to establish the psychometric properties 712 
of the CAPS -5 and findings will be reported in peer -reviewed publications. This interview is very similar to its 713 
predecessor, the CAPS for DSM- IV, which has been considered the gold standard for evaluating PTSD and 714 
demonstrated good reliability and validity (Weathers, Keane, & Davidson, 2001). In addition to reflecting 715 
diagnostic changes for PTSD in DSM- 5, the CAPS -5 differs from the CAPS in that frequency and intensity 716 
ratings for each symptom are no longer scored separately, so the severity rating for each item determines 717 
whether a symptom is present or not. Subscale scores are calculated by summing severity scores for  items in 718 
the following PTSD symptom clusters: re- experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, 719 
and hyperarousal. Scores ≥ 25 indicate a probable diagnosis of PTSD.  720

  Page 14 of 14 8. Life Events Checklist -5 (LEC -5): The LEC includes a list of 24 potentially traumatic life events commonly 722 
associated with PTSD symptoms. The instrument was designed to facilitate the diagnosis of PTSD (Weathers, 723 
Blake, Schnurr, Kaloupek, Marx, & Keane, 2013a).). In this study, the LEC -5 will also be used to identify the 724 
index event and focus of the PTSD treatment. For each potentially traumatic life event, respondents rate their 725 
experience of that event on a 5- point nominal scale (1 = happened to me, 2 = witnessed it, 3 = learned about it, 726 
4 =part of my job, 5= not sure, and 6 = does not apply). Each nominal point will be scored separately, as either 0 727 
(=not endorsed by participant) or 1 (=endorsed by participant).  728 
 729 
9. PTSD CheckList -5 (PCL -5): The PCL- 5 (Weathers, et al., 2010) is a 20- item self -report measure update of the 730 
PCL designed to assess PTSD symptoms as defined by the DSM- 5. The PCL -5 is currently available and has 731 
been shown to have good psychometric properties. The PCL- 5 evaluates how much participants have been 732 
bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past month (for baseline and follow up assessments) or the past week (all 733 
interim assessments) as a result of a specific life event.  Each item of the PCL- 5 is scored on a five point scale 734 
ranging from 0 “not at all”) to 4 (“extremely).  735 
 736 
10. Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory -2 (DRRI -2) Combat Experiences subscale and DRRI -2 Postbattle 737 
Experiences subscales:: The DRRI -2 (Vogt, et al., 2013) is a suite of 17 individual scales that assess key 738 
deployment -related risk and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for veterans’ long- term 739 
health.   The Combat Experiences and Postbattle Experiences subscales will be used to assess stressful 740 
deployment experiences.  741 
 742 
 743 
11. Monetary -Choice Questionnaire (MCQ): The MCQ (Kirby et al., 1999) is a 27- item self -administered 744 
questionnaire. For each item, the participant chooses between a smaller, immediate monetary reward and a 745 
larger, delayed monetary reward. The measure is scored by calculating where the respondent’s answers place 746 
him/her amid reference discounting curves, where placement amid steeper curves indicates higher levels of 747 
impulsivity.  748 
 749 
12. Suicide Cognition Scale Short Form (SCS- S): The SCS -S is a 9 -item self -report measure designed to assess 750 
suicide -specific thoughts and belief, with demonstrated reliability and validity with chronic pain patients (Bryan et 751 
al., 2016). The SCS -S evaluates how much an individual agrees with the suicide- related cognition. Scores on 752 
each item range from 1- 5, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.   753 
 754 
13. Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI):  The PTCI is a 36- item questionnaire that was developed to 755 
determine how an individual views the trauma and its sequelae in an attempt to understand both how PTSD 756 
develops and is maintained (Foa, Elhers, Clark, Tolin, & Orsillo, 1999).  Using an emotional processing theory, 757 
Foa and her colleagues (1999) have suggested that PTSD is a consequence of disruptions in the normal 758 
processes of recovery when an individual has excessively rigid concepts about self and world rendering the 759 
person vulnerable if a traumatic event occurs.  Thus the PTCI was developed as a measure of trauma- related 760 
thoughts and beliefs.  It is comprised of three subscales (Negative Cognitions about the Self, Negative 761 
Cognitions about the World, and Se lf-Blame).  The measure was tested in almost 600 adult volunteers recruited 762 
from two university PTSD treatment clinics as well as a university community.  Approximately 65% (n=392) of 763 
individuals reported having experienced a trauma in which their own life or that of another person was perceived 764 
to be in danger and their response at the time included intense terror, horror, or helplessness (Criterion A event).  765 
The remaining 35% (n=162) denied such a traumatic experience.  Of those who had experienced a trauma, 170 766 
had PTSD symptoms of at least moderate severity while the remaining 185 reported a low symptom severity.  767 
The three subscales of the PTCI demonstrated internal consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 768 
0.97.  Convergent validity was  demonstrated comparing the PTCI to appropriate subscales of the World 769 
Assumptions Scale and Personal Beliefs and Reactions Scale.  Significant correlations between the appropriate 770 
subscales ranged from 0.20 to 0.85.  The PTCI was able to differentiate individuals with and without PTSD 771 
demonstrating discriminate validity (sensitivity = 0.78, specificity = 0.93).  Test –retest reliability for each of the 772 
three subscales at a 1- week interval ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 and for a 3- week interval ranged from 0.80 t o 773 
0.86.  774

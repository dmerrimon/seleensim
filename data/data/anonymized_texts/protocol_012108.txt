6 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
There are numerous transdermal delivery systems (TDS) that are currently available in 
the United States, the first of which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in 1979  [1]. TDS are very attractive, convenient and easy to use systems and are 
available in vari ous forms including patches (matrix or reservoir), sprays, gels, and 
ointments. Drug release from these TDS varies significantly and is dependent on a 
number of factors including system design, physicochemical propertie s of the drug, 
excipients, occlusion, sweat, skin condition, skin type and temperature. Investigating the 
influence of these factors on drug release from reference products that are often 
available in different forms is important to ensure that one formula tion is  not less safe 
than other formulations . In this proposal we will focus on inves tigating the influence of 
heat and occlusion on drug release from oxybutynin  products  (patch and gel) . Systemic 
absorption of drugs is dependent on cutaneous blood flow. Application of, or exposure to 
heat, allows gradual increase in cutaneous blood flow and  an increase in the absorption 
rate and hence  can increase drug permeation from TDS.  Indeed, exposure to heat has 
been demonstrated to increase drug release from patches , which led to increased serum 
concentrations of  numerous drugs (e.g., fentanyl and nicotine)  and raised a number of 
safety concerns (2-7). As a result , almost all patches  that are currently available have 
warnings against heat exposure.   Occlusion effect on semi -solid formulations has not 
been widely investigated.  Skin occlusion prevents water loss from skin surface thus 
increasing hydration of stratum corneum.  Increased stratum corneum hydrophilicity can 
alter the movement of drug molecu les through skin resulting in increased drug 
permeation (15).  
2.2 Rationale  
The goal of this study is to conduct in vivo  studies to compare the influence of heat and 
occlusion on oxybutynin drug release from FDA approved product s; Oxytrol® for 
Women patch  versus Gelnique® gel.  While there is data in the literature for heat and 
occlusion effect on different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), specifically RLD  
products , from e xposure to external heating sources (heating pads, sauna, hot showers, 
exercising)  and occlusion , there is a lack of data to demonstrate in vivo -in vitro correlation 
under heat exposure and occlusion.  Therefore, t o help ensure that gels and TDS are 
safe f or patients, an in vitro setup is being developed to characterize the heat and 
occlusion effect for these TDS and gel systems , respectively, by correlating the in vivo 
data with in vitro  data using the IVPT model with excised human skin.  This necessitates 
that a small number of human subject heat effect and occlusion studies are performed

7 under controlled and monitored conditions with selected products, to serve as an in vivo 
reference for par allel IVPT heat effect  and occlusion  studies .  The oxybutynin  heat and 
occlusion effect studies  described in this protocol are the final set in this series of studies. 
The intent of this research is to establish an IVIVC for the IVPT model in the specific 
context of heat and occlusion effect studies, so that IVPT studies can be utilized to 
evaluate these effects so future generic products are similar in quality to the brand name .  
In addition, the residual drug content of the used Oxytrol® for Women patches  will be 
analyzed for the purpose of estimating the amount of drug absorbed.

13 5 PHARMACOKINETICS AND STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
5.1 Study Hypothesis  
Heat exposure can enhance the systemic delivery of oxybut ynin from the patch and  
occlusion can enhance systemic delivery from  gel. In this study, the influence of 
standardized heat application on the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of oxybutynin 
will be studied after using Oxytrol® for Women  patch. Heat will be applied when the 
serum  levels from the patch reach steady state levels around 24  h indicating steady 
state skin concentration. A second heat application will determine the influence of 
heat application on drug reservoir in the skin  from the patch . Gel application area will 
be occluded for three hours.  We will test the null hypothesis (H 0) that the coefficient 
for the patch -by-heat or gel -by-occlusion interaction equals zero, adjusting for time.  
 
5.2 Analyses  
Oxybutynin  concentrations will be measured in serum samples collected from each 
subject. Blood samples (approximately 4 mL (0.8 tsp)) will be collected at pre-dosing and 
then at 24 h, 24 h 15 min, 24 h 30 min, 24 h 45 min, 25 h,  25 h 15 min, 25 h 30 min, 25 
h 45 min, 26 h, 27 h, 28 h, 29 h, 30 h, 30 h 15 min, 30 h 30 min, 30 h 45 min, 31 h, 31 h 
15 min, 31 h 30 min, 31 h 45 min, 33 h and 34 h 30 min  post-patch application.   Blood 
samples (approximately 4 mL (0.8 tsp)) will be collected at pre -dosing and then at 1 h, 2 
h, 3 h, 4 h,  5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 7 h 15 min, 7 h 30 min, 7 h 45 min, 8 h, 8 h 15 min , 8 h 30 min , 
8 h 45 min, 9 h, 9 h 15 min, 9 h 30 min, 9 h 45 min, 10 h, 10 h 30 min, 11 h, 11 h 30 min  
and 12 h  post-gel application .   
 
Non compartmental  analyses (NCA) will be conducted to estimate the  PK parameters 
such as : maximum serum  concentration (Cmax) , apparent elimination rate constant (k); 
apparent half -life (t 1/2), calculated as 0.693/k; AUC 0-last of the serum  concentration –time 
determined by the linear trapezoidal method  (patch ) and AUC value extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC inf), calculated as the sum of AUC 0-last and the area extrapolated to infinity: 
AUC inf = AUC 0-last + C last/k where C last would be the last quantifiable concentration. All 
NCA analyses will be conduct ed using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.4 (Pharsight, a Certara 
Company, CA).

14 5.3 Final Analysis Plan  
An objective of this study is to investigate the influence of heat application  and occlusion 
application  on the PK parameters of oxybutynin after using patch and gel products.  The 
primary PK parameters to be compared are 1) C max, before and after heat application  or 
occlusion ; 2) AUC before and after heat application  or occlusion  consistent with similar 
PK studies . (6,7)  Determine PK parameters (C max, AUC) of oxybutynin  in healthy adults 
after using Oxytrol® for Women and Gelnique® for the purpose of IVIVC  by collecting 
data over two separate periods . Complimentary in vitro  data will be collected using 
human skin.  
 
IVIVC will be conducted comparing PK parameters and profiles to predicted PK 
parameters and profiles using IVPT results.  Multiple methods will be implemented to 
develop an IVIVC.  The first method is to compare t he steady state concentrations.  The 
predicted steady state concentration using our current IVPT data will employ the 
following formula:  
𝐶𝑠𝑠=𝐽𝑠𝑠 ∗𝐴
𝐶𝐿 
 
Css=steady state serum concentration; Jss=steady state flux; A=area; CL=clearance  
  
The second method will compare the PK profiles of the clinical and IVPT study by 
predicting oxybutynin  concentrations at each time point in the IVPT study and comparing 
it to the clinical PK profile.   The third method will be to determine and compare resid ual 
patch analysis between in vitro  and in vivo .

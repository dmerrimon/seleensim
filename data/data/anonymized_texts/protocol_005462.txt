Measures Taken to 
Reduce Bias  Subjects will be randomized to treatment sequences in visit 2 to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Investigator- masked treatment will be used to reduce the potential of bias  
during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. 
Eligibility Criteria  
           
      Inclusion Criteria : 
Subjects MUST:  
1. Be male or female, of 18 years of age or older  
2. Provide signed and dated informed consent in accordance with good 
clinical practice ( GCP ) and local legislation prior to any study 
procedure. 
3. Have open angle glaucoma, (with or without pseudo exfoliation, pigment dispersion component ) or ocular hypertensio n in both eyes

7. Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating 
(as confirmed by a negative urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of 
less than 50 mIU/mL or equivalent units of human chorionic 
gonadotropin). Women of childbearing potential must agree to the 
use of a reliable method of contraception (e.g., total abstinence, 
intrauterine device, a double -barrier method [such as condom plus 
diaphragm with spermicide], oral, transdermal, injected or implanted non- or hormonal contraceptive), throughout the  
study. A sterile 
sexual partner is not considered an adequate form of birth control. 
Subjects on hormonal contraceptives must have been on the same 
hormonal contraceptive for at least one month before the Screening and continue throughout the duration of the study. 
A female is considered of childbearing potential if she has had her first menses and she is either:  
a. not postmenopausal for at least 12 
consecutive months prior to enrollment; or b.  not surgically sterilized by bilateral tubal ligation, or bilatera l 
oophorectomy, or hysterectomy 
c. Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential who are not using birth control as described above must use a barrier method 
of contraception (eg. Condom) if not surgically sterile (ie, 
vasectomy).

Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  23 2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Glaucoma is collection of disorders characterized by a slow and progressive degeneration of 
retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in a distinct appearance of the optic disc and a concomitant pattern of visual field loss  In 2010, 60.5 million people were es timated to be 
suffering from glaucoma worldwide, with a predicted increase to 79.6 million by 2020  It is a 
leading cause of blindness in the United States, affecting 1% -2% of individuals aged 60 and over 
   
There are several recognized risk factors of glaucoma including an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), aging, family history, high myopia, systemic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, migraine headaches, peripheral vasospasm and prior nerve damage Elevated IOP is the 
only proven treatable risk factor in multiple forms of glaucoma   Increased IOP of greater 
than 21 mm Hg has traditionally been suspected to cause glaucoma the higher the IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. With IOP > 30 mmHg, the potential risk for vision loss is 40 t imes greater compared to an IOP of 15 mm Hg   As IOP 
has been shown in several large- scale National Eye Institute -sponsored studies to be a major 
factor in the pathogenesis of the progression of glaucoma, pharmacologic reduction of IOP is today the mainstay of treatment for this condition  
  
Brimonidine is a highly selective and potent alpha 2-adrenergic- receptor agonist that effectively 
lowers IOP and is useful as a monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, and replacement therapy in glaucoma and ocul ar hypertension. Brimonidine functions by dual mechanism, reducing inflow 
of aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. It has a greater selectivity for α
2-ARs and lower lipid solubility than the first-generation compounds of this class, clonidine 
and apraclonidine.  After topical administration, brimonidine readily penetrates the cornea and results in reduction of IOP within one hour. Its peak effect is achieved within two hours post-dosing and the trough effect occurs approximately 10 to 14 hours after administration   
Brimonidine tartrate is marketed and approved for use in the US only in topical ophthalmic formulations in concentrations between 0.1- 0.2% (Alphagan, Alphagan
® P, Combigan, and 
generic forms) and currently the only indication is for ocular hypertension and elevated IOP associated with open -angle glaucoma. Its pharmacology and toxicology profiles have been 
extensively characterized in previous US submissions. Due to its short half- life, brimonidine is 
dosed three times daily (TID) in the US. 
Brimonidine has been shown to be safe and well- tolerated ocularly and systemically in 
concentrations up to 0.5% when dosed twice daily for up to 1 month for IOP- lowering in 
glaucoma patients    The most common side effects included dry mouth, fatigue, blurring,

Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  24 blindness in glaucoma Studies on individual adherence with brimonidine tartrate 
ophthalmic solution for treatment of gla ucoma have shown that adherence of patients was highly 
variable and pharmacologically insufficient for more than two third of the patients included in 
the study when patients were asked to take brimonidine eye drops twice daily and TID  
Due to the dose-intensive schedule, patient adherence to brimonidine therapy is low suggesting that there i s a need for a longer acting drug or longer acting formulation to reduce dosing 
frequency.  
Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (SPARC; Sponsor) has developed a once daily (QD) long -acting ophthalmic product consisting of 0.35% brimonidine tartrate suspension in a 
nano-bound resin.  This product allows for the sustained release and activity of brimonidine over an extended period of time for the treatment of elevated IOP. This nano- size ion exchange resin 
technology is already in the marketed hypotensive ophthalmic suspension, Betoptic S
®  
W
hile lower concentrations of brimonidine are available (0.1, 0.15%, Alphagan® P, Allergan) for 
the treatment of glaucoma, t he Sponsor’s drug-resin complex suspension product is expected  
provide a slow, consistent, and sustained release likely reducing the immediate exposure to drug.   This feature has the potential for an  improved safety profile over the higher concentrations of 
marketed drug and allowing for a reduced medication burden from TID to QD.

will report promptly to the IRB/IEC new information that may adversely affect the safety of the 
subjects or the conduct of the study.  
The investigator will carry out the protocol in conformity with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
described in Guideline E6 of the ICH and applicable regulatory requirements. Before admission into the study, the written informed consent form must be personally signed and dated by the subject and by the investigator or designee who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
In obtaining and documenting informed consents, the investigator must comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and must adhere to GCP. The investigator must inform the subject of all pertinent aspects of the study including the written information approved/favorably assessed by the IRB.  
3.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
This study is designed to obtain estimates on the mean IOP at each of the 3 time points (8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 4:00 PM) on week 2, week 6 and week 12 in order to compare brimonidine tartrate 0.35% ophthalmic suspension, dosed QD at 8:00 AM and brimonidine tartrate 0.1%, dosed TID at approximately 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. 
The pri mary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of QD dosing with SPARC ’s brimonidine 
tartrate ophthalmic suspension 0.35% compared with brimonidine
 tartrate ophthalmic solution 
0.1% dosed TID  in subjects with open- angle glaucoma, or ocular hypertension.  
The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of QD dosing with SPARC’s brimonidine 
tartrate ophthalmic suspension 0.35% compared with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 
0.1% dosed TID  in subjects with open- angle glaucoma, or ocular hypertension.  
4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  multicenter, investigator -masked,  randomized,  parallel group, equivalence study. 
Treatment period will consist of QD and TID dosing for 12 weeks.  
Subjects who are chronically treated with ocular hypotensive medications are required to 
undergo appropriate washout periods prior to study entry to minimize any residual effects of other active ocular hypotensive medications.

4.2 Measures taken to avoid bias 
4.2.1 Subject number  
At the screening visit after signing the informed consent form ( ICF) form each subject will be 
allotted a subject number. The subject number will uniquely identify each subject in the study. 
The subject number will appear on all study documents relating to that subject.  Subject 
numbering will be described separately in dat a management plan.  
4.2.2 Randomization 
Subjects who qualify inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to study 
treatment using   
 
4.2.3 Masking  
This is an evaluator-masked study. The investigator or designated evaluator , masked to treatment 
assignment, will perform all ophthalmic examinations. Unmasked study coordinator may 
perform all study procedures other than ophthalmic/clinical examination, or treatment of the subjects. The investigator (if different from the evaluator) will  be responsible for deciding the type of medical care a subject will get; identifying the kinds of work a subject can safely perform while in the study, and assessment of safety . In order to maintain masking, the unmasked study

investigator and the subjects will be asked not to discuss the treatment received with the investigator or designated evaluator in order to maintain investigator/evaluator -masking.  
To minimize bias, T est and Reference bottles will be packed in an identical box with similar 
label.  
An unmasked site personnel  will instill the in -office physician dispensing (OPD) doses in a room 
separate from the evaluating investigator in order to maintain investigator -masking. As a means 
to maintain investigator masking, subjects in the SPARC 0.35% treatment group will be brought into the dosing room at each dosing time point (ie, 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM but will only receive study medication at the 8:00 AM time point). 
In order to maintain masking, the Investigator will not personally retrieve/review the study 
medication diary; designated study personnel will collect and review the diary at each visit to ensure treatment compliance.  
Subjects will be instructed  not to use the study medication on the morning of a study visit;

During the course of the study CRO monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to review 
protocol compliance, assess study drug accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory  requirements.  The review of the subjects’ medical records 
will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality.  Further details 
of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, quality assurance and or its designees 
may carry out on- site inspections and/or audits which may include source data checks.  
Therefore direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits.  
All ins pections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as 
subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
 
9.0 SAFETY REPORTING  
9.1 Reporting Adverse Events  
Any AE (clinical sign, symptom, or disea se) temporally associated with the use of this 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product, shall be 
reported and documented on the CRF. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the 
Principal Investigator  will be individually listed. All entries should contain an event term, date of 
onset, date of resolution, severity, action taken, outcome, relationship to study drug, and a 
seriousness assessment. The investigator will document all AEs in the subject’s source 
document. All AEs occurring during the study, including during the washout interval, will be

AE can therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not related to the investigational product.

Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  45 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any experience that is fatal or life -threatening, requires or 
prolongs inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, is a 
congenital anomaly or birth defect or an important medical event or requires medical intervention.      
If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will not be recorded as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (eg, sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE. 
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which, 
hypothetically, might have caused death if it were more severe.  
A planned hospitalization for pre-existing condition, or a procedure required per protocol without a serious deterioration in health or clearly not associated with an AE is not to be considered as an AE.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
dditionally, the Principal Investigator will evaluate  all AEs as follows:  
Seriousness : whether or not the AE is fatal or life threatening, persistent or permanently 
disabling, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or an important medical event.  
Action taken :. Action taken is  categorized as “none”, “study drug discontinued/withdrawn”, 
“study drug discontinued and restarted”, “required concomitant medication”, “required procedure”, or “other”. 
Event Outcome : Event outcome , or time last follow -up is recorded is categorized as “Fatal”, 
“Resolved”, “Resolved with sequelae”, “Resolving”, “Not Resolved”, “Unknown”.

Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  48 Definition of the adverse event reporting period  
The AE/ SAE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject sign’s ICF 
continues till end of study or early termination visit.  
Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures are not 
considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospitalizations or unplanned 
prolongation of an elective hospitalization (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.  
 
 
 
 
9.2 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported  according to ICH GCP or local regulations, applying the regulation 
with the stricter requirements. The report will contain as much available  information concerning 
the SAE to enable the Sponsor’s safety physician/ CRO to file a report, which satisfies reg ulatory 
reporting requirements. The SAE report will be notified by Investigator within 24-hours of his/ 
her awareness to the Sponsor’s safety physician/CRO. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow-up reports. 
All AEs/SAEs will be  recorded on the AE Report Form and SAE report form in the eCRF and 
source documents.  
 
  
  
  
  
In the case of fatal or life- threatening events, please immediately telephone the Sponsor’s safety 
physician/CRO  also.

Protocol No.: CLR_16_33                                                       Amendment 03 
Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  49 Additional follow-up information should be completed on an SAE follow-up form with a copy 
sent to the Sponsor’s safety physician/CRO. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the responsible Sponsor’s safety physician/CRO.  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs):  
The applicable Regulatory Authorities shall be initially notified by Sponsor Safety Physician/ 
CRO of any SUSAR, no later than 15 calendar days from the “date learned” of the event. The applicable Regulatory Authorities will be initially notified as per re gulation within 7 calendar 
days of any fatal or life -threatening SUSAR. If the safety report submitted within 7 calendar days 
is complete, an additional submission within 15 days from day 0 is not required.  
All participating Investigators and Ethics committee/ Institutional Review Board shall be notified 
of any SUSAR by CRO as per local regulatory requirement.

Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  50 9.3 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable)  
When medically necessary, the investigator may need to determine what treatment has been 
assigned to a subject. Site will contact the designated personnel in SPARC or CRO in case the treatment code needs to be unmasked. When possible (ie, in non- emergent situations), CRO 
and/or the study sponsor should be notified before unmasking investigational product.      
Unmasking details will be provided to Sponsor’s designated safety physician in case of SUSAR  
for regulatory reporting purpose only.  The code for all subjects will be broken when all subjects have completed the study, and all dat a 
for this period has been entered into the database and locked. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
9.5 Pregnancy  
A pregnancy test will be performed at screening and at visits specified in the protocol. Females 
of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating (as confirmed by a negative urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of less than 50 mIU/mL or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin). Females of childbearing potential must agree to the use of a reliable method of contraception as described in Inclusion Criteria of this protocol and throughout the study. Subjects wi th a positive test at screening or during the study period will be excluded from study.  
Similarly, male subjects enrolled to the study will be instructed not father a child and avoid passage of semen to their partner by using an acceptable contraceptive m ethod as discussed by 
the investigator during the enrollment to the study. However, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the pregnancy will be recorded as a significant medical event and reported per SAE reporting procedure and the subjec t will be withdrawn from the study 
immediately. Similarly, if a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study, the medical event will be recorded appropriately. The ‘pregnancy reporting form’ will be

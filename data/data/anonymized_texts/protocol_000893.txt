6 1. INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to provide details of the statistical 
analyses that have been outlined within the protocol " A Randomized, Blinded, Parallel Group, 
Placebo -Controlled, Multiple Dose, Multicenter, Multinational Study t o Compare t he 
Therapeutic Equivalence of a Budesonide 80 m cg/Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate 4.5 m cg 
Inhalation Aerosol (Manufactured b y  For Watson Laboratories Inc.) t o Symbicort® 
(Budes onide 80 m cg/Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate 4.5 mcg Inhalation Aerosol) 
(Manufactured b y Astrazeneca) i n Adolescent a nd Adult Patients w ith Asthma ", version 3.0, 
amendment 1.0, dated February 27, 2017. 
Watson  Laboratories, Inc. is developing a new generic f ormulation of budesonide 80 
mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 m cg inhalation aerosol  for which demonstration of 
bioequivalence to the reference product (i.e., Symbicort®) is required.   This study is designed to evaluate the bioequivalence between the administered test and reference products in 
accordance with the recommendations outlined in the  US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) Draft  Guidance on Budesonide; Formoterol fumarate dihydrate (June 2015). 
2. OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this pivotal trial is  to confirm the therapeutic equivalence of a new generic 
fixed -dose combination product containing budesonide 80 mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
4.5 mcg (BDS 80/FFD 4.5) (per actuation) inhalation aerosol pressurized metered dose inhaler 
(pMDI) manufactured by  for Watson Laboratories Inc. and r eference listed drug 
(RLD ) Symbicort®  (budesonide 80 mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg inhalation 
aerosol)  manufactured by AstraZeneca, in adolescent patients and adult patients with chronic 
but sta ble asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert 
Panel Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines. 
To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test and reference products should both be 
statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05) with regard to the study primary  endpoints. 
3. STUDY OVERVIEW  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, blinded, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, multicenter, multinational study to compare the therapeutic equivalence of  BDS 80/FFD 4.5 (per actuation) 

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -2015- 075-0AA 
Versi on Final  
Date Apr 11, 2018 
7 inhalat ion aerosol pMDI manufactured by  for Watson Laboratories Inc. and RLD 
Symbicort® manufactured by AstraZeneca, in  adolescent patients and adult patients with 
chronic but stable asthma as defined in NAEPP 3 guidelines. 
All patients in this study mus t have a documented diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma. 
Male patients and non-pregnant, non- lactating female patients 12 years to  75 years of age who 
meet the entry criteria may be enrolled.  
The study consists of a 2-week open placebo Run-in Period fol lowed by a 6 -week  randomized 
Treatment Period (test, reference, or placebo).  
Written informed consent/assent must be obtained prior to any study-related procedure, which 
includes medication washout and restrictions. Informed consent/assent may be signed up to 14 
days prior to Visit 1.  
Screening Visit  
Patient demographic information, medical and asthma history, lung function, and clinical 
laboratory assessments will be collected after patients provide informed consent/assent  (the 
latter for adolescent patien ts) and before taking study drug. Laboratory values at screening 
must be normal (or abnormal and not clinically significant) as evaluated by the Investigator. 
At Visit 1, patients will perform spirometry to demonstrate a pre -bronchodilator f orced 
expirator y volume in 1 second ( FEV 1) of ≥45% and ≤85% of the predicted normal value using 
the equations derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
III dataset for adults.  All lung function tests will be conducted in accordance with current 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) recommendations. 
Patients must demonstrate ≥15% reversibility of FEV 1 within 30 minutes following  360 mcg 
(4 puffs) of albuterol (free base) or 400 mcg (4 puffs) of salbutamol inhalation (pMDI) at 
screening (Visit 1). Up to 2 spirometry sessions within the time window after  bronchodilator 
administration (30 minutes ± 10 minutes) are permitted at Visit 1. If the  patient achieves 
<15%, but ≥10% reversibility at Visit 1, the site may instr uct the patient  to hold long- acting 
β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA ) and/or i nhaled corticosteroids  (ICS) and return up to 7 days

8 later for a repeat test. Only 1 repeat of  the Visit 1 spirometry (to retest for reversibility) is 
allowed per screening.  
Patients will receive instruction on how to measure PEF rate (PEFR) and answer electronic 
diary (eDiary) questions asking the patient about his/her asthma symptoms. Patients will also 
be instructed to measure PEFR and answer the questions before self -administering the 
provided study drug. Patients will also be given an albuterol/salbutamol pMDI as rescue medication and instructed to use 2 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol as needed to relieve 
asthma symptoms.  
Open Label Placebo Run- in Period  
Eligible patients will enter an open label, placebo Run- in Period of at least 2 weeks in  duration 
(but not longer than 21 days, unless approved by the Sponsor and Medical Monitor ) to wash 
out any pre- study corticosteroids or  long-acting bronchodilators and to establish FEV
1 
baseline values.  
Patients will perform PEFR measurements and inhale placebo medication at approximately 12 
hour intervals for a minimum of 14 days. 
Patients must have placebo inhaler compliance of at least 70% (rounded to whole number) of 
study drug doses in the Run-in Period to proceed into the randomized Treatment Period. 
Compliance will be  based on patient eDiary documentation of doses taken from the eCOA 
Visit 1 date (which may differ from the eCRF Visit 1 date due to rescreening or other delays 
in the start of placebo administration) until the Visit 2 date .  
Randomized Treatment Period  
Those continuing to meet entry criteria will enter a 6 -week Treatment Period (Day 1) and be 
randomly assigned in a 4:4:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms:  
• Test product: BDS 80/FFD 4.5 inhalation aerosol (manufactured by  for 
Watson Laboratories Inc.) ( Test Drug ) 
• Reference product (RLD): Symbicort® (manufactured by AstraZeneca) ( Reference 
Drug )

Versi on Final   
Date Apr 11, 2018 
9 • Placebo: To match generic BDS 80/FFD 4.5 inhalation aerosol (manufactured by 
 for Watson Laboratories Inc.) ( Placebo)  
On the first day of treatment at Visit 2, FEV 1 will be determined at approximately  60, 30, and 
5 minutes pre -dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-dose. 
Patients will record PEFR data and the other requested information on their eDiary and take 
test, reference, or placebo at approximately 12 hour intervals for a minimum of 42 days and 
maximum of 49 days. 
Patients will be instructed to return to the clinic for Visit 3 at the end of the third  treatment 
week (treatment day 21 ± 7 days) and for Visit 4, at the end of the sixth treatment week 
(treatment day 42 + 7 days). Patients will be  instructed to withhold the study drug and not 
perform morning PEFR measurements until they arrive at the clinic on the morning of Visit 3 (Day 21 ± 7 days) and Visit 4 (Day 42 + 7 days). On both visits, FEV
1 will be determined at 
60, 30, and 5 minutes pre-dose, the average of which constitutes the pre-dose (0) value. If only one acceptable session is available, it  will be used as the pre-dose (0) value.  
At the beginning of each visit, the Investigator will thoroughly review the patient’s eDiary entries and discuss the results with the patient. The patients will be asked about their 
medication washouts and whether they have experienced any unusual symptoms or medical 
problems since the last visit. Patients will be reminded that they must inhale the  study drug as 
instructed. 
Overall, the planned duration of patient participation is 8 weeks comprising 2 weeks for the 
placebo Run-in Period and 6 weeks for the randomized Treatment Period. 
No formal interim analysis with statistical stopping rules will be undertaken, although  sample 
size recalculation may be performed per the interim analysis plan . 
After the end of the st udy, the patients will revert to their previous care plan.  
A detailed Schedule of Procedures is provided in Appendix 12.1.  
3.2 Sample Size  
Patients will be enrolled in a  ratio of test:reference:placebo. Approximately  1130 
patients will be randomized

3.3 Randomization and Unblinding Procedures  
3.3.1 Patient  Identification  
Upon enrollment into the study (i.e., Visit 1, Screening ), each patient  will be sequentially 
assigned a 6-digit patient  identification ( PID) number that uniquely identifies the patient with 
the first three digits identifying the site and the last three digits identifying the  patient number 
at the site. The PID number for each patient will be assigned via Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS) .  
Once assigned, the PID number cannot be reused or reassigned even if a subject does not enter the ran domized Treatment Period or withdraws from the study at any time. Patients  who 
remain in the study will retain their PID numbers throughout the study.  3.3.2 Randomization Scheme  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment on a  basis to generic BDS 80 /FFD  
4.5 inhalation aerosol manufactured by  for Watson Laboratories Inc. (T est Drug ), 
Symbicort® (R eference drug), or P lacebo, respectively.  
3.3.3 Allocation/Randomization of Subjects to Treatment  
Randomization of patient to treatment will occur at Visit 2 (Day 1) after all screening  
procedures have been performed and eligibility for the study confirmed. Each randomized 
patient will receive a unique randomization number assigned via IWRS. Randomized patients 
who terminate their study participation for any reason, regardless of whether study drug was 
taken or not, will retain their randomization number. 
For the randomization of patients, the Investigator will use an IWRS. Appropriate 
documentation will be filed in the Trial Master File (TMF). IWRS will assign patients to  a 
treatment group based on the pre- defined randomization list.  
4. STUDY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOMES  
This study’s co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -2015 -075-0AA 
Versi on Final   
Date Apr 11, 2018 
13 • Baseline -adjusted area under the serial FEV 1-time curve calculated from time 0 (zero) 
to 12 hours on t he first day of the Treatment Period ( Visit 2 , Day 1).  
• Baseline -adjusted , pre-dose FEV 1 collected in the morning before dosing on the last 
day of treatment ( Visit 4, Da y 42). The FEV 1 Baseline is defined as the average of the 
pre-dose FEV 1 values obtained on Day 1. The Visit 4 FEV1 value will be measured as 
the mean of acceptable values collected at the visit or a single measurement if only one 
acceptable (per ATS criteria) spirometry session is obtained. 
5. HYPOTHESES TESTING  
Hypothesis of Equivalence  
A two -sided, 90% confidence interval on the test/reference ratio for each of the study’s co-
primary endpoints  will be constructed using a n Analysis of Co variance  (ANCOVA)  model of 
the Test and Reference results with  treatment and study site as fixed effect s and b aseline FEV 1 
as covariate, further applying  Fieller's method .  
Clinical endpoint bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals for the 
ratio of test/reference means, for both endpoints , are contained within the interval [80.00% , 
125.00% ] for the Per -protocol Set . 
Hypot hesis of Superiority  
In order to demonstrate adequate sensitivity, both test and reference treatments will be compared with placebo with respect to the primary endpoints using an AN COVA model with 
treatment a nd study site as fixed  effect s and baseline FEV
1 as covariate. Both treatments must 
be statistically superior to placebo for the Modified Intent -to-Treat  Set in order to validate the 
assessment of clinical endpoint bioequivalence for the test /reference ratios for the co -primary 
endpoints.  
6. ANALYSIS SUBSETS  
6.1 Enrolled Set (ENS)  
The Enrolled Set (ENS) will consist of all subjects who provided informed consent/assent.

7. STATISTICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS  
7.1 General Principles  
The statistical analyses will be performed by  with approval  of the Sponsor , 
using SAS Version 9.3 (or higher). All tables, figures and listings will be produced in 
landscape format.  
In gen eral, all data will be listed by subject  and visit/time point where appropriate. The 
summary tables will be stratified by , or have columns corresponding to, treatment groups. 
The total number of subject s in the treatment  group (N) under the stated analysis  set will be 
displayed in the header of summary tables. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables. Unless 
otherwise specified , descriptive statistics will include number of subject s, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, me dian and maximum. Number of subjects with missing values will also 
be displayed, but only if non-zero. The minimum and maximum statistics will be presented to 
the same number of decimal places as the original data. The mean and median will be presented to one more decimal place than the original data. The standard deviation will be 
presented to two more decimal places than the original data.  
In summary tables of categorical variables, counts and percentages will be displayed. The 
count [n] indicates the actual number of subject s in a particular category , which should always 
be less than or equal to the total number of subject s in the respective study group with known 
(non- missing) category [M ]. Percentage will be obtained by: % = n/ M*100. Unless otherwise 
specified, all percentages will be expressed to one decimal place.  
All statistical tests will be two -sided at a significance level of α = 0.05, unless otherwise 
indicated.  No adjustment will be made for multiplicity.  
Baseline will be defined as the last assessment , scheduled or not, prior to the first dose of the 
randomized study drug, unless otherwise specified.

Versi on Final   
Date Apr 11, 2018 
16 In by -visit summaries , only data collected on scheduled timepoints will be summarized. Data 
from unscheduled assessments will be included in listings and may be  used in determination 
of baseline if applicable.  
Relative days will be calculated relative to date of first dose of randomized study medication. 
Relative days will be calculated as follows only when the full assessment date is known (i.e., 
partial dates will have missing relative days).  
For assessment on or after the day of first dose of the randomized study drug: 
Relative Day = Date of Assessment – Date of First Dose of Randomized Study Drug+1. 
For assessment before the day of first dose of the randomized study drug: 
Relative Day = Date of Assessment – Dat e of First Dose of Randomized S tudy Drug. 
All dates will be displayed in DD/ MMM/ YYYY format.  
7.2 Subject  Disposition  
This analysis will be based on the ENS. Th e number of subject s enrolled in the study, 
randomized to treatment, included in the SAF, mITT ,  PPS , prematurely 
discontinued from the study  after randomization  (along with the reasons for discontinuation)  
will be presented . The same analysis will be repeated by study site.  
An overall summary of the number of subjects in each population by site will be created.  
All disposition information will be listed.  Additionally, a listing of subjects who discontinued 
from the study prematurely will be created, including date of discontinuation and primary 
reason.  Also a listing of enrollment details will provide the date of informed consent/assent 
and inclusion/exclusion criteria not met, if any . 
7.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will include: 
• age 
• sex 
• race 
• ethnicity

Date Apr 11, 2018 
18 All major protocol deviations will be summarized by deviation category and treatment group. 
This analysis will be performed for the Randomized set . 
7.6 Lung function testing  
The results of the spirometry measurements (including reversibility testing)  at Visit 1 
Screening  will be listed for each subject including the FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 to FVC ratio , FEF 25-
75 (absolute values and percentage of predicted values  rounded to whole numbers ). For the 
reversibil ity testing, both the absolute measurements and percentage change after inhaled 
albuterol (or equivalent) will be presented. Spirometry data from the vendor include quality assessment that ranges from ‘A’ to ‘F’.  
 
 
The results will be summarized by treatment and parameter  for the mITT set,  the  
 PPS. For subjects who repeated reversibility testing at a repeat screening visit, 
only the repeat value will be used for analysis  (provided it meets acceptability criteria above) . 
7.7 Efficacy Analyses   
7.7.1 Analysis of E quivalence and Superiority  
7.7.1.1 Calculation of the Primary Endpoint s  
Acceptability criteria . Spirometry  data from the vendor include quality assessment that 
ranges from ‘A’ to ‘F’.  
 
FEV
1 baseline.  The FEV 1 baseline will be defined as the average of the pre-dose FEV 1 values 
obtained at Visit 2  Day 1.  If some of these measurements are missing, the average will be 
calculated using the available measurements , however, a minimum of two pre-dose FEV 1 
values  is required; subjects who have only one or no pre- dose FEV 1 measurements on Day 1 
will have their FEV 1 baseline missing , and this the subject will be excluded from analysis. 
Calculation of FEV 1 AUC 0-12. The endpoint of Baseline -adjusted FEV 1 AUC 0-12 on Day 1  
will be calculated as follows: 
1. Each FEV 1 assessment on Day 1 will be baseline -adjusted by subtracting the FEV 1 
baseline value defined above.  

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -2015- 075-0AA 
Versi on Final   
Date Apr 11, 2018 
19 2. FEV 1 AUC 0-12 will be calculated from the baseline -adjusted values using the  linear 
trapezoidal  method. The calculation will assume that at time of dosing (time 0) the 
baseline- adjusted FEV 1 is also 0. The calculation will proceed over all available post-
dose FEV 1 assessments on Day 1 (including unscheduled timepoints, if any) using 
actual elapsed time from dosing . 
3. FEV 1 AUC 0-12 will be considered non-computable in a subject if one of the following 
occurs  in that subject: 
 
 
 
 
C
alculation of Baseline -adjusted pre -dose FEV 1 at end of treatment .  
The endpoint of Baseline -adjusted pre- dose FEV 1 at end of treatment  will be calculated as  
[FEV 1 at end of treatment] – [Basel ine FEV 1] 
where FEV 1 at end of treatment will be defined as  the single or average (if multiple available)  
pre-dose assessment (s) at Visit 4 Day 42. At least one acceptable pre- dose assessment at Visit 
4 Day 42 is required to calculate the change from baseline.  If more than one acceptable pre-
dose assessment is available, the average will be used in the calculation.  
If a subject has no pre- dose assessment at Visit 4, Day 42, in the mITT  analysis Average FEV 1 
at end of treatment will be imputed  (following LO CF rule)  as the average of available pre-
dose assessments on the last post- baseline day when at least two pre -dose FEV 1 assessment 
are available (e.g. the Early Termination visit) .  
. In the PPS 
analysis, however, the endpoint will not be imputed and the subject will be thus excluded from analysis, unless the subject missed Visit 4 Day 42  because he/she discontinued from the study 
due to lac k of efficacy. In the latter case the endpoint will be imputed in the same way as for 
mITT  analysis even in the PPS analysis.

22 FEV 1 AUC 0-12 on Day 1 and FEV1 at end of treatment (both absolute and baseline -adjusted) 
will be summarized  descriptively by treatment group and listed , for the mITT set and the PPS 
appropriate for each endpoint . 
7.8 Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the SAF.  
7.8.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary of Regulat ory Activities 
(MedDRA version 20.0) AE coding system for purposes of summarization. 
Only Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) starting will be used for the summary 
analysis. An AE will be considered as treatment -emergent if the time of onset is on or after the 
time of the first placebo  administration in the study Run- in period. AEs with unknown start 
dates will be counted as treatment- emergent unless the AE resolution date is prior to the 
placebo  start date. If the start date is partially missing , the AE will be considered treatment -
emergent, unless the month and year (when available) rule out the possibility that  the event 
occurred post dosing.  
All AEs will be assigned to study periods for the purposes of the tabulations:  
Run-in Period:  All TEAEs with onset at the time o n or after the first dose of placebo study 
drug during the Run- in Period until the time of the first dose of randomized study drug.  
Treatment Period : All TEAEs with onset at the time of or after the first dose of randomized 
study drug during the Treatment Period . 
For the purposes of assigning TEAEs to study  periods partial onset dates will be imputed as 
the latest possible date compatible with the known partial information; thus in case of 
ambiguity TEAEs will be assigned to Treatment per iod.  
A TEAE is defined  as treatment -related if it is recorded  as related, probably related or 
possibly related to the study medication on the e CRF . In case the relatedness was not assessed , 
the most conservative result ( related ) will be chosen for the ana lysis.  
In summaries of TEAEs a  subject  experiencing the same AE multiple times will only be 
counted once for that preferred term. Similarly, if a subject  experiences multiple AEs within 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Code ACT -2015 -075-0AA 
Versi on Final   
Date Apr 11, 2018 
23 the same system organ class that subject  will be counted only once in that system organ class. 
When summarizing AEs by severity, only the most severe occurrence within the preferred 
term or system organ class will be used. Similarly, when summarizing AEs by relationship to 
study drug, only the most related occurrence within  the preferred term or system organ class 
will be selected for displays in summary tables.  
An overall summary will include, by study period and by treatment group and overall, the 
number and percentage of subject s reporting at least 1 TEAE in the following  categories:  
• Any TEAE  
• Treatment -related TEAE  
• Serious TEAE  
• TEAE leading to discontinuation of the study medication  
• TEAE leading to death . 
The following TEAE frequency tables will be prepared summarizing the overall number of TEAEs, the number and percentage  of subject s reporting at least one TEAE by MedDRA 
System Organ Class ( SOC ) and preferred term ( PT), by treatment group and by study period:  
• All TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• AEs leading to discontinuation of the study medication 
• TEAEs by Sev erity 
• TEAEs by Relationship to Study Medication . 
All information pertaining to adverse events noted during the study will be listed by subject , 
detailing verbatim, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date , intensity, outcome, 
action taken and causal relationship to the study drug. The adverse event onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the date of first administration of the study medication.

below and presented (in number of days).  
                          AE Duration = AE Stop Date – AE Start Date + 1  
7.8.2 Laboratory tests  
Laboratory safety assessment (i.e., clinical chemistry and hematology) will be assessed by 
investigators for the p resence of any findings that meet the description of an AE. Laboratory 
test results will not be listed or summarized.  
Pregnancy test results and results of the drug and alcohol screen will be listed.  
7.8.3 Vital signs  
Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature and will be 
measured at each visit, as well as at any unscheduled visit . Overall interpretation will also be 
recorded as Normal, Abnormal not clinically significant or Abnormal clinically significant.  
Vital signs will be summarized descriptively by scheduled visit and treatment group. For visits 
in the Treatment period the change from baseline will also be summarized.  
Overall interpretation of vital signs will be summarized categorically by visit.  
All vital signs will be listed.  
7.8.4 12-Lead ECG  
ECG will be performed at Visit 1 Screening and Visit 4 Day 42 or early termination. The values of PR interval, QRS duration, RR interval, QT interval and QTcB interval will be collected , as available. Overall interpretation will be  recorded as Normal, Abnormal not 
clinically significant or Abnormal clinically significant.  
Number and percentage of subjects with each level of interpretation will also be summarized 
by visit and treatment.  
All ECG findings will be listed.  
7.8.5 Physical Examination  
Physical examination results will be listed by subject and body system.

25 7.8.6 Peak Expiratory Flow Rate 
The PEFR entries from the subjects’ diaries will be listed for each subject for both morning 
and evening measurements obtained during the Run-in Period and the Treatment Period. 
PEFR values will be summarized graphically. A line plot will be created with X axis showing 
study day ( -14 to 42) and Y axis showing mean PEFR. A separate line will be plotted for each 
treatment group.  
7.8.7 Asthma symptom scores  
The ast hma symptom scores will be completed daily in the eDiary, as well as during Visits 2, 
3, and 4. 
Asthma symptom score is defined as: 
  
  
  
 
  
Asthma symptom score  will be summarized graphically. A line plot will be created  with X

• Planned number of doses is determined as follows: 
  
 
 
o Treatment period: 
  
 
  
 
 
Note that in the calculation of the planned number of doses for the run- in period the date o f 
Visit 1 is taken from the  (spirometry vendor) data. It may differ from the CRF data if 
subjects return for repeat spirometry assessments. In such cases the  data will record the 
repeat visit as Visit 1.  The intent is to take the date of the repeat spirometry visit, if one 
occurred, and the date of the original screening visit, if no repeat occurred. 
All doses in the diary recorded on or after the date of Visit 2 and dosing time as reported in 
the spirometry data will be considered as belonging to the Treatment period. All doses in the 
diary prior to that date and time will be considered as belonging to  the Run-in period. 
Compliance will be rounded to whole percent ages. During the Run- in period, s ubjects will be 
considered compliant if they take at least .  For the 
treatment period,  subjects will be considered compliant  if they take at least 75% and not more

27 than 125% of doses. The compliance will be analyzed using the descriptive statistics by study 
period and treatment group. The proportion of compliant vs. non- compliant subjects will be 
tabulated for each study period and treatment group .  
Duration of exposure will be calculated by study period as [Date of last use of study 
medication in the period] – [Date of first use of study medication  in the period]  + 1. Duration 
of exposure will be summarized descriptively by study period and treatment group.  
Compliance and duration of exposure  will also be listed.  
These analys es will be performed for the SAF . 
Diary compliance will be determined only for the purposes of identification of protocol 
deviations. Diary compliance will be determined based on the compliance report from BMS 
similar to study drug compliance. In the Run -in period: “ Run- In: Actual Number of 
Questionnaire Completions ” / “Run- In: Expected Number of Questionnaire Completions ”. In 
the Treatment period: (“ Treatmen t V2-V3: Actual Number of Questionnaire Completions ” + 
“Treatment V3 -V4: Actual Number of Questionnaire Completions ”) / (“ Treatment V2 -V3: 
Expected Number of Questionnaire Completions ” + “Treatment V3 -V4: Expected Number of 
Questionnaire Completions ”) * 100%.  
7.8.9 Rescue medication use 
Number of rescue medication uses in Run- in and Treatment periods will be counted in the 
diary, using the answers from “AM Questionnaire” (“If you had difficulty sleeping during the 
night because of asthma symptoms, did you need to take albuterol/salbutamol (your rescue 
medication)?”) “PM Questionnaire” (“Did you need to take albuterol/salbutamol (your rescue 
medication)?”) and “Missed Recoding Questionnaire” (“Did you take your rescue medication 
yesterday morning (12:00am -11:59am)? ” and “Did you take your rescue medication yesterday 
afternoon or evening (12:00pm -11:59pm)?”) . This number will be summarized descriptively 
by study period and treatment group. It will also be listed.  
7.8.10 Prior and  Concomitant Medication  
Prior and concomitant  medication will be coded according to the World Health Organization – 
Drug Reference List and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Prior 
medications are defined as those taken before the first dose of randomized study drug on Day

28 1 (i.e., start and end date before the first dose of randomized study drug). Concomitant 
medications are defined as those taken at the time of or after the first dose of randomized 
study drug. Any medications that were started before the first dose of randomized study drug 
on Day 1 but continued after dosing will be considered a concomitant medication.  
All previous and concomitant medication will be listed by subject. Concomitant medications 
will be summarized by treatment group, ATC class (highest level avai lable) and preferred 
name. This analysis will be done for the SAF.

33 2. There is NO Day 0.  
3. The patient will be reminded to report any adverse experiences that occur within 30 days after the last visit. 
4. If a patient discontinues the study prematurely, he/she will be invited to undergo an early termination visit with the same 
procedures as on Visit 4, except for  inhalation of the study drug. More specifically, a series of at least 3 spirometric measurements 
will be obtained in the morning with an interval of  approximately 20 minutes in between. A medical follow -up examination 
including physical examination, blood pressure, pulse, ECG and clinical laboratory investigation will be done. 
5. Informed consent/assent may be signed up to 14 days prior to Visit 1. Written informed consent/assent must be obtained prior to 
any study- related procedure which includes medication washout and restrictions. 
6. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Blood pressure and puls e will be measured at each clinical visit 
after at least 10 minutes rest in  supine position. On Visits 2, 3, and 4, measurements will be done in the morning prior to inhalation, 
and a patient would not be administered study drug if  his/her blood pressure or pulse is deemed as clinically significant abnormal 
by the Investigator.  
7. 12- lead ECG to be measured after at least 10 minutes rest in supine position. 
8. Screening spirometry must demonstrate a pre -bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of the predicted value and at least 80% of 
the Visit 1 value.  In the morning of the first day of treatment (Visit 2) the FEV1 must also be in the range of ≥45% and ≤85% of the 
predicted value.  
9. Patients must demonstrate ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 360 mcg of albuterol/400 mcg salbutamol inhalation pMDI. If the patient achieves <15%, but ≥10% reversibility at Visit 1, the site may instruct the pat ient to hold LABA 
and/or ICS and return up to 7 days later for a  repeat test. Only 1 repeat of the Visit 1 spirometry (to retest reversibility) is allowed 
per screening.

34 10. Spirometric measurements in the morning prior to the dosing of inhaled medication at 60, 30, and 5 minutes pre-dose. 
11. Must be performed at 60, 30 and 5 minutes pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-dose on the first day of the 
6-week Treatment Period  (Visit 2).  
12. Inhalation training using placebo devices will be performed at the screening visit (Visit 1). Patients will inhale from a placebo pMDI. Patients will also  inhale from the  training device to simulate the resistance of the pMDI. Patients will be 
instructed to use the inhaler in the morning at  approximately the same time every day between 6:30 am and 11:00 am, and then 
approximately 12 hours later between 6:30 pm and 11:00 pm every day for the full duration of the Run-in Period and the Treatment 
Period. At each subsequent visit, the correct inhalation technique will be reinforced by the Investigator in the morning prior to 
inhalation. Patients will keep the placebo pMDI for use during the Run-in Period. 
13. If a re-supply is needed. 
14. If needed. 
15. Open- label placebo medication will be in haled during the Run-in Period. If a patient is deemed to be suitable to enter the Run-in 
Period, the first dose of placebo medication will be inhaled at the study site at Visit 1, and the correct inhalation technique will be 
reinforced.  
16. Patients will be instructed to withhold the study drug and not perform morning PEFR measurements until they arrive at the 
study site. Visits must be  scheduled to allow completion of the relevant assessments prior to taking study drug at the patient’s 
regular morning time. The last dose of study drug will  be inhaled at Visit 4 in the morning. Then, the inhaler will be collected.

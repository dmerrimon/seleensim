 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research requirements, approved by the Institutional Review Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisf action has increasingly become an important 
metric of hospital performance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinici an teams.  The scores resulting from these reports are integrated into the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is particularly relevant for surgical specialties.   Effective management of 
postoperative pain increases patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hospital  otolaryngology  
inpatient unit reveals that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfaction with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, which are associated with nausea, vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  These side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngol ogy patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain  control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications wor king synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is  a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminate d by 
renal excretion without chemical alteration.  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain manag ement.  It is also frequently used for acute post operative 
pain, and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending fre quency , 
dizziness, sedation, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in var ious surgical populations, such as gynecology -oncology and 
orthopedic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials report ed an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogene ity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies have examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryngology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surger y, oral cavity resection with reconstruction, and tonsillectomy9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with only one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology pat ients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until  POD 2 or 
the day of discharge, whichever comes first . Note that on the morning of POD3 at 7am, a VAS will be 
obtained to reflect the POD 2 7pm dose .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative N PO status  potentially  requiring a feeding tube .  The optimal 
dosage for gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on  day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain control in otolaryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed efficacy at low 
dosages and some showed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose regimen remains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included  participants are likely to be  gabapentin -naïve.  The perioperative BID dosing period was chosen  
to better elucidate the effects o f gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and neck 
mucosal resections cause significant pain for several d ays after the procedure.  T he majority of head and 
neck inpatient stays are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 da y and some as long as a 
few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject risk is als o 
minimized without compromising medication analgesic abilities.  Collaboration with the inpatient pain 
management team also supports the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be effective and will 
minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow  results will be collected from the medical record on those patients receiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.   The post-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the  research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and parti cipant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology  patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngolo gy head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 cancer resection  up to two days after surgery .   Subjects will be given the place bo or gabapentin for up to 
two days post op or until discharge, whichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recruited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM , the center for outpatient health or at other out patient or inpatient sites related to their pre -
surgical planning visits.   Eligible patients  will be identified before their scheduled appointments via review 
of medical records in Allscripts by a study team member  and approached either in the exam room du ring 
their scheduled appointment with  the head and neck surgeons  or afterwards via telephone call .  The 
study will be explained to them and a copy of the consent form will be  provided  after it has been signed.   
Patients will be reminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way affect their current or future care 
related to their head and neck health needs . Patients will be given time to ask questions and will have the 
option to consider  participation and enroll at a subsequent appointment before t heir planned procedure. 
The consent process will take place  in a private room.  Steps to avoid coercion include proper training in 
informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, and patients will be 
reassured that their car e from their head and neck surgeon will not be affected by their decision to 
participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made aware that their post operative care will not be 
limited by participation in this stud y, meaning that they will not be den ied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts e quivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usua l hospital procedure .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately 1 hour prior to surgery start time. 
Patients will not be excluded if surgery start time is delayed past 1 ho ur.  An investigational pharmacist 
will deliver the medication appropriately labeled  with patient name and study number  to the pre -op 
holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia faculty member of this 
project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a study member will place pain medication orders in compass 
on hold for post op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in cas e of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/ 10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by the inpatient treating physicians.  They will not have a ny 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study plac ed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least  initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s stud y participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copied and added to their hard copy file for use later during

CONFIDENTIAL  
 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed 45 minutes to 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
 
Note that subjects  must have completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive  the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at 45 minutes to 1 hour postoperatively , however , even if 
the case finishes later than 5 pm. On POD 1 -2, subjects will be given BID medications at 7am and 7pm 
per the study protocol and VAS scores will be obtained prior to medication administration   A separate 
VAS will be obtained at 10am on POD1 and POD 2.  ON POD 3 a 7am VAS will be obtaine d but no study 
medication given. This last VAS concludes participation in the study.  Discharge surveys will be 
administered at this point if they have not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investig ational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the 6200 inpatient floor prior to scheduled doses, and the medications will be stored in patient labeled 
bins in the locked medication refrigerator.  All VAS scor es will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, 
including draw ing the curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the room  from any potential 
roommate.  Also, the research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
providing the subject with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The s cale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study  ID and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access t o members of the study team should questions or concerns arise while 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to 30 days after completion of the study .   
 
Note that study medication wrappers have patient names on them as a safety mechanis m to make sure 
medications are given to the proper patient.  These wrappers and labels will be saved in the patient 
folders which are secured in a locked cabinet where only study team members have access.  E mpty  and 
unlabeled medication syringes will be di scarded in the red biohazard bins inside patient rooms.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperative narcotic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the ave rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospital length of stay , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfa ction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS s urveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usuall y 
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as a n ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to 1 hour  after surgery and then  three times  a day on 
POD 1 -2 and once on POD 3, or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner. A standardized 
VAS form will be given to subjects with verbal in struction to first “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by asking the 
subject to gesture  swallowing and “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you  swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VA S scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment qu estionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effec tive 
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant  
Gaba Protocol   Page 8

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of stay will be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medi cation side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.  
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse events.   Adverse  events 
will be monitor ed and recorded by study team members during subject  inpatient stay.   These events will 
be reviewed by the principal investigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events deter mined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the subject  will be 
discussed.  A safety meeting will be held half way through the study with the PI and all involved faculty 
mentors to de termine if an interim analysis is necessary, This analysis would be considered necessary if 
a significant number of adverse events likely related to the study medication were occurring, and an 
analysis to make sure the study was not causing harm to the tre atment group was needed.  
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Subjects undergoing definitive mucosal head and neck resection including oral cavity, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 night of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Crit eria

4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  either in the outpatient head and neck cl inic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by designated study team members .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by study team members prior to their scheduled appointments via the outpatient 
medical  records system.  Patient recruited by phone will be able to sign the informed consent prior to 
surgery either at a subsequent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private set ting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to  the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  Whe n and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their par ticipation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by the subject or by any team member if 
medical significant adverse reactions are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed by the principle 
investigator.  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The  withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by the subject, and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be exclude d in the final data analysis. The reasons for withdrawa l will be 
recorded and reported separately in the study data outcomes . 
 
4.4.3  Definitions  
Subject withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason d ropped out of the study before completion, whether by choice or by exclusion criteria 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does  not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300mg of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication syringe or in a marked bag with a capsule .  An unblinded study team 
member in charge of the randomization process will indicate to the pharmacy which subjects are to 
receive what medication .  The blinded study team members will not know which medication contains 
placebo or gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects wi ll receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperative holding area 
approximately 1  hour before their procedure is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the eveni ng (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD 0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be 
skipped.   Participants will then receive either placebo or  300 mg  of gabapentin BID POD 1 - POD 2.  
Dosing will end either on POD 2 after the PM dose or on day of discharge after the AM dose, whichever 
comes first.  VAS scores will be collected 45 minutes - 1 hour post extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet) .  
Gaba Protocol   Page 10 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
After a subject consents to study, the unblinded data manager will randomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign ed an enrollment ID .  The enrollment ID is given to any subject who signs 
consent. If the subject then proceeds to start the study and receive a medication dose, they will also be 
given a subject ID which reflects their randomization group.  The study ID reflects randomization while the 
enrollment ID is used to enter them into On Core and track their consent.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
The Investigational Pharmacist  will mix and prepare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist will deliver the medication to the preop holding unit or the floor and a designated study team 
member will administer it.  Please see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging details. Contact 
information for the pharmacy for this project is pharmacist Kathryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Inpatient pharmacists will be respo nsible for delivering the medication to the floor prior to the AM dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver the medication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.  Formal training for all study team members who will be administerin g the study drug or 
obtaining the VAS pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication dosage during the study period 
and record adherence to study pro tocol .  If a dose is missed during this period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protocol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will be made at the discretion of the principle investigator and stat istician at the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for missed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medicat ions made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than  5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or le ss than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated a s needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will  be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject 
name and study ID on it.  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 4 degrees Celsius.  The medications will be stored prior to dosing on the floor in a locked fridge in 
patient specific compartments, as per the floor medication protocol.  
5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications will be blinded towards whether a subject 
receives the  study drug  or the placebo.   The data manager who does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as well as the pharmacist  preparing the medication s, will be unblinded.  
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Investigational pharmacists will be responsible for medication delivery prior to planned dose s.  They will 
be alerted to upcoming procedures that involve study subject s.  They will be responsible for delivering the 
medication to the inpatient floor and in th e preoperative holding area.  Any damaged or unusable study 
drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study files  and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigational pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius. They will be stored on the inpatient floor in a locked, 4 degree fridge in patient specific 
compartments per the floor medication storage protocols.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team members administering the medications will receive the medication from the 
investigational pharmacist.  They will then administer the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destr uction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be  a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolve d, and documented.  Medication syringes will be discarded in the red 
biohazard containers in accordance with hospital policy and documented in the study files.  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or i n the preop holding unit.

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based on prior studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergo ing thyroidectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi d et al in a population of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the first 24 hours 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a st andard deviation of 9.9mg.  Assuming that 
this magnitude of effect variability will hold true in this project population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the calculated sample size within two years 
of study start time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusion criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged from 12 to 17 procedures a month.  
Note that IV morphine equivalents w ill be used rather than PO.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables will b e 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
Note that in discrepancies of data between reports, such as pack years smoked by a patient, an average 
of the reported amounts will be used to en sure consistency between data reporting fluctuations.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 7.3 Subj ect Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Event s 
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been ca used by the 
procedures involved in the research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness  or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur during the study period will be 
regarded as adverse events  (meaning that the event does not necessar ily have to be likely rel ated to the 
study drug to be considered an adverse event).  However, not all adverse events will meet criteria for 
reporting .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures will be reported as  adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  (see definition below)  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  that are considered significant and likely related to 
study participation  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considere d by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious , moderate or mild.  .  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in per sistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observatio n or medical treatment.  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 The study period during which adverse events  that are deemed reportable will be  the period from the day 
of surgery  to the end of the study , which is POD 3 or sooner if discharge is sooner than POD 3 . Ideally, 
these events will be reported to the PI within 24 hours of their occurrence.  Serious AE must be reported 
within 24 hours, however . Additionally, s ubjects will be provided with contact information for the study 
member that is in charge of adverse even t follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be instructed to 
contact this person with questions related to the study, adverse events or side effects experienced  after 
discharge so that the study members can be alerted to any events that may be related t o the medication. 
Any severe adverse events  or moderate events thought likely to be related to the study medication  that 
are reported to the PI during this 30 day window will be recorded .    Adverse events that occur during the 
inpatient study period and a re significant/severe as defined above or that are unusual will be required to 
be reported in the adverse events log. The PI will be made aware of all of these events immediately after 
they occur.    All adverse events regardless of grade and attribution w ill be collected.  The PI will sign off 
on all adverse events that are recorded in the adverse event log.  
 
For all severe AEs or AE s that are unexpected and thought likely related to the study medica tion, an IRB 
reportable event form will be submitted. All adverse events, whether mild, moderate or severe, will be 
reviewed at the safety meeting by all team members and faculty advisors to ensure that proper reporting 
has occurred.   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by  the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or  the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study  in the 30 days 
window follow discharge .   
8.2 Eliciting  Adverse Events  from Subjects  
At each interaction  with the subject, the investigator will seek inform ation on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the data recording form that is used to record subject data at each interaction.  Reporting 
of these eve nts is as outlined above.  Specific side effects that will be elicited at each interaction include 
nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
8.3 Unblinding Procedures  
For this study only the data manager and pharmacy will be unblinded to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the rest of the study investigators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subject data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study d ocuments within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI within a 24 hour time  period and must document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study dru g (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedati on.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25%  by the PI  and at 
50% enrollment  by the entire team  to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the st udy.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitori ng will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be  kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password prote cted spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records wil l be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years after study 
completion  per WU record retention policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Pla n, an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be specifically convened for this trial to 
review toxicity data at least every 6 months.  A DSMC will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 
clinical investigators and a biostatisti cian.  Like investigators, DSMC members are subject to the 
Washington University School of Medicine policies regarding standards of conduct. Individuals invited to 
serve on the DSMC will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the trial principal i nvestigator and/or 
appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that develop 
during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSMC must also be disclosed.  
 
The DSM report will be prepared by the study statistician  with assistance from the study team, will be 
reviewed by the DSMC, and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(QASMC).  This report will include:  
 
 HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator name, 
regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
 Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date of 
HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study  
 History of study incl uding summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual suspensions 
including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, error, or breach of 
confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason  
 Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  
 Protocol activation date  
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  
 Expected accrual end date and accrual by cohort  
Gaba Protocol   Page 16 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who ha ve met each 
objective  
 Measures of efficacy  
 Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have met the 
early stopping rules  
 Summary of toxicities separated by cohorts with the number of dose -limiting toxicities indicated  
 Abstract submissions/publications  
 Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
Further DSMC responsibilities are described in the DSMC charter.  
 
The study principal investigator and coordinator will monitor for seriou s toxicities on an ongoing basis. 
Once the principal investigator or coordinator becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be 
reported to the HRPO and QASMC according to institutional guidelines (please refer to Section 7.0).

11 Medication p rocessing  
 
11.1 Medica tion Processing  
All unused medications will be picked up from the pharmacy within 12 hours of the time they are 
determined to be not needed or not used.  The pharmacy will be alerted in real time that the medication 
was not needed so that  they can expect to pick it up.  A confirmation communication will be sent to the 
study team once the medication is retrieved to ensure that it is properly picked up.

 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research requirements, appro ved by the Institutional Review Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisfaction has increasingly become an impor tant 
metric of hospital performance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinician teams.  The scores resulting from th ese reports are integrated into the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is particularly r elevant for surgical specialties.   Effective management of 
postoperative pain increases patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hospital  otolar yngology  
inpatient unit reveals that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfaction with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, w hich are associated with nausea, vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  These side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful  and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical  for patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain co ntrol, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often u sed in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is  structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional im plication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
renal excretion without chemical a lteration.  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain management.  It is also frequently used for acute post operative 
pain, and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending frequency , 
dizziness, sedation, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in various surgical populations, such as gyne cology -oncology and 
orthopedic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials report ed an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogeneity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies have examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryngology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, oral cavity resection with reconstru ction, and tonsillectomy9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with only one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until POD 2 or 
the day of discharge, whichev er comes first . Note that on the morning of POD3 at 7am, a VAS will be 
obtained to reflect the POD 2 7pm dose .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative NPO status  potentially  requiring a feedi ng tube .  The optimal 
dosage for gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as  needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain control in otolaryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed effic acy at low 
dosages and some showed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose regimen remains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included participants are likely to be  gabapent in-naïve.  The perioperative BID dosing period was chosen  
to better elucidate the effects o f gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and neck 
mucosal resections cause significant pain for several days after the procedure.  T he majority of head and 
neck inpatient stays are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 da y and some as long as a 
few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject risk is also 
minimized without compromising medica tion analgesic abilities.  Collaboration with the inpatient pain 
management team also supports the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be effective and will 
minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow results will be collected from the med ical record on those patients receiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.   The post-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on  decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during  their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 cancer resection  up to two days after surgery .   Subjects will be given the placebo or gabapentin for up to 
two days p ost op or until discharge, whichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recruited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM , the center for outpatient health or at other outpatient or inpatient sites related to  their pre -
surgical planning visits.   Eligible patients  will be identified before their scheduled appointments via review 
of medical records in Allscripts by a study team member  and approached either in the exam room during 
their scheduled appointment with  the head and neck surgeons  or afterwards via telephone call .  The 
study will be explained to them and a copy of the consent form will be  provided  after it has been signed.   
Patients will be reminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way affec t their current or future care 
related to their head and neck health needs . Patients will be given time to ask questions and will have the 
option to consider  participation and enroll at a subsequent appointment before their planned procedure. 
The consent p rocess will take place  in a private room.  Steps to avoid coercion include proper training in 
informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, and patients will be 
reassured that their care from their head and neck surgeon wi ll not be affected by their decision to 
participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made aware that their post operative care will not be 
limited by participation in this stud y, meaning that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodo ne medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospital procedure .  A study team m ember will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately 1 hour prior to surgery start time. 
Patients will not be excluded if surgery start time is delayed past 1 hour .  An investigational pharmacist 
will deliver the medication appropriately labeled  with patient name and study number  to the pre -op 
holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia faculty member of this 
project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a stu dy member will place pain medication orders in compass 
on hold for post op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less t han or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team me mber will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by the inpatient treating physicians.  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medication s simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after  extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication p rotocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restriction s on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remai n in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copied and added to their hard copy file for use later during 
Gaba Protocol   Page 6

CONFIDENTIAL  
 tabulation/data anaylsis of th e pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed 45 minutes to 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
 
Note that subjects  must have completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  O therwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at 45 minutes to 1 hour postoperatively , however , even if 
the case finishes later than 5pm. On POD 1 -2, subjects will be give n BID medications at 7am and 7pm 
per the study protocol and VAS scores will be obtained prior to medication administration   A separate 
VAS will be obtained at 10am on POD1 and POD 2.  ON POD 3 a 7am VAS will be obtained but no study 
medication given. This  last VAS concludes participation in the study.  Discharge surveys will be 
administered at this point if they have not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivere d the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the 6200 inpatient floor prior to scheduled doses, and the medications will be stored in patient labeled 
bins in the locked medication refrigerator.  All VAS scores will be obtained with subject priv acy optimized, 
including draw ing the curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the room  from any potential 
roommate.  Also, the research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
providing the subject with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measure s 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subject s will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access to members of the study team should qu estions or concerns arise while 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to 30 days after completion of the study .   
 
Note that study medication wrappers have patient names on them as a safety mechanism to make sure 
medications are given to the proper patient.  These wrappers and labels will be saved in the patient 
folders which are secured in a locked cabinet where only study team members have access.  E mpty  and 
unlabeled medication syringes will be discarded in the red biohazard bins ins ide patient rooms.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperative narcotic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes so oner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the ave rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondar y endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospital length of stay , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captu red in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attac hed “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the su m of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to 1 hour  after surgery and then  three times  a day on 
POD 1 -2 and once on POD 3, or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner. A standardized 
VAS form will be given to subjects with verbal instruction to first “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by asking the 
subject to gesture  swallowing and “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “n o pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be ave raged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the foll owing questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how  has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant  
Gaba Protocol   Page 8

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of the se questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of stay will be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.  
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse events.   Adverse  events 
will be monitored and recorded by study team members  during subject  inpatient stay.   These events will 
be reviewed by the principal investigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events determined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the subject  will be 
discussed.  A safety meeting will be heald half way through the study with the PI and all involved faculty 
mentors to determine if an interim analysis is ne cessary, This analysis would be considered necessary if 
a significant number of adverse events likely related to the study medication were occurring, and an 
analysis to make sure the study was not causing harm to the treatment group was needed.

over the phone after this clinic appointment by designated study team members .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by study team members prior to their scheduled appointments via the outpatient 
medical records system.  Patient recruited by phone will be able to sign the informed consent prior to 
surgery either at a subsequent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained  to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their  subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subje cts may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be with drawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery  will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be request ed either by the subject or by any team member if 
medical significant adverse reactions are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed by the principle 
investigator.  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immedia tely when deemed necessary or when desired by the subject, and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be excluded in the final data analysis. The re asons for withdrawa l will be 
recorded and reported separately in the study data outcomes . 
 
4.4.3  Definitions  
Subject withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before compl etion, whether by choice or by exclusion criteria 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300mg of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication syringe or in a marked bag with a capsule .  An unblinded study team 
member in charge of the rand omization process will indicate to the pharmacy which subjects are to 
receive what medication .  The blinded study team members will not know which medication contains 
placebo or gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperative holding area 
approximately 1  hour before their procedure is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD 0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be 
skipped.   Participants will then receive either placebo or  300 mg  of gabapentin BID POD 1 - POD 2.  
Dosing will end either on POD 2 after the PM dose or  on day of discharge after the AM dose, whichever 
comes first.  VAS scores will be collected 45 minutes - 1 hour post extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).  
Gaba Protocol   Page 10 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
After a subject consents to study, the unblinded data manager will randomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign ed an enrollment ID .  The enrollment ID is given to any subject who signs 
consent. If the subject then proceeds  to start the study and receive a medication dose, they will also be 
given a subject ID which reflects their randomization group.  The study ID reflects randomization while the 
enrollment ID is used to enter them into OnCore and track their consent.  
5.4 Prepa ration and Administration of Study Drug  
The Investigational Pharmacist  will mix and prepare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist will deliver the medication to the preop holding unit or the floor and a designated study team 
membe r will administer it.  Please see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging details. Contact 
information for the pharmacy for this project is pharmacist Kathryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Inpatient pharmacists will be responsible for delivering the medication  to the floor prior to the AM dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver the medication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.  Formal training for all study team members who will be administering the study drug or 
obtaining the VA S pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication dosage during the study period 
and record adherence to study protocol .  If a dose is missed during t his period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protocol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will be made at the discretion of the principle investigator and statistician at the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for missed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.2 5-0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetami nophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pai n greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose,  and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name and study ID on it.  The p harmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 4 degrees Celsius.  The medications will be stored prior to dosing on the floor in a locked f ridge in 
patient specific compartments, as per the floor medication protocol.  
5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications will be blinded towards whether a subject 
receives the  study drug  or the placebo.   The data manager w ho does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as well as the pharmacist  preparing the medication s, will be unblinded.  
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Investigational pharmacists will be re sponsible for medication delivery prior to planned dose s.  They will 
be alerted to upcoming procedures that involve study subject s.  They will be responsible for delivering the 
medication to the inpatient floor and in the preoperative holding area.  Any da maged or unusable study 
drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study files  and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigational pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius. They will be stored on the inpatient  floor in a locked, 4 degree fridge in patient specific 
compartments per the floor medication storage protocols.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team members administering the medications will receive the medication fr om the 
investigational pharmacist.   They will then administer the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completi on of the study, there will be  a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and documented.  Medication syrin ges will be discarded in the red 
biohazard containers in accordance with hospital policy and documented in the study files.  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Pr ocedures

 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
3 or on date of discharge, whichever comes sooner . 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based on prior studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergoing thyroidectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi d et al in a population of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the first 24 hours 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a standard deviation of 9.9mg.  Assuming  that 
this magnitude of effect variability will hold true in this project population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in av erage morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the calculated sample size w ithin two years 
of study start time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusion criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged from 12 to 17 procedures a month.  
Note that IV morphine equivalents will be used rather than PO.  
7.2 Statist ical Methods  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of ch aracteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
Note that in discrepancies of data between reports, such as pack years smoked by a patient, an average 
of the reported amounts will be used to ensure consistency between data report ing fluctuations.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to pla cebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.

Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol-compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle inve stigator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in t he research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or wors ens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur during the study period will be 
regarded as adverse events  (meaning that the event does not necessary have to be likely related to the 
study drug to be considere d an adverse event).  However, not all adverse events will meet criteria for 
reporting .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures will be reported as  adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  (see definition below)  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  that are considered significant and likely related to 
study participation  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinica l significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious , moderate or mild.  .  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or significant disability or i ncapacity  
 a new congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treatment.  
 
 
Adverse  Event Reporting  
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 The study period during which adverse events  that are deemed reportable  must be reported  will be  the 
period from the day of surgery  to the end of the study , which is POD 3 or sooner if discharge is sooner 
than POD 3 . Ideally, these event s will be reported to the PI within 24 hours of their occurrence.  Serious 
AE must be reported within 24 hours, however . Additionally, s ubjects will be provided with contact 
information for the study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Mel anie Townsend, PI).  
They will be instructed to contact this person with questions related to the study, adverse events or side 
effects experienced  after discharge so that the study members can be alerted to any events that may be 
related to the medication . Any severe adverse events  or moderate events thought likely to be related to 
the study medication  that are reported to the PI during this 30 day window will be recorded .    Adverse 
events that occur during the inpatient study period and are significant/s evere as defined above or that are 
unusual will be required to be reported in the adverse events log. The PI will be made aware of all of 
these events immediately after they occur.  Events that are mild will not be required to be recorded in the 
adverse ev ents log.  Events that are moderate and thought likely related to the study medication will be 
reported.  Events that are moderate but deemed unlikely to be due to the study medication will not be 
required to be reported in the adverse events log.  However , these events may still be recorded in the 
adverse events log at the discretion of the PI.  The PI will sign off on all adverse events that are recorded 
in the adverse event log.  
 
For all severe AE or AE that are unexpected and thought likely related to the study medication , an IRB 
event form will be submitted. For  moderate events  thought likely to be due to the medication or 
unexpected , an event form will be submitted at at the discretion of the PI . This design is intended to make 
sure that if subjects s eem to be having symptoms that aren’t expected to be caused by study participation 
but are noted in multiple subjects, then this gets reported.  However, those side effects that are common 
after surgery (such as sedation or nausea) that could also be relat ed to study medications are noted in 
the AE log when appropriate but not generating multiple IRB reportable event forms.  The goal is to 
ensure subject safety and also only report appropriate events to the IRB.  All adverse events, whether 
mild, moderate o r severe, will be reviewed at the safety meeting by all team members and faculty 
advisors to ensure that proper reporting has occurred.   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are res olved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believe s might reasonably be related to participation in this study  in the 30 days 
window follow discharge .   
8.2 Elliciting  Adverse Events  from Subjects  
At each interaction  with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific 
quest ioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the data recording form that is used to record subject data at each interaction.  Reporting 
of these events is as outlined above.  Specific side effects that will be elicited at each interaction include 
nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
8.3 Unblinding Procedures  
For this study only the data manager and pharmacy will be unblinded to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the r est of the study investigators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subject data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding  that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI within a 24 hour time period and must document the  
event.  Sub jects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience sign ificant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be c onducted at 25%  by the PI  and at 
50% enrollment  by the entire team  to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study.  This safety 
monitoring will include  careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of t he number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS  pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years after study 
completion  per WU record retention policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored  in real time  for each subject by the PI and study team.  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all advers e events and data collection forms will be reviewed by the PI and discussed 
among the study team.   At our interim safety meeting, we determined by our AE log that significant 
adverse events were not occurring to study patients and events that were moderate  and likely related to 
the medication also were extremely infrequent. We determined at that time that a third party officer review 
was unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that we were aware at that point that an audit would occur.  
We will proceed  to study completion without this third party review.  We also will be reporting our study 
events and AE events in a DSM log to the Siteman monitoring committee , which will also serve as a third 
party review.  
 
11 Medication processing  
 
Gaba Protocol   Page 16 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 11.1 Medicaiton Processing  
All unused medications will be picked up from the pharmacy within 12 hours of the time they are 
determined to be not needed or not used.  The pharmacy will be alerted in real time that the medication 
was not needed so that they can expect to pick it up.  A confirmation communication will be sent to the 
study team once the medication is retrieved to ensure that it is properly picked up.

 1 Introduction  
This document  is a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research requirements, approved by the Institutional Rev iew Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisfaction has increasingly become an important 
metric of hospital perf ormance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinician teams.  The scores resulting from these reports are integrated i nto the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is particularly relevant for surgical special ties.  Effective management of 
postoperative pain increases patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hospital  otolaryngology  
inpatient unit reve als that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfaction with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, which are associated with nau sea, vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  These side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitati ng 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic m edication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regim ens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
renal excretion without chemical alteration.  Dose adjustments  are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain management.  It is also frequently used for acute post operative 
pain, an d meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending frequency , 
dizziness, sedation, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, constip ation, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in various surgical populations, such as gynecology -oncology and 
orthoped ic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials report ed an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogeneity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies have  examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryngology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, oral cavity resection with reconstruction, and tonsillectomy9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with only one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , whic h is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until POD 2 or 
the day of discharge, whichever comes first . Note that on the morning of POD3 at 7am, a VAS will be 
obtained to reflect the POD 2 7pm dose .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative NPO status  potentially  requiring a feeding tube .  The optimal 
dosage  for gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain control in otolaryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed efficacy at low 
dosages and some showed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose regimen remains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included participants are likely to be  gabapentin -naïve.  The perioperative  BID dosing period was chosen  
to better elucidate the effects o f gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and neck 
mucosal resections cause significant pain for several days after the procedure.  T he majority of head and 
neck inpatient s tays are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 da y and some as long as a 
few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject risk is also 
minimized without compromising medication analgesic abilities.  Collaboration with the inpatient pain 
management team also supports the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be effective and will 
minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow results will be collected from the medical record on those patient s receiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.   The post-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quali ty improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic require ments for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Des ign 
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  The 
duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 cancer resection  up to two days after surgery .   Subjects will be given the placebo or gabapentin for up to 
two days post op or until discharge, w hichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recruited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM , the center for outpatient health or at other outpatient or inpatient sites related to their pre -
surgical planning  visits.   Eligible patients  will be identified before their scheduled appointments via review 
of medical records in Allscripts by a study team member  and approached either in the exam room during 
their scheduled appointment with  the head and neck surgeons  or afterwards via telephone call .  The 
study will be explained to them and a copy of the consent form will be  provided  after it has been signed.   
Patients will be reminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way affect their current or future ca re 
related to their head and neck health needs . Patients will be given time to ask questions and will have the 
option to consider  participation and enroll at a subsequent appointment before their planned procedure. 
The consent process will take place  in a private room.  Steps to avoid coercion include proper training in 
informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, and patients will be 
reassured that their care from their head and neck surgeon will not be affected by their decision to 
participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made aware that their post operative care will not be 
limited by participation in this stud y, meaning that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply becau se they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an a llergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospital procedure .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately 1 hour prior to surgery start time. 
Patients will not be excluded if surgery start time is delayed past 1 hour .  An investigational pharmacist 
will deliver the medication ap propriately labeled  with patient name and study number  to the pre -op 
holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia faculty member of this 
project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a study member will place pain me dication orders in compass 
on hold for post op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg i f greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pai n (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropri ate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by the inpatient treating physicians.  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are in volved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject  had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that a re needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copied and added to their hard copy file for use later during 
Gaba Protocol   Page 6

CONFIDENTIAL  
 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed 45 minutes to 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
 
Note that subjects  must have completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be  skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at 45 minutes to 1 hour postoperatively , however , even if 
the case finishes later than 5pm. On POD 1 -2, subjects will be given BID medications at 7am and  7pm 
per the study protocol and VAS scores will be obtained prior to medication administration   A separate 
VAS will be obtained at 10am on POD1 and POD 2.  ON POD 3 a 7am VAS will be obtained but no study 
medication given. This last VAS concludes particip ation in the study.  Discharge surveys will be 
administered at this point if they have not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a p roperly labeled container to 
the 6200 inpatient floor prior to scheduled doses, and the medications will be stored in patient labeled 
bins in the locked medication refrigerator.  All VAS scores will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, 
including dra wing the curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the room  from any potential 
roommate.  Also, the research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallo wing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
providing the subject with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked  “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access to members of the study team should questions or concerns arise wh ile 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to 30 days after completion of the study .   
 
Note that study medication wrappers have patient names on them as a safety mechanism to make sure 
medications are given to the proper patient.  Thes e wrappers and labels will be saved in the patient 
folders which are secured in a locked cabinet where only study team members have access.  E mpty  and 
unlabeled medication syringes will be discarded in the red biohazard bins inside patient rooms.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperative narcotic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the ave rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospital length of stay , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered  at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  question naire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7

CONFIDENTIAL  
 0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assi gned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to 1 hour after surgery and then  three times  a day on 
POD 1 -2 and once on POD 3, or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner. A standardized 
VAS form will be given to subjects with verbal instruction to first “mark on the line the point that 
you feel repr esent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by asking the 
subject to gesture  swallowing and “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “ma rk the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extr eme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the pas t, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance bee n? 
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant  
Gaba Protocol   Page 8

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reporte d separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of stay will be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated  with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.  
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse events.   Adverse  events 
will be monitored and recorded by study team members during subject  inpatient st ay.  These events will 
be reviewed by the principal investigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events determined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the subject  will be 
discussed.  A safety meeting will be heald half way through the study with the PI and all involved faculty 
mentors to determine if an interim analysis is necessary, This analysis would  be considered necessary if 
a significant number of adverse events likely related to the study medication were occurring, and an 
analysis to make sure the study was not causing harm to the treatment group was needed.  
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal

surgery either at a subsequent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative ane sthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from th e study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated  or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding  tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by the subject or by any team member if 
medical significant adverse reactions are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed by the principle 
investigator.  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary o r when desired by the subject, and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be excluded in the final data analysis. The reasons for withdrawa l will be  
recorded and reported separately in the study data outcomes . 
 
4.4.3  Definitions  
Subject withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before completion, whether by choice or by exclusion criteria 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300m g of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication syringe or in a marked bag with a capsule .  An unblinded study team 
member in charge of the randomization process will indic ate to the pharmacy which subjects are to 
receive what medication .  The blinded study team members will not know which medication contains 
placebo or gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperati ve holding area 
approximately 1  hour before their procedure is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to  receive the second POD 0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be 
skipped.   Participants will then receive either placebo or  300 mg  of gabapentin BID POD 1 - POD 2.  
Dosing will end either on POD 2 after the PM dose or on day of discharge after t he AM dose, whichever 
comes first.  VAS scores will be collected 45 minutes - 1 hour post extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).  
Gaba Protocol   Page 10 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
After a sub ject consents to study, the unblinded data manager will randomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign ed an enrollment ID .  The enrollment ID is given to any subject who signs 
consent. If the subject then proceeds to start the study and rece ive a medication dose, they will also be 
given a subject ID which reflects their randomization group.  The study ID reflects randomization while the 
enrollment ID is used to enter them into OnCore and track their consent.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of  Study Drug  
The Investigational Pharmacist  will mix and prepare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist will deliver the medication to the preop holding unit or the floor and a designated study team 
member will administer it.  Pleas e see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging details. Contact 
information for the pharmacy for this project is pharmacist Kathryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Inpatient pharmacists will be responsible for delivering the medication to the floor prior to the A M dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver the medication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.  Formal training for all study team members who will be administering the study drug or 
obtaining the VAS pain scores is required pr ior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication dosage during the study period 
and record adherence to study protocol .  If a dose is missed during this period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protocol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will be made at the discretion of the principle investigator and statistician at the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will b e maintained such that subjects who are excluded for missed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough  pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain i n non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough  pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get  15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patien t’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single cap sules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name and study ID on it.  The pharmacy will be made aware o f all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 4 degrees Celsius.  The medications will be stored prior to dosing on the floor in a locked fridge in 
patient specific co mpartments, as per the floor medication protocol.  
5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications will be blinded towards whether a subject 
receives the  study drug  or the placebo.   The data manager who does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as well as the pharmacist  preparing the medication s, will be unblinded.  
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Investigational pharmacists will be responsible for medication del ivery prior to planned dose s.  They will 
be alerted to upcoming procedures that involve study subject s.  They will be responsible for delivering the 
medication to the inpatient floor and in the preoperative holding area.  Any damaged or unusable study 
drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study files  and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigational pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius. They will be stored on the inpatient floor in a locked, 4 degree  fridge in patient specific 
compartments per the floor medication storage protocols.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team members administering the medications will receive the medication fr om the 
investigational pharmacist.  They will then administer the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and documented.  Medication syringes will be discarded in the  red 
biohazard containers in accordance with hospital policy and documented in the study files.  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedure s are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent.

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based on prior studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergoing thyroidectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi d et al in a populatio n of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the first 24 hours 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a standard deviation of 9.9mg.  Assuming that 
this magnitude of effe ct variability will hold true in this project population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the calculated sample size within two years 
of study sta rt time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusion criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged from 12 to 17 procedures a month.  
Note that IV morphine equivalents will be used rather than PO.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive sta tistics will be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatm ent groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
Note that in discrepancies of data between reports, such as pack years smoked by a patient, an average 
of the reported amounts will be used to ensure consistency between data reporting fluctuations.  
 
The prim ary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes  of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.

Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who r eceived all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators broc hure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research)  
 Suggests that t he research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the c ourse of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur during the study period will be 
regarded as adverse events  (meaning that the event does not necessary have to be likely related to the 
study drug to be considered an adverse event).  Howeve r, not all adverse events will meet criteria for 
reporting .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures will be reported as  adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  (see definition below)  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  that are considered significant and likely related to 
study participation  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adve rse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious , moderate or mild.  .  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anoma ly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treatment.  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 The study peri od during which adverse events  that are deemed reportable  must be reported  will be  the 
period from the day of surgery  to the end of the study , which is POD 3 or sooner if discharge is sooner 
than POD 3 . Ideally, these events will be reported to the PI wit hin 24 hours of their occurrence.  Serious 
AE must be reported within 24 hours, however . Additionally, s ubjects will be provided with contact 
information for the study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  
They will b e instructed to contact this person with questions related to the study, adverse events or side 
effects experienced  after discharge so that the study members can be alerted to any events that may be 
related to the medication. Any severe adverse events  or m oderate events thought likely to be related to 
the study medication  that are reported to the PI during this 30 day window will be recorded .    Adverse 
events that occur during the inpatient study period and are significant/severe as defined above or that a re 
unusual will be required to be reported in the adverse events log. The PI will be made aware of all of 
these events immediately after they occur.  Events that are mild will not be required to be recorded in the 
adverse events log.  Events that are moder ate and thought likely related to the study medication will be 
reported.  Events that are moderate but deemed unlikely to be due to the study medication will not be 
required to be reported in the adverse events log.  However, t hese events may still be reco rded in the 
adverse events log at the discretion of the PI.  The PI will sign off on all adverse events that are recorded 
in the adverse event log.  
 
For all severe AE or AE that are unexpected and thought likely related to the study medicaiton , an IRB 
event form will be submitted. For  moderate events  thought likely to be due to the medication or 
unexpected , an event form will be submitted at at the discretion of the PI . This design is intended to make 
sure that if subjects seem to be having symptoms that aren’t expected to be caused by study participation 
but are noted in multiple subjects, then this gets reported.  However, those side effects that are common 
after surgery (such as sedation or nausea) that could also be related to study medications are not ed in 
the AE log when appropriate but not generating multiple IRB reportable event forms.  The goal is to 
ensure subject safety and also only report appropriate events to the IRB.  All adverse events, whether 
mild, moderate or severe, will be reviewed at t he safety meeting by all team members and faculty 
advisors to ensure that proper reporting has occurred.   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to f ollow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related t o participation in this study  in the 30 days 
window follow discharge .   
8.2 Elliciting  Adverse Events  from Subjects  
At each interaction  with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the data recording form that is used to record subject data at each interaction.  Reporting 
of these events is as outlined above.  Specific side effects that will be elicited a t each interaction include 
nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
8.3 Unblinding Procedures  
For this study only the data manager and pharmacy will be unblinded to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the rest of the study investigators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subject data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI within a 24 hour time period and must document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defin ed above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25%  by the PI  and at 
50% enrollment  by the entire team  to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropr iate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Heal th Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse eve nt reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years a fter study 
completion  per WU record retention policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored  in real time  for each subject by the PI and study team.  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection fo rms will be reviewed by the PI and discussed 
among the study team.  A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by this study.  At our interim safety meeting, 
we determined by our AE log that significant adverse events were not occurring to study patients and 
events that were moderate and likely related to the medication also were extremely infrequent. We 
determined at that time that a third party officer review wa s unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that 
we were aware at that point that an audit would occur.  We will proceed to study completion without this 
third party review.  We also will be reporting our study events and AE events in a DSM log to the S iteman 
monitoring committee , which will also serve as a third party review.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 11.1 Medicaiton Processing  
All unused medications will be picked up from the pharmacy within 12 hours of the time they are 
determined to be not needed or not u sed.  The pharmacy will be alerted in real time that the medication 
was not needed so that they can expect to pick it up.  A confirmation communication will be sent to the 
study team once the medication is retrieved to ensure that it is properly picked up.

 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted  according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research requirements, approved by the Institutional Review Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisfaction has increasingly become an important 
metric of hospital performance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinician teams.  The scores resulting from these reports are integrated into the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for M edicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is particularly relevant for surgical specialties.   Effective management of 
postoperative pain increas es patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hospital  otolaryngology  
inpatient unit reveals that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfactio n with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, which are associated with nausea, vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  T hese side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased ri sk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effec ts8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pai n.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric aci d), without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unkn own in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
renal excretion without chemical alteration.  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL /min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain management.  It is also frequently used for acute post operative 
pain, and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending frequency , 
dizziness, sedation, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Num erous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in various surgical populations, such as gynecology -oncology and 
orthopedic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials rep orted an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogeneity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies have examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryn gology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, oral cavity resection with reconstruction, and tonsillectomy9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with on ly one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgica l pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until POD 2 or 
the day of discharge, whichever comes first . Note that on the morning of POD3 at 7am, a VAS will be 
obtained to re flect the POD 2 7pm dose .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative NPO status  potentially  requiring a feeding tube .  The optimal 
dosage for gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain contr ol in otolaryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed efficacy at low 
dosages and some showed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose  regimen remains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included participants are likely to be  gabapentin -naïve.  The perioperative BID dosing period was chosen  
to better elucidate the eff ects o f gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and neck 
mucosal resections cause significant pain for several days after the procedure.  T he majority of head and 
neck inpatient stays are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 day and some as long as a 
few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject risk is also 
minimized without compromising medication analgesic abilities.  Collaboration with the inpatient pain 
management team also  supports the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be effective and will 
minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow results will be collected from the medical record on those patients receiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.   The post-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benef it of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head a nd neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, plac ebo-controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the o ral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subse quent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 cancer resection  up to two days after surgery .   Subjects will be given the placebo or gabapentin for up to 
two days post op or until discharge, whichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recru ited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM , the center for outpatient health or at other outpatient or inpatient sites related to their pre -
surgical planning visits.   Eligible patients  will be identified before the ir scheduled appointments via review 
of medical records in Allscripts by a study team member  and approached either in the exam room during 
their scheduled appointment with  the head and neck surgeons  or afterwards via telephone call .  The 
study will be expl ained to them and a copy of the consent form will be  provided  after it has been signed.   
Patients will be reminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way affect their current or future care 
related to their head and neck health needs . Patients will be given time to ask questions and will have the 
option to consider  participation and enroll at a subsequent appointment before their planned procedure. 
The consent process will take place  in a private room.  Steps to avoid coercion include proper tra ining in 
informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, and patients will be 
reassured that their care from their head and neck surgeon will not be affected by their decision to 
participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made aware that their post operative care will not be 
limited by participation in this stud y, meaning that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be o btained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospital procedure .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately 1 hour prior to surgery start time. 
Patients will not be excluded if surgery start time is delayed past 1 hour .  An investigational pharmacist 
will deliver the medication appropriately labeled  with patient name and study number  to the pre -op 
holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia faculty member of this 
project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a study member will place pain medication orders in compass 
on hold for post op care.  The se orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PR N breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater  than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject w ill be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by the inpatient treating physicians.  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn fro m the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administ ering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperati ve pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinic al stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copied and added to their hard copy file for use later during 
Gaba Protocol   Page 6

CONFIDENTIAL  
 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed 45 m inutes to 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
 
Note that subjects  must have completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at 45 minutes to 1 hour postoperatively , however , even if 
the case finishes later than 5pm. On POD 1 -2, subjects will be given BID medications at 7am and 7pm 
per the study protocol and VAS scores will be obtain ed prior to medication administration   A separate 
VAS will be obtained at 10am on POD1 and POD 2.  ON POD 3 a 7am VAS will be obtained but no study 
medication given. This last VAS concludes participation in the study.  Discharge surveys will be 
administer ed at this point if they have not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the 6200 inpatient floor pri or to scheduled doses, and the medications will be stored in patient labeled 
bins in the locked medication refrigerator.  All VAS scores will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, 
including draw ing the curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of  the room  from any potential 
roommate.  Also, the research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
providing the subje ct with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far ri ght.  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of  their 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessibl e only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access to members of the study team should questions or concerns arise while 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to 30 days after completion of the study .   
 
Note that study medication wrappers have patient names on them as a safety mechanism to make sure 
medications are given to the proper patient.  These wrappers and labels will be saved in the patient 
folder s which are secured in a locked cabinet where only study team members have access.  E mpty  and 
unlabeled medication syringes will be discarded in the red biohazard bins inside patient rooms.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperati ve narcotic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the ave rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospital length of stay , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat s atisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score  of 0-3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to 1 hour  after surgery and then  three times  a day on 
POD 1 -2 and once on POD 3, or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner. A standardized 
VAS form will be given to subjects with verbal instruction to first “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  Thi s is followed by asking the 
subject to gesture  swallowing and “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in  
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication e fficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as m orphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very toleran t 
Gaba Protocol   Page 8

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of s tay will be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.  
3.4 Primary S afety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse events.   Adverse  events 
will be monitored and recorded by study team members during subject  inpatient stay.   These events will 
be reviewed by the principal inves tigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events determined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the s ubject  will be 
discussed.  A safety meeting will be heald half way through the study with the PI and all involved faculty 
mentors to determine if an interim analysis is necessary, This analysis would be considered necessary if 
a significant number of adver se events likely related to the study medication were occurring, and an 
analysis to make sure the study was not causing harm to the treatment group was needed.  
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Subjects undergoing definitive mucosal head and neck resection including oral cavity, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 night of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria

4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  either in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by designated study team members .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by study team members prior to their scheduled appointments via the outpatient 
medical records system.  Patient recruited by phone will be able to sign the informed consent prior to 
surgery either at a subse quent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wi sh to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was ant icipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by the subject or by any team member if 
medical significant adverse reactio ns are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed by the principle 
investigator.  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by the subject, and documentation of the r eason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be excluded in the final data analysis. The reasons for withdrawa l will be 
recorded and reported separately in the study data outco mes. 
 
4.4.3  Definitions  
Subject withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before completion, whether by choice or by exclusion criteria 
(ie- staying intubated the night af ter surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300mg of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will  be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication syringe or in a marked bag with a capsule .  An unblinded study team 
member in charge of the randomization process will indicate to the pharmacy which subjects are to 
receive what me dication .  The blinded study team members will not know which medication contains 
placebo or gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperative holding area 
approximately 1  hour before their procedu re is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD 0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be 
skipped.   Participants will then receive either placebo or  300 mg  of gabapentin BID POD 1 - POD 2.  
Dosing will end either on POD 2 after the PM dose or on day of discharge after the AM dose, whichever 
comes first.  VAS scores will be co llected 45 minutes - 1 hour post extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).  
Gaba Protocol   Page 10 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
After a subject consents to study, the unblinded data manager will r andomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign ed an enrollment ID .  The enrollment ID is given to any subject who signs 
consent. If the subject then proceeds to start the study and receive a medication dose, they will also be 
given a subject ID which reflects their randomization group.  The study ID reflects randomization while the 
enrollment ID is used to enter them into OnCore and track their consent.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
The Investigational Pharmacist  will mix and p repare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist will deliver the medication to the preop holding unit or the floor and a designated study team 
member will administer it.  Please see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging details.  Contact 
information for the pharmacy for this project is pharmacist Kathryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Inpatient pharmacists will be responsible for delivering the medication to the floor prior to the AM dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver the me dication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.  Formal training for all study team members who will be administering the study drug or 
obtaining the VAS pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication dosage during the study period 
and record adherence to study protocol .  If a dose is missed during this period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protoc ol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will be made at the discretion of the principle investigator and statistician at the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for miss ed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg an d pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic pa tients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and p ain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name and study ID on it.  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medica tions approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 4 degrees Celsius.  The medications will be stored prior to dosing on the floor in a locked fridge in 
patient specific compartments, as per the floor medication protocol.  
5.8 Blindi ng of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications will be blinded towards whether a subject 
receives the  study drug  or the placebo.   The data manager who does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as wel l as the pharmacist  preparing the medication s, will be unblinded.  
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Investigational pharmacists will be responsible for medication delivery prior to planned dose s.  They will 
be alerted to up coming procedures that involve study subject s.  They will be responsible for delivering the 
medication to the inpatient floor and in the preoperative holding area.  Any damaged or unusable study 
drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study file s and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigational pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius. They will be stored on the inpatient floor in a locked, 4 degree fridge in patient specific 
compartments per the floor me dication storage protocols.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team members administering the medications will receive the medication fr om the 
investigational pharmacist.  They will then administer the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be  a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and documented.  Medication syringes will be discarded in the red 
biohazard containers in accordance with hospital pol icy and documented in the study files.  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit

 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomiz ation  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
3 or on date of discharge, whichever comes sooner . 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample S ize Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based on prior studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergoing thyroidectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi d et al in a population of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the first 24 hours 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a standard deviation of 9.9mg.  Assuming that 
this magnitude of effect variability will hold true in this project population,  it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  A ssuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the calculated sample size within two years 
of study start time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusio n criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged from 12 to 17 procedures a month.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for co ntinuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the t wo treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were  unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity wi ll be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the re search  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to addi tional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threate ning 
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical  intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention . It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treatment.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events  that are deemed likely related to the study medication and 
unexpected or significant  must be reporte d will be  the period from the day of surgery  to the end of the 
study , which is POD 3 or sooner if discharge is sooner than POD 3 .  Additionally, s ubjects will be 
provided with contact information for the study member that is in charge of adverse event foll ow up 
(Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be instructed to contact this person with questions related to the study, 
adverse events or side effects experienced  after discharge so that the study members can be alerted to 
any events that may be related to the medication.  Reporting of these events via an adverse event report 
will be up to the discretion of the PI.  Subjects will be advised that the medication does not remain in the 
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 body several days after discontinuation, but they will be able to report events at any point after study 
participation .  
 
For all severe or unexpected adverse events, an IRB event form will be submitted. For mild or moderate 
events, and event form will be submitted if the event is one that is likely related to the medication and is 
an event that is not considered an expected side effect of gabapentin. Mild or moderate events that do 
not resolve within an appropriate time frame will also be reported to the IRB.  Mild and moderate events 
will be reviewed by the PI and deemed appropriate for reporting. All adverse events, whether mild, 
moderate or severe, will be reviewed at the safety meeting by all team members and faculty advisors to 
ensure that proper reporting has occurred.   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) tha t the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each interaction  with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specifi c 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document  located on the secure wustl box for this study .  All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedur es results will be recorded in the source document. 
Specific side effects that will be elicited at each interaction include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and 
sedation.   
 
The clinical course of any adverse event will be followed until resolution, stabilizati on, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event tha t occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study drug 
or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately  to the IRB. 
 
8.3 Unblinding Procedures  
For this study only the data manager and pharmacy will be unblind ed to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the rest of the study investigators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subject data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented  in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the  PI within a 24 hour time period and must document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomit ing, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25%  by the PI  and at 
50% enrollment  by the entire team  to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ove rsee the safety of the study.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Monit oring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information abo ut study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.   Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been ente red into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years after study 
completion  per WU record retention policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored  in real time  for each subject by th e PI and study team.  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by the PI and discussed 
among the study team.  A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way throug h to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by this study.

 1 Introduction  
This doc ument is a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research requirements, approved by the Institutiona l Review Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisfaction has increasingly become an important 
metric of hospital  performance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinician teams.  The scores resulting from these reports are integra ted into the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is particularly relevant for surgical sp ecialties.   Effective management of 
postoperative pain increases patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hospital  otolaryngology  
inpatient unit  reveals that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfaction with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, which are associated wit h nausea, vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  These side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debil itating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfacti on and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narco tic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related t o the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mecha nism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
renal excretion without chemical alteration.  Dose adjust ments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain management.  It is also frequently used for acute post operative 
pain, and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending frequency , 
dizziness, sedation, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, co nstipation, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in various surgical populations, such as gynecology -oncology and 
orthopedic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials report ed an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogeneity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies  have examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryngology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, oral cavity resection with reconstruction, and tonsillectom y9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with only one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until POD 2 or 
the day of discharge, whichever comes first . Note th at on the morning of POD3 at 7am, a VAS will be 
obtained to reflect the POD 2 7pm dose .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative NPO status  potentially  requiring a feeding tube .  The optimal 
dosage for gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain control in otolaryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed efficacy at low 
dosages and some showed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose regimen remains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included participants are likely to be  gabapentin -naïve.  The perioperative BID dosing period was chosen  
to better elucidate the effects o f gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and neck 
mucosal resections cause significant pain for several days after the procedure.  T he majority of head and 
neck inpati ent stays are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 da y and some as long as a 
few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject risk is also 
minimized without compromising medication analgesic abilitie s.  Collaboration with the inpatient pain 
management team also supports the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be effective and will 
minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow results will be collected from the medical record on those pa tients receiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.   The post-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic re quirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
Observational outcome s 
Hospital length of stay and post -operative swallow function if assessed.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study su bjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
cancer resection  up to two days after surgery .   Subjects will be given the placebo or gabapentin for up to 
two days post op or until discharge, whichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recruited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM , the center fo r outpatient health or at other outpatient or inpatient sites related to their pre -
surgical planning visits.   Eligible patients  will be identified before their scheduled appointments via review 
of medical records in Allscripts by a study team member  and ap proached either in the exam room during 
their scheduled appointment with  the head and neck surgeons  or afterwards via telephone call .  The 
study will be explained to them and a copy of the consent form will be  provided  after it has been signed.   
Patients w ill be reminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way affect their current or future care 
related to their head and neck health needs . Patients will be given time to ask questions and will have the 
option to consider  participation and enroll a t a subsequent appointment before their planned procedure. 
The consent process will take place  in a private room.  Steps to avoid coercion include proper training in 
informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, and patien ts will be 
reassured that their care from their head and neck surgeon will not be affected by their decision to 
participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made aware that their post operative care will not be 
limited by participation in this stud y, meaning that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube  morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospital procedure .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately 1 hour prior to surgery start time. 
Patients will not be excluded if surg ery start time is delayed past 1 hour .  An investigational pharmacist 
will deliver the medication appropriately labeled  with patient name and study number  to the pre -op 
holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia fa culty member of this 
project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a study member will place pain medication orders in compass 
on hold for post op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepati c insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equ al to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by the inpatient treatin g physicians.  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is  at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain mana gement options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without re striction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copied and added to their hard copy file for use later during

CONFIDENTIAL  
 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed 45 minutes to 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
 
Note that subjects  must have completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at 45 minutes to 1 hour postoperatively , however , eve n if 
the case finishes later than 5pm. On POD 1 -2, subjects will be given BID medications at 7am and 7pm 
per the study protocol and VAS scores will be obtained prior to medication administration   A separate 
VAS will be obtained at 10am on POD1 and POD 2.  ON POD 3 a 7am VAS will be obtained but no study 
medication given. This last VAS concludes participation in the study.  Discharge surveys will be 
administered at this point if they have not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the 6200 inpatient floor prior to scheduled doses, and the medications will be stored in patient labeled 
bins in the locked med ication refrigerator.  All VAS scores will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, 
including draw ing the curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the room  from any potential 
roommate.  Also, the research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’ s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
providing the subject with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a  ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey wil l be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access to members of the study team should questions or concerns arise while 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to 30 days after completion of the study .   
 
Note that study medication wrappers have patient  names on them as a safety mechanism to make sure 
medications are given to the proper patient.  These wrappers and labels will be saved in the patient 
folders which are secured in a locked cabinet where only study team members have access.  E mpty  and 
unlab eled medication syringes will be discarded in the red biohazard bins inside patient rooms.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperative narcotic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the av erage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospital length of stay , and (e) potential side effects o f the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey question s will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you wit h your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisf action.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to 1 hour  after surgery and then  three times  a day on 
POD 1 -2 and once on POD 3, or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner. A standardized 
VAS form will be given to subjects with verbal instruction to first “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by asking the 
subject to gesture  swallowing and “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represe nts (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.   
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant  
Gaba Protocol   Page 8 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of stay will be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also colle ct information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.  
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse even ts.  Adverse  events 
will be monitored and recorded by study team members during subject  inpatient stay.   These events will 
be reviewed by the principal investigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events determined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the subject  will be 
discussed. A project safety review will be conducted by a third party safety officer  approximately half way 
through the study, or sooner if necessary.  
 
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Subjects undergoing definitive mucosal head and neck resection including oral cavity, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 ni ght of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Incapable of giving informed consent  
 Age < 18  
 GFR < 30 
 Allergy to gabapentin   
 Baseline  gabapentin or lyrica use 
 Chronic opioid use for over 6 months  
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruit ed either in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by designated study team members .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by study team members prior to their sched uled appointments via the outpatient 
medical records system.  Patient recruited by phone will be able to sign the informed consent prior to 
surgery either at a subsequent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible  subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to  decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent  process.

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a  feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdr aw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by the subject or by any team member if 
medical significant adverse reactions are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed by the principle 
investigator.  No subject  will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by the subject, and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn  Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be excluded in the final data analysis. The reasons for withdrawa l will be 
recorded and reported separately in the study data outcomes . 
 
4.4.3  Definitions  
Subject withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informe d consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before completion, whether by choice or by exclusion criteria 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300mg of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication syringe or in a marked bag with a capsule .  An unblinded study team 
member in charge of the randomization process will indicate to the pharmacy which subjects are to 
receive what medication .  The blinded study team members will not know which medication contains 
placebo o r gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperative holding area 
approximately 1  hour before their procedure is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD  0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD 0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be 
skipped.   Participants will then receive either placebo or  300 mg  of ga bapentin BID POD 1 - POD 2.  
Dosing will end either on POD 2 after the PM dose or on day of discharge after the AM dose, whichever 
comes first.  VAS scores will be collected 45 minutes - 1 hour post extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at  7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).

CONFIDENTIAL  
 5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
After a subject consents to study, the unblinded data manager will randomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign a subject  study  number.  The s ubject study number will be used to identify 
which  subjects  are to receive which medication.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
The Investigational Pharmacist  will mix and prepare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist w ill deliver the medication to the preop holding unit or the floor and a designated study team 
member will administer it.  Please see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging details. Contact 
information for the pharmacy for this project is pharmacist Kat hryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Inpatient pharmacists will be responsible for delivering the medication to the floor prior to the AM dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver the medication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.  Form al training for all study team members who will be administering the study drug or 
obtaining the VAS pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication d osage during the study period 
and record adherence to study protocol .  If a dose is missed during this period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protocol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will b e made at the discretion of the principle investigator and statistician at the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for missed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain  equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in case s of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be subst ituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for inve stigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapen tin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged int o a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name and study ID on it.  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store the se at 
4 degrees Celsius.  The medications will be stored prior to dosing on the floor in a locked fridge in 
patient specific compartments, as per the floor medication protocol.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications wi ll be blinded towards whether a subject 
receives the  study drug  or the placebo.   The data manager who does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as well as the pharmacist  preparing the medication s, will be unblinded.  
5.9 Receiv ing, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Investigational pharmacists will be responsible for medication delivery prior to planned dose s.  They will 
be alerted to upcoming procedures that involve study subject s.  They will be responsible  for delivering the 
medication to the inpatient floor and in the preoperative holding area.  Any damaged or unusable study 
drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study files  and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigation al pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius. They will be stored on the inpatient floor in a locked, 4 degree fridge in patient specific 
compartments per the floor medication storage protocols.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team mem bers administering the medications will receive the medication fr om the 
investigational pharmacist.  They will then administer the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be  a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed an d dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and documented.  Medication syringes will be discarded in the red 
biohazard containers in accordance with hospital policy and documented in the study files.  Any labels or 
bags with patient n ames will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent.

CONFIDENTIAL  
  Standard pain medications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up -titrated as needed per discretion 
of se rvice residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One postoperative dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrations.  
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of  Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
3 or on date of discharge, whichever comes sooner . 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based on prior  studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergoing thyroidectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi d et al in a population of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the first 24 hou rs 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a standard deviation of 9.9mg.  Assuming that 
this magnitude of effect variability will hold true in this project population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in this study .  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the calculated sample size within two years 
of study start time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusion criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged from 12  to 17 procedures a month.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables will be  
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Line ar Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
differ ence and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medicat ion doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be

 include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses wi ll be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility th at the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Ev ent 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures ar e considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the inv estigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for 
nausea, but that does not cause pe rmanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable 
amount of time.  
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treat ment.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported will be  the period from the day of surgery  
to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study follow -up is defined as 30 days 
followin g the last ad ministration of study drug.  Subjects will be provided with contact information for the 
study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be 
instructed to contact this person with questions related to  the study, adverse events or side effects 
experienced.  
For all severe adverse events, an IRB event form will be submitted. For mild or moderate events, and 
event form will be submitted if the event is one that is likely related to the medication and is a n event that 
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 is not considered an expected side effect of gabapentin. Mild or moderate events that do not resolve 
within an appropriate time frame will also be reported to the IRB.  Mild and moderate events will be 
reviewed by the PI and deemed appropriate  for reporting.   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each interaction  with the  subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, an d abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results will be recorded in the source document. Specific side effects that will be elicited at 
each interaction include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
The clinical course of any adverse event will be followed  until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study drug 
or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately  to the IRB. 
 
8.3 Unblinding Procedures  
For this study only the data manage r and pharmacy will be unblinded to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the rest of the study investigators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subject data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded , the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators  must report unblinding to the PI within a 24 hour time period and must document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematu rely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effec ts, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25% and 50% 
enrollment to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to overs ee the safety of the study.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitor ing).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.   A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half way 
through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by thi s study.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will b e kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source d ocument  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years after study 
completion  per WU record retention policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monito ring Plan  
This study will be monitored  in real time  for each subject by the PI and study team.  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by the PI and discussed 
among the study team.  A designated, thir d party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by this study.

 1 Introduction  
This document is  a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research requirements, approved by the Institutional Review  Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisfaction has increasingly become an important 
metric of hospital perform ance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinician teams.  The scores resulting from these reports are integrated into  the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is particularly relevant for surgical specialtie s.  Effective management of 
postoperative pain increases patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hospital  otolaryngology  
inpatient unit reveals  that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfaction with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, which are associated with nausea , vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  These side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and a n expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic medi cation 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens  that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the in hibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
renal excretion without chemical alteration.  Dose adjustments ar e recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain management.  It is also frequently used for acute post operative 
pain, and m eta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending frequency , 
dizziness, sedation, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, constipati on, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in various surgical populations, such as gynecology -oncology and 
orthopedic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials report ed an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogeneity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies have examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryngology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, oral cavity resection with reconstruction, and tonsillectomy9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with only one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which i s an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until POD 2 or 
the day of discharge, whichever comes first . Note that on th e morning of POD3 at 7am, a VAS will be 
obtained to reflect the POD 2 7pm dose .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative NPO status  potentially  requiring a feeding tube .  The optimal 
dosage fo r gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior  studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain control in otolaryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed efficacy at low 
dosages and some sho wed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose regimen remains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included participants are likely to be  gabapentin -naïve.  The perioperative BID dosing period was chosen  
to better elucidate the effects o f gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and neck 
mucosal resections cause significant pain for several days after the procedure.  T he majority of head and 
neck inpatient stay s are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 da y and some as long as a 
few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject risk is also 
minimized without compromising medication analgesic abilities.  Collaboration with the inpatient pain 
management team also supports the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be effective and will 
minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow results will be collected from the medical record on those patients r eceiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.   The post-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic requiremen ts for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
Observational outcome s 
Hospit al length of stay and post -operative swallow function if assessed.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects i nclude  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
cancer resection  up to two days after surgery .   Subje cts will be given the placebo or gabapentin for up to 
two days post op or until discharge, whichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recruited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM , the center for outpat ient health or at other outpatient or inpatient sites related to their pre -
surgical planning visits.   Eligible patients  will be identified before their scheduled appointments via review 
of medical records in Allscripts by a study team member  and approached  either in the exam room during 
their scheduled appointment with  the head and neck surgeons  or afterwards via telephone call .  The 
study will be explained to them and a copy of the consent form will be  provided  after it has been signed.   
Patients will be r eminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way affect their current or future care 
related to their head and neck health needs . Patients  will be given time to ask questions and will have the 
option to consider  participation and enroll at a subs equent appointment before their planned procedure. 
The consent process will take place  in a private room.  Steps to avoid coercion include proper training in 
informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, and patients will be 
reassured that their care from their head and neck  surgeon will not be affected by their decision to 
participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made aware that their post operative care will not be 
limited by participation in this stud y, meanin g that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphin e will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospital procedure .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately 1 hour prior to surgery start time. 
Patients will not be excluded if surgery star t time is delayed past 1 hour .  An investigational pharmacist 
will deliver the medication appropriately labeled  with patient name and study number  to the pre -op 
holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia faculty me mber of this 
project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a study member will place pain medication orders in compass 
on hold for post op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insuff iciency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/ 10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).   Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by the inpatient treating physic ians.  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on  study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member  administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management o ptions in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restrictio n based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer .  The VAS 
score obtained after surgery  will be completed 45 minutes t o 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
Gaba Protocol   Page 6 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Note that subjects  must have completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next d ay.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at 45 minutes to 1 hour postoperatively , however , even if 
the case finishes later than 5pm. On POD 1 -2, subjects will be given BID medications  at 7am and 7pm 
per the study protocol  and VAS scores will be obtained pri or to medication administration    A separate 
VAS will be obtained at 10am on POD1 and POD 2.  ON POD 3 a 7am VAS will be obtained but no study 
medication given. This last VAS concludes participation in the study.  Discharge surveys will be 
administered at th is point if they have not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the 6200 inpatient floor prior to sc heduled doses, and the medications will be stored in patient labeled 
bins in the locked medication refrigerator.  All VAS scores will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, 
including draw ing the curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the roo m from any potential 
roommate.  Also, the research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
providing the subject with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects  will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only t o the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access to members of the study team should questions or concerns arise while 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to  30 days after completion of the study .   
 
Note that study medication wrappers have patient names on them as a safety mechanism to make sure 
medications are given to the proper patient.  These wrappers and labels will be saved in the patient 
folders which are secured in a locked cabinet where only study team members have access.  E mpty  and 
unlabeled medication syringes will be discarded in the red biohazard bins inside patient rooms.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperative narco tic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divide d by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the ave rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospital length of stay , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
0) Never  
1) Sometime s 
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to 1 hour  after surgery and then  three times  a day on 
POD 1 -2 and once  on POD 3 , or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner. A standardized 
VAS form will be given to subjects with verbal instruction to first “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is fol lowed by asking the 
subject to gesture  swallowing and “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you  cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centime ters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine,  Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant

CONFIDENTIAL  
 3. Do yo u experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of stay will  be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.  
3.4 Primary Safety En dpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse events.   Adverse  events 
will be monitored and recorded by study team members during subject  inpatient stay.   These events will 
be reviewed by the principal investigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events determined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the subject  will be 
discussed. A project safety review will be conducted by a third party safety officer approximately half way 
through the study, or sooner if necessary.  
 
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Subjects undergoing definitive mucosal head and neck resection including oral cavity, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 night of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Incapable of giving informed consent  
 Age < 18  
 GFR < 30 
 Allergy to gabapentin   
 Baseline  gabapentin or lyrica use 
 Chro nic opioid use for over 6 months  
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  either in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by designated study team members .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by study team members prior to their scheduled appointments via the outpatient 
medical records system.  Patient recruited by phone will be able to sign the informed consent prior to 
surgery either at a subse quent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wi sh to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was ant icipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by the subject or by any team member if 
medical significant adverse reactio ns are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed by the principle 
investigator.  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by the subject, and documentation of the r eason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be excluded in the final data analysis. The reasons for withdrawa l will be 
recorded and reported separately in the study data outco mes. 
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300mg of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication syringe or in a marked bag with a capsule .  An unblinded study team 
member in charge of th e randomization process will indicate to the pharmacy which subjects are to 
receive what medication .  The blinded study team members will not know which medication contains 
placebo or gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperative holding area 
approximately 1  hour before their procedure is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5p m), and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD 0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be 
skipped.   Participants will then receive either placebo or  300 mg  of gabapentin BID POD 1 - POD 2.  
Dosing will end either on POD 2 after the PM d ose or on day of discharge after the AM dose, whichever 
comes first.  VAS scores will be collected 45 minutes - 1 hour post extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).   
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjec ts to Treatment Groups  
After a subject consents to study, the unblinded data manager will randomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign a subject  study  number.  The subject study number will be used to identify 
which  subjects  are to receive  which medication.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
The Investigational Pharmacist  will mix and prepare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist will deliver the medication to the preop holding unit or the floor and a de signated study team 
member will administer it.  Please see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging details. Contact 
information for the pharmacy for this project is pharmacist Kathryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Gaba Protocol   Page 10 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Inpatient pharmacists will be responsible for delivering the medication to the floor prior to the AM dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver the medication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.  Formal training for all study team members who will be administering the study  drug or 
obtaining the VAS pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication dosage during the study period 
and record adherence to study protocol .  If a dose is missed during this period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protocol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will be made at the discretion of the principle investigator and statistician at  the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for missed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medications made a vailable:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be  substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/1 0 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.    
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at  the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used fo r the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name a nd study ID on it.  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
4 degrees Celsius.  The medications will be stored prior to dosing o n the floor in a locked fridge in 
patient specific compartments, as per the floor medication protocol.  
5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications will be blinded towards whether a subject 
receives the  study drug  or the pla cebo.   The data manager who does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as well as the pharmacist  preparing the medication s, will be unblinded.  
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Investigation al pharmacists will be responsible for medication delivery prior to planned dose s.  They will 
be alerted to upcoming procedures that involve study subject s.  They will be responsible for delivering the 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 medication to the inpatient floor and in the preoperat ive holding area.  Any damaged or unusable study 
drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study files  and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigational pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius. They will b e stored on the inpatient floor in a locked, 4 degree fridge in patient specific 
compartments per the floor medication storage protocols.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team members administering the medications will receive the medication fr om the 
investigational pharmacist.  They will then administer the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of S tudy Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be  a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and docu mented.  Medication syringes will be discarded in the red 
biohazard containers in accordance with hospital policy and documented in the study files.  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop  holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent . 
 Pre-treatment questionnaire . 
 Randomization group will be assigned by the study data m anager after she is notified of subject 
agreement to participate.  
Day of Surgery  
 One dose  of study drug will be  administer ed preoperatively  according to subject’s randomization 
group  approximately 1 hour prior to procedure start time.  The coordinator admi nistering the 
medication will tape a study reminder sheet for anesthesia to the chart and will place an order in 
the chart that allows the participant to take the preop medication dose, and the RN to chart this 
dose as a study medication.  
 Standard pain me dications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up-titrate d as needed per discretion 
of service residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One p ostop erative  dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrations . 
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducte d either after the  AM dose on POD 
3 or on date of discharge, whichever comes sooner . 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based on prior studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergoing thyroid ectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi d et al in a population of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the first 24 hours 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a standard devi ation of 9.9mg.  Assuming that 
this magnitude of effect variability will hold true in this project population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
differenc e of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the  calculated sample size within two years 
of study start time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusion criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged from 12 to 17 procedures a month.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics wil l be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin a s compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) f or Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of t he principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unant icipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved pro tocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedu res involved in the research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that  develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study wit hdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse ev ents are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an impo rtant medical event  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported will be  the period from the day of surgery  
to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study follow -up is defined as 30  days 
following the last ad ministration of study drug.  Subjects will be provided with contact information for the 
study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be 
instructed to contact this person with questi ons related to the study, adverse events or side effects 
experienced.  
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is ot herwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each interaction  with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the sour ce document.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results will be recorded in the source document. Specific side effects that will be elicited at 
each interaction include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
The clinical course of any adverse event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period  will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study drug 
or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately  to the IRB.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 8.3 Unbl inding Procedures  
For this study only the data manager and pharmacy will be unblinded to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the rest of the study investigators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subje ct data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that partici pant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI within a 24 hour time period and must document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subje cts experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25% and 50% 
enrollment to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site da ta and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.   A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half way 
throug h to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by this study.  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Acc ountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient i nformation is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years after study 
completion  per WU rec ord retention policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored  in real time  for each subject by the PI and study team.  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by the PI a nd discussed 
among the study team.  A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by this study.

 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study  to be  conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice compliant to all associated Federal and applicable local 
and University research require ments, approved by the Institutional Review Board .  
1.1 Background  
High-quality healthcare is acces sible, safe, efficient, patient -centered and imperative for good treatment  
outcomes.  In this era of healthcare reform, patient satisfaction has increasingly bec ome an important 
metric of hospital performance.  The Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing P rogram utilizes patient 
reported satisfaction scores as a reflection of the quality of care delivered by hospital systems and 
clinician teams.  The scores resul ting from these reports are integrated into the formula with which 
hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients . 
 
An important patient -physician interface in quality heal thcare is the treatment of pain, and the treatment of 
acute postoperative pain is pa rticularly relevant for surgical specialties.   Effective management of 
postoperative pain increases patient satisfaction, reduces hospital costs, reduces postoperative morbidity 
and shortens hospitalizations8.  HCAHP and PRC  data from the Barnes  Jewish Hos pital otolaryngology  
inpatient unit reveals that postoperative otolaryngology patient satisfaction with pain control is routinely 
lower than the 75th percentile of all hospitals nationally surveyed.  Traditionally,  pain regimens rely heavily 
on the use of narcotics, which are associated with nausea, vomiting, delirium, and decreased bowel 
motility.  These side effects have the potential to increase length of hospitalization and decrease patient 
satisfaction.  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population  is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o imp rove pain control, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medica tion often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
renal excretion withou t chemical alteration.  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since 1993 for post -herpetic neuralgia  and epilepsy, and has 
been widely applied in neuropathic pain management.  It is also frequent ly used for acute post operative 
pain, and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it to be an effective pa in management 
strategy in post operative patients.  The major adverse reactions reported  were, in descending frequency , 
dizziness, sedation , asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and vomiting 23. 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrate d that gabapentin effectively reduce d narcotic use 
and improve d subjective pain in various surgical populations, such as gynecology -oncology and 
orthopedic surgery9-15.  Meta -analyses of these pooled trials report ed an overall trend toward improved 
pain control and decreased postoperative narcotic use with gabapentin,  despite the heterogeneity of the 
included studies6,16-19.  A small number of  studies have examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3

CONFIDENTIAL  
 otolaryngology patients  and suggest a potential benefit in improving postoperative pain control after 
thyroidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, oral cavity resection with reconstruction, and tonsillectomy9-15. 
Most of the studies  demonstrated an improvement  with only one preope rative dose .  To date,  no 
randomized control trials have been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing head and n eck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be 300 mg PO preoperatively, followed by 300 mg BID until POD 3  or 
the day of discharge, whicheve r comes first .  The liquid formulatio n will be used postoperatively  given the 
possibility of dysphagia or postoperative NPO status  potentially  requiring a feeding tube .  The optimal 
dosage for gabapentin in acute postoperative pain is unknown.  Recommended  gabapentin regimen for 
treatment of post -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, 300 mg BID on day 2, 300 mg TID on day 
3, and subsequently up -titrated as needed to 600 mg TID23.  Prior studies using gabapentin for 
postoperative pain control in otola ryngology patients have primarily administered a single preoperative 
dose ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg9-15. Data was inconsistent as some studies showed efficacy at low 
dosages and some showed no difference at high dosages , and an optimal dose regimen re mains to be 
determined .  For this study  a relatively low dosag e was chosen to minimize sedation side effects , as 
included participants are likely to be  gabapentin -naïve.  The postoperative 3-day BID dosing period was 
chosen  to better elucidate the effects of gabapentin in the acute, post operative period, as many head and 
neck mucosal resections cause significant pain for several days after the procedure.  T he majority of 
head and neck inpatient stays are between 2 -3 days, with some staying as short as 1 da y and some as 
long as a few weeks .  At this dose and schedule, gabapentin side effects are minimized so that subject 
risk is also minimized without compromising medication analgesic abilities.  Collaboration with the 
inpatient pain management team also supp orts the expectation that this dose and time regime n will be 
effective and will minimize side effects.  
 
Post-operative swallow results will be collected from the medical record on those patients receiving post 
op swallow therapy  per routine care.The  post-operative swallow evaluation will be based solely on the 
discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing definitive surgical resection of head and neck mucosal 
malignancies.  
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck  cancer patients undergoing definitive surgical resection of mucosal 
surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
Observational outcome s 
Hospital length of stay and post -operative swallo w function if assessed.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over t he age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  tumor resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the 
oral cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 recruited from the otolaryngology head an d neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospitalization following definitive 
cancer resection  up to three days after surgery .   Subjects will be given the placebo or ga bapentin for up 
to three days post op or until discharge, whichever comes first.   
 
Potential s ubjects  will be recruited from the patient population  in the head and neck surgery clinic , 11th 
floor CAM .  Eligible patients  will be identified before their sch eduled appointments via review of medical 
records in Allscripts by a study team member   and approached in the exam room during their scheduled 
appointment with  the head and neck surgeons.  The study will be explained to them and a copy of the 
consent form will be  provided.  Patients will be reminded that participation is voluntary and will in no way 
affect their current or future care related to their disease. Patients  will be given time to ask questions and 
will have the option to consider  participation an d enroll at a subsequent appointment before their planned 
procedure. The consent process will take place  in private clinical exam room.  Patients  will be able to 
choose to participate up to 24 hours prior to their scheduled procedure, as this will give the  study team 
enough time to alert the pharmacy and the study coordinators of their case.  Steps to avoid coercion 
include proper training in informed consent, private discussion rooms in which the surgeon is not present, 
and no involvement of the surgeon wi ll occur to ensure that patients do not feel as though their care from 
that surgeon will be affected by their decision to participate or to not participate.  Patients  will be made 
aware that their post operative care will not be limited by participation in this stud y, meaning that they will 
not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the start of research related procedures.

Subjects will present f or their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospital procedure .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication at 6AM an d no later than 630AM.  An 
investigational pharmacist will deliver the medication appropriately labeled  with patient name and study 
number  to the pre -op holding area .  This oral administration is safe per consultation with the anesthesia 
faculty member of this project.  Additionally, on the day of surgery a study Sub-Investigator  will place pain 
medication orders in compass on hold for post op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or 
per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours if the patient has hepatic insu fficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours 
PRN pain, and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN pain >5/10 or pain not controlled with maximal 
oxycodone dose.  The subject will be able to receive increases in pain medications as deemed 
appropriate by the inpatient tr eating physicians.  They will not have any limitations set on pain 
medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then proceed with surgery as 
planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be made based on study 
participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  The study team 
member  administering the preoperative dose will have provide d a post operative order sheet in the 
inpatient chart signed by a n MD on the study team with post operative pain orders for the nurses in PACU , 
so that all subjects  will start with the same amount of medicati ons available.  This order will be written  for 
2mg morphine IV q2 hours PRN pain.  The PAC U can increase the dose of post operative pain 
medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  without restriction 
based on a subject’ s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the usual protocol until the  
required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer .  The VAS score obtained after 
surgery  will be completed two hours after emergence. This i s an approximate time:  the post op VAS can 
be obtained sooner than two hours if the subject  is alert and awake.  If should not be obtained before one 
hour after anesthesia emergence. Thus it can be obtained one to two hours after the subject  has 
awakened.   
Gaba Protocol   Page 6 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Subjects will be given BID medications per the study protocol  and VAS scores will be obtained prior to 
medication administration.   The doses will be scheduled at 7AM and at 7PM.   The investigational 
pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose i n a properly labeled container to the 6200 inpatient 
floor prior to each dose.  Note that subjects  must have completed surgery by 5PM in order to receive the 
7PM dose after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administere d will 
be at 7AM the next day.  VAS score will still be obtained two hours post operatively and will count as the 
7PM VAS score  (see above) .  A mid day VAS score at 12PM  will be obtained , pending the availability of 
the study team .   All VAS scores will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, including draw ing the 
curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the room  from any potential roommate.  Also, the 
research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS scores will be 
obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by providing the 
subject with a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a scale of 0 -10 during each 
phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validat ed tool that measures 10cm in size and is marked “no pain” at 0 
and “worst pain” at 10.  The subject marks their pain level on the scale and the study team member  will 
measure with a ruler and record the resulting number in the study database.    
Subjects  will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into t he study database .All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/7 access to members of the study team should questi ons or concerns arise while 
they are actively participating in the study  as well as up to 30 days after completion of the study .   
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoint is postoperative narcotic consumption.   Average daily narcotic use from 
postoperative admission to the last dose of pain medication on POD 3 , or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
the total hours of inpatient hospitalization , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the ave rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
subject’s baseline pain tolerance, and (d) hospital leng th of stay.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 3 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.   This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  1-2 hours after surgery and then  three times  a day on POD 1 -3 
or until day of discharge, whichever comes sooner.  Two of these scores will occur prior to study 
drug administr ation.  A standardized photo -copy of the VAS form will be given to subjects with 
verbal instruction to first “mark on the line the point that you feel represent s your current pain 
level when you’re resting.”  This is followed by asking the subject to gestu re swallowing and 
“mark another point on the line that represents your pain level when you swallow.”  Lastly, the 
subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the line that represent s your pain 
when you cough.”   The study team member admi nistering the test will annotate what each mark 
represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm line from “no pain” on the left 
to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in millimeter s from the left of the 
line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  The results from all  available VAS 
scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the final analysis.  
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed f rom a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone,  Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant  
 
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospital length of stay will be calculated for each subject.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 3.4 Prim ary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints are the rate and severity of drug -related adverse events.   Adverse  events 
will be monitored and recorded by study team members during subject  inpatient stay.   These events will 
be reviewed by the principal investigator and categorized into “drug -related”, “likely drug -related”, and 
“unlikely drug -related.”   Any significant adverse events determined to be likely drug related will be 
reported to the OHRP  within a 24 hour time period and stopping  the study for the subject will be 
discussed.  
 
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Subjects undergoing definitive mucosal head and neck tumor resection including oral cavity, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 night of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Incapable of giving informed consent  
 Age < 18  
 GFR < 30 
 Allergy to gabapentin  
 Baseline  gabapentin use  
 Chronic opioid use for over 6 months  
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries by 
designated study team members .  Potentially eligible patients will be identified by study team members 
prior to their scheduled appointments via the outpatient medical records system.  Eligible subjects will be 
approache d after their scheduled appointment in a private setting and the study outline explained to the 
patient. Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  
may choose to think about study participation but will  need to decide and provide written consent prior to 
the day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed  
consent process.  
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs  in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to 
swallow medications after surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout 
rate was anticipate d and accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw 
on a continual basis throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by the subject or by 
any team member if medical significant adverse reactions are observed.  All withdraws will be reviewed 
by the principle investigator.  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will 
begin immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by the subject, and documentation of the 
reason a nd time of withdraw will be performed.   
Gaba Protocol   Page 9 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Withdrawn subjects will be excluded in the final data analysis. The reasons for withdrawa l will be 
recorded and reported separately in the study data outcomes . 
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
300mg of liquid gabapentin or an equal volume of placebo will be pre -packaged by the investigational 
pharmacist in a labeled medication cup.  An unblinded study team member in charge of the 
randomization process will indicate to the pharmacy which subjects are to receive what medication .  The 
blinded study team members will not know which medication cup contains placebo or gabapentin.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive either placebo or gabape ntin 300 mg PO the preoperative hold ing area an hour 
before their procedure is scheduled to begin.  This first dose will designate the day of their procedure as 
POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening, and the subject is not able to receive the second POD 
0 dose by 7 PM, then this second POD 0 dose will be skipped.   The subject must be completed with 
surgery and awake enough to give a VAS score.  Thus any subject not done with the procedure by 5 PM 
will not receive a 7PM dose on POD 0.  Participants will then receive either placebo  or 300 mg  of 
gabapentin BID POD 1 - POD 3 .  Dosing will end either on POD 3 after the PM dose or on day of 
discharge after the AM dose, whichever comes first.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
After a subject consents to study, the unblind ed data manager will randomize  the subject into active or 
placebo  group and assign a subject  study  number.  The subject study number will be used to identify 
which  are to receive which medication.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
The Investig ational Pharmacist  will mix and prepare the study medications necessary for each subject .  A 
pharmacist will deliver the medication to the floor and a designated study team member will administer it.  
Please see section 5.7 below for mixing and packaging d etails. Contact information for the pharmacy for 
this project is pharmacist Kathryn Vehe at 314 -795-7286.  
 
Inpatient pharmacists will be responsible for delivering the medication to the floor prior to the AM dose 
and to the PM dose, as well as will deliver  the medication to the pre-op holding area  prior to a subject ’s 
procedure.    Formal training for all study team members who will be administering the study drug or 
obtaining the VAS pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
The study team  members  will directly administer each study medication dosage during the study period 
and record adherence to study protocol .  If a dose is missed during this period, the subject wil l remain in 
the study through the completion of the protocol.  The decision to include data from subjects with missed 
doses will be made at the discretion of the principle investigator and statistician at the conclusion of the 
study.   Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are exclude d for missed doses will be 
consistent among cases.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Every subject will have standard postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN pain greater than 5/10 not improved b y oral or per tube 
medications  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain  
Gaba Protocol   Page 10 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
  PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’ s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form of 
250mg/5ml.  6ml of either gabapentin or placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic cup 
with a  sealed aluminum top.  Each cup will have the subject  name and study ID on it.  The 
pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and will prepare the medications 
approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 4 degree s Celsius.   
 Individual doses will be delivered before each scheduled dose by an investigational pharmacist to 
the inpatient floor.  
5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  
The study team members  administering the medications will be blinded towards whether a subject 
recei ves the  study drug  or the placebo.   The data manager who does not participate  in data collection or 
have direct  subject interaction , as well as the pharmacist  preparing the medication cups , will be 
unblinded.  
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Recei pt of Drug Supplies  
Investigational pharmacists will be responsible for medication delivery prior to each planned dose.  They 
will be alerted to upcoming procedures that involve study Subject s.  They will be responsible for directly 
delivering the medicati on to the study team members prior to administration both on the inpatient floor 
and in the preoperative holding area.  Any damaged or unusable study drug in a given shipment will be 
documented in the study files  and discarded.  
5.9.2  Storage  
Medications will be stored by the investigational pharmacy in a designated, locked area at 4 degrees 
Celsius.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The study team members administering the medications will receive the medication fr om the 
investigational pharmacist.  They will then admini ster the medication and record the time of administration 
and the subject identification number in the subject’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be  a final reconciliation of medications consumed.  This 
reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and documented.  Medication cups  and packaging will be d iscarded in the 
red biohazard containers in accordance with hospital policy and documented in the study files.

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculations were performed based  on prior studies with gabapentin use in otolaryngology 
patients undergoing thyroidectomy21.  A study by Al -Mujadi et al in a population of patients undergoing 
elective thyroidectomy reported that total morphine consumption in the placebo group in the firs t 24 hours 
post surgery required a mean of 29.5mg of morphine with a standard deviation of 9.9mg.  Assuming that 
this magnitude of effect variability will hold true in this project population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be  needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, 116 subjects will be enrolled in th is study.  The 
volume of eligible subjects for this study is predicted to meet the calculated sample size within two years 
of study start time. A review of surgical procedures meeting inclusion criteria performed over a sample 
three month time frame ranged  from 12 to 17 procedures a month.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe distribution of demographics. Bivariate analysis using 
independent samples t -test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables  will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a Gene ral Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mea n 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed  medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or freq uency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possib ility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic proce dures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by  the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or  significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported will be  the period from the day of surgery  
to the end of th e study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study follow -up is defined as 30 days 
following the last ad ministration of study drug.  Subjects will be provided with contact information for the 
study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up ( Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be 
instructed to contact this person with questions related to the study, adverse events or side effects 
experienced.  
 
 
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the  events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal phy sician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each interaction  with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examin ation.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results will be recorded in the source document. Specific side effects that will be elic ited at 
each interaction include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
The clinical course of any adverse event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the ca use.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study drug 
or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately  to the IRB. 
 
8.3 Unblinding Procedures  
For this study only the data manager and pharmacy will be unblinded to the study drug and placebo 
assignments.  Unblinding of the rest of the study investig ators will occur after assurance that data 
collection has completed .  If any subject data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the s tudy 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI within a 24 hour time period and must document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be  made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stopping Rules  
The study will be terminate d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as  defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25% and 50% 
enrollment to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.

 9 Data Handli ng and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Assigned study numbers will be 
used on a ll hard copy data collection instruments in place of subject name. Source Documents /Case 
Report Forms . 
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper 
formsincluding the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting 
forms etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the 
conclusion of the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, will be 
destroyed i n the proper manner.  The official source document  and case report form  for this study will be 
the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for 7  years after study 
completion  per WU record retent ion policy .  
 
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored  in real time  for each subject by the PI and study team.  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by the PI and discuss ed 
among the study team.

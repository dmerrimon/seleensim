1 BACKGROUND  AND  INTRODUCTION 
Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plate of the upper a nd lower eyelids, where they 
terminate along the interior rim (or margin) of the eyelids.  T hese glands secrete meibum, 
which is a lipid-rich essential component of a healthy tear fil m. When sufficient meibum 
is not present in the tear film, the aqueous layer of the tear film is disrupted and readily 
evaporates causing irritation, redness, and inflammation of the  lid margin and surrounding 
tissues.  Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is associated with a failure of these glands 
to produce adequate quantities of meibum due to atrophy, inflam mation, or obstruction, 
and is thought to be the most common cause of evaporative dry e ye disease (EDE)1.
Recommended methods for diagnosis of MGD reported in the literatu re2includes 
evaluation of meibomian gland expressibility by applying digita l pressure and observing 
gland response with a slit-lamp microscope.
1.1 INDICATION  FOR  USE 
The iLux System is indicated for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in 
adult patients with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, in cluding meibomian gland 
dysfunction (MGD), also known as evaporative dry eye. 
1.2 ILUX SYSTEM  
The iLux system enables an eye care professional to apply a treat ment to unclog blocked 
glands by heating the lids to melt the meibum while applying eno ugh compression to the 
lid to unblock clogged glands. By unclogging the glands, the gla nds can resume providing 
lipids to the tear film, which is key to preventing the aqueous  (tear) layer from evaporating.
Clogged and unproductive meibomian glands lead to increase evaporation of the aqueous 
layer of the tears leading to inflammation and eventually atrop hy of the meibomian glands.  
It is not known if an atrophied gland can be “revived”, therefo re it is important to maintain 
the health and viability of the existing meibomian glands. The iLux treatment is designed 
to unclogged meibomian glands thereby maintaining the health of  the gland and the ocular 
surface. 
The main components of the iLux system include a disposable tip section and a handheld 
battery-powered instrument.  The disposable tip section is a st erile, single-use device that 
snaps onto the tip of the instrument.  It has a thin back plate  that slides underneath the 
eyelid, and a front plate that is pushed against the front surf ace of the eyelid.  All materials 
that contact the patient are made from biocompatible silicone.  The instrument portion has 
a high-quality magnifying lens that allows the clinician to vie w the eyelid margin 
throughout the procedure.  There is also a compression control switch, when pressed, 
advances the front plate against the patient’s eyelid.

To treat clogged glands, the clinician presses the heating swit ch (located on the 
compression control switch) to turn on the energy source and wa rm the eyelid tissue.  The 
inner eyelid temperature is displayed on the instrument, enabli ng the clinician to titrate the 
ideal amount of heating and compression to optimize unclogging o f the blocked glands.
The handheld device includes circuitry with a heat safety limit  of 44°C so the inside of 
the back plate that contacts the  inner part of the eyelid and th e front plate that contacts the 
outer part of the eyelid cannot go above this safe temperature.
The iLux system was used recently on 30 subjects in an IRB-approv ed non-significant 
risk study in the United States with no adverse events reported.  
2S T U D Y  DESIGN 
2.1 O BJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to measure the temperatur e of the cornea and 
surrounding eye tissue temperat ure immediately after heating th e eyelids with the iLux 
device using the protoc ol treatment profile.  
2.2 D ESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY  
Up to 15 eligible subjects will be enrolled at 1 clinical site.
The primary effectiveness analy sis shall be based on immediate post-heating assessments.  
The clinical parameters outlined in Appendix 1 shall be evaluat ed for each eye treated with 
the iLux device per the schedule outlined.
1. Discomfort/pain during, and after treatment –A subjective pain scale shall be used.  
A subjective report of discomfort shall be recorded on a scale of from 0-10.
Descriptive Anchors on the scale include: 0 = no discomfort or pain, 2 = slight or 
transient awareness of pressure without pain, 4 = moderate disco mfort with minimal 
pain, 6 = moderate pain, 8 = severe pain, 10 = intolerable pain .  In an effort to provide 
some level of consistency to the subjective discomfort report, a scale shall be provided 
for the subject to compare their level of discomfort to commonl y experienced episodes 
of discomfort in every-day life (see Table 1 below).

xEvent diagnosis
xIntensity or severity
xExpectedness
xRelatedness to study treatment
xTreatment or action taken.
xOutcome
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used when  recording AEs.
Colloquialisms and/or abbreviations should not be used. Only one medical concept, 
preferably a diagnosis instead of individual symptoms, shall be recorded as the event.
If more than one distinct adverse event occurs, each event shal l be recorded separately.
5.3.1 Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity/Severity 
All adverse events shall be grade d on a three-point scale (mild,  moderate, severe) for 
intensity/severity, defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort of an 
adverse event as is determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the subject.  
The assessment of intensity is made irrespective of study proce dure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and shall be evaluated according to the  following scale:
Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated.
Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity.
There is a distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. Severity 
is a measurement of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a SAE.
5.3.2 Expectedness 
All AEs shall be evaluated as to w hether they are expected or une xpected.
Expected (anticipated): An adverse event is expected when the nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence was previously 
described, including those events listed in section 
5.4.2.
Unexpected (unanticipated): An adverse event is unexpected when the nature, severity, or degree of incidence was not previously described.
5.3.3 Relatedness 
The study investigator shall evaluate if the AE is related to t he iLux heating.  Relationship 
is defined in the following manner:
Not related: The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s  
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or 
therapy administered to the subject, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the procedure.
Page 33 of 65
Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the 
time of procedure and/or follows a known response pattern 
to the study procedure and cannot be reasonably explained 
by other factors such as subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant therapy administered to the 
subject.
5.3.4 Treatment or Action Taken 
Action taken in response to an adverse event shall be recorded as:
xNone
xOTC or Rx drug added
xNon-drug treatment/procedure
xHospitalization or ER visit
Action taken with study procedure shall be recorded as:
xNone
xStudy procedure interrupted
xStudy procedure discontinued
5.3.5 Outcome 
The clinical outcome of an AE shall be characterized as follows :
xResolved without sequelae
xResolved with sequelae (specify)
xOngoing (i.e. continuing at time of study discontinuation)
xDeath
xUnknown
5.4 R ISK ANALYSIS & ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.4.1 Risk Analysis 
Risks associated with using the  iLux 2020 were assessed in accordance with ISO 14971, 
which is an international standard for medical device risk mana gement that is recognized 
by the FDA.  Most of the potential hazards identified in the an alysis are common to many 
medical devices and are addressed by compliance with internatio nal standards. Other 
potential hazards unique to the iLux were addressed by assessing risk using Failure Modes 
Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and identifying contro ls to reduce residual risks 
to acceptable levels. 
The iLux is used in the eye and the sterile disposable may come  in contact with the 
conjunctiva and or cornea during the treatment of each lid.  Th e sterile disposable is 
covered with a biocompatible silicone similar to a contact lens .  There is nothing implanted 
either temporarily or permanently in the eye related to the iLu x and the risk is similar to 
other meibomian gland treatments.  Testing demonstrated that the disposable meets the 
requirements for biocompatibility (ISO 10993) and sterilization  and packaging (ISO 1135, 
ISO 11607).  
Page 34 of 65
Compliance to IEC 60601-1, which is an international standard f or safety of electromedical 
devices, was evaluated by the nationally recognized test labora tory, Nemko.  As part of the 
evaluation, the risk management files were reviewed to verify c ompliance with ISO 14971. 
Other IEC 60601-1 tests included electromagnetic compatibility (IEC 60101-1-2) and 
optical radiation safety (IEC 62471).  The iLux system successf ully met the requirements 
of all tests performed.
The instrument warms the eyelids using optical radiation (i.e.,  light) at two wavelengths, 
lime-green and infrared.  Potential photobiological hazards wer e evaluated by David 
Sliney, PhD, who is an internationally-respected expert in the field of optical radiation 
hazards and consults frequently with both the FDA and industry.   His testing was also 
witnessed by an expert from Nemko for certification to the stan dard IEC 62471.  Their 
analysis concluded that the iLux system poses minimal risk for damage to the eye or skin 
and can be classified as exempt from warnings.  To further redu ce risk, the heating cannot 
be operated without a disposable attached, which blocks a signi ficant portion of the emitted 
light.A safety study was conducted at Absorption Systems in San Diego  from November to 
December, 2014.  The study involved exposing one shaved eyelid on each of four New 
Zealand white rabbits to the same energy wavelengths and levels  that are emitted by the 
iLux device, using a back plate and front plate similar to the human device, and applying 
a controlled force to the eyelids.  One cohort received two-minute treatments and the other 
received four-minute treatments, with each treatment applied on ce per week for five 
treatments.  No adverse events occurred and there were no chang es observed in the eyelids 
or eyes, and there were no adverse histological findings. 
The iLux system measures temperatures on the inner and outer su rfaces of the eyelid.  Four 
redundant temperature sensors are included in the disposable.  The instrument displays the 
highest inner eyelid temperature.  If any of the four sensor re adings exceeds 44 °C, the 
instrument automatically turns off the heat source. Bench top t esting has shown that the 
back plate of the iLux disposable tip does not heat above 40°C.Lastly, the iLux system was recently used on 30 subjects in an IRB approved, non-
significant risk study in the United States with no adverse eve nts. 
The mitigations taken demonstrate that the risk of any adverse effects on study subjects 
participating in this study have been eliminated or minimized t o the extent possible and 
therefore, the risk to study subjects is acceptable for this st udy.
5.4.2 Anticipated Adverse Events 
xEyelid/eye Pain
xEyelid Irritation or Inflammation
xOcular Surface Irritation or Inflammation
xOcular Symptoms –Burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreig n 
body sensation, visual disturbance, sensitivity to light.

7.1 E FFICACY ENDPOINTS  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the tempe rature of the cornea and 
the surrounding eye tissue  after heating wi th the iLux instrument.
7.2 S AMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
A sample size of 15 subjects (30 eyes) has been chosen for an ini tial assessment of the 
safety of the iLux System in this patient population. This numb er was chosen to provide 
sufficient data to make an initial safety determination of the System while minimizing the 
number of patients subjected to a clinical trial.
7.3 S AFETY  
AEs, SAEs, and other findings shall be summarized by presenting  the number and
percentages of subjects with each event. Continuous endpoints sh all be summarized using 
summary statistics such as means, medians, standard deviations,  minima, maxima, and 
relevant percentiles.
8 RECORD  RETENTION 
The investigator shall maintain all subject records for a period  of two years after the 
investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.
The investigator must maintain accurate records of the receipt of all investigational 
material shipped by the sponsor, including the date and lot numbers received. In addition, 
accurate records must be kept on the amount and date that the i nvestigational material, by 
lot number, was used and for each subject.
The investigator must assure that study supplies are used only in conjunction with subjects
enrolled in the study and under the direct supervision of the i nvestigator or co-investigators.
9S T U D Y  MONITORING  REQUIREMENTS 
It is the responsibility of the study sponsor, Tear Film Innovations, Inc., to ensure proper 
monitoring of the investigation and to see that all the clinica l requirements are met. Either 
Tear Film personnel or a contracted third party will perform mo nitoring. In general, 
monitoring will consist of an initiation visit to train the sit e on the proper use of the device 
and execution of the protocol.  Due to the small size of the st udy and the limited data being 
collected, monitoring will likely consist of 1-2 visits to the site to compare study CRF data 
with site source data.  During these visits, the monitor may review the subject records to 
verify that all records and files are current and to assure com pliance with all requirements 
of this protocol.  The final monit oring visit may also serve as  the study close-out visit.
10 PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS/AMENDMENTS 
An investigator may deviate from the protocol to protect the li fe or physical well-being of 
a subject in an emergency, and must notify the sponsor and the reviewing IRB within 5 
working days after the emergency occurred.  Except in such an e mergency, an investigator 
may not deviate from the protocol unless he/she obtains the pri or approval of Tear Film 
Page 37 of 65

Innovations, Inc.  Depending on the specifics of the deviation,  IRB approval may also be 
required.

This is a research study. This study includes only individuals who  voluntarily choose to 
participate. Please take your time to make your decision. Discus s it in confidence with your 
regular doctor, friends and family if you want.  Be sure to ask q uestions about anything you do
not understand in this document. Taking part in a research study  is entirely voluntary and you 
can stop being in the study at any time you want to, without an y penalty or impact on your 
medical care or benefits.
The reason we are doing this research study is to gather inform ation. In this document, you will 
see the term “treatment.” This term is used in research studies  and is not meant to indicate 
that you will be receiving medi cal treatment for your condition  as the device being used in this 
investigational study is experimental.WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?
The purpose of this study is to measure corneal temperature as w ell as the surrounding eye 
tissue temperature including the eye lids after heating the eyelids with the iLux device after 
treatment with the iLux™ device. Bench top safety testing has shown that the back plate of the iLux disposable tip does not heat above the safe temperature of  40°C (104°F). The study 
device is investigational, which means that it is not approved b y the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).
If you participate in this study, y ou will be receiving one trea tment with the iLux device.  
HOW LONG IS THIS STUDY? HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THIS STUD Y? 
About 15 adults with healthy eyes will take part in this study. Yo u will be in the study for about
one week, including a screening evaluation, a single treatment and a follow up evaluation one 
day after the treatment visit. 
Page 55 of 65
WHAT IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE?
If new information in relation to the study DEVICE becomes avail able, that may be relevant to 
the purpose and safety of the study and your willingness to con tinue participation in this study, 
you will be informed by the study doctor.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?
If you agree to take part in this research study, you will be re quired to sign this informed 
consent form before any procedures take place.  STUDY PROCEDURES:
During the screening and if you qualify and continue, during the study the following procedures will occur:
xDemographics/medical/ocular history
xVisual acuity (a test to evaluate your vision)
xSlit lamp evaluation for anterior segment health (an exam allowi ng the doctor to see the 
front of the eye)
xEvaluation of any eyelid margin abnormalities
xCorneal fluorescein staining slit lamp evaluation (a variation o f the slit lamp exam that 
allows for the doctor to see abrasions and scarring on the eye)
xIntraocular pressure (an exam to assess the fluid pressure insid e the eye)
xiLux™ treatment
The study doctor will talk to you and give you a list of the th ings you must do to participate, 
such as:
  
xYour history of contact lens wear in the last 30 days and intention on wearing contact lenses during this study.
You may have additional tests, for example, to follow up on tests previously done.
Please tell your regular health care providers and any emergency care providers that you are 
participating in this research study.
At the screening visit, your eyes will be examined and you will  be asked questions about your 
health to make sure that you meet the requirements to participa te in the study without 
unacceptable risk to your safety and health. If it is found tha t you do meet those requirements, 
you will have a detailed eye exam including the assessments incl uded in the above list. The 
iLux device will then be used on your eyelids for a single trea tment. The device is a small 
instrument that the study doctor will hold in their hand. You w ill have eye drops with numbing 
medicine dripped into your eye to keep the eye surfaces numb du ring the treatment (the 
effects of these eye drops will wear off in 10-20 minutes after  the procedure). The study doctor 
will gently pull your eyelid away from the eyeball and place th e eyelid between two pads on the 
device then gently squeeze the eyelid between the pads. 
Page 56 of 65
The study doctor will then push a button on the device that act ivates a green light and some 
infrared (warming lights) on the eyelids for 90 seconds. The li ght will warm the eyelids to 
between 104 and 107.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The study doctor will  also look through a 
magnifying lens on the device to get it into the proper place o n your eyelids.
The device is designed to shut off automatically if you eyelids  get too hot. It is also designed 
NOT to touch your eyeball. However, if it accidentally did touc h your eyeball, the device will be 
cool enough that you eyeball is not warmed higher than your normal body temperature. This 
helps prevent any risk of damage to you eye. 
You will be asked to answer questions about whether you are hav ing any eye discomfort on 
the day of the procedure or the next day.After the one day follow up phone call, your participation in t he study will end. 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS STU DY?
The iLux™ is used in the eye and the sterile disposable may come  in contact with the 
conjunctiva and or cornea during the treatment of each lid.  Th e sterile disposable silicone 
pads are covered with a biocompatible silicone similar to a con tact lens.  There is nothing 
implanted either temporarily or permanently in the eye related to the iLux™.
David Sliney, PhD, a nationally-respected expert in the field o f ocular radiation hazard who 
consults frequently with both the FDA and industry, performed an  on-site evaluation of Tear 
Film’s benchtop system.  He concluded that the iLux™ system con forms to applicable safety 
standards.The iLux has also undergone safety testing by NEMKO and has passed all test which were 
based on international standards.   
An animal safety study was conducted at Absorption Systems in Sa n Diego from November to 
December, 2014.  No adverse events occurred and there were no c hanges observed in the 
eyelids or eyes, and there were no adverse histological finding s. 
Anticipated risks include: Eyelid/eye pain (during and after proc edure), eyelid irritation or 
inflammation, ocular surface irritation or inflammation and ocu lar symptoms (stinging, tearing, 
itching, discharge, redness, foreign body sensation, visual dis turbance, sensitivity to light). 
There may be risks to being in this study that we cannot predic t.  
You should discuss these risks wi th the study doctor and/or your regular doctor. 
Side effects occurring during the trial can be treated by the study doctor, if this is deemed 
necessary. It is important that you inform the study doctor any  unusual or unpleasant effects 
which you should feel.

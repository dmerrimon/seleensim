CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 23of 1621.2 Synopsis
Principal Investigator:
Dr Timothy  Yap

Houston, Texas
77030
United States
Protocol Title:
A Phase I/IIa, Open -Label Study  to Assess the Safety , Tol erabilit y, Pharmacokinet ics and 
Preliminary Efficacy  of Ascending Doses of AZD7648 Monotherapy  or in Co mbinat ion with 
either Cy totoxi c Chem otherapi es or Novel  Anti-Cancer Agents in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies
Rationale:
In cancer cells, defect ive DNA damage response (DDR) promote s genomic instabilit y, 
neopl astic transform ation and proliferat ion.  Such instabilit y results in the format ion of highly 
destructive double -strand breaks (DSBs) and cell death.  DNA dependent protein kinase 
(DNA -PK) overexpressio n renders tumours resistant to DNA dam age; therefore DNA -PK 
inhibit ion is an attractive therapeut ic strategy .  Preclinical data from both in vitro and in vivo 
system s supports thi s hypothesis and provides the rationale required to explore the clinical 
potenti al of the DNA -PK select ive inhibitor AZD7648.
Study Design:
This is a modular Phase I/IIa, open -label, m ulti-centre, study  of AZD7648 administered 
orally , either as a m onotherapy , or in combinat ion with either cy totoxi c chem otherapi es or 
novel ant i-cancer agents in pat ients with advanced malignancies.  The modular design allows 
for an escalat ion of the dose of AZD7648 alone or in combinat ion with either cy totoxi c 
chemotherapies or novel ant i-cancer agents, with intensive safety  monitoring to ensure the 
safet y of the pati ents.
The study  consists of 2modules each evaluat ing the safet y and tol erabili ty of AZD7648 
monotherapy  or wi th a specific combinat ion partner.  The init ial components are a Core 
Module of AZD7648 monotherapy  and Combination Module 1 (AZD7648 in co mbinat ion 
with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD]).  Up to 5 addit ional co mbinat ion modules may 
be added via a formal amendment (see Section 4.1.3 ) to allow further evaluat ion ofAZD7648 
in defined populat ions or novel combinat ions.  These may include i) combinat ion with a DDR 
agent eg, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 -related protein (ATR) inhibitor; ii) co mbinat ion with 
an immuno -oncol ogy agent eg, a programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) inhibitor; iii)

conjugate; and v) combination wit h radi otherapy .
Combinat ion Modul e1has 2 study  parts: Part A consist ing of dose escalat ion cohorts and 
Part B, asafety and proof of concept (PoC) Phase IIa expansio n.  Part A dose escalat ion and 
de-escalat ion will fo llow the principles of the Bayesian adaptive design which co mbines prior 
expectati ons about the dose toxicit y relationship and applies the data at the end of each cohort 
to recommend a dose for the next cohort.  A Safet y Review Co mmittee (SRC) will review 
evaluable pat ients at each cohort and assess if the study  shoul d progress to Part B.  Optional 
expansio n cohorts may also be triggered in Part A dose e scalat ions, enrolling addit ional 
patients at appropri ate dose(s) to explore further the safet y, tolerabili ty, pharm acodynamics 
(PD), pharmacokinet ics (PK), bio logical activity and effect of food. 
Main Objectives:
The primary  object ive is to invest igate th e safet y and tol erabili ty of AZD7648 when given 
orally  to pati ents wi th advanced m alignancies, as mo notherapy  and in combinat ion with 
anti-cancer agents, and to define the doses and schedules for further clinical evaluation.
Secondary  object ives are i) to characterise the PK of AZD7648, following a single dose and at 
steady  state after mult iple doses, when given orally  as m onotherapy  and in combinat ion with 
anti-cancer agents, and to characterise the effect of food on AZD7648 exposure (if 
conducted); ii) to obtain a preliminary assessment of ant i-tumour activit y of AZD7648 as 
monotherapy  and in combinat ion with anti-cancer agents.
Terti ary/expl oratory  object ives are described in Section 3.
Study Period:
Estimated date of first patient enro lled:Q4 2019
Estimated date of last patient completed: Q22024
Number of Patients:
Approximately  192evaluable patients may be enrolled in the Core Modul e(95evaluable 
patients: 46patients in the dose escalation and up to 49 addit ional patients in optional 
expansio n cohorts) and Combinat ion Modul e1(97evaluable patients: 30 patients in the dose 
escalat ionwiththe potenti al for an additional 30 patients once m aximum  tolerate do se[MTD] 
has been determined, and 37 patients in the expansio n cohort).

AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25of 162Treatments and Treatment Duration:
For the Core Module, a single dose of AZD7648 will be administered in the clinic (Cycle 0, 
Day 1) to enable collection o f blood samples for PK analys es.  Thi s will  be followed by  a drug 
washout (no dose) of 3 to 7 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 AZD7648 administration.
In cohort 1, at Cy cle1, Day 1, the starti ng dose of AZD7648 will be mg  on a 
continuous .  There is no in terval  between cycles.  Using an accelerated 
titration design, dose escalation may  occur wi th single pat ient cohorts up to and including 
mg .  From  mg , a minimum o f 3 pati ents will be 
enrolled into each dose cohort.  Dose escalat ion will  stop at the MTD, maximum feasible dose 
(MFD), or the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).  From Cohort 2 onwards, intermittent 
dosing schedules for AZD7648 may  be expl ored.
For Combinat ion Modul e 1the starting dose of AZD7648 is dependent on emerging safet y 
and tol erabilit y data from the Core Module.  Intermittent dosing schedules for AZD7648 may 
be explored. 
For Combinat ion Modul e1 the starting dose of PLD is 40 mg/m2, administered by  intravenou s 
(IV) i nfusi on once every 4 weeks, for a m aximum  of 6 cy cles.  AZD7648 will be administered 
4hours from the start of the IV infusio n of PLD .

2.2 Background
DNA damage events occur frequent ly in any  living cell  and vari ous mechanisms have evolved 
to deal  with them .  Different form s of DNA damage trigger responses by di fferent repair 
mechanisms and signalling pathways ( Figure 2). 
Amo ng DNA damage lesio ns, DSBs are the most cytotoxic.  They  induce cell cycle arrest and 
cell death if left unrepaired.  NHEJ pathway  of DSB repai r occurs independent ly but is 
preferentially used during the early G1/S phases, where no template sister chromatid is 
available ( Hartlerode andScully 2009 ).  This contrasts with the second major pathway  of DSB 
repai r, hom ologous recombinat ion (HR), which occurs primarily in G2/M phases of the cell 
cycle when undamaged sister chromatids are available ( SanFilippo etal2008 ).
DNA -PK is a m ember of the phosphatidylino sitol 3-kinase -related kinase (PIKK) family  (that 
includes ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM] and ATR) and is a key  modulator for the NHEJ

process that utilises NHEJ to promote immune system diversit y(Blunt etal1995 ).  
DNA -PK is activated when it is recruited to DSBs by  Ku70/80 heterodimer.  
Autophosphorylat ion of the DNA -dependent protein kinase cataly tic sub unit (DNA -PKcs), i s 
critical for the regulati on of  DNA -end processing, enzyme inact ivation, and co mplex 
dissoci ation (Chan etal2002 ).  Activated DNA -PKcs prom otes DN A-end tethering 
(Graham etal2016 ) which prevents DNA degradation by exonucleases 
(Yoo andDynan 1999 ) and al ters the activit y of a wi de range of substrates that mediate 
DNA -end processing and resolut ion (Figure 3) (NealandMeek 2011 ).
DNA -PK has also been implicated in a range of other bio logical processes, including 
modulat ion of chromat in structure, telo mere maint enance, transcriptional regulat ion, an d the 
response to replicat ion stress ( Figure 4) (Goodwin andKnudsen 2014 ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 30of 162Upregul ation of DNA -PK has been reported in various tumour ty pes, correl ates w ith poor 
clinical prognosis, and has been shown to correlate with decreased response to DNA 
damaging agents and therapeutic resistance in mult iple cancers, such as co lorectal  cancer, 
oesophageal cancer, oral  squam ous cell  carcinom a, and neuroblastoma 
(Goodwin andKnudsen 2014 , Shintani etal2003 , Hosoi etal2004 ,Shintani etal2003 , 
Tonotsuka etal2006 , Dolman etal2015 ,Beskow etal2009 ).
The concept of targeting DNA -PK as an ant i-cancer strategy  is based on explo iting tumour 
dependence on NHEJ repair.  Synthetic lethal interactions have been ident ified between 
DNA -PK and m ultiple dam age response factors including ATM and HR proteins suggest ing 
that a DNA -PK inhibitor may show efficacy  as m onotherapy  in specifically sele cted genetic 
backgrounds ( Gurleyetal2001 , Oken etal1982 , Riabinska etal2013 , Dietleinetal201).  
Furtherm ore, combining a DNA -PK inhibitor with a gents that increase levels o f DNA DSBs 
in cells –such as radiat ion, topoi somerase 2 inhibit ors (eg, doxorubicin) represents another 
rational strategy  for clinical  devel opment of DNA -PK inhibitor.  
There i s currently one other DNA -PK select ive inhibitor, M3814, known to be undergoing 
clinical trials.  A Phase I study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of M3814 showed that the drug was safe and 
tolerable at doses up to 400 mg BID with limited single -agent activit y (Van Bussel etal2017 ) 
and a Phase Ia/b study  is now being conducted in combinat ion with radiati on and 
chemoradiat ion ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Preliminary results fro m 16 pati ents dosed across 3 cohorts 
(100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg once da ily [QD]) in combinat ion with radiati on have shown 
that the combinat ion was well tolerated, although som e Grade 3 events of mucosit is and 
odynophagia were observed.  Two dose -limiting toxicit ies (DLTs) were observed at 400 mg 
QD therefore 300 mg QD is bein g expl ored.  Ini tial efficacy data from  12evaluable pat ients 
was reported to have 1 complete response (CR), 4 partial responses (PR) and 7 stable disease 
(SD) ( Van Triestetal2018 ).  Two addi tional studies are al so recrui ting patients: a Phase I 
study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to evaluate RP2D and/or MTD of M3814 in combinat ion with 
avelumab wit h and wit hout radiotherapy  in solid tumours; and a Phase Ib/2 study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to first define RP2D of M3814 in combination wit h capecitabine and 
radiotherapy  followed by evaluat ion of the combination efficacy in pat ients with locally  
advanced rectal cancer.  There are 2 other DNA -PK drugs, SF -1126 and CC -115, in Phase I 
clinical trial s but, unlike AZD7648 and M3814, they  are known to be m ulti-kinase inhibitor 
and dual -kinase inhibitor respectively .
A detailed description o f the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of AZD7648 is 
provi ded in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
2.3 Benefit/risk assessment

minimise potential risks and alt hough the potential benefit s in pat ients are unknown at this 
time, non -clinical data demonstrates evidence of ant i-tumour acti vity.  Thus, the benefit/risk 
assessment for this Phase I/IIa study  appears acceptabl e based on the l ack of effect ive 
alternat ive treatments, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, and the strength of 
the scientific hypothesis under evaluat ion.

4.1.2 Core module study design: AZD7648 monotherapy
This part of the study  is dose escalat ion (Part A) of AZD7648 mo notherapy , administered 
orally , in approximately  46 evaluable patients with advanced so lid tumours. Further details o f 
the study  design for Com binat ion Modul e 1 can be found in Sect ion12. 
The starting dose of AZD7648 is mg .  A single dose of AZD7648 will be administered 
during .  From  Cycle 1, Day 1, the init ial 
schedule will be AZD7648 dosed on a continuous basis in a .  There will be no 
interval  between cycles.  Using an accelerated titration des ign (see Table 4), dose escal ation 
may occur with single patient cohorts up to and including mg   From mg

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35of 162onwards, a minimum o f 3patients will be enrolled into each dose cohort.  Dose escalat ion will 
stop at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), maximum feasible dose (MFD), or the RP2D.  
Dose escalat ions wi th single patient cohorts may  proceed up to and i ncluding mg  
following SRC reco mmendat ion (informed by  real-time PK analysis) and provided no 
CTCAE Grade ≥2 drug -related toxicit y is observed.  If either of these condit ions is not m et, 
the cohort will be expanded to recruit a minimum of 3 patients (maximum of 6 pati ents) in all 
subsequent cohorts.  At this point, the decision to dose escalate AZD7648 will fo llow the 
principles of the Bayesian adaptive design, using all o f the available data and considering the 
PK fro m a minimum of 2 out of the 3 patients enrolled into each dose cohort (data from all 
evaluable pat ients will be used to make the dose escalat ion decisio n).  The DLT period is fro m 
the first dose until the end of Cycle 1 (incl usive of any non -dosing days).  This DLT 
assessment period was s elected as the major potential toxicit ies woul d be antici pated to 
present within this duration.  Doses and/or schedules of AZD7648 will be defined by  the SRC 
by taking the Bayesian adaptive design and PK into considerat ion.
Part A cohorts may be expanded a t doses at or above the monotherapy  Minimum  Biologically 
Active Dose (MBAD) in parallel to continuing the dose escalat ion cohorts provided the dose 
has al ready been declared as tolerated.  Further recruitment to such an expansio n cohort will 
stop if the do se in that cohort is subsequent ly evaluated to be non -tolerated.  The opti onal 
expansio n cohort(s) are described in Sect ion6.1.2.1 . 
Escal ation will stop at the M TD, MFD, or the RP2D. 
To accoun t for the dose range between starting dose and target dose level, intra -patient dose 
escalat ion is permitted as part of the monotherapy dose escalat ion to m aximise pat ient benefit 
and minimise exposure to non -efficacious dos es.  However, the fo llowing cri teria must be 
fulfilled before a patient is permitted to proceed with an intra -patient dose escalat ion:
The pl anned next hi gher dose m ust be declared tolerated by  the SRC (based on 
assessment of 2 to 6 evaluable patients).
Agreement by  the SRC that the pati ent is permitted to have an intra -patient dose 
escalat ion.
Intra -patient dose escalat ion occurs on Day 1 following a scheduled scan assessment.
Whilst a pati ent is being considered for an intra -patient dose escalation, they shoul d cont inue 
treatm ent at thei r allocated dose l evel.  In the event of an intra -patient dose escalat ion, such 
patients will  not be evaluable for DLT at the escalated dose.
No Part B expansio n is planned in the Core Module but there are optional expansio n opti ons 
as described in Sect ion6.1.2.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 38of 162AZD7648 is a novel potent and highly selective oral inhibitor of DNA -PK.   
 
   
 
This FTIH study  with AZD7648 will be conducted within the context of a modular protocol to 
evaluate the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK and anti -tumour activit y of AZD7648 at increasing doses 
as a monotherapy  (Core Modul e) and in co mbinat ion with PLD (Co mbinat ion Module 1), in 
patients wi th advanced malignancies.  Whilst AZD7648 monotherapy  may offer som e clinical 
benefit to patients, preclinical evidence suggests that the greatest potential for benefit is likely 
tobe achieved in co mbinat ions.  Therefore, rather than co mpleting an AZD7648 mo notherapy  
escalat ion to RP2D before init iating co mbinat ion dosing, the combinat ion dosing phase of the 
study  with PLD will commence as soon as sufficient safet y and PK data have been obtained 
from the monotherapy  escalati on.  
Key aspects of the study , such as the starting dose of AZD7648 in the Core Module, and the 
dose escalat ion, stopping criteria and cohort size of all study  modules, are based upon 
accepted methodology  for Pha seI oncol ogy studies.  Furthermore, blood samples will be 
collected to enable characterisat ion of AZD7648 PK and, if appropriate, invest igation of 
additional metaboli tes to enable AstraZeneca to fulfil regulatory  requi rements rel ated to the 
testing of the safet y of AZD7648 and its metabo lites.

4.3 Justification for dose
A dose of  mg/day is proposed as the starting dose in this FTIH Phase 1 study  in pat ients 
with advanced cancer, including patients with so lid tumours.  This is based on international 
guidance for starting dose select ion for agents in cancer patients (International Conference on 
Harm onisat ion [ICH] S9) which recommends that the starting dose sho uld be set at a dose of 
1/10 of the Severely Toxic Dose in 10% of the animals (STD 10) in rodent toxicit y studi es.  If 
the non -rodent is considered the most appropriate species then 1/6th of the Highest 
Non-Severely  Toxic Dose (HNSTD) observed in non -roden t studies is viewed as an

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 39of 162appropriate starting dose.  For AZD7648, the non- rodent was considered to be the most 
sensit ive species.
A rat STD 10 was not ident ified in the 1 -month toxico logy study .  The hi ghest dose tested 
( mg/kg/day administered as mg/kg  was tolerated in all animals and is 
considered to be the MTD as higher doses administered in the dose range finding study  
( mg/kg/day administered as mg/kg  led to body weight loss and clinical signs 
which were considered too severe f or this dose to be suitable for longer term administration.  
At mg/kg ( mg/m2), body  weight l oss and decreased food intake was observed over 
the first few days of dose administration in both sexes.  However, by days 4 to 5, animals 
started to gain w eight and food consumption increased.  Histopathological findings were 
restri cted to decreased cellularit y in lympho id tissue, effects on the male reproductive tract 
and thy roid hypertrophy  in females only .  Full  recovery  from the histopathological changes
was observed after 28 days o ff dose.
However, 1/10th of the MTD in rats gives a dog -equivalent dose of mg/kg/day and a 
dose of mg/kg/day was not tolerated in onemale dog.  The animal was removed fro m the 
study  on Day 11 due to m arked body  weight l oss together with decreased or absence of food 
intake and adverse clinical signs, including liquid faeces wit h red traces, decreased activit y 
and vo miting.  Histopathological examinat ion showed m ucosal  degenerat ion, neutrophil ic 
inflammat ion, ulcerati on, and haemorrhage in the gastrointestinal (GI) sy stem  and decreased 
cellularit y in lympho id tissue. 
The human equivalent dose derived from 1/6th of the dog HNSTD (  mg/kg/day) was 
calculated to be mg/kg, which equates to mg for a kg human.  In an in vitro GI 
organoi d model, human and dog results were similar.  Therefore, the dog is considered an 
appropriate species and a starting dose of  mg/day  is proposed for thi s study .
4.3.1 Justification for the dose escalation doses
The select ion of the starting dose is based upon internat ional guidance for an ICH S9 patient 
popul ation, and is based on the HNSTD dose level.  However, when considering proposed 
human starting dose margins to measured exposure in the dog study, there is a 23-fold margin 
to AUC and a 16- fold margin to C maxvalues recorded at the NOAEL of mg/kg/day in the 
dog.  At this dose level there were no significant toxico logical findings.  Therefore, assuming 
human PK values are as predicted from real- time PK analy sis, and that there are no 
drug-related Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥2 events, a 
maximum o f dose doubling is proposed.

The end o f study  is defined as the last visit of the last patient undergoing the protocol -defined

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 40of 162The study  may be terminated at individual centres if the study  procedures are not being 
perform ed according to GCP, or recruitment is low.  AstraZeneca may  also terminate the 
entire study  of individual cohorts prematurely  ifconcerns for safet y arise wi thin this study  or 
in any other study  with any agent used in any  of the study  modules.
A pat ient is considered to have completed the study  when he/she has co mpleted his/her last 
scheduled visit or contact.
For each module or st udy part ,there will be a data cut -off (DCO) defined as the earlier of 
6months after the last patient recruited starts study treatm ent(in module/study  part) or after 
the final pat ient discont inues study  treatm ent (in modul e/study  part) .  Patients who are
receiving treatment fo llowing the data cut -off (DCO) for the final analysis can either choose 
to discont inue from the study  or,where the Investigator believes the patients are gaining 
clinical benefit, patients may cont inue to receive study treatment.  A ll pat ients will receive 
follow-up care in accordance with standard local clinical practice.  For patients who do 
continue treatment bey ond the time of the final DCO, Invest igators will cont inue to report all 
SAEs unt il 90 days after the last dose of study treatm ent.  Addi tionally, any SAE or AE that is 
ongoing at the time o f this DCO must be fo llowed up to resolut ion unless the event is 
considered by the Invest igator to be unlikely to resolve, or the patient is lost to fo llow-up.
Data analysis will be perf ormed separately  for each m odule or study  part and a CSR will be 
written.  Inform al data cuts m ay be perform ed at regul ar intervals across all modules/parts to 
inform  internal decisio n making.

5 STUDY POPULATION
Prospective approval o f protocol  deviati ons to recrui tment and enro lment criteria, also known 
as protocol waivers or exemptions, are not permitted.
Each patient should meet all o f the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria for the 
core and Com binat ion Modul e1 (if applicable) .  Under no circumstances can there be 
exceptions to this rule.   If there are differences in cut -off v alues, the specific module takes 
precedence.  For example, if the haematological parameters are stricter in the combinat ion 
module rather than the Core Module, the Investigator should adhere to the combination 
module cri teria.  Pati ents who do not m eet the entry  requirements are screen failures, refer to 
Secti on5.4.

AZD7648 tablets should be swallowed who le wit h water on an empt y stom ach (no food or 
drink other than water for 2 hours prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing).
5.3.2 Dietary restrictions
During the studies, patients should avoid consuming grapefruits, Seville oranges, or other 
products that may contain these fruits as these may affect AZD7648 metabo lism.
5.3.3 Contraception
Male patients
Shoul d use barrier contraceptives (ie, by  use of  condom s) during sex wit h all partners 
from the time they  sign consent and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study  treatm ent.  If 
male pat ients wish to father children, they  shoul d be advised to arrange for freezing of 
sperm  samples pri or to the start of study  treatm ent. 
A sexual partner of a male participant who is a WOCBP should also use a highly  effect ive 
form of contracepti on.
Men should not donate sperm for 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Female patients
Women with evidence of non -child -bearing potential at screening have no restrict ions 
around con tracepti on.
From  the time of signing consent, and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study  treatm ent; 
WOCBP and their partners (who are sexually active) should agree to use 2 reliable 
methods of contraception in co mbinat ion, or they  must totally/truly  abstain from  any form  
of sexual intercourse.  All hormonal methods of contraception should be used in 
combinat ion with the use of a condom by  their male sexual partner for intercourse.  
Total /true abstinence is when a patient refrains from any  form of sexual  intercourse and 
this is in line with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total 
durati on of  the tri al unt il at leas t 1month after the last dose of study  drug.  Peri odic 
abstinence (eg, calendar ovulat ion, symptothermal, post -ovulati on methods, or decl aration 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46of 162of abst inence so lely for the duration of the trial) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.
Contraceptives that are prone to drug -drug interactio ns may not be effect ive due to a 
potenti al CYP3A4 interacti on wi th AZD7648.  Contraception used must therefore include 
a condom  and oneof:
Medroxy progesterone inject ions (eg, Depo -provera)
Intrauterine Device (IUD)
Levonorgestrol Intrauterine System (eg, Mirena)
Tubal occlusio n
Vasectomised partner that is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial part icipant 
provi ded the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical 
success.
5.3.4 Concomitant medication
See Secti on 6.5, for details in restricted or prohibit ed m edicat ions.
5.3.5 Blood donation
Patients shoul d not donate bl ood whilst parti cipat ing in studies of AZD7648 and for at least 
12weeks after receiving the last dose of study  treatm ent.
5.4 Screen failures
Screen failures are defined as pat ients who si gned the ICF to parti cipate in the clinical study  
but are not subsequently dosed with study  treatm ent.  A minimal set of screen failure 
inform ation is required to e nsure transparent reporting of screen failure pat ients to m eet the 
Conso lidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from Regulatory  authori ties.  Minimal informat ion includes demography, 
screen failure details, eligibilit y criteria, and any  SAE.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failure) m ay be 
rescreened.  Rescreened patients should be assigned the same patient number as for the init ial 
screening.  However, rescreening should be documented so that its effect on study  resul ts, if 
any, can be assessed.
These pat ients should have the reason for screen failure recorded in the case report form 
(CRF).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 48of 162AZD7648 will be administered as an oral dose, init ially  (refer to Figure 7).  The 
individual pat ient observat ion peri od will be for the duration of the sampling as detailed in the 
SoA ( Table 1).  When there i s more than one pati ent enrolled to a dose cohort, sentinel dosing 
will be applied with a single pat ient exposed for a minimum o f 48hoursafter Cycle1, Day 1
before further pati ents are enrolled at that dose level.  In the absence o f any significant 
toxicities in the first patient, the patients for the remainder of the cohort may be enrolled, 
concurrent ly or sequent ially, based upon the decision of the SRC. 
If significant tox icities are observed during the first 48 hours of observat ion in the first patient 
of the cohort, further enro lment into the cohort will be halted until the SRC has reviewed all 
the safet y data (and the PK data for Cohorts 1 to 4 ) for that pati ent and cum ulative data fro m
all tri al patients to determine the appropriate action.

Where dosing is  the tablets should be taken approximately 12 hours apart .  If a dose is 
missed, i t is acceptable to take the scheduled dose up to 2 hours after the scheduled dose time.  
If greater than 2 hours, the missed dose should not be taken, and the patient should cont inue 
with the next dose at the allotted time.  If vo miting occurs shortly after AZD7648 is 
swall owed, the dose shoul d not be repl aced.  Resume dosing at the fo llowing scheduled dose.

that the SRC accounts for all pat ient data .
Dose escalat ion and de -escalat ion will fo llow the Bayesian adapt ive design below.
If no DL T at any  dose has been observed, then dose escalat ion may occur without 
modelling.  Dose doubling may  be permi tted in singl e pat ient cohorts up to and including 
mg  if reco mmended by the SRC (informed by ‘real -time’ analysis of PK samples
for Cohort s1 to 4 ).  However, if CTCAE Grade ≥2 drug -related toxi city is observed or at
the recommendat ion of the SRC, cohorts may be expanded to recruit a minimum of 3 
(and m aximum of 6) pati ents in all subsequent cohorts. 
From  mg  (or once cohorts are rec ruiting a minimum of 3 patients), after the first 
DLT has been observed (at any  dose), a Bay esian logi stic regressio n model will be used 
to inform subsequent dose selections.  After each cohort, cumulative data on the evaluable 
patients will  be used to est imate the predicted probabilit y of a DLT at each potential next 
dose.
The recommendat ion for the next dose will be based on the fo llowing principles:
The recommendat ion for the next dose will be chosen to target a DLT of 25% for 
monotherapy  and 30% for com binat ion but i gnoring any  dose f or whi ch the m odel 
suggests the probabilit y of a DLT exceeds 35%.  This will allow efficient 
ident ificat ion of the MTD whilst restrict ing the risk of overdosing.
Dose escalat ion and de -escalat ion will be co mpleted when any o f the following occur:
The target toxicit y of 25% (for monotherapy ) and 30% (for combination) is reached 
and the required precisio n of the estimated MTD is achieved (ie, the ratio of the 
upper/l ower 95% credible interval limit s for the estimated MTD < 5.0).
The m aximum  number of evaluable pat ients for the dose escalat ion cohort has been 
reached.
There i s no antici pated improvement in efficacy  with increasing dose.
The MFD is achieved.
Decisio n made by the SRC to stop dose escalat ion.
Prior established d ose toxi city relati onship at doses at which 10% and 50% (or similar) of 
patients experience DLTs will be used to inform the Bay esian m odel.
Emerging data fro m the Core Module or any  combinat ion module of this study  may also 
be used to inform the Bayesian model in another module of this study  or other clinical 
studi es.
Dose increases will be permitted after review of data from a minimum o f 2 out of the 
3patients enrolled into each dose cohort (data from all evaluable pat ients will be used to 
make the dose escalation decisio n).
There i s no minimum t ime period required between co mpletion o f dosing in the last evaluable 
patient from one cohort and the start of dosing in the subsequent cohort.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 51of 162To accoun t for the dose range between the starting dose and target dose level, intra -patient 
dose escalat ions is permitted as part of the monotherapy  dose escalat ion to maximise patient 
benefit and minimise exposure to non -efficacious doses.  However, the fo llowing cri teria must 
be fulfilled before a patient is permitted to proceed with an intra -patient dose escalation:
The pl anned next hi gher dose m ust have been declared tolerated by  the SRC (based on 
assessment of 2 to 6 evaluable patients).
Agreement by  the SRC that the pati ent is permitted to have an intra -patient dose
escalat ion.
Intra -patient dose escalat ion occurs on Day 1 following a scheduled scan assessment.
Whilst a pati ent is being considered for an intra -patient dose escalation, they should cont inue 
treatm ent at thei r allotted dose level .  In the event of an in tra-patient dose escal ation, such 
patients will  not be evaluable for DLT at the escalated dose.
After each patient has co mpleted the DLT assessment period during the dose escalation phase 
of the study , the SRC will evaluate all available toxicit y informati on (incl uding AEs and 
laboratory  abnorm alities that are not DLTs), as well as available PK and PD informat ion for 
the first cy cle for all evaluable pat ients (data from Cycle 2 and beyo nd will also be evaluated 
if available).  Addit ional CRF data m ay be inc luded in the SRC review including vital signs, 
clinical chemistry /haematol ogy, ECG resul ts, PK and PD data, ad hoc safet y reports, AEs 
from previ ous cohorts and opti onal expansi ons and any  other emerging data.  If appropriate, 
quant itative dose/exposure -response models will be used to describe the relat ionship for such 
data of interest to decide the next dose and/or schedule.
There i s no limit to the number of intra-patient dose escalat ions that a patient can undergo. 
Interm ediate dose l evels, dosing inter vals and/or frequency , and/or schedules may  be 
evaluated prior to declaring the RP2D, which will be guided by the evo lving safet y, 
preliminary efficacy , PK and PD data.
For decisio ns on dose escalat ion (Part A), an evaluable pat ient is defined as a patient that has 
received AZD7648 and eit her:
Has completed minimum safet y evaluat ion requirements and has received at least 75% of 
the total amount of planned dose of AZD7648 (and PLD for Combinat ion Modul e 1) 
during Cycle 1 
or
Has experienced a DLT during Cycl e0 or Cy cle1.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 52of 162Triggers for Additional Module s
Combinat ion modules, eg, Combinat ion Modul e1 (combinat ion of AZD7648 + PLD )will 
start after PK data from monotherapy  dose escalat ion has confirmed an understanding o f the 
metabo lic profile of AZD7648 and th e dose sel ected as the starting dose for the combinat ions 
is safe and tolerated.  Triggers that will init iate the start of addit ional co mbinat ion modules 
may include (but are not limited to):
PK dose proportional.  PK exposure vs. dose is well understood. 
Total  drug exposure levels ≥50% of that predicted to be required for bio logical act ivity 
for a peri od defined for the specific combinat ion.  It i s ant icipated that the combinat ion 
modules will  be triggered once exposure (based on clinical PK exposure and emerging 
safet y and tolerabilit y data) i s determined to be in a suitable therapeut ic range .
No toxicit y red flags eg, DLT rate greater than that anticipated for a tolerated cohort .
Multiple combinat ion modules maybe tri ggered simultaneously.  
6.1.2.1 Optional Expansion Cohorts
In all modules of the study , Part A cohorts may be expanded at doses at or above the MBAD 
in parallel to continuing the dose escalat ion cohorts provided that the dose has been declared 
as tol erated.  Using this design, tolerabilit y and PK will be characterised in the Part A 
popul ation whilst providing evidence of PD and clinical act ivity in the populat ions most likely 
to benefit fro m drug and potentially  across several  doses.
The opti onal Part A expansio n cohorts may be init iated for 3 rea sons:
PD expansion cohort of up to 12 addit ional pat ients to obtain mandatory  serial biopsies 
for signal searching of bio logical  PD activi ty.
Efficacy expansion cohorts of up to 25 addi tional pati ents (of which a subset of up to 12 
in each cohort m ay have mandatory  biopsies if PD data i s also required) to explore 
clinical benefit.
Food effect expansion cohorts of up to 12 pati ents at doses between the MBAD and 
RP2D.
The expansio n cohorts will also explore further the tolerabilit y, safet y and PK act ivity at these 
doses.
Food Effect 
At least one cohort may  investi gate the effect of food on AZD7648 PK.  If a food effect cohort 
is included in the monotherapy  expansi on cohort, then up to 12 evaluable pat ients may be 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 53of 162included in the food effect cohort if the dose and schedule has already been declared tolerated 
by the SRC.
If the dose and schedule has not y et been declared tolerated, then init ially up to 6 evaluable 
patients will  be enrolled to the food effect cohort, and an addit ional 6 evaluable patients may 
be added once the dose and schedule has been declared tolerated by the SRC. A cross over 
design will be used for the food effect cohort.  Each patient will be allocated to receive a 
single oral  dose of AZD7648 on Cycle 0, Day 1 in ei ther the fasted or fed st ate, followed by a 
single oral  dose of AZD7648 in the other state for Cycle 1, Day 1 at l east 72hours later.  
Other criteria may be used for decisio n-making based on emerging AZD7648 PK data.  After 
Cycle 1, Day 1 patients m ay cont inue to receive AZD7648 monotherapy  (at or bel ow the 
RP2D and schedule), and all dosing fro m that point onwards must be administered in the 
fasted state.  For the fed dosing day, pat ients should ideally  start the recommended meal 
30minutes prior to the planned administration of the study  drug.  The study  drug shoul d be 
administered 30 min utes after the start of the meal (or up to 45 min utes after the start of their 
meal if the patients couldn ’t com plete at l east 75% of their meal within 30 min utes). Pati ents 
will be considered ev aluable if they com pleted at least 75% of their meal before the 
administration of the study drug and the study  drug is administered between 30 to 45 minutes
after the start of the meal. For the fasted state, patients must fast (water only) for ≥10hours 
prior to taking a dose to ≥2hour post -dose.  For the fed state patients must fast overnight 
(minimum of 8 hours) pri or to consuming a standardised meal in the clinic.  The meal should 
consist of about 800 to 1000 total calories wit h around 54% of the cal orific content made up 
from fat.  The dose should be administered with 240 mL of water.  Refer to Appendix Ifor 
full details.
6.1.3 Definition of dose -limiting toxicity
DLTs will be evaluated during Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 of treatment.  Toxicit y will be graded 
according to the National Cancer Inst itute CTCAE v5.0.
A DLT is defined as an AE that occurs from the first dose of study treatment up to and 
including Cycle 1, Day 28(the DLT assessment period) that is assessed as unrelated to the 
disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and that, despite optimal therapeut ic 
intervent ions, m eets any of the fo llowing cri teria:

6.1.3.1 Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose and Recommended Phase II Dose
The MTD i s defined as the highest dose at which the predicted probabilit y of a DLT is l ess 
than 25% (for monotherapy) or 30% (for combinatio ns).  At least 6 evaluable pat ients are 
requi red to determine the MTD (refer to Section 6.1.2 for a detailed descri ption of  the 
Bayesian adapt ive design).
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001

MTD), MFD, PK, bio logical/clinical act ivity (PD data), as well as data bey ond Cycle 1 during 
dose escalat ions.
6.1.3.2 Definition of M aximum Feasible Dose
A dose and schedule will be considered to be the MFD and dose escalat ion will stop if:  
There i s evidence of saturation of absorption from emerging PK data that limit s the 
exposure
and/or
An MFD has been reached, based on a maximum nu mber of tablets per dose or day , or

6.1.4 Safety review committee
The SRC Remit document for this stu dy will define the exact membership and who will be 
present for decisio ns to be made. 
The SRC will guide all dose escalat ion and cohort expansio n decisio ns in this study .  The dose 
or schedule for subsequent cohorts or a decisio n to stop recruit ment will be agreed by the SRC 
after revi ew of the data from each cohort.  When there are other patients that are ongoing at 
the time a review is planned, the SRC should defer their decisio n until these further patients 
beco me evaluable.  The data which will be revi ewed at a dose decision meet ing includes (but

6.2 Preparation/handli ng/storage/accountability
The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature condit ions have been 
maintained during transit for all study  treatm ent received and any  discrepancies are reported 
and reso lved before use of the study  treatm ent.
Only patients enrolled in the study  may receive study  treatm ent and only authorised site staff 
may supply  or administer study  treatm ent.  All study  treatm ents m ust be stored in a secure, 
environmentally  controlled, and m onitored (m anual  or autom ated) area in accordance with the 
labelled storage conditions with access limit ed to the Invest igator and authorised site staff.
The Investigator, inst itution, or the head of the medical inst itution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study  treatm ent accountabilit y, reconciliat ion, and record maintenance 
(ie,recei pt, reconciliat ion, and final disposit ion records).
Further gui dance and information for the final disposit ion of unused study  treatm ent are

AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 57of 162In case of parallel recruit ment to Part A and Part B (in the combinat ion modules), a sui table 
patient all ocati on system  will be implemented to manage any potential bias.  
If an u nscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every  attem pt 
shoul d be made to perform  the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visit s.  Thi s 
schedule is to be fo llowed to minimise any  unintenti onal bias caused by  som e patient s being 
assessed at a different frequency  than other pati ents.
6.4 Treatment compliance
The first single dose of AZD7648 will be taken whilst the patient is in the clinic (Cycle 0, 
Day 1) and the administration of this dose will be recorded in the appropriate section o f the 
CRF.
From  Cycle 1 onwards, pati ents will  self-administer AZD7648.  All pat ients will be required 
to com plete a Pati ent Di ary, which must be returned to the clinic for review at each visit.  The 
Patient Diary  will contain detailed instruction s on how to take the study  treatm ent.  The 
patient shoul d be instructed to record the date and time that all dose(s) of AZD7648 were 
taken in the Patient Diary.  If a dose is missed, the reason must be noted in the Patient Diary.  
The em ergency  address and telephone number shoul d be wri tten on a Patient Diary  and the 
patient will be instructed to keep this in their possessio n at all t imes.  A copy  of the Pati ent 
Diary is provided in the study  reference materials.
Study  site staff will make tablet counts at regular intervals during treatment.  Compliance will 
be assessed by  the tablet count and the informat ion will be recorded in the appropriate section 
of the CRF.  After the tablet count has been performed, the remaining tablets will not be 
returned to the p atient but will be retained by the investigative site unt il reconciliat ion is 
completed by  the study  monitor.  All pati ents m ust return their bottle(s) of AZD7648 at the 
appropriate scheduled visit, when a new bottle will be dispensed.  Patients will be in structed to 
notify study  site personnel of missed doses.  Dates of missed or held doses will be recorded by  
the pati ent on their Patient Diary  and by the site staff on the CRF.
Patients m ust return all containers and any  remaining tablets at the end of the study .
Any change fro m the dosing schedule, does interruptions, dose reductions, dose 
discontinuat ions shoul d be recorded in the CRF.
The Investigat ional Product Storage Manager is responsible for managing the study  treatm ent 
from receipt by  the study  site unt il the destruction or return of all unused study treatment.  The 
Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that the patient has returned all unused study  
treatm ent.

CYP3A4 activity (potent/strong inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A 4).  The required washout period prior to starting 
study treatment is 3 weeks (5 weeks for enzalutamide or 
phenobarbital) until 28 days after the last dose of study 
treatment
See also Appendix F
Live virus and bacterial vaccines Prohibited whilst the patient is receiving study treatment 
and during the 28 -day follow -up period
6.5.1 Other concomitant treatment
Other medication other than that described above, which is considered necessary  for the 
patient’s safet y and wellbeing, may be given at the discret ion of the Invest igator and recorded 
in the appropriate sections of the CRF.
If the Investigator, based on his medical judgement, feels that medications described above are 
essent ial to pati ent's wellbeing, such products may be administered with caut ion following 
discussio n between the Investigator and the AZ Study  Physician.
Patients who are taking warfarin may participate in this study ; however, it is recommended 
that INR be monitored carefully at least once per week for the first month, then mo nthly if the 
INR is stable.  Subcutaneous heparin, low mo lecular weight heparin, and new oral  
anticoagulants ( NOACs )are permitted.  The use of granulocy te-colony st imulat ing factor 
(G-CSF) is not permitted for primary prophylaxis or secondary  prophylaxis during Cycle 0 or 
Cycle 1 (unl ess deemed by  the invest igator that this is essent ial to the patient’s well -being).  If 
requi red for secondary  prophylaxis from  Cycle 2 onwards, thi s should be administered 
following discussio n between the Investigator and the AZ Study Physician.
6.5.2 Support m edication
There i s no anti dote m edicat ion for AZD7648; restri cted m edicati ons are described in 
Appendix F.  Rescue medicat ion for PLD in Combinat ion Module1will fo llow the l ocal 
label.
The use of rescue medicat ions is allowable at any  time during the study .  The date and time of 
rescue m edicati on administrat ion as well as the name and dosage regimen o f the rescue 
medicat ion must be recorded in the CRF.

necessary  to provi de adequate prophylact ic or supportive care, except for tho se medicat ions 
ident ified as “prohibited,” as described in Table 5), are to be administered as prescribed by  the 
Invest igator. 
Best supportive care, including antibi otics, nutri tional support, correction of metabolic 
disorders, optimal symptom control, and pain management (including palliat ive radiotherapy) 
shoul d be used for all pat ients, when necessary . 
Inact ivated viruses, such as those in the influenza vaccine are permitted during the study. 
AstraZeneca recommends avo iding administering COVID -19 vaccinat ion for 72hours prior to 
administration of the first dose of study  drug, or during the dose -limiting toxicit y period, to 
avoid biases in the interpretation of safety data due to the potential overlap of vaccine -related 
AEs with study  drug -related AEs.
6.6 Dose modification
Details o f dose escalat ion can be found in Sect ion6.1.2.
Study  treatm ent will be repeated in 28 -day cycles.  The dosing criteria for Day 1 of a new 
cycle of  study  treatm ent (bl ood tests shoul d be reviewed pri or to dosing) and continuat ion of 
treatm ent are:
ANC ≥1500 cells/mm3(≥1.5 x 109/L)
platelets ≥75,000/mm3(≥75 x 109/L)
If a patient experiences a clinically significant and/or unacceptable toxicit y (including a DLT) 
study  treatm ent will be interrupted (and appropriate treatment adm inistered) for a maximum 
of 28days unt il reso lution of the toxicit ies to the patient’s baseline or until improvement 
(CTCAE Grade ≤2) (Table 6).  Clinically  signifi cant abnorm al laboratory  values m ust be 
repeated at regular intervals unt il resolved to the patient’s baseline or until improvement 
(CTCAE Grade ≤2).  If the patient is showing clinical benefit and the toxicit y resolves to the 
patient’s baseline or until improvement (CTCAE Grade ≤2), treatment can be restarted; 
guidelines are provided below for dose modificat ions (Table 7).
If the toxicit y does not resolve to the patient’s baseline or to CTCAE Grade ≤2 within 
28days of onset, treatment with AZD7648 must be discont inued.

Patients enrolled into the first 3 dose cohorts are permitted to dose reduce to the previous dose cohort, but must 
discontinue if a dose reduction is required in the first dose level.
6.7 Treatment afte r the end of the study
Patients are permitted to either receive standard of care therapy , or to continue to receive 
study  treatm ent following the end of the study  if, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, they  are 
continuing to receive benefit fro m treatm ent.  After di scontinuati on of  study  treatm ent, the 
Invest igator will be at liberty to define further the most appropriate ant i-cancer treatment.  
Subsequent anti -cancer treatment is expected to be init iated fo llowing the cancer recurrence or 
development of a new cancer.  Informat ion on subsequent anti -cancer therapi es shoul d be

PATIENT WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of study treatment
Patients m ay be di scontinued from study  treatm ent in t he following si tuations.  Note that 
discontinuat ion from study  treatm ent is NOT the sam e as a com plete wi thdrawal from  the 
study :
Disease progressi on (confirmed progression or symptomat ic deterioration or confirmed 
progression by  RECIST cri teria).
Adverse event, eg, study  treatm ent-related toxicit y that fail to recover to CTCAE

Patient or Invest igator decisio n.  The patient is at any t ime free to discont inue treatment, 
without prej udice to further treatment.
Pregnancy.
Non-compliance wi th the CSP (Invest igator or patient).
Patients incorrectly init iated on study treatm ent.
Unexpected, significant or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in the study .
Lack of evaluable and/or complete data.
Decisio n to m odify  the devel opment pl an of the drug.
Sponsor terminat ion of study  due to unfavourable risk-benefit.
See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of treatment discont inuat ion and fo llow-up 
and for any  further evaluat ions that need to be completed.
7.1.1 Temporary discontinuation
See Secti on6.6for further details on study  treatm ent interrupti ons.
7.1.2 Rechallenge
See Secti on6.6for further details on study  treatm ent interrupti ons.
7.1.3 Procedures for discontinuation of study treatm ent
The Investigator should instruct the patient to contact the site before or at the time if study 
treatm ent is stopped.  A patient that decides to discontinue study  treatm ent will always be 
asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The date of last intake of study  
treatm ent shoul d be docum ented in the CRF.  All study  treatm ent shoul d be returned by  the 
patient at thei r next on -site study  visit or unscheduled visit.  Patients permanent ly

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 63of 162discont inuing study  treatm ent shoul d be given locally  available standard of care therapy , at the 
discreti on of  the Investi gator.
Discontinuati on of  study  treatm ent, f or any  reason, does not impact on the patient’s 
participat ion in the study.  The patient should c ontinue attending subsequent study  visits and 
data collect ion shoul d continue according to the study  protocol .  If the pati ent does not agree 
to con tinue in -person study  visit s, a m odified foll ow-up m ust be arranged to ensure the 
collect ion of endpo ints and safet y informat ion.  This could be a telephone contact with the 
patient, a contact wi th a relative or treating physician, or information fro m medical records.  
The approach taken should be recorded in the medical records.  A patient that agrees to 
modified follow-up is not considered to have withdrawn consent or to have withdrawn fro m 
the study .
7.2 Lost to follow -up
A patient will be considered potentially  lost to f ollow -up if he or she fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by  the study  site.
The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study  
visit:
The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the pat ient on the importa nce of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule.
Before a patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the patient or next of kin by eg, repeat telephone 
calls, certified letter to the patie nt’s last known m ailing address or local equivalent 
methods.  These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical 
record.
Efforts to reach the patient should continue unt il the end of the study.  Should the 
patient be unreachable at the en d of the study  the pati ent shoul d be considered lost to 
follow-up wi th unknown vital status at end of study  and censored at l atest follow -up 
contact.
7.3 Withdrawal from the study
A pat ient may wi thdraw from  the study  (eg, wi thdraw consent), at any  time (study treatm ent 
and assessments) at his/her own request, without prejudice to further treatment.
A pat ient who considers withdrawing from the study  must be inform ed by  the Invest igator 
about m odified fo llow-up opti ons (eg, tel ephone contact, a contact with a re lative or treating 
physician, or informat ion from medical records).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 64of 162If the patient withdraws consent for disclo sure of future informat ion, the Sponsor may retain 
and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent.
If a patient withd raws fro m the study , he/she may  request destructi on of  any samples taken, 
and the Investigator must document this in the site study records.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AE.  The Invest igator will follow up patients as medically indicated . 
AstraZeneca or its delegate will request Invest igators to collect informat ion on pati ents’ vital 
status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at the end of the study  from publicly 
available sour ces, in accordance with local regulat ions.  Knowledge o f the vital status at study  
end in all patients is crucial for the integrit y of the study .
See SoA for data to be collected at the time of study  discontinuat ion and fo llow-up and for 
any further evalua tions that need to be completed.  All study  treatm ent shoul d be returned by  
the pati ent.
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA.
The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the CRF.  The Web Based Data Capture 
system  will be used for data collect ion and query  handling. 
The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the prov ision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study  Agreement.  The 
Invest igator will sign the completed CRF.  A copy of the completed CRF will be archived at 
the study  site.
Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the Sponsor immed iately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient should continue or discontinue study 
treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the SoA, is essent ial 
and required for study  conduct.
All screening eva luations must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential pat ients 
meet all eligibilit y criteria.  The Investi gator will maintain a screening log to record details of 
all patients screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.

AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 65of 162Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management (eg, blood coun t)
and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline purposes 
provi ded the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the 
time frame defined in the SoA.
The number of samples taken, as well as the vo lume required for each analysis, may  be 
changed during the study  as emerging data beco me available.  However, the estimated total 
volume of blood that will be drawn fro m each pat ient in this study during screening and the 
first cy cle of  treatm ent will not exceed approximately 350 mL (over a 1 month peri od).  Any 
additional requirements are specified within the relevant section ofCombinat ionModul e 1.  
Safety laboratory  assessments will be performed lo cally at each centre ’s laboratory  by means 
of their established methods.  Therefore, the number of samples/blood volumes is pat ient to 
site-specific change.
8.1 Efficacy assessments
8.1.1 Tumour assessmen ts by CT or MRI
RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable and non -measurable TLs and non -target l esions 
(NTLs) and the object ive tumour response criteria are presented in Appendix Hof this 
protocol .
At baseline, the imaging modalit ies used for assessment should be contrast enhanced 
computed tom ography  (CT) (m agnet ic resonance imaging [MRI] where CT is 
contraindicated) scans of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis (includi ng liver and adrenal 
glands) and shoul d encom pass all  areas of known predilect ion for metastases in the disease 
under evaluat ion, and should addit ionally  invest igate areas that may be invo lved based on 
signs and symptoms of individual patients.  Follow -up CT or MRI assessments will cover 
chest, abdomen and pelvis wit h any  other regi ons imaged at baseline where disease was 
present.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately 
imaged.  A CT/MRI scan of the brain should be pe rform ed in all patients at the main screen.
Radiological examinat ions performed in the conduct of this study  shoul d be retained at site as 
source data.  All treatment decisio ns will be based on site assessment of scans.  Baseline 
radiological  assessments s hould be perform ed no m ore than 28 days before the start of study  
treatm ent, and i deally shoul d be performed as close as possible to the start of study  treatment.  
Scans obtained as part of standard clinical pract ice, prior to informed consent, but within the 
28-day period are acceptabl e.  The radio logical confi rmatory  scans shoul d be perform ed no 
less than 4 weeks after the prior assessment of tumour and preferably at the next scheduled 
visit (in the absence o f clinically significant deterioration).
The m ethods of  assessment used at baseline should be used at each subsequent fo llow-up 
assessment through to object ive confirmed radio logical disease progression, as defined by 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66of 162RECIST 1.1 and as determined by the Invest igator.  Tumour assessments should be perfo rmed 
every 8 weeks (2 cy cles) (± 1week) or earlier, if disease progression is suspected.  If a patient 
discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent cancer therapy ) prior to progressi on then 
the pati ent shoul d cont inue to be fo llowed (unless they w ithdraw consent) until confirmed 
objective disease progression, as defined by RECIST 1.1.  Scans confirming progression 
shoul d not be conducted wi thin 1 week after a progressio n biopsy to allow for reduction in 
inflammat ion.
If scans are performed outside of scheduled visit window interval and the patient has not 
progressed, every  attem pt shoul d be m ade to perform  the subsequent scans at their scheduled 
visits whilst the patient remains on study  treatm ent.  If the pati ent interrupts treatment or 
incurs a tr eatment delay, scans should continue to occur at the protocol -defined frequency.
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely  as possible.  Pl ease refer to the 
SoA.
8.1.2 Tumour evaluation
Categorisat ion of object ive tumour response assessment wi ll be based on the RECIST 1.1 
criteria of response: CR, PR, and SD (see Appendix H).  The CR and PR will need to be 
confirmed.  In addit ion, the object ive tumour res ponse assessment will also be assessed for 
exploratory  analysis on a m odified RECIST 1.1 (mRECIST) criteria considering progression 
only when confirmed.  The mRECIST will not be used for the Core Module or Combination 
Module 1, but will be used if any  immu ne onco logy (IO) combinat ion modules are added to 
the study  in the future.  TL progression will be calculated in comparison to when the tumour 
burden was at a minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study ).  In the 
absence of progress ion, tum our response will be calculated in comparison to the pre -dose 
tumour m easurements obtained before starting treatment.
If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly wit h 
response to NTLs or the appearance o f a new lesio n, it is advisable to continue treatment until 
the Invest igator reassesses the patient’s status at the next scheduled assessment (confirmat ion) 
or sooner if clinically indicated.
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ based on non -target di sease, th ere m ust be an overall 
level of substant ial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of 
therapy .  A m odest increase in the size of 1 or m ore NTLs i s usually not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal disease progression status.
If repeated scans confirm progression, then the date of the init ial scan should be declared as 
the date of progression.  All RECIST assessment images will be reviewed at site.  Duplicates 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 67of 162may be collected and stored by  an AstraZeneca appointed representative, and sent for 
independent central RECIST review, if deemed appropriate.
8.1.3 Survival assessment
In Part B of Combinat ion Modul e1, survival status will be obt ained for all pat ients who 
receive study  treatm ent.  Vi tal status (dead or alive; date of death) will be collected every  
3months (±1 week) post -permanent discont inuat ion of study  treatm ent.  To ai d the 
interpretati on of  the survival  analysis, the use of s ubsequent anti -cancer therapi es, after 
discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent, will also be recorded on the CRF.
Survival status will cont inue to be collected until the earlier of 12 months after the last patient 
has di scontinued treatm ent in a given m odule or75% of patients have died in the module.  
The patient does not have to attend the clinic for the assessment to be carried out; it can either 
be done via a telephone call, or through a review of the pat ient’s notes, or using public 
records.  If the site be comes aware that a patient has died prior to the final analysis, the 
relevant CRF on the database should be co mpleted at that time.
8.2 Safety assessments
Planned time po ints for all safet y assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.2.1 Clinical safety laboratory assess ments
See Table 8for the list of clinical safet y laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.  All protocol -requi red laboratory  assessments, as defined in the 
table, must be c onducted in accordance with the Laboratory  Manual and the SoA.
The Investigator should assess the available results with regard to clinically relevant 
abnorm alities.  The l aboratory  resul ts shoul d be signed and dated and retained at centre as 
source data for laboratory  variables.
For informat ion on how AEs based on laboratory  tests shoul d be recorded and reported, see 
Secti on8.3.7 .  Further details on CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 l aboratory  values defined as DLTs can 
be found in Sect ion6.1.3 .  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  values m ust be repeated 
at regular intervals unt il reso lved to the patient’s baseline or to CTCAE Grade ≤2.  
Addit ional safet y samples may  be collected if clinically indicated at the discret ion of the 
Invest igator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units and reference ranges) will 
be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
The haematol ogy, coagul ation, clinical chemistry , and urinalysis will be performed at the local 
laboratory  (a copy  of laboratory  reports will be available as source data).

8.2.3 Body weight
Body  weight will be recorded at each visit as indicated in the SoA.  
8.2.4 Vital signs
Oral temperature (in degrees Celsius), pulse rate, respiratory  rate, and blood pressure will 
be assessed.
Blood pres sure and pulse measurements will be assessed in supine or sitting position wit h 
a com pletely  autom ated device.  Manual techniques will be used only  if an autom ated 
device is not available.
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by  at least 5minutes of rest 
for the patient in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, televisio n, mobile phones).
Vital signs (to be taken before blood collect ion for laboratory  tests) will  consist of one
pulse rate measurement, oneblood pressure measurement, and onetemperature 
measurement.
Vital signs will  be measured pri or to ECG and PK blood draws at all PK sample 
timepo ints.  Timepo ints may be m odified based on init ial data obtained.
8.2.5 Electrocardiograms
In Part A: triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be obtained for all timepo ints using an ECG 
machine that automat ically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc 
intervals.  For triplicate ECG measurements, 3 individual ECG tracings should be 
obtained in successio n, no more than 2 minutes apart.  The full set of tri plicates should be 
completed wi thin 5 minutes.
In Part B, triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be obtained for screening only, at all other 
timepo ints a single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained.
ECGs will be obtained after the patient has been resting.  A ll ECGs should be recorded 
with the pati ent in the same physical posit ion.
ECGs will be measured after vital signs and prior to PK blood draws at all PK sample 
timepo ints.  Timepo ints may be m odified based on init ial data obtained.
8.2.6 Performance status
The patient’s perform ance status will be assessed at screening using the ECOG PS scale.  
Patients m ust have an ECOG PS of 0 to 1 to be eligible for enrolment.
These scales and criteria are used by doctors and researchers to assess how a patient's disease 
is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily  living abilit ies of the patient, and 
determine appropriate treatment and prognosis ( Oken etal1982 , see Table 9).

8.3 Collection of adverse events
The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study  are 
familiar wit h the content of this sect ion.
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B.
AE will be r eported by  the pati ent (or, when appropri ate, by  a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
patient's l egally authorised representative).
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, document ing, and recording 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE.  For informat ion on how to follow -up AEs 
see Section 8.3.3 .
8.3.1 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal quest ioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
8.3.2 Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information
AEs will be co llected fro m time of signature of ICF through out the treatment period and 
including the 28 -day follow-up visit after treatment discont inuat ion. 
All SAEs will be recorded from the time of signing of ICF unt il the 28 -day follow-up visit 
after treatm ent discont inuat ion.  Only SAEs related to the study  treatm ent and/or procedure 
will be recorded thereafter (during the progression fo llow-up). 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 71of 162All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as 
indicated in Appendix B.  The Invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of it being available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study pat ients.  However, 
if the Invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient’s last visit 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study  treatm ent or study  
participat ion, the Invest igator may notify the Sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for complet ing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix B.
8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively fo llow each pat ient 
at subsequent visits/contacts.  All events will be followed until reso lution, stabilizat ion, the 
event i s otherwise explained, or the pati ent is lost to foll ow-up.
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study  are f ollowed up 
by the Invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the 
CRF.  AstraZeneca retains the rig ht to request additional information for any  patient wi th 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
8.3.4 AE data collection
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
Adverse event (verbat im)
The date and time when the AE st arted and stopped
The CTCAE grade (v5.0) and changes in CTCAE grade with the date they changed
Whether the AE is serious or not
Invest igator causalit y rating against the Investigat ional Product(s) (y es or no)
Action taken with regard to study  treatm ent
Adverse event caused patient’s wit hdrawal fro m study  (yes or no)
Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
Date AE m et cri teria for SAE
Date Invest igator became aware of SAE
Adverse event is serious due to
Date of hospi talisat ion
Date of discharge

Date of death (as applicable)
Autopsy  performed (as applicable)
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion
8.3.5 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between study treatment and each AE, and
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y that 
the event may have been caused by the study  treatment?’
For SAEs, ca usal relationship will also be assessed for other medicat ions and study  
procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Bto the CSP.
8.3.6 AEs based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati entor reported in response to the open question 
from the study  site staff ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you w ere 
last asked?’ or revealed by observation will be co llected and recorded in the CRF.  When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when p ossible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
8.3.7 AEs based on exami nations and tests
The results from the CSP mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be summarised in the 
CSR.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory  values, vi tal 
signs and clinical safet y laboratory  tests shoul d there fore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfil 
any of the criteria for a SAE, a DLT or are the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with the 
investigat ional product.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and sy mptom s, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemi a versus l ow haem oglobin value).  
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73of 162Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to disease progressio n, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease progression (see Section 8.3.9 ).
8.3.8 Hy’s law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f AST or ALT ≥3xULN together with TBL ≥2xULN may  need to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix Efor further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry  and eva luation of HL.
8.3.9 Disease progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condit ion attributable to 
the disease for which the study  treatm ent is being studied.  It may  be an increase in the 
severit y of the disease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms o f the disease.  The 
development of new, or progression of exist ing metastasis to the primary cancer under study
shoul d be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events which are unequivocally 
due to di sease progr ession should not be reported as an AE during the study .
8.3.10 New cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE.  New primary  cancers are 
those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study  treatm ent and have 
been id entified after the patient’s inclusio n in this study.  They do not include metastases of 
the original cancer.
8.3.11 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the study  treatm ent peri od, or wi thin the protocol -defined 
follow-up period after the administration of the last dose of study  treatm ent, m ust be reported 
as fo llows:
Death cl early  resul ting fro m disease progression should be reported to the study  
Invest igator at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the CRF in the 
Statem ent of Death page.  It sh ould not be reported as an SAE.
Where death is not due (or not clearly  due) to progressio n of the disease under study , the 
AE causing the death must be reported to the study Invest igator as an SAE within 
24hours.  It should also be documented in the State ment of Death page in the CRF.  The 
report should contain a comment regarding the co -involvement of disease progression, if 
appropriate, and should assign main and contributory  causes of death.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74of 162Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an S AE.  It should also be 
docum ented in the Statem ent of Death page in the CRF.  A post -mortem may be helpful 
in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed, a copy  of the post -mortem 
resul ts shoul d be f orwarded to AstraZeneca Pat ient Safet y or itsrepresentative within the 
usual t imeframe.
Deaths occurring after the protocol -defined safet y follow-up period or after the administration 
of the l ast dose of study  treatm ent shoul d be documented in the Statement of Death page.  If 
the death occurred as a resul t of an AE that started post the defined safet y follow-up peri od 
and the AE is considered to be due to a late onset toxicit y to study treatm ent, then i t shoul d 
also be reported as an SAE with an outcome of death.
8.4 Safety reporting and medical manageme nt
8.4.1 Reporting of SAEs
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the study  
treatm ent, or to the study  procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then Invest igators or o ther site personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 
24hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all t he 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site within 
1calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately .  Investi gators or other site personnel inform 
AstraZeneca representatives of any  follow-up informat ion on a previously  reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes 
aware of it .
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the CRF, an 
autom ated em ail alert is sent from  the el ectroni c data capture sy stem  to the desi gnated 
AstraZeneca representative.
If the electronic data capture sy stem  is not available, then the Investigator or other study  site 
staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investi gator/study  site staff how to proceed.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix Bof the CSP.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75of 1628.4.2 Pregnancy
All pregnan cies and outcomes of pregnancy  should be reported to AstraZeneca except for:
If the pregnancy  is discovered before the study  patient has received any study treatment
If a pregnancy  is reported, the Invest igator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy.
Abnorm al pregnancy outcom es (eg, spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopi c pregnancy ) are considered SAEs.
8.4.2.1 Maternal Exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study , study  treatm ent shoul d be 
discontinued immediately but the patient will remain in the study .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that the study  treatm ent 
may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. Congenital 
anomalies/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion,ectopi c pregnancy, norm al 
birth, or congenital anomaly ) shoul d be f ollowed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued fro m the study .
If any pregnancy  occurs during the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropri ate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day  ie, immediately
but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is prov ided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 
5calendar days for SAEs (see Section 8.4.1 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.
8.4.2.2 Paternal Exposure
Inform ation on the pregnancy  of a pati ent’s partner must be obtained direct ly from the 
patient’s partner.  Therefore, prior to obtaining information on the pregnancy, the Invest igator 
must obtain the consent of the patient’s partner.
Male patients must refrain fro m fathering a child or donating sperm during the study  and f or 
90 day s following the l ast dose of study  treatm ent.
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not consid ered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth ,
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 76of 162or congenital anomaly) shoul d, if possible, be followed up and documented.  To capture 
inform ation about a pregnancy from the partner of a male patient, consent must be obtained 
from the male pat ient’s partner in order to collect informat ion related to the pregnancy and 
outcom e; the m ale pat ient shoul d not be asked to provide this informat ion.  A consent form 
specific t o this situation must be used.
The outcome o f any concept ion occurring fro m the date of the first dose until 90 days after the 
last dose of study  treatm ent shoul d be fo llowed up and docum ented.
8.4.3 Overdose
For thi s study , any dose of AZD7648 in excess of thos e specified in the protocol will be 
considered an overdose.  Further details on the combinat ion treatments can be found in the 
relevant combination module protocol.
There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of AZD7648 and possible 
symptoms of overdose are not established.
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose CRF m odule.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study  treatm ent occurs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives 
immediately , or no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of i t.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting t imelines a pply, see 
Secti on8.3.2 .  For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days.
8.4.4 Medication error
If a medicat ion error occurs during the study ,then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately  but no l ater 
than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Inves tigator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 (Init ial Fatal /Life -Threatening or follow -up 
Fatal /Life -Threatening) or 5 (other serious init ial and fo llow-up) cal endar days if there is an 
SAE associated with the medicat ion error (see Sectio n8.3.2 ) and within 30 days for all other 
medicat ion errors.

8.5 Pharmacokinetics
Venous blood samples (2 mL) for determination of concentrations of AZD7648 and the 
potenti al metaboli tes (if  any) in plasma will be taken at times presented in Table 10.  Sam ples 
will be split to provide plasma for the primary analysis and secondary/backup analyses.  The 
backup sample may be used for the metabo lite identification work.  B lood and urine samples 
for PK analysis will be co llected as specified belo w (Table 10) and in the SoA ( Table 1).
Full details o f sample handling procedures, storage and shipping will be provided in the lab 
manual.  The date and time of co llection of each sample will be recorded.
Urine samples (~10 mL) for the determinat ion of AZD764 8 concentration will be taken fro m 
the total urine sample provided during each of the collect ion intervals.  The date and time of 
collect ion and the vo lume of each total urine collection will be recorded.  Approximately 
50mL of the urine sample may also b e used to i dentify metabo lites, if any . 
Results will only  be reported for sam ples shipped wi thin a t imeframe for which the stabilit y of 
AZD7648 in the samples has been validated and shown to be acceptable.
All patients start with a single dose of AZD7648 to fully  profile the PK of AZD7648, 
followed by an approximately 3 to 7 day washout.  If the half -life of AZD7648 is shorter than 
expected the washout period can be shortened or may not be required at all.  
Pharmacokinet ic samples will be taken at the times indicated in Table 10.

samples at pre -dose and 1 hour on the day of esc alation (Cycle X, Day 1) and after one cy cle 
(Cycle X+1, Day 1) of  escalat ion will be obtained.  Other PK time points maybe added as 
appropriate based on the emerging PK data.
PK Window
The fo llowing time windows will be allo wed: 
5minutes (min) for sampl es taken up to 1 hour (h) post -dose
10min for sam ples taken between 2 and 9 h
1h for samples taken between 10 and 24 h post -dose
2h for samples taken between 25 and 72 h
The timing of the PK samples may be adjusted during the study , dependent on emerging data, 
in order to ensure appropriate characterisat ion of the plasma concentration -time profiles.  
After 2 or m ore cohorts have been completed the timing of later PK samples will be 
re-assessed based on emerging PK data and the desire to characteri se 80% of the AUC in all 
patients.  The total  number of samples taken from each patient will not exceed that presented 
in Table 10.
If a patient misses any doses of A ZD7648 within 3 day s of PK sampling, the Invest igator 
shoul d contact the AstraZeneca PK representative as to any  effect on the changes required on 
the timing of the PK assessments.  All other assessments, including laboratory  safet y 
assessments, vital sign s and RECIST should continue to be performed as per study  plan, 
relative to baseline assessments.

a Measurable disease is defined as having at least one measurable target lesion, not previously irradiat ed, which 
is ≥10mm in the longest diameter (LD) (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥15mm)
9.4 Statistical analyses
The stati stical analyses will be performed by Parexel or other designated third -party  provi ders, 
under the direct ion of the Bios tatistics Group, AstraZeneca.  Further detail will be provided in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87of 162Data from each part/module will be presented separately.  All pat ients who undergo 
intra-patient dose escal ation will be analysed & reported as per thei r starting dose. 
Methods common to all modules are detailed belo w.
Demographic Data
Characteristics of the patients, including medical history  and di sease characteri stics at baseline 
will be listed for each pat ient and summarised by cohort.
Reasons for discont inuat ion of study  treatment will be listed including the study  day of 
treatm ent discont inuat ion and will be summarised by cohort.
Exposure
Exposure to each study  treatm ent, i e, total  amount of  study  treatm ent received will be listed 
for all patients.
Total  treatm ent durati on (=date of l ast dose minus date of first dose + 1) and actual treatment 
durati on (=total  treatm ent durati on excluding dose interruptions not in accordance with the 
protocol ) will  be summarised for each study  treatment and cohort by  the following: m ean, 
standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median,and number of observat ions.  In addit ion, 
the number and percentage of pat ients with at least 1 non -protocolled dose interruption and at 
least 1 dose reduction will be presented separately  for the init ial period of evaluabilit y defined 
as 28 days and for any  time following thi s initial period of  the study .
9.4.1 Efficacy analyses
These are secondary variables.
The efficacy assessment of Part A (dose escalat ion) will be done using ORR.  All efficac y 
endpo ints will be used in Part B (expansio ns) efficacy  assessment.
Tumour Response Data
Data will be summarised for dosed patients with measurable disease at baseline and separately 
for dosed pati ents with abaseline tumour assessment , unless otherwise s pecified .
Data will be listed and summarised by cohort using the fo llowing response categories: CR, 
PR, SD, disease progression and not evaluable (NE).
Waterfall plots (bar charts) indicating the percentage best change fro m baseline in sum o f the 
diameters of TLs m ay be produced by  cohort.
Tumour response includes the following variables:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88of 162Percentage best change in TL
Durati on of  response 
PFS 
ORR
Derivat ion of tumour response variables
Every  8 weeks (2 cy cles), or earlier if disease progressio n is suspect ed, patients will be 
programmat ically assigned a RECIST visit response of CR, PR, SD, and disease progression 
depending on the status of their disease compared to baseline and previous assessments.
Progression of TLs will be calculated in comparison to whe n the tum our burden was at a 
minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters previously recorded during the study ).  In the absence 
of progressi on, tum our response (CR, PR, SD) will be calculated in comparison to the baseline 
tumour m easurements obtained before sta rting treatm ent.
If a patient has had a tumour assessment, which cannot be evaluated, then the patient will be 
assigned a response of NE unless there is evidence of progression in which case the response 
will be assigned as disease progression.
For TL meas urements, if ⅓ of the TL sizes are missing then a scaling up rule will be applied 
as fo llows:
If ≤ ⅓ of  lesions recorded at baseline are missing then the results will be scaled up (based 
on the baseline sizes) to give an est imated sum of diameters and this will be used in 
calculat ions (thi s is equivalent to comparing the visit sum of diameters of the non-missing
lesions to the baseline sum of diameters excluding the lesio ns that are missing and 
determining at what rate the lesio ns are changing).
If > ⅓ of l esions recorded at baseline are missing, then the TL response will be NE.  
However, if the sum of non -missing TL diameters would result in disease progression 
(ie,if using a value of 0 for missing lesio ns the sum o f diameters has st ill increased by 
>20% or more com pared to the sm allest sum  of diam eters on study ), disease progression 
takes precedence over NE.
A response of CR will not be allowed if any  of the TL data are missing.
Percentage Best Change in TL
Percentage change in tumour size will be determined for patients with measurable disease at 
baseline and is derived at each visit by the percentage change in the sum of the diameters of 
TLs.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89of 162Duration of Response
Durati on of  response is defined as the time from the date of first documented respons e (which 
is subsequent ly confirmed) unt il date of documented progression or death in the absence of 
disease progressi on (ie, date of PFS event or censoring –date of first response +1).  The end 
of response shoul d coincide wi th the date of progressio n or death fro m any cause used for the 
PFS endpo int.
The time of the init ial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contribut ing towards 
the first visit that was PR or CR that was subsequent ly confirmed.  If a patient does not 
progress following a response, then their duration of response will use the PFS censoring time.
PFS
PFS i s defined as the time from first dose of any study  treatm ent at Cycle1 unt il the date of 
objective disease progression or death (by  any cause in the absence of progression ) regardl ess 
of whether the patient withdraws fro m study  therapy  or receives another anti -cancer therapy  
prior to progression (ie, date of PFS event or censoring –date of first dose +1).  Patients who 
have not progressed or died at the time of analysis w ill be censored at the time of the latest 
date of assessment fro m their last evaluable RECIST assessment.  However, if the patient 
progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visit s, the patient will be censored at the time of the 
latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment prior to the 2 missed visits.
ORR
ORR will be assessed per RECIST criteria .  ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who 
have a confirmed visit response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression (as defined 
by RECIST 1.1).  Note tha t responses that occur after the start of subsequent anti -cancer 
therapy  must be excluded from  the derivat ion of ORR.
A visit response of CR is defined when all TLs and NTLs present at baseline have disappeared 
(with the except ion of lymph nodes which must be <10mm to be considered non patho logical) 
and no new lesio ns have developed since baseline.  A visit response of PR is defined when the 
sum of diameters of the TLs has decreased by 30% or more compared to baseline (wit h no 
evidence of progression) and t he NTLs are at least stable with no evidence of new lesions.
In the case of SD, measurements should have met the SD criteria at least once after the study  
start.
When the Investigator reassesses the progression of the pat ient at a l ater date, the date of t he 
initial scan shoul d be declared as the date of progressio n if the repeat scans confirm 
progression.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 90of 162Overall Survival
Overall survival is defined as the time from first dose of any study  treatm ent at Cy cle1 unt il 
death due to any  cause regardl ess of whether the patient withdraws from study  treatm ent or 
receives another anti-cancer therapy  (ie, date of death or censoring –date of first dose +1).  
Any pat ient not kn own to have died at the time of analysis w ill be censored based on the last 
recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. 
Survival calls will be made in the week fo llowing the date of DCO for the analysis, and if 
patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date these patients will 
be censored at the date of DCO.
9.4.2 Safety analyses
These are primary  variables.
All safet y analyses will be performed on the safet y analysis set.  All patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of study  treatm ent will be included in the as sessment of the safety  profile.  At the 
end of the study , appropri ate summaries of all safety  data will be produced, as defined below.
Data from all cycles of init ial treatment will be combined in the presentation of safet y data.  
AEs will be listed indivi dually  by pati ent and cohort.  For patients who have a dose 
modificati on, all AEs (due to drug or otherwise) will be assigned to the init ial dose group.  
The number of pat ients experiencing each AE will be summarised by the Medical Dict ionary 
for Regul atory Activit ies (MedDRA) system organ class, MedDRA preferred term and 
CTCAE grade.  The number and percentage of patients with AEs in different categories 
(eg,causally related, CTCAE Grade ≥3 etc) will be summarised by dose regimen, and events 
in each cate gory will be further summarised by  MedDRA system  organ cl ass and preferred 
term, by dose group.  SAEs will be summarised separately .
Any AE occurring before the first dose of study  treatm ent (ie, before study  Day 1) will  be 
included in the data list ings bu t will not be included in the summary  tables of AEs.  
Treatment -emergent AEs occurring prior to first dose of invest igational product (ie, before 
study  Day 1) which subsequently worsen in severity fo llowing dosing will be included in the 
summary tables.
Any AE occurring wit hin the defined 28 -day follow-up period after discont inuat ion of study  
treatm ent will be included in the AE summaries.  Any AEs in this period that occur after a 
patient has received further therapy  for cancer (fo llowing discont inuat ion of study  treatm ent) 
will be flagged in the data list ings.  AEs occurring after the 28 -day follow-up peri od af ter 
discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent will be listed separately, but not included in the summaries.

Statistical Analysis Methods for Assessment of Pharmacokinetic Food Effect
To evaluate the effect of food on the PK obtained after dosing with AZD7648 tablet, the 
primary  PK param eters will  be analy sed using a linear mixed Effects model with treatment 
(fed/fasted) as a fixed effect and patient as a random effect to compare AUC0 -t and Cm ax in 
the fed state with AUC0 -t and Cm ax in the fasted state respectively. Log -transform ation of 
exposure measurements (AUC0 -t and Cm ax) will be performed prior to analysis. The po int 
estimate and 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geo metric means for fed and fasted 
states will be provided. The food effect on a log scale (fed –fasted) and its upper and lower 
confidence limit s will be exponent ially back transformed to (and presented in) the linear scale.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 99of 16211 INTRODUCTION
Combinat ion Modul e 1will invest igate the safet y, tolerabilit y, and preliminary efficacy  of 
AZD7648 administered in combinat ion with PLD.
11.1 Study rationale
Doxorubi cin is an inhibitor of topoiso merase -II that generates topoi somerase -DNA adducts 
and DSBs and used as a cancer therapy .  PLD i s FDA approved for treatment of ovarian 
cancer and mult iple myelo ma offering the same efficacy wit h less cardiot oxicit y and 
haematotoxicit ythan the uncapsulated form.   
.  
 
11.2 Background
As described in Section 2.2the DNA -PK inhibitor AZD7648 is being developed as an 
anti-cancer therapy  for pati ents wi th advanced m alignancies.  Combination Module 1 will 
investigate the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, PD, and preliminary  efficacy  (anti -tumour activi ty) of 
AZD7648 in co mbinat ion with PLD in pat ients with advanced malignancies.  Combinat ion 
Module 1 consi sts of the following parts: AZD7648 combined with PLD in dose escalat ion 
(Part A) and PoC expansio n in pat ients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer (Part B).
Epithelial ovarian cancer, which accounts for 90% of all ovarian cancers, is further subdivided 
into vari ous cell ty pes, grades, and anatomic locat ions.  The most commo n form is high -grade 
serous ovarian c ancer, which accounts for approximately 70% of all epit helial ovarian cancer.  
Historically, the treatment of ovarian cancer has been surgical cy toreducti on followed by  
adjuvant chem otherapy .  Ovari an cancer remains a deadly  malignancy because most patient s 
develop recurrent disease that is resistant to chemo therapy , including pl atinum.  For 
platinum -resistant pati ents (pati ents who relapse ≤ 6months after any  line of platinum -based 
chemotherapy or having disease progression whilst receiving plat inum -based chem otherapy  in 
the ≥second -line setting), other chemotherapies including PLD are used.  For partially 
platinum -sensit ive pat ients (pati ents who rel apse > 6 to 12 months from the last 
platinum -based chemotherapy) and plat inum -sensitive patients (patients who relapse 
> 12 months from the last chem otherapy ), pati ents may derive benefit from further 
platinum -based chemotherapies.  Time fro m last platinum treatment to relapse remains an 
integral  measure for defining patient populations and predict ing outcomes for treatm ents, 
although response rates fall on a continuum (Wilson et al 2017 ).
A brief background on PLD, including its mechanisms of act ion, is provided below.  Fo r 
detailed descript ions of the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of AZD7648 and 
PLD , refer to the IB ( AZD7648 ) or Summary  of Product Characteri stics (PLD ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 100of 16211.2.1 Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
11.2.1.1 Overview of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
Doxorubi cin is an inhibitor of topoiso merase 2 that generates topoiso merase -DNA adducts 
and DSBs and used as a cancer therapy .  PLD has been approved by FDA and the European 
Medicines Agency for treatment of ovarian cancer and mult iple myelo ma offering the same 
effica cy with less cardi otoxi city and haematotoxicity  than the uncapsulated form.  
Doxorubi cin direct ly generates DSBs and therefore could potentiate the activit y of DNA -PK 
inhibitor, which is the crit ical co mponent of NHEJ DNA DSB repair.
11.2.1.2 Pegylated liposomal do xorubicin data
DOXIL® (FDA -approved):
DOXIL i s indicated for the treatment of patients wit h ovarian cancer whose disease has 
progressed or recurred after plat inum -based chemo therapy .
DOXIL was studied in 3 open -label, single -arm, clinical studi es of 176patients wi th 
metastati c ovari an cancer (Tri als 1, 2 and 3).  One hundred forty -five of these pat ients were 
refractory  to both paclitaxel -and platinum -based chemotherapy regimens, defined as disease 
progression while on treatment or relapse within 6 months of co mpleting treatment.  Patients 
received DOXIL at 50 mg/m2every  3or 4weeks for 3 -6+ cy cles in the absence of DLT or 
disease progressi on.  In a pooled analysis of Trials 1-3, the response rate for all pat ients 
refractory  to paclitaxel and plat inum a gents was 13.8% (95% CI 8.1, 19.3).  The median t ime 
to progression (TTP) was 15.9 weeks, the median time to response was 17.6 weeks and the 
durati on of  response was 39.4 weeks.
In an open -label Trial 4, a total  of 474 patients wi th epithelial ovarian canc er after 
platinum -based chemotherapy  were randomised to receive eit her DOXIL 50 mg/m2every  
4weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m2daily  for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks.  Pati ents were 
stratified according to plat inum sensit ivity (response to i nitial plat inum -based therapy  and a 
progression -free interval o f >6months off treatm ent) and the presence of bulky  disease 
(tum our m ass > 5cm in size).  The median TTP showed no statist ically significant difference 
between the 2 arms (4.1 months in the DOXIL arm and 4 .2months in the topotecan arm).  The 
median OS was 14.4 months in the DOXIL arm and 13.7 months in the topotecan arm.  The 
median duration of response was 6.9 months in the DOXIL arm and 5.9 months in the 
topotecan arm.
Caelyx (EMA -approved):
A Phase III comparat ive study  of Caelyx versus topotecan in patients with epit helial ovarian 
cancer following the failure of first -line, platinum -based chemotherapy  was com pleted in 
474patients.  There was a benefit in OS for Caelyx -treated pati ents over topotecan -treated 
patients as indicated by  a hazard rati o of 1.216 (95% CI: 1.000, 1.478), p =0.050. The

11.3 Benefit/risk assessment
As describe d in Secti on2.3patients enro lled to this study have advanced cancer with a limited 
number of treatment options available, including chemotherapy such as PLD.  The survival 
outcome and toxi city profile of che motherapy  in this setting mean that other active therapies 
are hi ghly desirable and present a potential advantage for patients.
The study  design aims to evaluate and determine a dose and schedule of AZD7648 in 
combinat ion with PLD and i dentify patient popu lations who may  respond favourably to the 
combinat ion. Based upon the available non -clinical and clinical safet y data, the limited 
survival benefit provided by the current treatment options, the limited life expectancy due to 
advanced malignant disease, an d the hypothesis of a synergist ic effect of the 2 agents, the

12 STUDY DESIGN
12.1 Overall design
Combinat ion Modul e 1 will  evaluate the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy  
(anti-tumour activit y) of AZD7648 (given orally) in co mbination wit h PLD (given IV) as 
below:
Part A: Dose escalat ion of AZD7648 in co mbination with PLD in approximately 
30evaluable patients with advanced solid tumours in who m PLD is an appropri ate therapy .  
Prior informat ion for PLD toxicit y will be based on the l ocally approved label, whilst pri or 
inform ation for AZD7648 toxicit y will  be based on emerging data from the monotherapy  arm
(Core Modul e).
The starting dose of PLD will be 40 mg/m2 administered IV once every  4 weeks for up to 
6cycles.  Pati ents who respond or have stable dis ease fo llowing 6 cycles of PLD, are 
permitted to continue AZD7648 at the monotherapy RP2D (or lower dose) from the Core 
Module during the ‘continuat ion phase’ .  Although AZD7648 is administered continuously  as 
monotherapy , it is ant icipated that an intermi ttent schedule willbe required in combinat ion.  
Two intermittent schedules thatmay be explored, including but not limited to, are :i) an 
intermittent wi thin cycle schedule starting fro m  dosing eg, days 
on/ days off, and/or ii) an  starting from  
dosing eg, days on/ days .  The duration and/or frequency o f dosing for
both schedules may be altered based on emerging data and mult iple schedules may be run 
concurrent ly if agreed by  the SRC.
The PLD dose is consistent with local clinical practice (commo n usage of 40 mg/m2).
Part B: A safet y and PoC Phase 2a expansio n is planned to assess the co mbination in 
approximately  37evaluable pat ients with advanced ovarian cancer who have relapsed within 
12months of complet ing a platinum -containing therapy .  Thi s includes pat ients who have 
platinum -resistant disease who have not received more than one cy totoxi c regimen for 
platinum -resistant disease and patients with partial plati num sensit ivity.  
Sites m ust send form alin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue for retrospective central 
laboratory  confi rmationof advanced ovari an cancer .

12.3 Justification for dose
12.3.1 Justification for AZD7648 dose
The act ual starting dose of AZD7648 for this module will be dependent on clinical PK 
exposure and emerging safet y and tol erabili ty data seen during the m onotherapy  escalat ion 
(refer to the Core Module). However, the actual  AZD7648 starting dose will be triggered
when the equivalent AZD7648 monotherapy  dose cohort is declared tolerated in the Core 
Module .The starting schedul e of AZD7648 fro m  dosing,  
t (an intermittent within cycle schedule). Therefore, the total per cy cle 
dose in the combinat ion is ≤25% of the per cy cle dose administered as continuous 
monotherapy .
12.3.2 Justification for pegylated liposomal doxorubicin dose
Although PLD is approved at a dose of 50 mg/m2every 4 weeks, i t is commo n for pati ents to 
require a dose reduction to 40 mg/m2due to AEs such as palmar -plantar ery throdysesthesia, 
stom atitis or haematological toxicit y.  Several large studies including combinat ions (eg, 
AURELIA trial) have deplo yed a starting dose of PLD of 40 mg/m2.  For these rea sons, 
40mg/m2has been selected as the starting dose in Combinat ion Modul e 1.

14.3.1 Effect of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin on other drugs
No formal medicinal product interaction studies h ave been perform ed wi th PLD, al though 
Phase II combinat ion trials wi th conventi onal chem otherapy  agents have been conducted in 
patients wi th gynaeco logical malignancies.  Exercise caution in the concomitant use of 
medicinal products known to interact with standard doxorubicin hydrochloride.  PLD, like 
other doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations, may potentiate the toxicit y of other anti -cancer 
therapi es.  During clinical trials in patients with solid tumours (including breast and ovarian 
cancer) who have r eceived conco mitant cy clophosphamide or taxanes, no new addit ive 
toxicities were noted.  Caution must be exercised when giving any other cy totoxi c agents, 
especially  myel otoxi c agents, at the same t ime.
14.4 Dose modification
Refer to Section 6.6for management of treatment related toxicit y applicable to all study  
modules. 
If the toxicit y does not resolve to the patient’s baseline or to CTCAE Grade ≤2 within 
28days ofonset, treatm ent wi th AZD7648 and PLD must be discontinued.  However, if 
toxicity is clearly attributed to PLD alone, the patient is permitted to continue receiving 
AZD7648 as monotherapy  following discussio n between the Investigator and the AZ Study  
Phys ician.  If PLD is discont inued due to reasons other than toxicit y, AZD7648 m onotherapy  
may cont inue following di scussi on between the Investigator and the AZ Study  Physician.
15 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA ( Table 13). 
15.1 Management of study treatment -related toxicities
At this time, there are limited safety  data regarding the combinat ion of AZD7648 and PLD .  
Given the differing mechanisms o f action of AZD7648 and PLD , the potenti al for potenti ation 
of toxicities is thought to be limited.  Some toxicit ies, for example pneumo nitis and 
asthenia/fatigue may, on theoretical grounds, be potentiated in the combina tion arm  and 
particular attenti on shoul d be paid to these.
In the event of toxicit y in this co mbinat ion module of the study  which cannot be managed by 
supportive measures alone, stopping one or both study  treatm ents shoul d be an Investigator 
decisio n based on the available information and, if necessary , following discussio n with the 
Sponsor.
The fo llowing general guidance should be fo llowed for m anagement of toxi cities:
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111of 162Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including withho lding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicit y if required).
If the symptoms prompt ly resolve with supportive care, considerat ion should be given to 
continuing the same dose of the assigned study  treatm ent al ong wi th appropri ate 
continuing supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose modificat ions are permitted for 
AZD7648.  In addit ion, gui delines on AZD7648 dose modificat ions are provided in 
Secti on6.6and 14.4.  In the event of toxicit y that cannot be managed by fo llowing the 
toxicity management gui delines for AZD7648 and PLD , consi der stopping treatm ent.
All dose modificat ions shoul d be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the 
approach taken.
Management of PLD related toxicit ies will be performed in accordance wit h local pract ice.
15.2 Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram or MUGA scan will be conducted on all patients at screening for Parts A 
and B, and at the timepo ints in the SoA ( Table 13). The screening echocardiogram or MUGA 
scan will not be required if a previo us echocardi ogram  or MUGA scan was performed 
6months pri or to screening, unless there has been a change in the pat ient’s cardiac status.
15.3 Pharmacokinetics
Venous blood samples (2 mL) for determination of concentrations of PLD (as total 
doxorubi cin), will b e taken at the times presented in the SoA ( Table 13) in addit ion to the 
venous blood samples (2 mL) for determinat ion of concentrations of AZD7648 in plasma. The 
date a nd time of co llection of each sample will be recorded.  Further details can be found in

LRV=lower reference value; PLD=pegylated liposomal doxorubicin; TV=target value.
The sample size for the interim analysis has been determined by Lalonde criteria set for ORR 
(LRV% and TV% defined in Table 18).  The sample size ensures success (Go) if there is a 
≥80% chance of exceeding the LRV and stop if there is < 10% chance of exceeding the TV.  
Recrui tment will not be stopped for the interim analysis.
The SAP will des cribe the planned interim analys isin greater detail.
16.2 Sample size determination
Part A will require approximately  30 evaluable patients across approximately 5 cohorts 
(n=3to6 per cohort) to provide a model -based estimate of MTD within target toxicit y 
(30%).   Once MTD has been determined, an addit ional 30 evaluable patients may be recruited 
to invest igate intermittent dosing schedules. If two schedules recruit patients at the same time, 
a pati ent sy stem atic allocat ion algorithm will be followed.
Part B will require approximately 37 evaluable patients wi th advanced platinum -resistant 
ovari an cancer.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123of 162Appendix BAdverse Event Definitions and Additional Safety Information
B1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or 
clinical study  patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have a 
causal relat ionship with this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore b e any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.
The ter m AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
B2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study  phase (ie, run -in, 
treatm ent, washout, fo llow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -patient hospi talisat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital anomalyor birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical 
treatment to prevent oneof the outcom es listed above
B3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient ’s 
death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
B4 Hospitalisation
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a SAE, alt hough the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, pr ovided that i t did not deteri orate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124of 162B5 Important medical event or medical treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events m ay not be immediately life -threatening or resul t in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the patient or may  require 
medical treatment to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous.  These 
shoul d usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent.
Hepatotoxicit y cause d by paracetam ol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine.
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm.
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion.
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
B6 Intensity rating scale:
The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Inst itute commo n termino logy 
criteria for adverse event (CTCAE) versio n 5.0 will be utilised for all events with an assigned 
CTCAE grading.  For th ose events wi thout assi gned CTCAE grades, the recommendat ion in 
the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades 
shoul d be used.  A copy  of the CTCAE can be d ownl oaded f rom the Cancer Therapy  
Evaluat ion Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).
It is important to dist inguish between SAEs and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, b ut not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B2.
B7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making a n assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125of 162Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharma cological class?  Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by another aetio logy such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Rechallenge experience.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped?  AstraZeneca would not normally  recommend or support a 
rechallenge .
Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationsh ip is meant to convey, in general , that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgement.  With limited or insufficient informat ion in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B8 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  treatm ent that ei ther causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the p articipant.
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure whilst the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126of 162Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.
Occurred.
was ident ified and intercepted before the patient received the drug.
did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error.
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n.
Dispensing error eg, m edicati on prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the pati ent.
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration.
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it sho uld be taken as a 
solid tablet.
Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature.
Wrong patient received the medication.
Wrong drug administered to patient.
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medicat ion.
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose).
Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging.
Error s related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open -label studi es, even if an AZ product.
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

C1 Chain of custody of biological samples
A full chain o f custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their life cycle.
The Investigator at each centre keeps full traceability  of collected bi ological sam ples f rom the 
patients whilst in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate).
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples whilst in storage and during use 
until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of 
arrival.
AstraZ eneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, 
monitoring of study  sites, audi ting or process checks, and contractual requirements of external 
laboratory  provi ders
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AZ -assigned bio banks and will be 
registered by  the AstraZeneca Bio bank Team during the ent ire life cycle.
C2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will  be
disposed of/destroy ed, and the acti on documented.  If samples are already  analysed ,
AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.

International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categori es 
(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infect ious_substances.ht m).  For 
transport purposes the classificat ion of infect ious substances according to risk groups was

D1 Use/analysis of DNA
Genet ic variat ion may impact a patient’s response to therapy , susceptibilit y to, and severi ty 
and progression of disease.  Variable response to therapy may  be due to geneti c determinants 
that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism of act ion of 
the drug; disease aet iology; and/or m olecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, 
where local regulat ions and IRB/IEC all ow, a bl oodsample will be collected for DNA 
analysis fro m consent ing patients.
AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the resp onse to 
medicat ions.  Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis 
of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery o f new di agnost ics, 
treatm ents or m edicat ions.
In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the patient’s DNA, ie, the 
entire geno me.
The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in the CSR or in a separate study summary.
The Sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confident iality.
The samples will be retained whilst research on the study  treatm ent in thi s protocol  continues 
but no l onger than 15 y ears or other period as per local requirements.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130of 162Inclusion Criteria
For inclusio n in this genet ic research, patients must fulfil all o f the inclusio n criteria described 
in the main body  of the CSP andprovide informed consent for the genet ic sampling and 
analyses.
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant.
Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n wit hin 120 days of genet ic sample 
collect ion.
Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research:
Patients m ay withdraw from  this genet ic research at any t ime, independent of any decisio n 
concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study .  Vol untary  withdrawal will  not 
prejudice further treatm ent.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Sect ion7of the m ain 
CSP.
Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
The blood sample for ge netic research will be obtained fro m the pati ents at the Cycle1, Day 1
Visit.  Although DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid introducing bias 
through excluding pat ients who may wit hdraw due to an AE, such patients would be importan t 
to include in any  genet ic analysis.  If for any reason the sample is not drawn at the Cycle1, 
Day 1Visit, it may be taken at any  visit until the l ast study  visit.  Only 1 sample shoul d be 
collected per -patient for genetics during the study .  Sam ples wi ll be collected, labelled, stored, 
and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and Storage of DNA Samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain pat ient confident iality.  Samp les will be stored for a maximum o f 
15years, from the date of last patient last visit, after which they will be destroyed.  DNA is a 
finite resource that is used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no 
further analyses are possible o r the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA 
extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable only by the secon d, unique number.  This number is used to ident ify the sample 
and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 131of 162organi sation.  No personal details ident ifying the individual will be available to any person 
(AstraZeneca e mplo yee or designated organisat ions working with the DNA).
The link between the patient enrolment code and the second number will be maintained and 
stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated 
organi sations.  The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, 
facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regul atory  audi t, and permi t 
tracing of samples for destruction in the case o f withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulat ory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in Appendix A.
Informed Consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal and the pati ent may  parti cipate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component.  To participate 
in the genet ic co mponent of the study the pat ient must sign a nd date both the consent form for 
the main study  and the genet ic co mponent of the study .  Copi es of both si gned and dated 
consent forms must be given to the patient and the original filed at the study  centre.  The 
Principal Invest igator(s) is responsible f or ensuring that consent is given freely and that the 
patient understands that they  may freely  withdrawal  from the genet ic aspect of the study at 
any time.
Patient Data Protection
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to patients, any  insurance co mpany, 
any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by  law.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identi ty of the patient.  In except ional circumstan ces, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal ident ifiers of a pati ent.  For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency , an AstraZeneca Physician or an Invest igator might know a patient’s 
ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data.  In addit ion, Regulatory  authori ties 
may require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical informat ion and the 
genet ic files would remain physically separate.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 132of 162Data Management
Any genoty pe data generated in this study  will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca 
and/or designated organisat ions to analyse the samples.
AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fr om this genetic research with other 
researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisat ions or health insurance co mpanies.  This 
can be done by placing the results in scient ific databases, where they can be combined wit h 
the resul ts of similar studies to le arn even m ore about heal th and disease.  The researchers can 
only use this inform ation for healt h-related research purposes.  Researchers may  see summary  
resul ts but they  will not be able to see individual patient data or any  personal  identifiers.
Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic data 
in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.
Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size
The number of pat ients that will agree to partic ipate in the genet ic research is unknown.  It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be generated.  A statist ical 
analysis plan m ay be prepared where appropriate.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 133of 162Appendix EActions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases.  It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries.
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated ALT from  a central  laboratory  and/or el evated TBL fro m 
a local laboratory .  
The Investigator w ill also review Adverse Event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment o f cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met.  
HL cri teria are m et if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  theInvest igational 
Medicinal Prod uct (IMP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs according to the outcome of the review 
and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes.
E2 Definit ions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3× ULN together 
with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2×ULN at any  point during the study  following the start of study  
treatm ent, irrespect ive of an increase in alkal ine phosphatase (ALP).
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134of 162Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
study  treatm ent, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP 
indicat ing cholestasis, viral hepat itis, ano ther drug.
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3×ULN
AST ≥ 3×ULN
TBL ≥ 2×ULN
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Section E2 Definit ions wit hin this 
Appendix for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory  reports from  all previ ous visi ts
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF.
E4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Perform  follow-up on subseque nt laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP.
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting study  
treatm ent (See Appendix E, Section 6. Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law 
Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study  Treatm ent).
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study  Team .
Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment ‘y es/rel ated’ 
according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 135of 162For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the subject’s condit ion
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data
Subsequent to this contact the Invest igator will:
Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medic ally 
indicated.  Completes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician.
Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.
E5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s Law cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the 
IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin 15 calendar days 
from the date th e PHL criteria was met.  The AstraZeneca Glo bal Clinical Lead or equivalent 
and Glo bal Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review together with other patient 
matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, t he Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternat ive explanat ion for the ALT or AST and TBL elevati ons, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets t he criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF.
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new informa tion (reassessing event term; causalit y 
and seriousness criteria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes:
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 136of 162The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria 
apply.
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigne d.
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 calendar days in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed deci sion can be m ade:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
E6 Actions required when potential Hy’s Law criteria are met before 
and after starting study treatment
This sect ion is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatm ent having previously  met PHL cri teria at a study  visit prior to starti ng study  treatm ent.
At the first on -study  treatment occurrence of PHL cri teria being met, the Invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condit ion#compared wi th the 
last vi sit where PHL cri teria were m et.#
If there is no significant change, no action is requi red.
If there is a significant change, notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will inform the 
central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in Appendix E, 
Secti on4.2.
# A ‘significant’ change in the pat ient’s condit ion refers t o a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant chang e will be at the di scret ion of the Invest igator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.
E7 Actions required for repeat episodes of potential Hy’s Law

PHL i s based on the nature of the alternat ive cause identified for the previous occurrence.
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the alternat ive cause for the previous occurrence o f PHL cri teria being met found to 
be the disease under study , eg, chroni c or progressing malignant disease, severe infect ion 
or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study  treatm ent and 
at first on study  treatm ent visi t, as described in Section 6 of this Appendix
If No: Follow the process described in Appendix E, Secti on4.2 for reporti ng PHL as an SAE .
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant#change in the pat ient’s condit ion compared 
with when PHL cri teria were previously  met.
If there is no significant change, no ac tion is requi red.
If there is a significant change, fo llow the process described in Appendix E, Secti on4.2 
for reporting PHL as an SAE.

Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evalua tion Criteria in 
Solid Tumours)
Introduction
This Appendix details the implementation o f response evaluation criteria in so lid tumours 
(RECIST) 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer etal,2009 ) for the study  with regards to Invest igator 
assessment of tumour burden including protocol -specific requirements for this study .
Definition of Measurable, Non -measurable, Target and Non -target Lesions
Patients wi th at least 1 l esion (measurable and/or non -measurable) that can be accurately 
assessed at baseline by  com puted tom ography  (CT), MRI or pl ain X -ray should be included in 
this study .  Patients wi th previ ously  irradiated TLs can be included in this study  provi ded that 
there has been progression in the irradiated site fo llowing the treatm ent.
Measurable Lesions
A lesio n, not previously irradiated, that can be measured accurately at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in 
the longest diameter (except lymph nodes) which must have a short axis ≥ 15 mm with CT or 
MRI and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.
Non-measurable Lesions
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter < 10mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm  to < 15 mm  short axi s at baseline).  Nodes with <10mm 
short axis are considered non -patho logical and shoul d not be recorded as non -target 
lesions (NTLs).
Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio n, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangit ic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organo megaly ident ified by 
physical examinat ion that are not measurable by CT or MRI.
Previously  irradiated l esions as l ocalised post -radiation changes, which affect lesio n sizes, 
may occur.  Therefore, lesio ns that have been previously irradiated will not be considered 
measurable and should be selected as NTLs at baseline and fo llowed up as part of the 
NTL assessment.
Skin l esions assessed by clinical examinat ion.
Brain metasta sis.
Special Cases
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue com ponents, 
can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of 
measurabilit y.  Bl astic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 143of 162Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurabilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present in the 
same patient, these non -cystic lesions shoul d be selected as the TLs.
Target Lesions
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesio ns involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline.
Non-target Lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites o f disease) not recorded as TLs should be ident ified as NTLs at 
baseline.
Methods of Measurement
The Same Method of Assessment and the Same Technique Should Be Used to 
Characterise Each Identified and Reported Lesion at Baseline and During Follow -up.
The m ethods to be used for RECIST assessment are summarised in Table 1 and those 
excluded for tumour assessments in this study  are di scussed below, with the rationale 
provi ded.

CT and MRI 
CT and MRI are generally  considered to be the best currently  available and reproducible 
methods to measure TLs selected for response assessment and to assess NTLs and 
ident ificat ion of new lesio ns.
In thi s study  it is recommended that CT examinat ions will be used to assess tumour burden at 
baseline and fo llow-up visi ts.  CT examinat ion with intravenous contrast media administration 
is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or it is medically 
contraindicated.  For assessment of brain lesio ns MRI i s the pr eferred m ethod.

AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 144of 162Clinical Examination 
Clinical examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TLs.  Clinically detected lesio ns can 
be selected as TLs if they are then assessed by CT or MRI scans.  Clinical examinat ion can be 
used to assess NTLs in pat ients that also have other lesio ns assessable by CT, MRI or plain X -
ray and to i dentify the presence of new lesio ns.
X-rays
Plain X- ray
Plain X- rays may  be used as a m ethod of assessment for bone NTLs and to ident ify the 
presence of new bone lesio ns. 
Chest X -ray
Chest X -rays will  not be used for assessment of TLs as they  will be assessed by CT or MRI 
examinat ion.  Chest X -rays can, however, be used to assess NTLs and to ident ify the presence 
of new lesio ns.
Ultrasound 
Ultrasound examinat ion will not be used f or assessment of TLs and NTLs as it is not a 
reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is 
subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examinat ion can, however, be used to ident ify 
the presence o f new lesio ns.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed 
then new lesio ns should be confirmed by CT or MRI examinat ion.
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy
Endoscopy  and l aparoscopy  will not be used for tumour assessments as they  are not validated 
in the context of tumour m easurements.
Tumour Markers

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 145of 162Cytological confirmat ion of the neoplast ic origin of any effusio n that appears or worsens 
during treatm ent is requi red when the measurable tumour has met criteria for response or 
stable disease (SD).  In such circumstances, the cy tology is necessary  to differentiate between 
response/SD (an effusio n may be a si de effect of the treatment) and progressiv e disease (if the 
neopl astic ori gin o f the fluid is confirmed).  Where cy tology findings are not available, any  
effusio n that significant ly worsens (from trace to large) or the appearance of a clinically 
significant effusio n (requi ring change in drug thera py) during the study  treatm ent will  be 
considered to be progression o f NTLs or disease progression due to new lesions.
Isotopic Bone Scan 
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT, MRI or X -
ray at baseline shoul d be recorded as NTLs and followed by  the same method as per baseline 
assessment.
Isotopi c bone scans m ay be used as a method of assessment to ident ify the presence of new 
bone lesio ns at follow -up visi ts.  New l esions will be recorded where a positive hot -spot that 
was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is ident ified on a bone scan performed 
at any  time during the study .  The Investigator should consider the posit ive hot-spot to be a 
significant new site of malignant disease and represent true dis ease progression in order to 
record the new lesio n.  Confirmat ion by CT, MRI and X -ray is recommended where bone scan 
findings are equivocal.
FDG -PET Scan 
FDG -PET (fl uorodeoxy glucose posi tron emissio n tomography ) scans may  be used as a 
method for ident ifying new lesio ns, according with the fo llowing algori thm: New lesi ons will  
be recorded where there is posit ive FDG uptake (defined as when an uptake greater than twice 
that of the surrounding tissue is observed) not present on baseline FDG -PET scan or in a 
location corresponding to a new lesio n on CT/MRI at the same fo llow-up visi t.  If there is no 
baseline FDG -PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesio ns on CT/MRI scans then 
follow-up CT/MRI assessments should be cont inued, scheduled as per protocol o r clinical 
indicated, in order to confirm new lesio ns.
Tumour Response Evaluation 
Schedule of Evaluation
Baseline tumour assessments should enco mpass all areas of known predilect ion for metastases 
in the disease under evaluation and should addit ionally  investi gate areas that may be invo lved 
based on signs and symptoms of individual pat ients and should be performed no more than 
28days before the start of study  treatm ent.  In Combinat ion module1, follow-up assessments

discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent or wi thdrawal of consent.  
If AZD7648 is co mbined with any immuno -oncol ogy drugs (in future combinat ion modules)
modified RECIST will be used in an exploratory  analysis . If progression is not confirmed, 
then the overall visit response as per modified RECIST should be assessed as SD/partial 
response (PR) or CR and the patient should continue scheduled REC IST1.1.CT/MRI scans.  
If progression is confirmed the overall visit res ponse shoul d be assessed as progressive disease 
as per modified RECIST.
Target Lesions
Documentation of Target Lesions
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns, with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes), representative of all lesions invo lved, should be identified as TLs at baseline.  
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non -nodal  
lesions or short axis for nodal lesio ns) but in addit ion should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated m easurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n 
does not l end i tself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest 
lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL shoul d be documented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal  lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in 
millimetres.  At baseline, the sum o f the diameters for all TLs will be calculated and reported 
as the basel ine sum of diameters.  At fo llow-up visits the sum o f diameters for all TLs will be 
calculated and reported as the follow -up sum  of diam eters.  
Special Cases:
For TLs m easurable in 2 or 3 dimensio ns, always report the longest diameter.  For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes m easurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. 
If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is > 5mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm.
If a TL split s into 2 or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts.
If 2 or more TLs merge then the sum o f the diameters of the combined lesio n should be 
recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesio n(s).
If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an est imate of the 
size of the lesio n.

Evaluation of target lesions
Table 2 provi des the defini tions of  the cri teria used to determine objective tumour visit 
response for TLs.
Table 2 Overall Visit Response for Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis 
to <10mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease At least a 20 % incr ease in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20 %, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not 
evaluable or had a lesion intervention at this visit.
Note: If the sum of diameters meets the progressive disease 
criteria, progressive disease overrides NE as a TL response.
Non-Target lesions
Evaluation of Non -target Lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TLs shoul d be ident ified as NTLs at 
baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions but their status should be fo llowed 
at subsequent visits.  At each visit, an overall assessment of the NTL response should be 
recorded by  the Investi gator.  Table 3 provi des the defini tions of  the cri teria used to determine 
and record overall response for NTLs at the invest igational site at each visit.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 148of 162Table 3 Overall Visit Response for Non -Target Lesions
Progressive Disease Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.  Unequivocal 
progr ession may be due to an important progression in 1 lesion 
only or in several lesions.  In all cases the progression MUST 
clinically significant for the physician to consider changing or 
stopping therapy.
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant when 1 or some of the NTLs were not assess ed and 
in the Investigator’s opinion they are not able to provide an 
evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit.
Note: For patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any 
of the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression 
criteri a have not been met.
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level o f 
substant ial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in TLs, 
the overall tumour burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy .  A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify  for 
unequivocal progression status.
New Lesions
Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of asse ssment.  The presence of 
1 or m ore new l esions i s assessed as progression.
A lesio n identified at a follow -up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression.
The findin g of a new lesio n shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modalit y or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumour.
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of its small size , the treatm ent and tum our 
assessments should be cont inued unt il the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans 
confirm there is a new lesio n, then the progression date should be declared using the date of 
the init ial scan.
Symptomatic Deterioration
Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an object ive response: it is a reason for 
stopping study  therapy .
Patients wi th ‘symptom atic deterioration’ requiring discont inuat ion of study  treatm ent wi thout

Specifications for Radiological Imaging
These notes are recommendations for use in clinical studies.  The use of standardised 
protocol s for CT and MRI allows comparabilit y both within and between different studies, 
irrespect ive of where the exam ination has been undertaken.
CT Scan
CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be cont iguous throughout all the 
anatomical regio ns of interest.  
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 150of 162The m ost cri tical CT image acquisit ion parameters for optimal tumour evaluat ion using 
RECIST 1.1 are a natomic coverage, contrast administration, slice thickness, and 
reconstruction interval.
Anatomic Coverage
Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  
Coverage should enco mpass all areas of known predilect ion for metastases in the disease 
under evaluat ion and shoul d addi tionally invest igate areas that may be invo lved based on 
signs and symptoms of individual patients.  Because a lesio n later i dentified in a body part not 
scanned at baseline would be considered as a ne w lesi on represent ing disease progression, 
careful considerat ion should be given to the extent of imaging coverage at baseline and at 
subsequent fo llow-up time points.  This will enable better consistency not only  of tumour 
measurements but also ident ification of  new disease.
Intravenous Contrast Administration
Optimal visualisat ion and m easurement of m etastases in so lid tumours requires consistent 
administration (dose and rate) of intravenous contrast as well as t iming o f scanning.  
Typically , most abdomin al imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and 
(optim ally) about the sam e time frame after inject ion on each examinat ion.  An adequate 
volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to 
best effect an d a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any  given pat ient.  
It is very  important that the sam e techni que be used at baseline and on fo llow-up 
examinat ions for a gi ven pati ent.  F or pati ents who develop contraindicat ions to con trast af ter 
baseline contrast CT is done, the decisio n as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or 
non-enhanced) shoul d be perform ed shoul d also be based on the tumour ty pe, anatomic 
location of the disease and should be optimised to allow for comparison to the prior studies if 
possible.  Each case should be discussed wit h the radi ologist to determine if subst itution of  
these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable  
from that point forward.  Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different modalit y 
and interpretation of non -target di sease or new lesions, since the same lesio n may appear to 
have a different size using a new modalit y.  Oral  contrast i s recommended to help visualise 
and different iate structu res in the abdo men.
If iodine contrast m edia is medically  contraindicated at baseline or at any  time during the 
course of the study  then the recommended methods are: CT thoracic examinat ion without 
contrast and abdominal and pelvic MRI with contrast.  If M RI cannot be performed then CT 
without intravenous contrast is an option for the thorax, abdomen and pelvic examinat ions.  
Slice Thickness and Reconstruction Material
It is recommended that CT scans be performed at 5 mm cont iguous slice thickness and this
guideline presumes a minimum 5 mm thickness in recommendat ions for the m easurable l esion 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 151of 162definit ion.		Exceptionally, parti cular inst itutions may  perform medically acceptable scans at 
slice thi cknesses greater than 5 mm.  If this occurs, the minimum size o f measurable lesio ns at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scans.
All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where 
lung and soft tissue windows should be considered.  When measuring lesio ns, the TLs should 
be measured on the same window setting for repeated examinat ions throughout the study .  All  
images from each examinat ion shoul d be included in the assessment and not “selected” 
images of the apparent lesio n.
MRI Scan
MRI has excellent con trast, spati al and tem poral  resol ution; however, there are many  image 
acquisit ion variables invo lved in MRI, which greatly impact image qualit y, lesion conspicuit y 
and measurement.  Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI is variable glo bally .  The m odali ty 
used at follow -up shoul d be the same as was used at baseline and the lesio ns should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  Generally, axial imaging o f the abdo men and 
pelvis wit h T1 and T2 weighted imaging along wit h gado linium -enhanced imaging s hould be 
perform ed.  The field of view, matrix, number of excitat ions, phase encode steps, use of fat 
suppressio n and fast sequences should be optimised for the specific body  part being imaged as 
well as the scanner utilised.  It is beyo nd the scope of thi s Appendix to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body  parts and diseases.  Ideally, the same ty pe of 
scanner should be used and the image acquisit ion protocol  shoul d be f ollowed as closely  as 
possible to prior scans.  Body  scans shoul d be perform ed wi th breath -hold scanning 
techniques if possible.
For these reasons, CT is the imaging modalit y of choi ce.
FDG -PET Scans
FDG -PET has gained acceptance as a valuable tool for detecting, staging and restaging several 
malignancies.  If  FDG -PET scans are included in a protocol, an FDG uptake period of 60 min 
prior to imaging has been decided as the most appropriate for imaging of  pati ents wi th 
malignancy. Who le-body  acquisit ion is important since this allows for sampling of all areas 
of interest and can assess if new lesio ns have appeared thus determining the possibilit y of 
interval  progressi on of  disease.  Images fro m the bas e of the skull to the l evel of the mid -thigh 
shoul d be obtained 60 min post inject ion.  PET camera specificat ions are variable and 
manufacturer specific, so every  attem pt shoul d be made to use the same scanner, or the same 
model scanner, for seri al scans o n the same pat ient.  Who le-body  acquisit ions can be 
perform ed in eit her 2 -or 3-dimensio nal mode wi th attenuati on correcti on, but the m ethod 
chosen should be consistent across all pat ients and seri al scans in the clinical trial.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 152of 162PET/CT Scans
At present, lo w dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET –CT are of 
limited use in anatomically based efficacy  assessments and it i s therefore suggested that they  
shoul d not be subst ituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for tumour
measurements by  RECIST 1.1.  In except ional situations, if a site can document that the CT 
perform ed as part of a PET –CT is o f ident ical diagnostic qualit y to a diagnost ic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET –CT can be used for RE CIST measurements.  
However, this is not recommended because the PET portion of the CT introduces addit ional 
data that may bias an Invest igator if it is not routinely or serially performed.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 153of 162Appendix IFood Effect Cohort Plan
Summary
The food effect cohort of the study  com prises a cross over design.
Each patient in the food effect cohort will init ially receive a single oral dose of AZD7648 
(dose to be decided by  the SRC) on Cycle 0, Day 1 in ei ther the fasted or fed state.  The 
Parexel project m anager (in appropriate consultation with AZ study  team ) will advise 
each site on whether a particular pat ient parti cipat ing in the food effect cohort has been 
allocated to the fed or fasted group for their Cycle 0, Day 1 dose. 
The patient will then cross over to receive their single Cycle 1, Day 1 dose in the o pposite 
state to their Cycle 0, Day 0 dose.  So ,if the patient had the Cy cle0, Day 1 dose in the 
fasted state, the Cycle 1, Day 1 dose will be taken in the fed state, after a high fat 
breakfast m eal.  If the pati ent had the Cy cle0, Day 1 dose in the fed state, the Cy cle1, 
Day 1 dose will be taken in the fasted state (water only  for ≥2hours prior to taking a dose 
to ≥1hour post -dose).  The Cy cle1, Day 1 dose should be given in the morning at least 
72hours after the Cy cle0, Day 1 dose.
Meal and Timin g Requirements 
Please note that for the fasted state, patients must fast (water only) for ≥10hours prior to 
taking a dose to ≥2hour post -dose.  For the fed state patients must fast overnight 
(minimum of 10 hours) pri or to consuming a standardised meal in the clinic.
For the fed dosing day, the meal should consist of about 800 to 1000 total calories, with 
around 54% of the calorific content made up from fat.  The dose should be administered 
with 240 mL of water.
Patients shoul d ideally  start the recomme nded meal 30 min prior to planned 
administration of the study  drug and aim  to consume at l east 75% of the m eal wi thin 
30min. 
If the patient takes less than 30 min to complete the meal, it is st ill expected that the drug 
is dosed not earlier than 30 min a fter the start of the meal.
If the patient is unable to consume at least 75% of the meal wit hin 30 min an addit ional 
15min will be allowed.
The study  drug shoul d be administered after a minimum o f 75% of  the m eal is completed 
between 30 min and up to 45 min after starting the meal. 
Please note that patients will only be considered evaluable for the food effect cohort if 
they eat at l east 75% of their meal wit hin a maximum  of 45min.  Patients will remain in 
the Part A continuous scheduling cohort and shou ld continue to receive their dose and 
undergo planned sampling/procedures even if they have been unable to consume the 
requi red am ount of food wi thin the 45 min window, but will not be considered evaluable 
for the food effect cohort.
After Cycle 1, Day 1 patients m ay cont inue to receive AZD7648 mo notherapy  
(continuous dosing) and all dosing fro m that point onwards must be administered in the 
fasted state.

(HbA1c > 7 mm ol/L assessed l ocally) will be judged by  the Invest igator. 
Summary of 5 High -fat Br eakfast Meals
In accordance with FDA guidance ( FDA Guidance for Industry 2002 ), the high fat meal 
shoul d have a total  of approximately  800 to 1000 kcal, with approximately 50 -60% of  the 
calorific content made up from fat.  The meal should therefore derive approximately 150, 250 
and 500 to 600 kcal fro m protein, carbohydrate and fat respectively, as shown in Table 1.
Some high fat breakfast meal examples are given in Table 2 to Tabl e6.  The exact 
composition of  the m eal may vary  as long as the total s are similar to thos e detailed in Table 1.

Crisis 
Note: Changes below should be implemented only dur ing study  disrupti ons due to any  of or a 
combinat ion of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis (eg, during quarant ines and 
resul ting site closures, regional travel restrictions and considerat ions if site personnel or study  
patients beco me infected with SARS -CoV -2 or similar pandemic infect ion) during which 
patients m ay not wi sh to or m ay be unable to vi sit the study  site for study  visit s. These 
changes should only be implemented if allowable by lo cal/regi onal guidelines and following 
notifi cation from the Sponsor and instructions on how to perform these procedures will be 
provi ded at the time of implementation.   
J1 Reconsent of Study Patients During Study Interruptions
During study  interrupti ons, i t may not be possible for the patients to complete study  visits and 
assessments on site and alternat ive means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be 
necessary , eg, rem ote vi sits. Reconsent shoul d be obtained for the al ternat ive means of 
carrying out visits and assessments and shoul d be obtained prior to performing the procedures 
described in Sections J2toJ5. Local and regional regulat ions and/or guidelines regarding 
reconsent of study  patients shoul d be checked and fo llowed. Reconsent may  be verbal  if 
allowed by  local and regi onal guidelines (note, i n the case of verbal reconsent the informed 
consent form [ICF]shoul d be signed at the patient’s next contact with the study  site). Visi ting 
the study  sites for the sole purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avoided. 
J2 Rescreening of Patients To Reconfirm Study Eligibility
Addit ional rescreening for screen failure due to study disruption can be performed in 
previously screened part icipants. The invest igator should confirm this with the designated 
study  physician.
In addit ion, during study  disrupt ion there may be a delay between confirming eligibilit y of a 
patient and ei ther enrolment into the study  or commencing of dosing with investigat ional 
product . If this delay is outside the screening window specified in in the appropriate 
Schedule of Assessment Tabl e,the pati ent will need to be rescreened to rec onfirm eligibilit y 
before commencing study  procedures. This will provide another opportunit y to re-screen a 
patient in addit ion to that detailed in Section5.4. 
J3 Home or Remote Visit to Replace On -site Visit (where applicable)
A qualified Health Care Professional (HCP )from the study  site or third-party  vendor service 
will visit the patients home / or other remote location as per local standard operating 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 AstraZeneca
AZD7648 -D9170C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 158of 162procedures ( SOPs ), as applicable. Supplies will be provided for a safe and efficient visit. The 
qualified HCP will be expected to collect informat ion per the clinical study protocol (CSP).
J4 Telemedicine Visit to Replace On -site Visit (where appli cable)
In thi s appendix, the term telemedicine visit refers to remote contact with the patients using 
telecommunicat ions techno logy including phone calls, virtual or video visit s, and m obile 
healt h devices.
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or publi c heal th crisis, on -site visi ts may  be replaced by 
a telemedicine visit if allowed by  local/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine contact 
with the patients will allow adverse events, concomitant medication, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group perform ance status (ECOG PS )to be reported and documented.
J5 At-home or Remote Location IP Administration Instructions
If a site visit is not possible, at -home or remote location administration of invest igational 
product may be performed by a qualified HCP, provided this is acceptable within local 
regul ation/guidance, or by  the pati ent or hi s/her caregiver. The option of at -home or remote 
location invest igational product administration ensures patients safet y in cases of a pandemic 
where patientsmay be at increased risk by traveling to the site/clinic. This will also minimize 
interrupti on of  invest igational product administration during other study disruptions, eg, site 
closures due to natural disaster. All necessary supp lies and instructions for administration and 
docum entati on of  invest igational product administration will be provided if site is able to 
complete all  safety  assessments as per CSP.
J6 Data Capture During Telemedicine or Home / Remote Visits
Data collected du ring tel emedicine or hom e / rem ote visi ts will be captured by  the qualified 
HCP fro m the study  site or third-party  vendor service, or by  the patient themselves eg, details 
of self-administrati on of  study  medicati onin diary card .

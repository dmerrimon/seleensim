3.1 Synopsis  
Title of Study:  A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Split- Face Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of Revanesse® Ultra + (with Lidocaine ) versus Revanesse® Ultra  for the 
Correction of Nasolabial Folds 
Name of Sponsor :  Prollenium Medical Technologies Inc.  
Name of Finished Product s:  Revanesse® Ultra +, Revanesse® Ultra  
Device Composition :  Hyaluronic acid  gel with lidocaine (0.3% w/w); h yaluronic acid  gel  
Objectives:  To compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Revanesse® Ultra + (with 
lidocaine, hereafter referred to as Revanesse Ultra +) to Revanesse Ultra  for subjects 
undergoing correction of nasolabial folds (NLFs)  
Study  Design:  This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, split- face study in  subjects 
seeking nasolabial fold correction.  Subjects will be treated with Revanesse Ultra + in the NLF  
on one side of the face and Revanesse Ultra  in the NLF  on the other side of the face.  T he side 
of the face for each study product will be randomly assigned.  The investigator and  the subject 
will be blinded to the treatment; injections of the study product will be performed by an 
unblinded injecting investigator. 
At each visit, investigator and subject evaluations of the treated areas will be performed and 
recorded.  Visits will occur at: 
Visit 1/Week 0  (Day 1)  – baseline and treatment  
Visit 2/Week 2 – interim visit, touch -up if the iGAI score = 3 or 4  
Visit 3/Week 4 – interim visit  
Visit 4/Week 12 – interim visit  
Visit 5/ Week 24  –End of Study  
 
Evaluations include: 
Pain assessment using a visual analog scale (VAS)  
Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS)  
Patient Global Aesthetic Improvement (pGAI)  
Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement (iGAI)  
Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events ( AEs) at all study visits.   
Other evaluations include Investigator Ease of Use Assessment.  
 
Number of Study  Centers :  Approximately 5 sites  in the United States  
Duration of Participation:  S ubject s will participate in the study for approximately 24  weeks

Products  
Test product:   Revanesse Ultra  +: a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 mL pre- filled syringes with 
25 mg/mL of stabilized hyaluronic acid  and lidocaine 0.3% w/w.   
Comparator product:   Revanesse Ultra: a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 mL pre -filled syringes 
with 25 mg/m L of stabilized hyaluronic a cid. 
The injection will be given intradermally and for best results should be injected in the 
mid-dermis.  
Statistical Methods:   
Sample Size Determination:   To detect the difference between the null hypothesis proportion 
of responders of 50% and the alternative proportion of responders of 70% via a two-sided 
exact binomial test with a 0.05 significance level, 80 modified intent- to-treat ( mITT ) subjects 
will supply a power of 94.1%.  For the alternative proportion of responders of 68%, 80 mITT 
subjects will supply a power of 87.8 %. A responder is defined as a subject who had a within-
subject difference (Revanesse Ultra minus Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain score of at least 
10 mm immediately after injection.   
A total of 100 subjects will be randomized to obtain 80 mITT subjects and  to provide adequate 
data for monitoring safety of the study product. 
 
Analysis Populations:   
Intent- to-treat (ITT) (safety) population:  All randomized subjects who received study product. 
Modified intent- to-treat (mITT):  All randomized subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, were randomized, received both study products, and had VAS pain score immediately  
post injection from both sides of the face. 
Per-protocol (PP):  All randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria; received 
both study products ; completed Visit 5/Week 24 within the specified window; had data on 
pain s core from both sides of the face i mmediately post injection and at 15, 30, 45, and 
60 minutes post injection at Visit 1/Day1; had data on pain score at 2  weeks post injection

Confidential (prior to touch -up); and ha d no significant protocol violations that would affect the treatment 
evaluation.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and PP populations.  Safety analyses will be 
performed on the ITT population. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of responders immediately after  injection, 
where a responder is defined as a subject who  had a within- subject difference (Revanesse 
Ultra minus Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain  score  of at least 10 mm on a 100- mm scale .  
Summary statistics include mean, standard deviation ( SD), minimum, median, and maximum 
for VAS score for each treatment and f or the within -subject difference.  The proportion of 
responders will be summarized with frequency  and percentage with  a 95% confidence interval 
(CI) constructed using a one -sample binomial exact test.  If the lower  bound of this 95% CI is 
greater than 50%, the test product will be claimed to be superior to the comparator product. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized by site descriptively.  
The s econdary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of responders at 15, 30, 45, and 
60 minutes post injection and a t 2 weeks post injection (prior to touch -up).  Upon the 
significance of the primary efficacy outcome, secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a hierarchical approach will be used.  If success is achieved at 15 minutes, 30 minutes will be evaluated; if s uccess is achieved at 30 minutes, 45 minutes will be evaluated; if success is 
achieved at 45 minutes, 60 minutes will be evaluated; and if success is achieved at 60 minutes, 2 weeks post- injection will be evaluated .   
Other efficacy variables include change in WSRS score from baseline, pGAI, and iGAI at each scheduled post- baseline visit.  Descriptive summaries will be provided for each treatment and 
for within -subject difference. 
All efficacy analyses will be performed for both the PP and mITT populations.  For the primary endpoint, the results from mITT  are considered definitive and those from PP 
supportive. 
Safety Analysis:   
Adverse events will be coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 15.1 or higher).  
Frequency and percent of subjects reporting treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) of 
injection site reaction s will be ta bulated for each treatment by preferred terms, and further by 
severity.  In summaries of severity, subjects reporting more than one event in a treatment arm 
that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once in that treatment arm 
under the strongest severity.  
For other AEs where an  association with either treatment  may not be clearly identified, 
including system ic TEAEs, frequency  and percent of subjects will be tabulated to treated 
subjects as one group by  preferred terms and system organ class, and further by severity and 
relationship to study device.  In summaries of severity and relationship, subjects who reported more than one event that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once under the strongest severity and relationship .  
Adverse events will be summarized using the ITT population.

Confidential Interim Analysis:  One interim analysis is planned  after all subjects have completed Visit 3 or 
discontinued prior to Visit 3.  The purpose is to de termine the safety and pain relief of 
Revanesse Ultra + to support regulatory submissions outside the US that are currently under 
review for products containing lidocaine. The sponsor does not plan to change the protocol or stop the study based on the results of the interim analysis.

Confidential 6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background 
Revanesse Ultra + (with lidocaine, hereafter referred to as R evanesse Ultra +) is a stabilized 
hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal filler with lidocaine 0.3% w/w and Revanesse Ultra is a stabilized 
HA dermal filler .  Both products are commercially available in Canada and several European 
countries.  The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of these two products. 
Details about specific benefits and risks for subjects participating in this study  may be found in 
the Appendix  (product labeling) and consent documents for this study.   
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good C linical Practice (GCP) , and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.  
6.2 Rationale for the Study and Study Design  
This study is a randomized, double-blind prospective, comparative study of the efficacy and 
safety of Revanesse Ultra  + versus Revanesse Ultra  in the cutaneous correction of nasolabial 
folds (NLFs) .  Randomization will follow a  1:1 within -subject  control model of augmentation 
correction of NLFs .  Given that the implants have been shown to not migrate, the within- subject 
model is ideal and has already been shown in previous studies to detect differences.  Subjects 
with signs of NLFs who  meet the  entry criteria will be enrolled.  All subjects will be followed for 
efficacy and safety for 6 months.  The study design is appropriate for the indication studied.  Validated methods of data collection, analysis, and evaluation will be used. 
7 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are t o compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Revanesse Ultra + 
to Revanesse Ultra  for subjects undergoing correction of NLFs . 
8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, split- face study  in subjects seeking NLF  
correction.  Subjects will be treated with Revanesse Ultra + (test product) in the NLF  on one side 
of the face and Revanesse Ultra (comparator product) in the NL F on the other side of the face.  
The side of the face for each product will be randomly assigned.  The investigator performing the 
evaluations and the subject will be blinded to the treatment ; injections of the study product will 
be performed by an unblinded injecting investigator. 
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized at approximately 5 study sites in the United 
States (US).   Where possible, subjects currently enrolled in the ongoing retreatment study 
SYM2014-02 entitled “A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Split- Face Study to Evaluate 
the Safety and  Efficacy of Revanesse
® Ultra versus Restylane for the Correction of Nasolabial 
Folds” (G140120) will be invited to participate in this study.  Those subjects will receive a third 
treatment with Revanesse Ultra.

Confidential At each visit, investigator and subject eval uations of the treated areas will be performed and 
recorded.  Visits will occur at: 
Visit 1/Week 0  (Day 1) – baseline and treatment  
Visit 2/Week 2 (± 2 days) – interim visit, touch -up if the iGAI score = 3 or 4  
Visit 3/Week 4 (± 2 days) – interim visit  
Visit 4/Week 12 (± 4 days) – interim visit  
Visit 5/ Week 24 (± 7 days) – End of Study  
 
Evaluations include pain assessment by a visual analog scale (VAS)  , Wrinkle Severity Rating 
Scale (WSRS) , Patient Global Aesthetic Improvement (pGAI) , and Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement (iGAI) .  Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events ( AEs) at all study 
visits.   Other evaluations include the Investigator Ease of Use A ssessment.  A diary card will be 
dispensed to each enrolled subject at Visit 1/Day 1.  The subject will be instructed to complete 
the diary card to record the occurrence and extent of symptoms experienced for the first 2 weeks 
after treatment.  
8.2 Beginning and End of Study  
A subject is considered to be enrolled in the study when he/she  has provided written informed 
consent and has been randomized to treatment . 
A subject is considered to have completed the study after he/she has  completed  Visit 5/Week  24.   
A subject is co nsidered to have withdra wn after he/she has withdrawn consent or has been 
withdrawn  under the conditions specified in Section 8.3.3. 
A subject is considered to have been lost to follow-up if he/she cannot be contacted by the 
investigator.  The investigator will document efforts to attempt to reach the subject twice by 
telephone and will send a certified letter before considering the subject lost to follow-up.  The 
end of participation for a subject lost to follow-up is documented as the date of the certified letter.  
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including serious adverse events (SAEs), starting immediately after the subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF).  Each 
subject will be followed for safety monitoring  until he/she is discharged from the study.  
Follow-up procedures related to pr egnancy , AEs , or SAEs may continue beyond the end of the 
study.  
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 24 weeks from  the time he/she signs 
the ICF through the final contact.  After determination of eligibility at Visit 1/ Day 1, each subject 
will be treated with Revanesse Ultra + and Revanesse Ultra . 
It is anticipated that the duration of this study will be 12 months. 
8.3 Study Population  
Approximately 100 healthy males and females  at least 22 years of age  and with NLFs will be 
selected to participate in the study.

8.4.1 Dosage and Formulations 
The test and comparator products will be provided by the sponsor as follows. 
Test product:  Revanesse Ultra +:  a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 mL pre- filled syringes with 
25 mg/mL of stabilized hyaluronic acid  and lidocaine 0.3% w/w. 
Comparator product:  Revanesse Ultra: a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 m L pre -filled syringes with 
25 mg/m L of stabilized hyaluronic acid. 
8.4.2 Method of Treatment Assignment, Randomization, and/or Stratification 
Every subject will receive Revanesse Ultra + on one side of the face and Revanesse Ultra  on the 
other side of the face.  The side of the face treated with either product will vary from subject to 
subject based on the randomization assignment made at Visit 1/Day 1.    
Subjects who satisfy all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized with respect to which side of the face receives which treatment.  Randomization will be performed according to a computer-generated randomization scheme.  The randomization scheme will be generated and maintained by an independent third party.

Confidential randomization scheme should be retained at each site and should be available to regulatory 
authoriti es at the time of site inspection to allow for verification of the treatment identity for each 
subject.  
A unique subject number will be assigned to each subject.  Each site will receive a list of randomization code numbers and corresponding study product boxes .  Each eligible subject will 
be assigned a unique randomization code number in ascending order.   
No stratification based on age, sex, or other characteristics will be performed.   
8.4.3 Administration  of Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects are physically masked (blindfolded) just prior to and during all injection procedures to 
prevent observation of the syringes containing study product. 
Injections of the study product are performed by the unblinded injecting investigator.  The 
blinded evaluator is not allowed to retrieve study supplies or to be present during opening of the study supplies or during the injections.  The injecting investigator is not to have any discussion with the blinded evaluator or subjects regarding the treatments.  
Up to a maximum of 2.0 mL (2 pre- filled syringes)  will be used per treatment on each nasolabial 
fold similar to the comparator agent based on previous studies and common clinical practice.   
The injection will be given intradermally and for best results should be injected in the 
mid- dermis.   The treatment technique and the volume per treatment should be as similar as 
possible on both sides of the face. 
For many subjects with moderate NLFs, one syringe will be adequate per NLF .  Based on the 
iGAI score at that time, a touch- up treatm ent may be administered at Visit 2/Week 2.   
For this study, topical anesthetic will not be used.  Ice may be applied before the treatment  if the 
injecting investigator deems it necessary.   The same technique should be used on both sides of 
the face.  Usin g the nondominant hand to apply gentle downward traction to the inferiormost 
aspect of the fold to immobilize it, the dominant hand is used to inject filler.  Steadying the 
injecting hand on the mandible or the other hand, the linear threading technique is most easily used to deposit the filler beneath the fold and efface it. 
The peri -alar sulcus, a triangular shaped concavity at the upper end of the fold, may be more 
effectively filled with the fanning technique of implantation, where two or three threads are 
deposited in a fan-like array.  Wide portions of the fold may require several threads placed side by side, with gentle massage after each thread is placed.  
Treatment of this area is generally easy and straightforward.  Notice that the fold is partially  
formed by prominent cheek tissue that is lateral to it, with the fold becoming more prominent as the cheek becomes more protuberant.  Therefore, injections should stay medial to the fold to fill it.  Injecting lateral to the fold, in the excessive cheek tissue, can actually tend to accentuate the fold. 
Bruising is the most common side effect in this area and usually resolves in 5 to 7 days.  The 
facial artery runs below the fold and necrosis is possible, al though rare.

SYM 2016- 02 Version :  1.0  
Revanesse® Ultra +  08 July  2016 
 
Confidential Implantation Technique  
After removing any make-up, the area to be treated should be cleansed with an alcohol prep pad 
or some other antiseptic.  It is useful to avoid having the subject completely recline as the 
contours of some facial folds change in the supine position. 
The viscosity of stabilized HA gel fillers  decreases with increasing  temperature.  The syringe 
should be warmed in the hand for a few minutes prior to injection.  Use the syringe s labeled 
LEFT to treat the left NLF and the syringe labeled RIGHT to treat the right NLF.   
Before injecting the subject , push the plunger forward to feel the intrinsic resistance of the filler 
moving through the needle, until a small droplet appears at the needle tip.  Wipe off the droplet 
with a sterile pad and begin injection. 
The linear threadi ng technique is probably the most commonly used.  Holding the syringe 
parallel to the length of the NLF to be treated, pierce the skin and advance the needle to its fullest extent.  Then, while slowly withdrawing the needle, apply even pressure on the plunger to dispense material into dermis.  Relieve pressure just before withdrawing the needle from the skin 
to avoid leakage.  Several successive “threads” below, above, or beside previous injections may 
be required to fill larger folds. 
Enter the skin with a needle angle of 30°, 45°, or parallel to the skin.  It is recommended to keep 
the needle bevel up so the tip of the needle is seen and more precisely controlled where the skin is pierced.  Keep the tip of the needle at constant depth during implantation, depositing all filler material within the same plane to get even results.  The depth of needle placement (and thus filler implantation) should be mid-dermis for NLFs, where the needle’s contour should be visible through the subject’s skin, but the needle’s color is not visible. 
After injection, manually massage the area gently to smooth out any nodular or uneven areas, 
and ensure the implanted material conforms to the contour of surrounding tissues.  Using an ice pack or other cold compress can help to mini mize swelling and alleviate post injection 
discomfort.   
The subject  should be injected so that an optimal correction is achieved.  If overcorrected, 
massage firmly between fingers or against underlying bone to obtain optimal results.  
Approximately 20% overcorrection can be massaged out; more will lead to a persistent unwanted cosmetic result.  
8.4.4 Blinding of Study Product 
Injections of the study product prior to Week 24 are performed by the unblinded injecting investigator.  The blinded evaluator is not allowed to retrieve study supplies or to be present during opening of the study supplies or during the injections.  The injecting investigator is not to have any discussion with the blinded evaluator or subjects regarding the treatments. 
Subjects are blinded to treatment assignment of each NLF.  Subjects are physically masked 
(blindfolded) just prior to and during all injection procedures to prevent observation of the syringes containing study product. 
Subjects, investigators, the sponsor’s staff conducting the study, and members of the 
administrative team will not have access to individual subjects’ treatment assignments.  In the

have provided written informed consent and have met all entry criteria.  Study products may not 
be used for any purpose other than as stated in the protocol. 
8.4.6 Study Product Accountability  
Study products will be ava ilable on site for each subject.  Receipt of study products will be 
documented and confirmed via the Investigational Product Receipt Form.  All study products 
must be kept in a locked area with access restricted to designated study personnel  in a climate -
controlled, limited access area.  The administration  of study products will be recorded on the 
Study Product Dispensing Log.  The site monitor will periodically check the supply of study 
products held by the investigator or pharmacist to ensure accountability.  At study conclusion, all unused study products will be returned to the sponsor and documented using the Investigational Product Return Form. 
Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by the study monitor and/or auditor, 
and open to inspection  by regulatory authorities  at any time.

Subjects who had used hormonal contraception and stopped must have stopped no less than 90 days prior to Visit 1/Day  1. 
8.6.7 Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS) 
Pain from the injection will be assessed at each NLF by the subject using a 100- mm VAS scale 
from 0 = no pain to 100 = w orst possible pain ( Figure  1) at Visit 1/Day 1 immediately after the 
injection and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post injection .  At Visit 2/Day 14, this assessment will 
be performed for subjects who do not have a touch- up treatment and  prior to touch-up, 
immediately after the injection and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post injection for subjects who do have a touch -up treatment.  Subjects will be asked the question “How would you rate your pain 
from the injection of study material?” and will respond by plac ing a mark on the VAS.

8.6.8 Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS)  
1. Absent - No visible fold; continuous skin line. 
2. Mild - Shallow but visible fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature; 
implant is expected to produce a slight improvement in appearance. 
3. Moderate - Moderately deep folds; clear facial feature visible at normal 
appearance but not when stretched; excellent correction is expected from 
injectable implant.  
4. Severe - Very long and deep folds; prominent facial feature; less than 2 mm 
visible when stretched; significant improvement is expected from injectable implant.  
5. Extreme - Extremely deep and long folds, detriment al to facial appearance; 2 to 
4 mm visible V -shaped fold when stretched; unlikely to have satisfactory 
correction with injectable implant alone.

(Visit 1/Day 1, Visit 2/Week 2, Visit 3/Week  4, Visit 4/Week 12, and Visit 5/Week 24 [End of 
Study/Early Termination ]) by a n evaluator blinded to the treatment assignment of each NLF .   
8.6.9 Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee to 
ensure that the subject qualifies for the study. 
8.6.10 Investigator Ease of Use Assessment  
The Investigator will assess overall ease of use by the device by circling the appropriate number 
on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 being not easy to 10 being most easy  at 
Visit 1/Day  1.   
8.6.11 Evaluation for Touch- up 
If the iGAI score = 3 or 4  at Visit 2/Week 2, a touch -up treatment will be administered.   
8.6.12 Patient G lobal Aesthetic Improvement (pGAI) Score 
The pGAI score is a 5 -point scale used to assess the subject’s satisfaction with the visual 
appearance of their NLF correction after treatment by assessment of wrinkle improvement using 
the following categories: 
1. Worse – the appearance is worse than the original condition. 
2. No change – the appearance is the same as the original condition.  
3. Improved – obvious improvement in appearance from the initial condition.  A 
touch-up might further improve the result. 
4. Much improved – marked improvement in appearance from the initial condition, 
but not completely optimal.  A touch-up might slightly improve the result 
5. Very much improved – optimal cosmetic result.  
The GAI S score will be assessed for each NLF  at Visit 2/W eek 2, Visit 3/Week 4, 
Visit 4/Week  12, and Visit 5/Week 24 (End of Study/Early Termination).   Subjects will be asked 
the question “How would you rate improvement in your appearance compared to your initial condition using the scale below?”  Treatment success is defined as at least a 1 -grade 
improvement from pre- treatment.  
8.6.13 Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement (iGAI) Score 
The iGAI score is a 5 -point scale with the following categories:  
1. Worse – the appearance is worse than the original condition. 
2. No change – the appearance is the same as the original condition.  
3. Improved – obvious improvement in appearance from the initial condition.  
A touch-up might further improve the result. 
4. Much improved – marked improvement in appearance from the initial condition, 
but not completely optimal.  A touch- up might slightly improve the result.

8.8 Efficacy Assessments  
8.8.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders immediately after injection, where 
a responder is defined as a subject who  had a within -subject difference (Revanesse Ultra – 
Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain score of at least 10 mm. 
8.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary  efficacy endpoints are the proportion of responders at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes 
post injection and at 2 weeks post injection (prior to touch-up).   
8.8.3 Other Efficacy Endpoint s 
Other  efficacy endpoints include change in WSRS score from baseline, pGAI, and iGAI at each 
scheduled post- baseline visit. 
8.9 Assessment of Safety  
8.9.1 Safety Endpoints 
Safety of the study products will be compared by evaluating the nature, severity, and frequency 
of treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs).  All AEs that occur during the study will be 
recorded whether or not they are considered to be related to treatment.  A description of the AE 
will be recorded with the date of onset, date of resolution, severity of the AE, relationship to the study product, action taken, and the outcome. 
8.9.2 Definition s of Terms   
8.9.2.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated wi th the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug- related (21 Code of Federal Regulations [ CFR ] 
312.32 (a)).  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disea se temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
Expected adverse events are defined as th e events that  appeared at injection site subsequent to 
the first injection.  Expected adverse events may include but are not limited to bruising, swelling, 
erythema, edema, inflammation at injection site.  
8.9.2.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is  defined as any AE for which there is reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the AE (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).

Prollenium Medical Technologies Inc.  Page 29 of 55 
SYM 2016- 02 Version :  1.0  
Revanesse® Ultra +  08 July  2016 
 
Confidential 8.9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the labeling for the  study products. 
8.9.2.4 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE or SAR that, in the view of the investigator or sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)): 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (Note: the term “life -threatening” as used here refers to an event that 
in the view of the investigator or sponsor places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not include an AE or SAE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death [21 CFR 312.32(a)]) 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Any “other” important medical even t.  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
8.9.2.5 Planned Hospitalization  
A hospitalization planned by the subject prior to signing the ICF is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history.  If the planned hospitalization or procedure occurs as planned, the record in the subject’s medical history is considered complete.  However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an AE. 
8.9.2.6 Pregnancy 
Pregnancies occurring after the administration of study product require immediate reporting.  
They must be reported within 24 hours after the investigator has become aware of the pregnancy.  
A pregnancy report will be completed and sent by fax to Symbio within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the pregnancy.  The investigator will collect follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant that must also be reported to the sponsor or designee.  Upon awareness of the outcome of the pregnancy, the PI or designee must forward a follow-up Pregnancy Report with any relevant information to Symbio.

Confidential If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investi gator will 
report the event by faxing a completed SAE report form to Symbio within 24 hours of being 
notified of the pregnancy report. 
The subject should immediately be withdrawn from the study.   8.9.2.7 Monitoring 
8.9.3 Monitoring Adverse Events  and Laboratory Evaluations 
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs, immediately after 
treatment initiation .  Each subject will be followed for safety monitoring until discharged from 
the study.  Follow-up procedures related to pregnancy or AEs or SAEs may continue beyond the 
end of the study. 
Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by the investigator or a qualified designee for 
occurrence of AEs  throughout the study.  The presence or  absence of specific AEs should not be 
elicited from subjects.   In addition, subjects will be instructed to record AEs on the subject diary 
card during the 2 weeks after treatment.  Subjects having AEs will be monitored with relevant 
clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as determined by the investigator. 
AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow-up results must be recorded on the CRF , as 
well as in the subject’s source documentation.   For all AEs that require the subject to be withdrawn from the study and SAEs, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests will be repe ated as clinically appropriate until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
8.9.4 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.9.4.1 Assessment of Severity 
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions: 
Mild :  AE that was easily tole rated  
Moderate : AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity  
Severe : AE that pre vented normal daily activities  
8.9.4.2 Assessment of Causality 
A medically -qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of the study product, as unlikely related, possibly related, or probably related, based on 
available information, using the following guidelines:   
Unlikely related:   no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, 
or the drug, biological, or device cannot be implicated based on available information 
Possibly related:   temporal association but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; 
however, involvement of the drug, biological, or device cannot be excluded based on 
available information

8.9.4.3 Reference Safety Information for Assessing Expectedness of Adverse Events  
The reference safety information for assessing the expectedness of an AE for the study product  
in this study is the  Revanesse Plus Instructions for Use  and the Revanesse Ultra  Instructions for 
Use.   
8.9.5 Reporting Safety Observations 
Any SAE , whether deemed product-related or not, must be reported to Symbio by telephone or 
fax as soon as possible after the investigator or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence.  
The investigator/coordinator must complete a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Form and fax it to 
Symbio along with the subject’s Adverse Events Log and Concomitant Medications Log within 
24 hours of notification  of the event.  Symbio will notify the sponsor immediately upon 
notification of the event from a study site to allow for reporting to the United States Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA ) in a timely fashion.  T he sponsor will notify the FDA of device -
related S AEs.

The Sponsor must submit a written summary of the clinical course of any life- threatening SAE 
and related subject information to the FDA within 7 days.  Serious and unexpected AEs that are 
not life -threatening must be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days.  Any serious and 
unexpected A E (including all deaths) must also be reported to the IRB /IEC  by the investigator 
according to IRB reporting requirements and documentation of this report sent to Symbio. 
The investigator must provide a follow-up written report within 5 calendar days of reporting the 
event to the medical monitor.  The written report must contain a full description of the event and any sequelae.  Subjects who have had an SAE must be followed clinically until all parameters (including laboratory) have either returned to normal or are s tabilized.  
8.9.6 Withdrawal, Treatment Interruption, and Unblinding of Blinded Treatment Due to Safety Observations  
8.9.6.1 Withdrawal 
See Section  8.3.3 for the criteria for withdrawing a subject.  If a subject is withdrawn  from the 
study , the activities specified for Visit 6/Week 24  on the Study Flow Chart ( Section  3.2) should 
be completed if possible. 
8.9.6.2 Unblinding Treatment for a Subject During the Study 
Unblinding by the investigator should occur only in the event of an AE or SAE  for which it is 
necessary to know the study treatment to determine an appropriate course of therapy for the 
subject.  In the event of an emergency that requires breaking of the study blind, randomization code envelopes will be maintained by each investigator that can be opened to reveal the study product.

Confidential Envelopes that have been opened at the study site must be returned to the sponsor accompanied 
by a written explanation of the reason why the blind was broken. 
If unblinding occurs, the subject must be wit hdrawn from the study. 
8.10 Criteria for Early Termination of the Study  
The trial  may be termin ated because of safety concerns. Where termination is deemed 
appropriate, there will be timely  communication with FDA in accordance with the regulation  
(21 CFR 812.150 (devices)). The  sponsor , Prollenium Medical Technologies, will initiate 
discussion as soon as possible about t he appropriate course of action  for the trial in question and 
for the investigational product. There will be immediate follow up by the company to investigate 
any potential safety  concern.  
The clinical study may be stopped if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of emerging 
effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population as a whole is  
unacceptable.  In the event of an unanticipated serious adverse event or death, the sponsor, 
Prollenium Medical, will submit to the agency,  and to the reviewing IRB , a report as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the investigator / sponsor first learns of the effect.  Thereafter the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as 
FDA requests .  
The following conditions are considered as cause for termination of the study: 
Any death related to the study treatment  
Unanticipated treatment emergent related AEs  reported as severe in the opinion of the 
Investigator in > 7 of the subjects 
Unanticipated treatment emergent related AEs reported as moderate in the opinion of the 
Investigator in > 43 of the subjects  
 
Unanticipated t reatment emergent related AEs reported as mild in the opinion of the 
Investigator and unresolved at 14 days in > 98 of the subjects 
 
Duration of AEs lasting more than 4 weeks 
Increased incidence of Phy sician diagnosed unexpected AEs 
Increased occurrence of extreme swelling of the face, hypersensitivity 
reactions/anaphylaxis  
Anticipated Adverse Effects:  Injection -related reactions might occur, such as transient erythema, 
swelling, pain, itching, discoloration, or tenderness at the injection s ite.  These reactions may last 
for 1 week.  Nodules or induration are also possible at the injection site. Glabellar necrosis, abscess formation, granulomas, and hypersensitivity have all been reported with injections of HA products.  Reactions thought to be of hypersensitivity in nature have been reported in less than 1 in every 1,500 treatments.  These have consisted of prolonged erythema,  swelling, and induration at the implant site.

Confidential Unanticipated adverse events related to the injection will be evaluated as they occur by the 
sponsor and physician (the
se may include injection site adverse events not listed above, such as 
hyperpig
mentation, pru
ritus, papule, burning, hypopigmentation, and injection s ite scab). These 
events will be evaluated based on their severity and duration, and if deemed necessary, the study will be stopped. 
Any serious adverse ev
ent, and / or systemic response, or condition, that requires hospitalization 
following injection, in particular those deemed related to the injection, will be evaluated based 
on their severity and duration, and if deemed necessary, the study will be stopped. All reported events will be reviewed on a weekly basis during the clinical study team meeting.  
In addition, further recruitment in the study or at (a) particular site(s) may be stopped due to 
insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP, and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure-related problems, or the number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.  
9 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Prior to the database lock, a detailed, finalized Statistical Analysis Plan will be completed and 
placed on file.  The Statistical Analysis Plan will contain a more comprehensive explanation  than 
that provided here of the methodology used in the stati stical analyses, as well as  the rules and 
data handling conventions used to perform the analyses and the procedure used to  account for 
missing data.  
9.1 Analysis Populations 
Three populations are defined for the analyses. 
• Intent- to-treat (ITT) (safety population):  All randomized subjects who received study 
product. 
• Modified intent- to-treat (mITT):  All randomized subjects who met the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized, received both study products, and returned for at least 1  post- injection assessment of pain score immediately post injection from both 
sides of the face.    
• Per-protocol (PP):  All randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
received both study products ; completed Visit 5/Week 24 within the specified window; 
had data on pain  score from both sides of the face  immediately post injection  and at 15, 
30, 45, and 60 minutes post injection at Visit 1/Day1; had data on pain score at 2 weeks post injection  (prior to touch-up); and had no significant protocol violations that would 
affect the treatment evaluation.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and PP populations.  Safety analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
9.2 General Considerations  
Two-sided hypothesis testing will be conducted for all tests.  Resulting p -values less than  0.05 
will be considered statistically significant unless noted otherwise.  No adjustments of p- values 
Page 35 of 56

Revanesse® Ultra +  08 July  2016 
 
Confidential for multiple comparisons will be made.  SAS software (version 9.1.3) will be used for all data 
analyses and tabulations. 
Missing efficacy data will be imputed via the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method in 
the mITT analysis. For the PP population, efficacy analysis will be performed using all the available data without imputation for the missing values.  
For demographic and baseline characteristics and the safety profile, each variable will be analyzed using the existing data. Subjects with missing data will be excluded only from the analyses for which data are not available.  
9.3 Comparability of Subjects at Baseline (or Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant Medications) 
Baseline and demographic characteristic variables  (including date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, 
and Fitzpatrick skin type) will be tabulated using descriptive statistics. For each continuous variable, the summary will include the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  For each categorical variable, the summary will include frequencies and perce ntages.  
9.4 Efficacy Evaluations 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of responders immediately after injection, where 
a responder is defined as a subject who  had a within- subject difference (Revanesse Ultra minus 
Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain scor e of at least 10 mm on a 100- mm scale .  The  VAS score 
will be summarized for each treatment and for the within -subject difference with mean, standard 
deviation ( SD), minimum, median, and maximum.  The proportion of responders will be 
summarized with  frequency  and percentage.  A 95% CI for proportion of responders will be 
constructed using a one- sample binomial exact test.  If the lower  bound of this 95% CI is greater 
than 50%, the t est product will be claimed to be superior to the c omparator product.  The primary 
endpoint will be summarized by site descriptively.  
The s econdary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of responders at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes 
post injection and at 2 weeks post injection (prior to touch-up).  Upon the significance of the primary efficacy outcome, secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a hierarchical approach will be used.  If success is achieved at 15 minutes, 30 minutes will be evaluated; if success is achieved at 30 minutes, 45 minutes will be evaluated; if success is achieved at 45 minutes, 60 minutes will be evaluated ; and if success is achieved at 60 minutes, 2 weeks post- injection will 
be evaluated . 
Other efficacy variables include change in WSRS score from baseline, pGAI, and iGAI at each scheduled post- baseline visit.  Descriptive summaries will be provided for each treatment and for 
within -subject difference . 
All efficacy analyses will be performed for both the PP and mITT populations.  For the primary endpoint, the results from mITT  are considered definitive and those from PP supportive. 
9.4.1 Handling of Missing Data  
There will not be missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint for the mITT and PP  based on 
the definitions of these analysis populations ( Section 9.1).

Confidential For the mITT analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints, missing VAS scores will be replaced 
using the multiple imputation (MI) method.  To evaluate the robustness of MI method, subjects 
with missing VAS scores will be considered in two different ways: (1) as non-responders to the test product (worse case scenario), and (2) as responders to the test product (best case scenario).  
Other efficacy endpoints will be tabulated using the observed data; no missing values will be replaced in the analyses.  
9.4.2 Interim Analys is 
One interim analysis is planned  after all subjects have completed Visit 3 or discontinued prior to 
Visit 3.  The purpose is to determine the safety and pain relief of Revanes se Ultra  + to support 
regulatory submissions outside the US that are currently under review for products containing lidocaine. The sponsor does not plan to change the protocol or stop the study based on the results of the interim analysis.  
To maintain the integrity of the study, there will be a separate Statistical Analysis Plan for the 
interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed by an independent group that is not 
involved in the day- to-day trial activities.  Access to the interim analysis results will be strictly 
limited to people who are not directly involved in the study conduct. 
Because no change in the study conduct is planned based on the results of the interim analysis, 
the Haybittle -Peto method will be used to guard the overall Type 1 error rate, with a 0.001 level 
of significance for the interim analysis and a 0.05 level of significance for the final analysis.  
9.5 Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 15.1 or higher).  
TEAEs are defined as events that appear subsequent to the first injection or that were present  
prior to the first injection but worsened in intensity after the first injection.  TEAEs may include, 
but are not limited to, injection site bruising, injection site discoloration, injection site edema, injection site erythema, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, and injection site swelling.  
Frequency and percent of subjects reporting TEAEs of injection site reaction s will be tabulated 
for ea ch treatment by preferred terms, and further by severity.  In summaries of severity, subjects 
who reported more than one event in a treatment arm that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once in that treatment arm under the strongest severity.  
For other AEs where an  association with either treatment may not be clearly identified, including 
systemic TEAEs, frequency and percent of subjects will be tabulated to treated subjects as one 
group by preferred terms and system organ class, an d further by severity and relationship to 
study device.  In summaries of severity and relationship, subjects who reported more than one 
event that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once under the strongest severity and relationship.  
Adverse events will be summarized using the ITT population. SAEs will be discussed within the clinical study report.  Data collected pertaining to SAEs  will 
be presented in data listings.

9.6 Sample Size Determination  
Restylane -L Injectable Gel  was approved in supplement P040024/S039 on January 29, 2010 for 
mid-to-deep dermal implantation for the correction of moderate to severe facial w rinkles and 
folds such as NLFs.  For the supplement study (MA-1100-001), the primary endpoint was the 
proportion of subjects who had a within- subject difference in VAS (Restylane minus 
Restylane -L) pain assessment of at least 10 mm at injection. The objective was to show that the 
95% confidence interval for the within- subject difference lay above 50%.   The key study results 
are shown in  Table 2 ( Source: Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data (SSED), for 
Restylane -L Injectable Gel ). 
Table 2 Subjects with at Least a 10 mm Difference in VAS ( Restylane – Restylane-L ) 
 
The following sample size is calculated based on the data from the above Restylane- L study , 
assuming t hat similar statistics  and the same criterion  will be applicable for Revanesse Ultra  + vs 
Revanesse Ultra.  
Table 3 Sample Size Calculations  
Proportion of 
Responders  Power by N (Number of mITT subjects) 
N=90  N=80  
70% 97.2%  94.1%  
68% 93.3%  87.8%  
 
To detect the difference between the null hypothesis proportion of responders of 50% and the 
alternative proportion of responders of 70% via a two- sided exact binomial test with a 
0.05 significance level, 80 mITT subjects will supply a power of 94.1 %. For the alternative 
proportion of responders of 68%, 80 mITT subjects will supply a power of 87.8%.  
A total of 100 subjects will be randomized to obtain 80 mITT subjects and to provide adequate 
data for monitoring safety of the study product.

monitor and a copy retained with the CRF s. 
A CRF must be completed and signed by the investigator for each subject enrolled, including 
those withdrawn  from the study for any reason.  The r eason for withdrawal  must be noted on a 
subject’s  study termination form. 
CRFs must be kept current to reflect the subject’s status at each phase during the course of the study.  Subjects are not to be identified on CRFs by name; appropriately coded identification and the subject’s initials must be used.  The investigator must keep a separate log of the subjects’ names and addresses.  
Source documents such as the clinic chart are to be maintained separately from the CRF  to allow 
data verification.  Because of the potential for errors, inaccuracies, and ill egibility in transcribing 
data o nto CRFs , originals of laboratory and other test results must be kept on file with the 
subject ’s CRF .  CRFs , source documents, and copies of test results must be availab le at all times 
for inspection by the study monitor.  The following should also be available for review: 
• Subject Screening Log, which should reflect the reason any subject screened for the s tudy

performed as a requirement of the study.  During monitoring visits the monitor will validate CRF 
entries  against these sources of data.  
11.3 Study Monitoring  
Symbio will be responsible for monitoring the study according to GCP  and applicable 
regulations.  The study will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) in compliance with GCP,  ICH guidelines, and applicable regulations.  The investigator will be visited by a CRA  
prior to the study and at regular intervals during the course of the study.  These visits are to  
verify adherence to the protocol.  The CRA  will review the  ICFs  and ver ify CRF entries by 
comparing them with the source documents (hospital/clinic/office records) that will be made available for this purpose.  The CRA  will review the maintenance of regulatory documentation 
and product accountability.  The monitor will review  the progress of the study with the 
investigator and other site personnel on a regular basis .  CRFs  may be collected during these 
visits.  At the end of the study, a closeout monitoring visit will be performed.  Monitoring visits will be arranged with site  personnel in advance at a mutually acceptable time.  Sufficient time 
must be allowed by the site personnel for the monitoring of CRFs and relevant source documents.  The coordinator and/or investigator should be available to answer questions or resolve da ta clarifications.  Adequate time and space for these visits should be made available by 
the investigator and study staff. 
11.4 Audits and Inspections  
During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, 1 or more site s may be audited 
by authorize d representatives of the sponsor.  The purpose of the audit is to determine whether or 
not the study is being conducted and monitored in compliance with recognized GCP/ICH 
guidelines and regulations . 
Additionally, the study may be inspected by regulatory authorities .  These inspections may take 
place at any time during  or after completion of the study and are based on local regulations. 
11.5 Modifications to the Protocol 
The procedures defined in the protocol and CRFs will be carefully reviewed to ensure that all 
parties involved with the study fully understand the protocol.  To ensure the validity of the data, no deviations from the protocol ( with minimal exceptions ) may be made unless the issue is broad 
enough to warrant revision of the protocol.  Such revisions must be submitted to and have documented approval from the sponsor and IRB /IEC  prior to implementation.  The only

COMPOSITION  
Cross -linked hyaluronic acid (High Viscosity) 25 mg/mL 
Lidocaine 0.3% w/w  
In phosphate buffered saline  
[Cross -linked with Butanediol -diglycidylether (BDDE)]  
 
DESCRIPTION  
Revanesse® Ultra + is a colorless, odorless, transparent and aqueous gel of synthetic 
origin. The gel is stored in a pre- filled disposable syringe. Each box contains two 1ml 
syringes of Revanesse® Ultra + along with two sterilized needles. The product is being 
evaluated to compare the safety  and efficacy  profiles  of Revanesse®  Ultra  + 
(with lidocaine, hereafter referred to as Revanesse Ultra +) to Revanesse Ul tra for 
subjects undergoing correction of nasolabial folds (NLFs). The product is not currently approved by US FDA.  
 
APPLICATION RANGE / INDICATIONS  
Revanesse® Ultra + is intended for nasolabial fold correction. The product is intended 
for injection into the mid to deep dermis for correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds (such as nasolabial folds).  
 
ANTICIPATED SIDE EFFECTS  
Physicians must inform patients that with every injection of Revanesse® Ultra + there 
are potential adverse reactions  that may be delayed or occur immediately after the 
injection. These include but are not limited to:  
 
• Injection -related reactions might occur, such as transient erythema, swelling, 
pain, itching, discoloration or tenderness at the injection site. These reactions may last for one  week.  
 
• Nodules or induration are also possible at the injection site. 
 
• Poor product performance due to improper injection technique.

Confidential • Glabellar  necrosis, abscess formation,  granulomas  and hypersensitivity  have all 
been reported with injections  of hyaluronic  acid products.  It is important  for 
physicians  to take these reactions  into account  on a case by  case basis. 
 
Reactions thought to be of hypersensitivity in nature have been reported in less than 
one in every 1500 treatments. These have consisted of prolonged erythema, 
swelling and induration at the implant site.  
 
These reactions have started either shortly after injection or after a delay of 2 – 4 
weeks and have been described as mild or moderate, with an average duration of 2 
week s. Typically, this reaction is self -limiting and resolves spontaneously with time. 
However, it is imperative that patients with hypersensitivity type reactions contact their physician immediately for assessment. Patients with multiple allergic reactions should be excluded from the treatment.  
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Confidential 15.2 Revanesse Ultra  Instructions for Use  
 
Revanesse Ultra   
 
COMPOSITION  
Cross -linked hyaluronic acid (High Viscosity)  25 mg/mL  
In phosphate buffered saline [Cross -linked with Butanediol -diglycidylether (BDDE)]  
 
DESCRIPTION  
Revanesse Ultra is a colorless, odorless, transparent and aqueous  gel of synthetic origin. The gel is 
stored in a pre-filled disp osable syringe. Each box contains two 1ml syringes of Revanesse Ultra along 
with two sterilized needles.  The product is being evaluated to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of 
Revanesse Ultra + (with lidocaine, hereafter referred to as Revanesse Ultra +) to Revanesse Ultra for 
subjects  undergoing correction of nasolabial folds (NLFs). The product is not currently approved by US 
FDA.  
 
APPLICATION RANGE / INDICATIONS  
Revanesse Ultra  is intended for nasolabial fold correction. The product is intended for injection into the 
mid to deep dermis for correction of  moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds (such as nasolabial 
folds).  
 ANTICIPATED SIDE EFFECTS Physicians must inform patients that with every  injection of Revanesse® Ultra there are potential adverse 
reactions that may be delayed or occur immediately after the injection. These include but are not limited 
to: 
 
• Injection- related reactions might occur, such as transient erythema, swelling, pain, itching, discoloration 
or tenderness at the injection site. These reactions may last for one week.  
 • Nodules or induration are also possible at the injection site.  
 
• Poor product performance due to improper injection technique.  
 
• Glabellar necrosis, abscess formation, granulomas and hypersensitivity have all been reported with 
injections of hyaluronic acid products. It is important for physicians to take these reactions into account on a case by case basis.  
 
Reactions thought to be of hypersensitivity in nature have been reported in less than one in every 1500 
treatments. These have consisted of prolonged erythema, swelling and induration at the implant site.

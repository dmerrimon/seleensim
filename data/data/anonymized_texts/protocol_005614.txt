Protocol Summary  
Title Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction To Improve Cognitive Function During 
Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy  
Short Title  NA 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Brief Summary  This study will use non -invasive neuroimaging (i.e., MRI) to examine whether 
Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) improves neural markers of changes 
in cognitive function for postmenopausal women taking aromatase inhibitor (AI) 
therapy for breast cancer. The pilot randomized controlled trial will obtain preliminary 
efficacy of MBSR versus Health Enhancement Program (HEP) active control to 
improve neural markers of changes in co gnitive function. The final sample will 
include 32 postmenopausal women with breast cancer. MBSR and HEP groups will 
meet for a matched schedule of 8 weekly 2.5 -hour sessions and a one -day weekend 
retreat. Specimen and data collection will be done at three  time points: pre - 
randomization (i.e., within three weeks before beginning the intervention), within 
three weeks after completion of the intervention, and approximately three months  
(+/- 1.5 weeks) post intervention. To obtain effect sizes, change scores for 
neuroimaging parameter estimates will be correlated with change scores for 
measures of neuropsychological function and affect. Differential expression of genes 
will be associated with change scores in neuroimaging parameter estimates.  
Phase  Preliminar y efficacy  
 
 
Objectives  The primary aim is to (1) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of MBSR to improve 
neural markers of changes in cognitive function during AI therapy. The exploratory, 
hypothesis generating aims are to (2) describe relationships between neural 
markers and (a) neuropsychologica l function and (b) affect during MBSR; and (3) 
explore the moderating effect of inter -individual differences in the expression of 
genes involved in stress responses on neural markers of changes in cognitive 
function during MBSR.  
Methodology  Single blind, randomized controlled trial  
 
 
Endpoint  Primary endpoint: Changes in neural markers of cognitive function  
Exploratory endpoints: Changes in neuropsychological function and affect; 
moderating effect of differential expression of genes involved in str ess responses  
Study Duration  Three years  
Participant Duration  Approximately seven months  
Duration of behavioral 
intervention  Eight weeks  
Population  Postmenopausal women with breast cancer in the New York City metropolitan area, 
aged 18 -79 
Study Sites  New York University (NYU Langone Health Perlmutter Cancer Center, Bluestone 
Center for Clinical Research, New York University Center for Brain Imaging)

Description of Study 
Intervention/Procedure  The MBSR group will receive training from a trained instructor during a group - 
based, 2.5 -hour manualized educational activity weekly for eight weeks.  
Activities include body scans, gentle stretching, yoga, and mindful awareness. 
Participants  will be asked  to complete  daily 45-minute  mindfulness  activities  on 
days the group does not meet and a one -day weekend retreat (approximately 
7 hours) to reinforce learning. The HEP group, which was developed to serve 
as an active control for MBSR, will receive manualized health education in 
physical activity, functiona l movement, music therapy, and nutrition —without 
mindfulness instruction —using similar modalities for a matched schedule with 
the same time  requirements.  
Reference Therapy  NA 
Key Procedures  Functional and structural brain imaging, neuropsychological testing, patient - 
reported outcomes, and blood draws  
  
  Statistical Analysis  See statistical analysis plan (SAP).   A formal SAP will be developed for this 
study in consultation with the study biostatistician. Only a general overview of 
study statistics is included in this protocol.

Schematic of Study Design  
 
Note: Informed consent will be obtained after recruitment before any study procedures begin. Of the 32 
subjects recruited with analyzable data, 16 will be randomly assigned to the MBSR group and 16 to the 
HEP group in a permuted block design, stratified by receipt of chemotherapy (i.e., two strata). Up to 40 
participants will be recruited to reach this goal. S ee Table A (Schedule of Events) for details of specific 
assessments and specimens collected at each time point, as well as the intervention timeline.

2 Introduction,  Background  Information  and Scientific  Rationale  
2.1 Background  Information  and Relevant  Literature  
Significance  
Approximately 3.1 million breast cancer survivors are alive today.30 Among women with hormone -receptor 
positive breast cancer, which accounts for 75% of cases, aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy improves 
disease -free and overall  survival  for postmenopausal  women.1 It is typically  prescribed  for at least  five years 
after surgery.1 Symptoms experienced during this extended therapy may include changes in cognitive 
function , such as difficulty with concentration and recall.31  These symptoms may  negatively affect quality 
of life and ability to adhere to prescribed therapy .32 For example, poorer attention (i.e., ability to maintain 
concentration) and working memory (i.e., ability to retain information for seconds or minutes to work with 
it) negatively impact meaningful activities such as work, achieving personal goals, and social 
interactions.33-35 
AI therapy blocks conversion of androgens to estrogen through the enzyme aromatase, which is the 
primary source of estrogen for postmenopausal women.1 Estrogen promotes neural and synaptic 
plasticity, which contributes to growth and maintenance of neurons and white matter tracts that connect 
them.36,37 Objectively and subjectively measured changes in cognitive function associated with AI therapy 
could be mediated through changes in neural structure and function (i.e., neura l markers of cognitive 
changes ) due to AI -therapy induced estrogen deprivation.7,38-40 Co-occurring changes in affect  may be 
associated with cognitive changes and underlying neural markers of cognitive changes.10,11,41 See Figure 
1. 
Neural markers bridge variable 
findings of objective and 
subjective changes in cognitive 
function and changes  in affect.  
For example,  one functional  
magnetic  resonance  imaging  
(fMRI)  study  found  lower  than 
normal activity in the bilateral 
posterior parietal corti ces during 
attention tasks in women ten 
years after chemotherapy  plus 
tamoxifen,  a selective  estrogen  
receptor  modulator  endocrine  
therapy  agent,  compared to  
women  with a history  of breast  
cancer  treated  without  
chemotherapy  or anti-estrogen  
therapy.42 Women who received 
systemic therapy responded 
more quickly during these tasks, 
which reduced their accuracy 
and effectiveness.42 A similar 
association was found in an fMRI study of women three years after chemotherapy  with or without  
tamoxifen  compared  to women  without  breast  cancer.43 In this study,  women had  reduced  prefrontal  
cortical  activation  during  a memory  encoding  task but increased  activity  in the same brain region during 
memory recall.43 In addition, they showed poorer attention, as evidenced by greater response 
impulsivity.43 The researchers hypothesized that poorer attention reduced the ability to encode memories

 successfully  so that greater  effort  was needed  to retrieve  these  poorly  encoded  memories.43 The unique 
contribution of anti -estrogen therapy to cognitive changes in both studies was not testable, so it is unclear 
whether the findings were related to chemotherapy, anti -estrogen therapy, or their combination. These  
findings  suggest  that poorer  attention  is closel y related  to poorer  function  in other  cognitive  domains 
(slower  performance,  impaired  memory),  and that deficits  may be explained  by neural  markers.  
Relationships between AI therapy and neural markers of cognitive changes may be moderated by inter - 
individual differences in expression of genes involved in stress responses (e.g., inflammation 
pathways).44 Peripheral inflammation is communicated to the b rain through the vagus nerve.45,46 In 
response, microglial cells in the brain produce inflammatory cytokines.45 Central cytokines may damage 
neurons and neuroglia by inducing oxidative stress.47 Damage may be less likely to be repaired due to AI - 
induced e strogen deprivation.  
Mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) is a well -tested intervention in the general population for 
improving stress -related outcomes.48 Its use has been linked to neural markers associated with stress.49 
Inter-individual variability  in the expression of genes involved in stress responses could moderate 
relationships between MBSR and neural markers during AI therapy.50,51 Neural markers of changes in 
cognitive function may correspond to improved self -report and neuropsychological meas ures of cognitive 
function. Although neural deficits have been shown to improve in stressed adult populations using 
MBSR,25,28 it is not known whether the intervention improves neural deficits in women taking AI therapy, 
which may reduce neural plasticity.  
Summary. AI therapy may result in changes in cognitive function. Neural markers of cognitive changes 
may underlie changes in cognitive function and affect. Inter -individual differences in stress responses may 
be associated with variability in neural marke rs. The R00 study will test preliminary efficacy of an 
intervention targeted at modifiable stress responses to improve neural markers of changes in cognitive 
function during AI therapy.  
Innovation  
The R00 study appears to be the first to evaluate neural ma rkers of cognitive changes in women 
undergoing AI therapy during an MBSR intervention targeting stress responses. Neural markers may 
bridge gaps in understanding of how stress reduction interventions impact more distal objective and 
subjective measures of cognitive function. Because cognitive function and affect are closely linked, the 
study will incorporate emotion processing into the cognitive neuroimaging task. Although a previous study 
found a significant relationship between worry and cognitive functio n,10 no studies have described neural 
markers using a task that engages cognitive and emotion processing simultaneously in the context of a 
stress -reduction intervention. The R00 study will integrate genomics and neuroimaging by evaluating the 
moderating r elationship of inter -individual differences in the expression of genes involved in stress 
responses on variability in neural markers.  
2.2 Rationale  
Adjuvant AI therapy improves disease -free and overall survival for postmenopausal women after surgery 
for hormone  receptor -positive  breast  cancer.1 Among  symptoms  associated  with AI therapy  are changes  in 
cognitive function.2,3 Up to 25% of postmenopausal women with breast cancer report that they experience 
changes in cognitive function during AI therapy.4-7 Studies using neuropsychological tests found subtle 
deteriorations  in  verbal2,8   and  visual2   learning  and  memory —as  well  as  concentration, working 
memory, and executive function —for as many as a third of these patients.9 Changes in cognitive function  
may be associated  with changes  in affect  (e.g.,  worry,10 depressive  symptoms7,11). Neural  markers of 
cognitive changes , including changes in brain function and structure, may underlie changes in cognitive 
function.  
The investigators’  recent  preliminary  neuroimaging  work52 to describe  neural  markers  of cognitive  changes 
suggests that postmenopausal women with breast cancer have inefficient cognitive -emotion processing 
before AI therapy, as evidenced by greater neural activity in the hippocampus (working memory) and 
amygdala  (emotion  processing)  during  task performance  compared  to controls.  During  AI therapy,  patients 
show differential activation compared to controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (executive function 
and working memory), medial prefrontal cortices (cortical control of amygdala responses), and 
hippocampus.

 Study number: 17 -00995  
Version: 2.2  page 8  
 In previous work by our group looking at changes in neuropsychological performance with AI therapy,9 we 
found that, compared to controls, postmenopausal women in the first 18 months of AI therapy (a) declined 
in working memory and concentration performance in the first six months, recovered to ba seline (i.e., pre - 
AI therapy) levels by one year and then had a second decline in performance in these cognitive domains 
through 18 months; and (b) had poorer executive function performance pre -AI therapy, then improved in 
executive function performance i n the first six months of therapy, which matched performance 
improvements by controls. However, women on AI therapy then remained flat in their performance while 
controls continued to improve (possibly due to practice effects) through 18 months.  
Taken toge ther, women with breast cancer experienced poorer cognitive performance in some cognitive 
domains  before  AI therapy;  in other  cognitive  domains  they experienced  a pattern  of decline,  recovery,  and 
then a second  decline.  It is unclear  what  happens  after 18 months,  but other  groups  have  noted  that some 
women have persistent cognitive problems. These patterns of neuropsychological performance suggest 
that it is important to intervene before AI therapy and later in AI therapy. Since the therapy is at l east 5 
years, with some women receiving therapy for 10 years, intervening in the first 18 months may prevent or 
alleviate long -term cognitive  problems.  
Stress responses could partially explain relationships between AI therapy and neural markers of cognitiv e 
changes. The Mindfulness Stress -Buffering Account suggests that interventions such as Mindfulness - 
Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may improve stress responses by attenuating negative appraisals of 
stress and reducing reactivity to stressful situations.12 For example, mindfulness meditation improved 
psychological stress responses in women with breast cancer.13-20 It improved some measures of cognitive 
function.21-23 Mindfulness practices reduced physiological markers of stress responses, including 
inflammat ory markers in women with breast cancer13,20,24 and in stressed community adults,25 as well as 
cortisol reactivity for breast cancer survivors26 and during chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.27 Although 
similar neural deficits as the investigators found in  the investigators’ preliminary work have been shown to 
improve in stressed adult populations using MBSR,25,28 it is not known whether the intervention improves 
neural deficits in women taking AI therapy (estrogen, production of which is blocked by AI ther apy, is 
neuroprotective and promotes neural plasticity30,31). Genetic variability was previously found to moderate 
the effect of MBSR on self -reported cognitive function.29 Therefore, it is po ssible that inter -individual 
variability in the expression of genes involved in stress responses could moderate relationships between 
AI therapy and neural markers of cognitive changes during MBSR. Taken together, MBSR may improve 
neural markers of cogniti ve changes shown in preliminary work to be deficient in postmenopausal women 
before and during AI therapy for breast cancer by targeting stress responses. Neural markers of changes 
in cognitive function may correspond to improved self -reported cognitive fu nction and neuropsychological 
function, as well as improved affect.  
Hypothesis : Stress reduction, moderated by gene expression, blunts the impact of AI therapy on neural 
markers of changes in cognitive function, thereby improving cognitive function and aff ect in women with 
breast cancer.  
2.3 Potential Risks &  Benefits  
 
2.3.1 Known Potential  Risks  
This study involves no more than minimal risk, as defined by federal regulations, to research participants. 
The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated for this research are not greater than 
what the population encounters in daily life or during the performance of physical or psychological 
examinations or tests. The only alternative to study participation is non -participation. Non -participation will 
in no way affect the potential participant’s medical care. An infrequent risk of study sc reening, enrollment, 
or participation is breach of confidentiality. For the MRI scan and neuropsychological testing, common 
risks include the possibility that participants may become frustrated or fatigued. Infrequently, some 
participants may become claust rophobic or anxious during a scan, and anxiety may continue even after 
the scan. Sometimes people feel lightheaded when they sit up after a scan. A clinically significant, 
unexpected disease or condition might be identified during the MRI scan as an incide ntal finding. Risks of 
completion of subjective study measures include fatigue and frustration. Common risks of blood draws 
include bruising, bleeding, or soreness; infrequent risks include fainting or infection. An infrequent risk of 
the collection of gen omic information is that breach of confidentiality of genomic research data could 
potentially impact future insurability, employability, and reproduction plans; such a breach might have a

 negative impact on family relationships and result in embarrassment.  Participating in the group -based 
intervention may include uncomfortable social interactions for some participants, and participants may 
become fatigued.  
 
2.3.2 Known Potential  Benefits  
Subjects may not benefit personally from being in this study. Subjects might  experience reduced stress 
and improvements in health by participating in MBSR or HEP. The investigators hope that findings from 
this study lead to better understanding in the future about whether and how MBSR and HEP may improve 
cognitive function in wome n with breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors.  
 
3 Objectives and  Purpose  
The purpose of the pilot randomized controlled trial is to obtain preliminary efficacy of an eight -week, 
group -based MBSR intervention versus HEP active control to improve neural mar kers of changes in 
cognitive function in postmenopausal women receiving AI therapy for breast cancer.  
3.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary aim is to (1) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of MBSR to improve neural markers of 
changes in cognitive function during AI  therapy.  
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
The exploratory, hypothesis generating aims are to (2) describe relationships between neural markers 
and (a) cognitive function and (b) affect during MBSR; and (3) explore the moderating effect of inter - 
individual difference s in the expression of genes involved in stress responses on neural markers of 
changes in cognitive function during MBSR.  
 
4 Study Design and  Endpoints  
4.1 Description of Study  Design  
This study is a pilot, single -center randomized controlled trial of the preliminary efficacy of an eight -week, 
group -based MBSR intervention versus HEP active control (i.e., two groups, parallel design) to improve 
neural markers of changes in cognitive function in postmenopausal women receiving aromatase inhibitor 
therapy for breast cancer. Participants will be stratified in a permuted block design by receipt of 
chemotherapy (i.e., two strata). Data will be collected at up to three time points using a repeated 
measures design (i.e., pre -intervention, post -intervention, approxim ately three months after the 
intervention). The study groups will meet at New York University for MBSR or HEP. Neuropsychological, 
self-report, and biospecimen data collection will be conducted at the Bluestone Center, Meyers College 
of Nursing, or the NYU  Center for Brain Imaging. Neuroimaging data will be collected at the NYU Center 
for Brain Imaging . A portion of the retreat will be performed at a teaching kitchen facility that will be used 
by the HEP trained instructor.  
4.2 Study  Endpoints  
 
4.2.1 Primary Study  Endpoints  
As this pilot randomized controlled trial is designed to provide preliminary efficacy for a future well - 
powered R01 application, the primary endpoint (i.e., preliminary efficacy) will be evaluated using effect 
sizes for neural markers of changes i n cognitive function from before to after MBSR versus HEP.  
 
4.2.2 Secondary Study  Endpoints  
No secondary endpoints.  
 
4.2.3 Exploratory  Endpoints  
Exploratory endpoints will include correlations between neural markers of changes in cognitive function 
(or baseline neural  markers if no changes are found) and changes in (a) cognitive function from before to

 three months after MBSR versus HEP and (b) self -reported affect from before to within three weeks after 
and three months (+/ - three weeks) after the intervention. Explor atory endpoints will also include the 
moderating effect of inter -individual differences in the expression of genes involved in stress responses 
on neural markers of changes in cognitive function. Exploratory endpoints were chosen to gain 
preliminary eviden ce of relationships between neural markers and objectively and subjectively measured 
cognitive and affective phenotypes, as well as to gain preliminary evidence for underlying biological 
mechanisms (i.e., gene expression). See Figure 1 for a graphical repr esentation of these relationships.  
 
5 Study Enrollment and  Withdrawal  
The R00 study will enroll up to 32 evaluable participants (i.e., 16 per group) for the pilot randomized

*If a potential participant reports implanted metal objects, which might be affecte d by MRI magnets, the 
study personnel or MRI technologist will screen over the phone or in person to determine whether the 
potential participant would be safe during the MRI scan. A current list of implants compatible with MRI will 
be consulted ( http://www.mrisafety.com/TheList_search.asp ). 
5.3 Vulnerable  Subjects  
No special classes of people who may be considered vulnerable populations (e.g., fetuses, neonates, 
pregnant women, children less than 16 ye ars of age, prisoners, institutionalized individuals) will be 
recruited into the study.  
5.4 Strategies  for Recruitment  and Retention  
Approximately 640 -800 new postmenopausal patients with early -stage breast cancer are seen at the NYU 
Perlmutter Cancer Center annually. The investigators’ target goal of 16 participants with evaluable data 
recruited in each of years one and two would be a successful recruiting rate of 3%, which is well below

Version: 2.2  page 11  
 the in vestigators’ success rate of 33% of eligible patients using similar recruiting procedures for the K99 
study at the University of Pittsburgh. Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children: All participants in 
the R00 study will be women, since breast cancer primarily affects them. Breast cancer in men is rare, 
accounting for less than 1% of breast cancers in the United States. Moreover, the natural history of male 
breast cancer is different than in women. No one will be excluded on the basis of race or ethnic ity. The 
target enrollment for minority populations is 14 of the participants. The minority population in New York 
City is 25% African American, 12% Asian American, <1% Native American/Pacific Islander, and 16% 
mixed race. The city is 28% Hispanic/Latino o f any race. A particular strength of the NYU Perlmutter 
Cancer Center is its diverse patient population, which includes large multiethnic, international populations 
comprised of medically underserved and minority women with breast cancer. No children under  18 years 
of age will be included in the R00 study. Breast cancer under age 21 is extremely rare, with an incidence 
estimated to be 0.1 per 100,000 women. AI therapy is approved for the adjuvant treatment of 
postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Therefo re, women with breast cancer age 18 and older who 
meet the inclusion criteria in section 5.1 would be eligible for AI therapy and, thus, would be eligible for 
participation in the  study.  
 
The screening procedures for this study vary based on whether the po tential participant is screened (1) 
directly or (2) after contact initiated via a research registry, DataCore, any form of advertisement (e.g., 
study flier, NYU Langone Health media services, social media), or referral from a participant in the 
study. For any recruitment method, the screening script will be followed throughout. It is anticipated that 
120 interested potential participants will go through screening procedures and up to 40 will be enrolled 
to obtain a final evaluable sample size of 32. The exp lanation for these estimates is that (A) a number 
of interested participants will be unable to do MRI due to claustrophobia or MRI -incompatible metal 
implants, and (B) it is anticipated that a number of enrolled participants will have neuroimaging data tha t 
is not evaluable (e.g., head movement, image artifacts).  
 
(1) Initial  screening  procedure  for the study  if screened  directly:  If the potential  participant  meets  eligibility 
criteria as determined during the medical record review (see 5.4.1), the study team member will notify a 
clinician at the site (i.e., treating physician or that physician’s nurse practitioner or physician assistant) of 
the intent  for direct  screening.  If the clinician  approves  and the participant  agrees  to discuss  the study,  as 
determined by the clinician, the team member will screen the potential participant in person for 
eligibility (see final screening procedure below). If the potential participant would prefer, the 
study team member will call to conduct the screening or send information about the study via 
email.  
 
(2) Initial screening procedure for the study after contact initiated via a research registry, DataCore, any 
form of advertisement (e.g., study flier, NYU Langone Health media services, social media), or referral 
from a participant in the study: Any study advertisements will be approved by the IRB. With clinician 
approval, study fliers will be posted in clinics. Patients who are interested in the study may contact study 
staff directly, or their clinicians may refer potent ial participants to study staff. Additional recruitment 
methods will include clinical research registries (e.g., Research Match), NYU internal recruitment email, 
patient letters, identification of potential participants by DataCore and contact through MyCh art at NYU 
Langone Health, NYU Langone Health media services and social media, or referral from patients in the 
study. After contact is initiated via any of these methods, a study team member will determine  eligibility  
using  the final screening  procedure  below.  
 
Final screening procedure common to either of the above initial screening procedures:  
Potential participants must meet screening criteria on the screening form (attached). If the candidate 
reports an implanted metal object, the study staff or the MR I technologist will conduct further screening 
according to the script to determine whether the candidate will be safe in the MRI machine before being 
allowed to begin the study. Candidates are required to be postmenopausal to enroll in the study.  
However, if the MRI technologist requests a pregnancy screening, the candidate will be required to 
complete it before enrolling. If the potential participant is not eligible or decides not to participate, reason 
for ineligibility or refusal will be recorded and the  screening form will be destroyed.

 Study number: 17 -00995  
Version: 2.2  page 12  
 Written, informed consent will be obtained at the initial assessment visit (i.e., TP0) at the Center for Brain 
Imaging, Meyers College of Nursing, or the Bluestone Center for Clinical Research prior to any study 
proce dures, including study assessments, random assignment, and the intervention. After informed 
consent, a urine and saliva toxicology screen will be performed at each of the study time points to 
determine whether controlled substances or alcohol, which might affect results, have recently been 
consumed by the participant.  
 
Multiple means of contact will be collected for enrolled participants, including email, mailing address, and 
phone number. Reminders for study visits will be sent via email, if available, or via one of the other means 
of contact.  
 
5.4.1 Use of DataCore/EPIC  Information  for Recruitment  Purposes  
This study will utilize EPIC to identify potential participants. A study team member who already has (or will 
have been given) access to the medical record will screen for eligibility for the study. The PI and approved 
study staff (e.g., clinical research coordinator) will have access to these search results. During recruitment  
windows,  medical  records  of patients  with scheduled  visits  at study  sites will be reviewed  each workday to 
identify potential participants scheduled for clinic visits the following workday who meet eligibility criteria 
contained in the medical record. Data points reviewed will include sex, age, menopausal status, breast 
cancer diagnosis and staging, comorbidities and previous conditions, surgical history, breast  cancer  
treatment  history,  and medication  use. 
 
Once potential subjects have been identified using EPIC, the study team member will notify the treating 
physician or that physician’s nurse practitioner or physician assistant that they have patients potentially 
eligible to participate. At that point, either of the following will occur:  
• Treating physician or that physician’s nurse practitioner or physician assistant agre es to permit 
study team member to contact potential subjects on their behalf, after the clinician obtains verbal 
consent  from the patient  to be contacted  as a direct approach (see screening  procedure  in 5.4) 
• The study team will  mail the IRB -approved patien t letter to potential subjects, or email a flyer 
through MyChart, if they do not have a scheduled medical appointment after referral to our study 
by a clinician.   
• Provide  physician  or that physician’s  nurse  practitioner  or physician  assistant  with an 
advertisement  to provide  to potential  subjects  
 
Study staff will work with DataCore to identify patients  who may meet inclusion criteria. Specifically, 
DataCore will conduct a query in Epic to find potentially eligible patients. Data points to be searched  in 
this query will include age, diagnoses, and medication use . The query will be run after IRB approval  and 
as needed during the course of the study, depending on recruitment rates . Query results  will be used 
solely for identification of patients who may b e eligible  for the study . Using query results, DataCore  will 
set up  an IRB -approved  contact  message in MyChart for distribution . The recruitment message may be 
repeated ly sent in MyChart  up to two times at two -month intervals . Patients who respond in MyChart that 
they are interested in the study will be contacted by the study team, who will follow the approved 
recruitment procedures. The study team will discard contact information from patients  who do not meet 
inclusion criter ia or who do not wish to participate in the study. If a subject requests information regarding 
opting out of further recruitment for all research, subjects will be directed to contact research -contact -
optout@nyumc.org or 1 -855-777-7858.  
 
Once contact is ma de, approved recruitment language (see script) will be used to communicate the 
reason for the contact, and potential participants will be asked if they are interested in participating in this 
study. Should the potential participant agree, the study team me mber will screen the participant for  
eligibility and provide the potential participant with information regarding next steps. Any recruitment 
information sent by email will utilize Send Safe email. Should a potential participant decide not to 
participate, reason for non -participation will be recorded and screening forms will be destroyed by 
shredding.  
 
If a potential subject requests information regarding opting out of further recruitment for all research, she 
will be directed to ema il research -contact -optout@nyumc.org  or call 855 -777-7858.

Version: 2.2  page 13  
 5.5 Duration of Study  Participation  
The duration of study participation after informed consent is approximately seven months, which includes 
the three assessments (i.e., TP0, TP1, TP2) and the intervention between the TP0 and TP1 
assessments. The time between initial screening and the enrollment visit (i.e. TP0) will vary depending on 
the speed with which a sufficient number of potential participants for  randomization is recruited. The 
investigators plan to recruit in each cycle until a sufficient number of potential participants who meet 
eligibility criteria are recruited, at which point enrollment visits will be scheduled.  Investigators  will 
continue t hese  cycles  until the target sample size of evaluable participants is reached.  
5.6 Total Number of Participants and  Sites  
Recruitment will end when 40 participants are enrolled. It is expected that approximately 40 participants 
will be enrolled to produce 32 e valuable participants.  
5.7 Participant Withdrawal or  Termination  
 
5.7.1 Reasons  for Withdrawal  or Termination  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time on request. An investigator 
may terminate participation in the study if:  
• Any a dverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs 
such  that continued  participation  in the study  would  not be in the best interest  of the participant.  
• The participant  meets  an exclusion  criterion  (either  newly  developed  or not previously 
recognized)  that precludes  further  study  participation.  
• The participant  becomes  claustrophobic  during  an MRI scan.  
• The participant  sustains  a head  injury  between  study  visits.  
• The participant has an MRI-incompatible metal object implanted between assessment visits 
(study  personnel  or an MRI technologist  will determine  whether  any new metal  implants  will be 
safe for MRI according  to the procedure  described  in section  5.2). 
• The participant  fails to attend  at least  70% of intervention  visits.  
• The participant  is lost to follow -up. 
 
5.7.2 Handling  of Participant  Withdrawals  or Termination  
If a participant cannot be contacted for follow -up using all of the contact information collected, no further 
efforts will  be made to contact the participant and that participant will be considered lost to follow -up. 
Abrupt termination of participation in the study intervention poses no safety risk to participants. As this 
study is minimal risk, efforts will not be made to co llect safety and efficacy data after withdrawal.  
 
If participants withdraw or are withdrawn from an intervention cycle, additional participants may be 
added to subsequent cycle(s) to reach recruitment targets for the number of evaluable participants.  
 
Any data and banked specimens collected before withdrawal from the study will be retained for analysis, 
and no new data will be collected. If the participant requests that data and blood samples be destroyed, 
all paper records will be shredded, blood samples w ill be destroyed, and any data already processed into 
computer files will be removed. However, if results based on the participant's data have been submitted 
for publication or presentation before the request is made, the results cannot be removed from the  
publication or presentation.  
 
5.7.3 Premature  Termination  or Suspension  of Study  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided 
by the suspending or terminating party to the PI a nd NINR, depending on who suspends or terminates the 
study. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI will promptly inform the IRB and will 
provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  
 
As this study will evaluate preliminary efficacy, it will not be possible to determine whether the intervention

 is efficacious or futile for this population during the study. Circumstances that may warrant temporary 
suspension or termination or include, bu t are not limited to:  
• Determination  of unexpected,  significant,  or unacceptable  risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance with protocol  requirements  
• Data  that are not sufficiently  complete  and/or  evaluable  with no immediate  feasible  plan to 
compensate  
 
If the study is temporarily suspended, the study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol 
compliance, and/or data quality are addressed and satisfy the sponsor and/or IRB.  
 
6 Behavioral/Social  Intervention  
6.1 Study  Behavioral  or Social  Intervention(s)  Description  
The MBSR group will receive manualized training in mindfulness activities including body scans, gentle 
stretching, yoga, and mindful awareness.48 The HEP control, which was developed to serve as an active 
control to MBSR, will r eceive manualized health education in physical activity, functional movement, 
music therapy, and nutrition —without mindfulness instruction.56 
 
6.1.1 Administration  of Intervention  
MBSR will be administered in person by a trained instructor for eight weekly sessi ons (approximately 2.5 
hours each) and a one -day (approximately 7 hours) retreat. Participants will be asked to complete daily 
45-minute mindfulness activities on days the group does not meet to reinforce learning. Homework 
sessions will be accessible via the Internet or by CD, if preferred by a participant. MBSR activities will 
include walking meditation, gentle yoga, body scan, and instruction in mindfulness.  
 
The HEP active control consists of manualized activities that will be administered by experts in  physical 
activity, functional movement, music therapy, and nutrition using similar modalities for a matched 
schedule with the same time requirements. As detailed in the HEP manual, physical activity will include 
moderate -intensity walking and stretching; functional movement will include balance, stability, and agility; 
music therapy will include music making, song writing, and imagery; and nutrition will include 
recommended nutritional intake and how to improve participants’ current diets.  
 
The groups will  be led by trained instructors who are expert community interventionists and who are 
contracted as consultants with NYU . The group leaders are contracted for work that they routinely do in 
the community . The consultants are not engaged in the research acti vities for this protocol  (e.g., 
collecting data , performing recruitment). The PI and study staff approved by the IRB will oversee the 
protocol -related activities of the groups . In addition, t he IRB-approved research study staff will be on -site 
during the g roups to monitor all activities.   
 
6.1.2 Procedures  for Training  Interventionists  and Monitoring  Intervention  Fidelity  
MBSR instructors have nationally standardized certification requirements, including familiarity with the 
MBSR manual. HEP instructors are considered experts in the specific health education content to be 
covered (e.g., nutritionist, physical therapist). Because HEP instructors have no path to certification in the 
HEP active control condition, the PI will review the specific s ections of the HEP intervention manual with 
each content expert, as appropriate, to establish expectations for intervention fidelity. A study team 
member who is not blinded to group assignment will record intervention sessions, which will be randomly 
asses sed by that study team member for fidelity to the manualized interventions after each cycle of the 
study. Specifically, the study team member will review one randomly chosen treatment session from each 
group (i.e., MBSR, HEP), flag any deviations from the manual, and code any deviations as equivalent or 
non-equivalent to the intent of the manual. If the total non -equivalent deviations from the manual are 
greater than 5% of activities, the PI will meet with the interventionist to evaluate the reason for devi ation 
and whether fidelity can be maintained for the next cycle of the study. If it is determined that the 
interventionist cannot maintain fidelity, a replacement interventionist will be hired.

 The investigators will track feasibility data, including willingness to complete study measures and 
retention rates. Participant engagement will be assessed through attendance records for MBSR or HEP 
sessions, and by percentage of homework completed and mindfu lness activities during study participation 
assessed using REDCap diaries. A link to the weekly REDCap survey will be emailed to participants with 
a reminder to complete the diary. Participants will not be required to be computer literate or have access 
to a computer;  therefore,  if a participant  will not have  access  to REDCap,  paper  diaries  will be provided.  
 
7 Study Procedures and  Schedule  
7.1 Study  Procedures/Evaluations  
 
7.1.1 Study Specific  Procedures  
After written informed consent, participants will complete the baseline assessment (i.e., TP0) and be 
randomly assigned to the MBSR or HEP group in a permuted block design stratified by receipt of 
chemotherapy (i.e., two strata). To reduce bias, research staff who assess participants, as well as the PI, 
will be blinded to group assignment. At regional community centers, the MBSR group will receive training 
from a trained instructor during a group -based, approximately 2.5 -hour manualized educational activity 
weekly for eight weeks. Participants will be aske d to complete daily 45 -minute mindfulness activities on 
days the group does not meet and a one -day weekend retreat (approximately 7 hours) to reinforce 
learning. HEP, which was developed to serve as an active control to MBSR, will receive manualized 
health  education, without mindfulness instruction, using similar modalities for a matched schedule with 
the same time requirements. Participant engagement will be assessed through attendance records, and 
by percentage of homework completed and mindfulness activi ties during study participation assessed 
using REDCap diaries. Assessments will be done at three time points (see Figure – MBSR Study 
Schema): within three weeks pre -randomization (TP0), within three weeks after completion of the 
intervention (TP1), and th ree months (+/ - 1.5 weeks) post intervention (TP2). Functional and structural 
brain imaging will be done at the NYU Center for Brain Imaging at TP0 and TP1. Neuropsychological 
tests and blood draws will be completed at the Bluestone Center for Clinical Res earch, Meyers College 
of Nursing, or New York University Center for Brain Imaging at TP0 and TP2. Neuropsychological tests 
will not be performed at the post -intervention assessment (i.e., TP1) due to likelihood of practice effects 
at that interval (i.e., t wo months). Patient -reported outcomes (see Patient -Reported Outcomes below for 
detail of these study measures) will be assessed at each time point.  
 
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected by 
patient self -report at TP0 and confirmed, when possible, by medical record review. A list of concomitant 
medications will be collected from participants at each study visit and confirmed, when possible, by 
medical record review.  
 
MRI. Functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans will be collected at TP0 and TP1 using a 3T 
Siemens Prisma scanner (Erlangen, Germany). Total time to obtain the neuroimaging scans is 
approximately one hour at each of these time points. During fMRI, participants will  complete the 
emotional faces n -back (EFNBACK) task,62 which engages working memory while evaluating the impact 
of emotional distractors. Participants will complete a resting state fMRI scan (i.e., fcMRI) before the 
EFNBACK to evaluate the activity of the brain in its default mode.10,63 dMRI will evaluate white matter 
integrity.   
Neuropsychological Function. Neuropsychological function will be evaluated with a battery of well - 
validated measures in the NIH Toolbox at TP0 and TP2.57 Total time to administer these tests is 
approximately two hours at each of these time points.  
 
Patient -Reported Outcomes. Patient -reported outcomes will be collected at each time point (i.e., TP0, 
TP1, TP2). Subjective cognitive function will be assessed with the Patient Assessmen t of Own 
Functioning Inventory,58 Attentional Function Index,33 and PROMIS -Cognitive.59 Affect will be assessed 
with the PROMIS measures60 and subjective measures of worry (i.e., Three -Item Worry Index,61 Cancer - 
Specific Worry Index10). Fatigue and sleep disturbance will be assessed with the PROMIS measures.60 
Self-reported stress will be assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale.55 Dispositional mindfulness will be 
measured with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS).78 Total time to administer the s elf-report

 measures is approximately 30 minutes.  
 
Blood draws. Blood will be drawn to obtain data on variability in genes and gene products. Universal 
precautions will be used during blood collection and banking. At each assessment time point (i.e., TP0, 
TP1, TP2), 5 ml of blood will be drawn using two PaxGene RNA tubes (Qiagen) and 10 ml of blood will be 
drawn using one or a combination of smaller EDTA tubes, totaling 15 ml (approximately 1 tablespoon) of 
blood drawn at each assessment time point. If a par ticipant completes the study, 30 ml (approximately 3 
tablespoons) of blood will be drawn in total. Blood banked at each time point will be processed in the 
Aouizerat lab in bulk after data collection. PaxGene RNA tubes are stored at -80°C before RNA 
proces sing. EDTA tubes will be subjected to ultra -centrifugation to separate plasma (stored at -80°C) and 
to collect buffy coats. Cell pellets, which are re -suspended in freezing solution, are isolated from buffy 
coats prior to storage at -20°C for future use. B iobanked samples will be stored with bar -coded 
identification labels associated with only each participant’s study ID number.  
 
Individual results of study -specific procedures will not be provided to study participants because these 
procedures are completed for research purposes and are not conducted in CLIA -certified labs. The MRI 
scans in this study are done to answer research questions and are not the type that are used to reveal 
medical conditions. However, it is possible that a clinically signi ficant, unexpected disease or condition 
could be identified during the conduct of the study as an incidental finding. In particular, the MRI 
technologist, study personnel, and other researchers will be able to view images of participants’ brains 
collected during scanning sessions, and the investigators could detect something unusual. In the unlikely 
event that the investigators detect an abnormality in a scan, the technologist will refer the scan without 
the participant's name to a radiologist for further e xamination as soon as possible. The participant will be 
contacted should the consulting radiologist recommend further examination. Then the participant and the 
participant's oncologist or primary care provider will decide if the participant should undergo further 
examination. The consulting radiologist will be available to this clinician to answer any questions about 
the findings of the scan.  
 
It is unlikely that study participants will require counseling due to study procedures. However, should a 
participa nt express distress indicating the need for counseling, even if that distress is unrelated to study 
participation, the participant will be referred to a psychologist for further evaluation. If a participant asks 
for counseling resources but is not expressi ng distress, local counseling resources will be provided.  
 
Study intervention adherence will be assessed as detailed in section 6.1.3.

All procedures  will be performed  in the Aouizerat  lab with biosafety  level 2+ procedures  in a chemical  fume 
hood. Personal protective equipment including goggles, safety glasses, and lab coat will be worn while 
working with the samples. Empty pipettes and tubes will be placed in biohazardous waste disposal 
containers after processing. Any materials derived from the blood samples will be treated with the 
appropriate level of precaution. Waste materials from processing will be stored securely in watertight, 
sealed, biohazard -labeled containers until disposal by the University’s department of environmental heal th 
and safety.

7.2.4 Specimen  Shipment  
The BCCR Biospecimen Bank (B3) is a secure facility in the Bluestone Center at the College of Dentistry 
that features three -80°C freezers with integra ted freezer failure alert that are powered by circuits with 
emergency back -up power. Sample location and linking information are managed by a commercial 
specimen tracking system. Dr. Aouizerat, a study team member, is Director of B3. Biospecimens collected  
as part of the study will be stored in B3 on the date of collection or, if collected on a weekend, on the next 
business day. If biospecimens are drawn outside the Bluestone Center, blood tubes will be placed in a 
sealed plastic bag inside a sealed, watert ight, biohazard -labeled, hard -sided container and sealed, 
biohazard -labeled secondary container with absorptive material between the two containers for transport 
to B3.

8 Assessment of  Safety  
8.1 Specification of Safety  Parameters  
The study will involve no more than minimal risk to research participants. The probability and  magnitude 
of harm or discomfort anticipated for this research are not greater than what this same population 
encounters in daily life or during the performance of physical or psychological examinations or tests. The 
only alternative to study participation  is non -participation.  
 
8.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events  (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study. Intercurrent  illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study  withdrawal  
• is associated  with a serious  adverse  event  
• is associated with clinica l signs or  symptoms  
• leads  to additional  treatment  or to further  diagnostic  tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical  significance

 Study number: 17 -00995  
Version: 2.2  page 21  
  
8.1.2 Definition  of Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital  stay 
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth  defect  
• an important medical  event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other se rious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typically be considered serious.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events . 
 
8.1.3 Definition  of Unanticipated  Problems  (UP) 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected  in nature,  severity,  or frequency  (i.e. not described  in study -related  documents  such 
as the IRB-approved  protocol  or consent  form,  the investigators  brochure,  etc.) 
• Related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research  (i.e. possibly  related  means  there  is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the  research)  
• Suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at greater  risk of harm  (including  physical, 
psychological,  economic,  or social  harm).  
8.2  Classification of an Adverse  Event  
 
8.2.1 Severity of  Event  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events  require  minimal  or no treatment  and do not interfere  with the participant’s  daily 
activities.  
• Moderate  – Events  result  in a low level of inconvenience  or concern  with the therapeutic 
measures.  Moderate  events  may cause  some  interference  with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy  or other  treatment.  Severe  events  are usually  potentially  life-threatening  or incapacitating.  
 
8.2.2 Relationship  to Study  Intervention  
A clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study intervention is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their 
relationship to study intervention assessed. In a clinical trial, the study intervention must always be 
suspect. The following guidelines are used for determination of relationship of any AE to the intervention 
or study procedures:  
 
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention or study procedure, there is a  
reasonable possibility that the study intervention or procedure caused the AE, or there is a

 Study number: 17 -00995  
Version: 2.2  page 22  
 temporal  relationship  between  the study  intervention  and event.  Reasonable  possibility  means  that 
there  is evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship  between  the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  or procedure  caused  the event,  there  is no temporal  relationship  between  the study 
intervention  or procedure  and event  onset,  or an alternate  etiology  has been  established.  
 
8.2.3 Expectedness  
As this study is minimal risk, no adverse events are expected.  
8.3 Time  Period  and Frequency  for Event  Assessment  and Follow -Up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of stud y personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured. Information to be 
collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study 
intervention (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately 
regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system 
throughout the study.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 
The PI will r ecord all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At 
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the o ccurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to pa rticipation in this study. The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
8.4 Reporting  Proce dures  – Notifying  the IRB 
 
8.4.1 Adverse Event  Reporting  
AEs are not expected due to participation in this minimal risk study. However, AE forms will be completed 
at each of the three study assessments, and study participants will be encouraged to contact study staff 
immediately should any AEs occur during study participation. Periodic adverse event reporting will include 
any AE that occurs while a participant is on the research protocol, regardless of whether it is considered 
related to study participation.  
 
The PI will submit as part of annual progress reports to the IRB and NINR a summary of monitoring that 
took place; cumulative adverse event data; assessments that were performed to evaluate external factors 
or relevant information that may have an impact on t he safety of study participants or ethics of the 
research study; outcomes of procedural reviews conducted to ensure participant privacy and 
confidentiality; and final conclusions regarding changes to the anticipated risk -to-benefit ratio of study 
participa nts and recommendations related to continuing, changing, or terminating the study.

 8.4.2 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting  
SAEs are not expected due to participation in this minimal risk study. The procedure for AE reporting will 
be followed for SAEs. In addition, if a serious adverse event occurs, it will be reported in a timely fashion 
after adjudication: All SAE reports wil l be made to the IRB within 5 working days; any participant deaths 
will be reported to the NINR Program Officer within 24 hours of realization, and all other serious adverse 
events will be reported to NINR within 72 hours of realization.  
 
8.4.3 Unanticipated  Problem  Reporting  
UPs are not mentioned in the consent form or final study protocol; however, should UPs that are related 
to the intervention occur, the informed consent will be modified accordingly. The procedure for AE 
reporting will be followed for SAEs. I n addition, if changes to the risk -to-benefit ratio of the study are 
determined based on occurrence of UPs, the IRB and NINR Program Officer will be notified.  
 
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of a n UP 
report form. It is the PI’s responsibility to report UPs to the IRB and to the NINR. The UP report will 
include the following information:  
 
• Protocol  identifying  information:  protocol  title and number,  PI’s name,  and the IRB project  number;  
• A detailed  description  of the event,  incident,  experience,  or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an  UP; 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions tha t have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the  UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:  
 
• UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to NINR within the timeframe described in 8.4.2 
for SAEs.   
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to NINR within the timeframe described in 8.4.1 for 
AEs.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by an institution’s 
written reporting procedures), the sup porting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within the 
timeframe  described  for AEs or SAEs,  as appropriate,  after the IRB’s  receipt  of the report  of the 
UP from the  investigator.  
 
8.4.4 Reporting of  Pregnancy  
As all participants will be postmenopausal per the medical record, pregnancy is not an anticipated event. 
However, should a participant become pregnant during the study, she will be allowed to continue in all 
study activities except MRI assessment.  
8.5 Reporting  Procedures  – Notifying  the Study  Sponsor  
The study clinician will complete a SAE Form within the following timelines:  
 
• All deaths  and immediately  life-threatening  events,  whether  related  or unrelated,  will be recorded 
on the SAE Form and submitted to the data and safety monitoring team/study sponsor within 24 
hours  of site awareness.  See Section  1, Key Roles  for contact  information.  
• Other  SAEs  regardless  of relationship  will be submitted  to the data and safety  monitoring  team  
/study sponsor within 72 hours of site awarene ss. 
 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be 
chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by 
the data and safety monitoring team/study sp onsor and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
As a follow -up to the initial report, within the following 48 hours of awareness of the event, the investigator 
shall provide further information, as applicable, on the unanticipated event or the unanticipated problem in

 the form of a written narrative. Th is should include a copy of the completed Unanticipated Problem form, 
and any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event. Significant new 
information on ongoing unanticipated adverse effects shall be provided promptly to t he study sponsor.  
8.6 Reporting  Procedures  – Participating  Investigators  
As the study intervention and data collection will be conducted only at NYU, procedures for monitoring 
and reporting across sites are not provided.  
8.7 Study Halting  Rules  
As this study is mi nimal risk, it is not anticipated that the study may be halted. However, if there is a 
determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants, the study may be 
temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated as described in section 5.7.3  
8.8 Safety  Oversight  
Following are plans for data and safety monitoring during the R00 study.  
 
Monitoring entity. Data and safety monitoring will be overseen primarily by the PI, who will complete all 
monitoring procedures except those for which he will be blinded (i.e., any procedures involving group 
assignment). The project’s biostatistician will be designated to oversee any aspects of the study for which 
the PI is blinded. The PI will submit any necessary reports to the IRB and NINR.  
 
Monitoring proced ures. The PI, biostatistician, and study personnel will meet quarterly to review the 
study protocol, participant recruitment, intervention attendance rates, achievement of intervention goals, 
retention rates, minimizing risk of adverse events, and data qua lity control. Because the PI and study 
personnel collecting data will be blinded to group assignment, any metrics by group assignment will be 
monitored by the biostatistician. Multi -site procedures. As the study intervention and data collection 
will be con ducted only at NYU, procedures for monitoring across sites are not provided.  
 
Minimizing risk. It is possible that a breach of confidentiality may occur during screening or study 
participation. However, every effort will be made to ensure that participant confidentiality is maintained. All 
investigators and key personnel will have trained in HIPAA policies and procedures and signed 
confidentiality agreements. Each participant will be assigned a unique ID number for data collected during 
the stud y; all study data will be de -identified so that only the ID number is associated with it. Paper linkage 
records for these ID numbers will be stored in the PI’s office in a separate locked file cabinet, and an 
associated password -protected file containing t he linkage records will be kept on an encrypted, password -
protected  server.  
 
Each participant's blood sample will be associated with only the study ID number and stored in the 
Bluestone Center Biospecimen Bank (i.e., B3). De -identified data collected from study measures and 
blood samples will be stored on encrypted, password -protected servers indefinitely. Paper -based records 
will be stored in a locked file cabinet. Access to de -identified data will be restricted to the PI, co - 
investigators, and other stud y personnel, as well as approved secondary investigators. These procedures 
will be reviewed at quarterly meetings to ensure that data are collected in a manner to protect 
confidentiality of participants.  
 
After the data retention period, de -identified data  will be retained in an electronic format indefinitely for 
future analyses. Paper records of data obtained during the study, such as subjective measures, will be 
scanned or retained in secured long -term retention. Blood samples and materials derived from t hem will 
be retained until they are used completely. All protected health information, including the PI's linkage 
record, will be destroyed at that time to protect confidentiality.  
 
Personnel who draw blood will apply universal precautions to reduce the ri sk of infection and will take 
steps to minimize discomfort, including application of pressure on the site following withdrawal of the 
needle. Participants will be observed after blood draws for any ill effects. To minimize fatigue, frustration, 
and anxiety  that might occur during task performance, participants will be asked how they are feeling and 
will be offered breaks between tasks. During the MRI scan, participants will be able to squeeze a panic

 ball if they become claustrophobic; doing so will stop th e scan so that the participant can exit the scanner.  
 
External factors. The PI will monitor developments in the literature as the study progresses. Should it 
become clear that the intervention would be in any way harmful to participants, would increase ris k, or 
would be unethical to continue, the IRB and NINR Program Officer will be notified and the study will be 
stopped.  
 
Futility analysis. As this pilot randomized controlled trial is designed to provide preliminary data (e.g., 
effect sizes) for a future w ell-powered R01 application, it will not be possible to determine whether the 
intervention is futile for this population during the proposed study.  
 
9 Clinical  Monitoring  
Clinical site monitoring may be conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of h uman subjects are 
protected; that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable; and that the conduct of the 
trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable 
regulatory requirement(s).  
 
• Authorized representatives of the IRB and the NINR may review de -identified information, as well 
as participants' identifiable information, for the purposes of assuring proper conduct of the 
research, addressing a specific reported incident, or verifying  appropriate use of funds. The 
Quality  Assurance  and Quality  Improvement  Division  of NYU’s  Research  and Regulatory  Services 
may audit the study to confirm compliance. Access of any protected health information will be 
done in the offices of the PI in his presence. No identifiable information may be copied or taken 
off-site.   
• The project manager (or clinical research coordinator) will audit one case per quarter, selected at 
random, to confirm compliance with IRB requirements, including conformance with informed 
consent  requirements,  verification  of source  documents,  and investigator  compliance.  
 
10 Statistical  Considerations  
10.1 Statistical and Analytical  Plans  
A formal SAP will be developed for this study in consultation with the study biostat istician. Only a general 
overview of study statistics is included in this protocol.  
10.2 Statistical  Hypotheses  
The sample size is too small to make inferences about relationships evaluated in the R00 study to the 
larger population of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. For the primary aim, effect sizes for 
neural markers of changes in cognitive function will be obtained. For the exploratory aims, effect sizes for 
correlations of exploratory outcomes to neural markers of changes in cognitive function will b e calculated. 
The effect sizes for these relationships will be determined in the R00 study, which will inform the sample 
size for a well -powered study planned for future R01 applications.  
10.3 Analysis  Datasets  
The analysis dataset will include all randomized p articipants (i.e., intention -to-treat).  
10.4 Description of Statistical  Methods  
 
10.4.1  General  Approach  
See study schematic for the design of this pilot, single -center randomized controlled trial of the 
preliminary efficacy of an eight -week, group -based MBSR intervention versus HEP active control to 
improve neural markers of changes in cognitive function in postmenopausal women receiving aromatase 
inhibitor therapy for breast cancer. Using exploratory and descriptive analyses, the investigators will first 
evaluate whether any data anomalies (e.g., nonrandom missing data, erroneous outliers, multicollinearity,

 possible  confounding)  may invalidate  planned  analyses  and then summarize  data in terms  of location  and 
variability using appropriate descriptive statistics, given the variable’s level of measurement and observed 
data distribution. As needed, appropriate r emedial approaches (e.g., data transformations, imputation, 
nonparametric  analysis  methods)  will be applied.  
 
10.4.2  Analysis  of the Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
See SAP.  
 
10.4.3   Analysis  of the Secondary  Endpoint(s)  
There are no secondary endpoints.  
 
10.4.4  Safety  Analyses  
As this study is minimal risk, no adverse events are expected, and no formal plan for safety analyses will 
be developed. The procedures in section 8 will be followed for any AEs, SAEs, or UPs that occur during 
this study.  
 
10.4.5  Adherence  and Retention  Analyses  
Adherence to the intervention will be assessed using data collected in attendance records and weekly 
REDCap diaries of completion of homework and other mindfulness activities. These data will be 
described as percentage homework completed and numbe r of minutes of mindfulness activities.  
Retention will be assessed as number of study assessment time points (i.e., TP0, TP1, TP2) completed.  
 
10.4.6  Baseline  Descriptive  Statistics  
Intervention groups will be compared on baseline characteristics, including demographic and clinical 
characteristics of the sample, using descriptive statistics. Inferential statistics will not be used.  
 
10.4.7  Planned Interim  Analysis  
Not applicable.  
 
10.4.8  Safety  Review 
As this study is minimal risk, it is not anticipated that the study may be halted. However, if there is a 
determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants, the study may be 
temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated a s described in section 5.7.3.  
 
10.4.9  Efficacy  Review  
This study will not evaluate efficacy.  
 
10.4.10  Additional Sub -Group  Analyses  
Primary or secondary endpoints may be analyzed for descriptive purposes by age, race/ethnicity, or any 
other participant characteristic as described in detail in the SAP.  
 
10.4.11  Multiple  Comparison/Multiplicity  
For these analyses, the investigators will generally not control for multiple comparisons. Any specific 
controls for multiple comparisons for the neuroimaging or gene expression data may be considered as 
part of the SAP.  
 
10.4.12  Tabulation  of Individual  Response  Data  
Individual participant data will not be listed.  
 
10.4.13  Exploratory  Analyses  
See SAP.

 Study number: 17 -00995  
Version: 2.2  page 27  
 10.5 Sample  Size 
The R00 study will recruit up to 32 participants (i.e. 16 participants per group) with analyzable data. Up to 
40 participants will be recruited to reach this goal. The projected sample size is sufficient to meet the 
specific aims of the R00 study and falls  within the range of pilot neuroimaging studies.53,54 It is unknown 
what effect sizes for the intervention versus active control will be uncovered for neural markers in this 
population. However, based on the investigators’ finding of large effect sizes for  neural markers of 
cognitive changes in the K99 study, group sample sizes of 16 will achieve 78.1% power to reject the null 
hypothesis of no effect size when the population effect size is 1 and the significance level (alpha) is 0.05 
using a two -sided, two -sample equal variance t -test. 
10.6 Measures to Minimize  Bias  
 
10.6.1  Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures  
After written informed consent at  the enrollment visit, participants will complete the baseline assessment 
(TP0) and be randomly assigned to the MBSR intervention group or HEP active control group in a 
permuted block design stratified by receipt of chemotherapy (i.e., two strata). It will  not be possible to 
blind study participants or interventionists to group assignment. However, to reduce bias, research staff 
who conduct participant assessments (TP0, TP1, TP2), including the PI, will be blinded to group 
assignment (i.e., single blind). P articipants will be reminded not to reveal their group assignment to study 
staff conducting assessments. The study biostatistician will have no direct contact with study participants 
and will not be blinded to group assignment. The biostatistician will pro duce and maintain the 
randomization codes for the permuted blocks. Randomization may only be unmasked by the 
biostatistician at the completion of analysis of the primary outcome, or for reporting of SAEs or UPs for 
which it will be essential to provide inf ormation to the PI on group assignment.  
 
As described in section 5.7.2, participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study may be replaced 
with additional participants in the next cycle of the intervention with the intent of obtain at least 32 
analy zable participants. For this study of preliminary efficacy, which is determining effect sizes, as large 
an analyzable sample size as possible will refine the estimates of these effect sizes.  
 
10.6.2  Evaluation of Success of  Blinding  
Blinding will be considered su ccessful if, with the exception of SAE and UP reporting, the PI and study 
staff conducting assessments remain unaware of group assignment until after data collection is 
complete.  
 
10.6.3  Breaking  the Study  Blind/Participant  Code  
Single blinding will be broken before completion of data collection only for reporting of SAEs or UPs for 
which it will be essential to provide information to the PI on group assignment. For SAEs or UPs that 
could affect other participants, the entire grou p will be unblinded so that the PI and study staff can discuss 
with these participants whether it is safe for them to continue in the study.  
 
While every effort will be made to remind participants not to unblind themselves, it is possible that a 
participan t may unintentionally unblind themselves to study staff conducting assessments or to the PI. If a 
blind is unintentionally broken, it will be reported to the study biostatician and discussed by the data and 
safety monitoring team. Any unintentional unblind ings will be reported to the IRB as a deviation from 
protocol. As this is a pilot study, the participant will be allowed to continue in the study and data will be 
analyzed.  
 
11  Source  Documents  and Access  to Source  Data/Documents  
Source data is all informati on, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in 
source documents. Examples of these original documents, and data rec ords include: hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions 
certified after verificatio n as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm

 or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
The study  case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is 
left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was  not asked, write “N/D”. If the item is 
not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printed legibly in black ink. If any 
entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect en try 
and enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed and dated. DO NOT ERASE OR 
WHITE OUT ERRORS. For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it.  
 
Access to study  records will be limited to IRB -approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB/EC, the sponsor, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance gro ups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.). 
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g.  
Bluestone Center for Cl inical Research, Center for Brain Imaging, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government 
regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.  
 
12 Quality A ssurance and Quality  Control  
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system, and data QC checks that will 
be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to 
the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
 
Following w ritten SOPs in the MOP, the PI will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are 
generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the 
applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (G LP)).  
 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and 
reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and regulatory 
authorities.  
 
13 Ethics/Protection of H uman  Subjects  
13.1 Ethical  Standard  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46.  
13.2 Institutional Review  Board  
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to th e protocol will require review and 
approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study. All changes to the consent form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants 
need to be re -consented.  
13.3 Informed Consent  Process  
 
13.3.1  Consent/Assent  and Other  Informational  Documents  Provided  to Participants  
The informed consent form describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are 
given to the participant, and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting any

 study procedures.  
 
13.3.2  Consent  Procedures  and Docum entation  
Information will be obtained during screening for the study by study staff or the MRI technologist to 
determine eligibility. Obtaining this information before written informed consent for the study will save time 
for potential participants by avoi ding unnecessary trips to the study sites at which enrollment will be 
completed. During screening, study staff will review the purpose, nature, risks, and benefits of the study; 
determine eligibility; and, if desired, schedule an enrollment appointment at NYU to obtain written 
informed consent from the candidate. The period of time between screening and enrollment will vary, 
depending on the availability of the potential participant and recruitment of a sufficient number of potential 
participants to begin a n intervention cycle.  
 
This process will give the potential participant time between screening and enrollment to consider whether 
she wants to participate in the study. Participants will be reminded when the study is introduced, during 
screening, and durin g written informed consent that participation is voluntary and that choosing not to 
participate in no way affects the quality or quantity of medical or nursing care provided to them. During 
this time between screening and the enrollment visit, the candidat e will have a copy of the consent form. If 
at any point the candidate prefers not to proceed, the enrollment visit will be canceled. The candidate will 
be offered time after the in -person review of the consent form during the enrollment visit to think abou t her 
potential  participation  and to ask any questions  before  choosing  to sign the study  consent.  In addition, 
subjects  are told that they may choose  to withdraw  from the study  at any time.  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provi ded to potential participants. Consent forms will be IRB -approved, and 
the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain the research 
study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participa nts will receive a verbal 
explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the 
study and of their rights as research participants. The participant will sign the informed consent document 
prior to any pr ocedures being done for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any time 
throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the 
participants for their records. A copy of the signed informed conse nt document will be stored in the 
participant’s research record. The consent process, including the name of the individual obtaining 
consent, will be thoroughly documented in the subject’s research record. Any alteration to the standard 
consent  process  and the justification  for such  alteration  will likewise  be documented.  
13.4 Participant  and Data  Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabi lity Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be collected  from subjects  in this study  
• Who will have  access  to that information  and why 
• Who will use or disclose  that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their  PHI. 
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to  collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
 
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating inve stigators, their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and 
genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Therefore, documentation, data, 
and all  other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study 
or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor or 
CONFIDENTIAL

 the PI.  
 
The study monitor, other authorized r epresentatives of the sponsor, or representatives of the IRB may 
inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited 
to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the parti cipants in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored in the PI’s office in the NYU Meyers 
College of Nursing for internal use during the study. Only the PI a nd study staff authorized by the PI will 
be allowed access to the document linking ID numbers to study participant’s personally identifiable 
information. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a 
perio d as dictated by IRB and institutional regulations.  
 
Study  participant  research  data,  which  is for purposes  of statistical  analysis  and scientific  reporting,  will be 
transmitted to and stored in the research offices of the PI at the NYU Meyers College of Nursing. These 
data will be shared with study investigators and may be shared with non -study investigators for secondary 
analyses at the discretion of the PI. This will not include the participant’s contact or identifying information. 
Rather, in dividual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification 
number. The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and by NYU Meyers 
College of Nursing research staff will be secured and passw ord protected. At the end of the study, all 
study databases will be de -identified and archived at the NYU Meyers College of Nursing. Blood samples 
will be identified only by a study ID number and stored in the B3 biobank in the College of Dentistry until 
genomic data collection. Data generated in genomic data collection will be transferred to the research 
offices of the PI and shared as described herein. MRI scans will be stored on secure servers at the Center 
for Brain Imaging. Scans will be transferred wh en ready for pre -processing and analysis to the research  
offices  of the PI and shared  as described  herein.  
 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the 
NIH. This certificate protects iden tifiable research information from forced disclosure. It allows the 
investigator and others who have access to research records to refuse to disclose identifying information 
on research participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at 
the federal, state, or local level. By protecting researchers and institutions from being compelled to 
disclose information that would identify research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve 
the research ob jectives and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentiality and privacy 
to participants.  
 
Genomic Data Sharing Plan . The R00 study will not produce large -scale human genomic data (i.e., at 
least 100 samples for RNA -seq). Therefore, the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy does not require 
submission of the data to an NIH -designated repository. Currently, the maximum number of samples that 
will be submitted for RNA -seq using samples collected during the R00 study will be 96. However, it is 
unlikely that the investigators will successfully collect RNA -seq data from all samples.  
 
If the maximum number of samples from which RNA -seq data is successfully collected were to exceed 
the threshold for data sharing (due to, for example, securing additional funds to increase sample size), 
the appropriate program official at the NINR will be notified, and a detailed plan for sharing of generated 
data will be developed. In that case, it is anticipated that the study will be registered in dbGaP and that 
gene expression data and associated phenotypic data will be submitted to an NIH -designated da ta 
repository (e.g., Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO]) so that it can be released no later than six months 
after initial data submission begins, or at the time of acceptance of the first publication, whichever 
occurs first. To allow for this possibility, the consent form for the R00 study will be worded to allow 
broad data sharing, should it become necessary.  
 
Even though the R00 study is not anticipated to reach the threshold for required genomic data sharing, 
the study will have in place plans for sharing de -identified data for secondary analyses with qualified 
investigators. The consent language for the R00 study will be worded for possible broad data sharing, 
as described above. The investigators also plan to submit genomic data and relevant phenotypic data  
(e.g., clinical characteristics of the sample) generated in the R00 study to an NIH -designated data

 repository in a timely manner. In this case, the timeline for submission to an NIH -designated data 
repository will allow first for publication of findings related to the aims of the R00 study, as well as 
submission as preliminary data for anticipated R01 grant application(s). The submission process will 
likely include registration in dbGaP and submission to GEO for controlled access to the data.  
13.5 Research  Use of Stored  Human  Samples,  Specimens,  and Data  
• Intended Use: Samples and genomic data collected under this protocol may be used to study 
relationships between genes or gene products and neural markers of changes in cognitive 
function, for exploratory analyses consistent with the SAP, and for any purpose described in the 
Genomic Data Sharing Plan. To accomplish these aims, study samples may be shipped to 
locations outside NYU for processing and data collection. Any samples so shipped will be  
returned to the B3 after data collection for future storage. Any data generated in said process will 
be returned  to the PI at the NYU  Meyers  College  of Nursing  and shared  as described  herein.  
• Storage: Access to stored samples in the B3 will be limited to study investigators and their 
approved staff. Samples and genomic data will be stored using codes assigned by the 
investigators.  Genomic  data generated  from the samples  will be kept in University -approved 
encrypted,  password -protected  servers.  Only investi gators  and their approved  staff will have 
access to the samples and  data.  
• Tracking:  Sample  location  and linking  information  are managed  by a commercial  specimen 
tracking  system.  Dr. Aouizerat,  a study  team  member,  is Director  of B3. 
o Disposition  at the completion  of the study:  All stored  samples  remain  in B3 until used  
completely. Study participants who request destruction of samples will be notified of 
compliance  with such  request  and all supporting  details  will be maintained  for tracking.  
13.6 Future Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens, and Data  
Participants may provide optional permission for future broad use of their stored samples, specimens, 
and data after the study is completed. We do not yet know the purpose of such future research, which 
could be related to any of the samples, specimens, or data collected as part of the study.  
 
After the study is completed, the de -identified, archived data will remain at NYU, under the supervision of 
the PI, for use by other researchers including those outside the study. These other researchers may 
include the PI’s students, other researchers at NYU, or researchers at other institutions. The PI will 
monitor the research activities of students and other researchers at NYU to ensure that data generated in 
this study are used appropriately. Data shared with researchers at other institutions via NIH d atabases will 
be covered under the NINR -approved Genomic Data Sharing Plan. The PI will enter into Data Use 
Agreements with researchers at other institutions not covered under this plan. The optional permission for 
future use includes future uses that are unknown at this time, so the PI will ensure that any such future 
uses are  appropriate.  
 
These biological samples will be stored indefinitely at the B3 until used up. The samples could be used 
for research consistent with this protocol, for research consist ent with the genomic data sharing plan, or 
for broad use with any data collected as part of the study. True genetic testing is not planned for these 
samples or specimens. Samples, specimens, and data will be labeled using codes assigned by study 
investigat ors. Data will be stored in University -approved, encrypted, cloud -based storage (e.g., Box), 
which is password protected. With the exception of NIH databases, any data shared with secondary 
investigators will be accessed by them using shared Box folders. S tudy investigators and their approved 
staff will have access to the samples and data. Secondary investigators will be granted access to the 
data with time, as consistent with the Genomic Data Sharing Plan.  
 
Sample location and linking information will be m anaged in B3 by a commercial specimen tracking 
system. The PI will maintain a code -link that will allow linking the biological specimens with the phenotypic 
data from each participant, maintaining the masking of the identity of the participant. This code l ink will be 
shared with approval by the PI. Some data collected as part of the study may constitute a Limited Data 
Set, which will be shared with researchers at other institutions only as approved by the University in Data 
Use Agreements.

Version: 2.2  page 32  
 During the condu ct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to have 
samples, specimens, and data stored for future research by contacting the PI in writing. However, 
withdrawal of consent for storage will not be possible after the study is co mpleted.  
 
14 Data Handling and Record  Keeping  
14.1 Data  Collection  and Management  Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the 
data reported.  
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copie s. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, 
OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL.  
 
Copies of the electronic CRF (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained for 
recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source docu ments, or the discrepancies should be explained 
and captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record. Data 
obtained from paper source documents (e.g., patient -reported outcomes) will be entered twice and 
comp ared to reduce potential for data entry error.  
 
Data generated in the study and clinical data entered directly from source documents (e.g., AEs, 
concomitant medications) will be entered into the SPSS dataset maintained by the PI and approved study 
staff. T he dataset will be password protected and will be examined for data that appear inconsistent, 
incomplete, or inaccurate.  
14.2 Study Records  Retention  
Study documents will be retained for at least the longest of 3 years after closeout, 3 years after the date 
of Federal Financial Report (FFR) submission, or 5 years after final reporting/publication. These 
documents may be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations or if data 
analysis remains ongoing (e.g., secondary analyses). No recor ds will be destroyed without the written 
consent of the PI.  
14.3 Protocol  Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or MOP requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, an investi gator, or the study staff. As a result 
of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed and implemented promptly.  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance  with Protocol,  sections  4.5.1,  4.5.2,  and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Qua lity Control,  section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance,  sections  5.20.1,  and 5.20.2.  
 
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations within 3 
working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 3 working days of the scheduled protocol - 
 
required activity. All deviations mus t be addressed in study source documents, reported to the NINR 
Program Official and the data and safety monitoring team. Protocol deviations must be reported to the 
local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI and study staff are responsible for knowing and  adhering to 
their IRB requirements. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the 
MOP.

 14.4 Publication and Data Sharing  Policy  
Data will be shared with study investigators, with secondary investigators as approved by the PI , and as 
described in the genomic data sharing plan for the purpose of disseminating findings to the scientific 
community and to the public. This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that 
the public has access to the published  results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to submit final 
peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon 
acceptance for publication.  
 
The International Committee of Medical Journal Edito rs (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical 
trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research 
project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or c ontrol 
groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. 
Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care 
changes, and the like. Health outcomes i nclude any biomedical or health -related measures obtained in 
patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and 
the Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, requires that al l clinical 
trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by the National 
Library of Medicine. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional 
clinical trials performe d under NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility 
to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in 
ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific stu dies to determine whether registration is 
necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to 
register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journal in which they wish to 
publi sh. 
 
FDAAA mandates that a "responsible party" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register 
and report results of certain "applicable clinical trials." NIH grantees, such as the R00 study PI, will take 
specific steps to ensure complian ce with NIH implementation of FDAAA, including registering the trial with 
clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
15 Study  Finances  
15.1 Funding  Source  
This study is funded through a grant from the National Institute of Nursing Research (R00NR015473).  
15.2 Costs to the  Participant  
Participants will not be charged for any procedures of this study.  
15.3 Participant  Reimbursements  or Payments  
Participants will receive a modest compensation of $100 for the two -part pre -intervention assessment, 
which includes MRI and neuropsycholo gical testing; $75 for the post -intervention assessment, which does 
not include neuropsychological testing; and $75 for the three -month follow -up visit, which does not include 
MRI (total compensation of $250 if all three study visits are completed). Partic ipants will receive 
reimbursement for public transit or parking at NYU for each of the study assessment visits. Parking fines 
will not be reimbursed. Reimbursements for public transit or parking at NYU may be provided for the 
MBSR or HEP visits.  
 
16 Study  Adm inistration  
16.1 Study  Leadership  
The study team will govern the conduct of the study. The study team will be composed of the PI, study 
investigators, and representatives of NINR, as listed in section 1. With the exception of NINR personnel, 
who will meet with the study team when required, the PI will schedule monthly study team meetings. In 
addition, the PI will meet individually with study team members as needed.

17 Conflict of Interest  Policy  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence  is critical. Therefore, any actual 
conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect 
of this trial will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest 
will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the 
trial. The study leadership in conjunction with the NINR has established policies and procedures for all 
study group members to disclose all conflicts o f interest and will establish a mechanism for the 
management of all reported dualities of interest.  
 
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain 
greater than the minimum allowable by their  institution, etc.) must have the conflict reviewed by the NYU 
Langone Conflict of Interest Committee with a Committee -sanctioned conflict management plan that has 
been reviewed and approved by the study sponsor prior to participation in this study. All NY U Langone 
Health investigators will follow the applicable conflict of interest policies.

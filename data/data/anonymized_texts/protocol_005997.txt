1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, two cohort, phase I/II study of immune checkpoint blockade with 
cemiplimab in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) who have 
previously undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or renal allograft 
transplantation. Patients are divided into two cohorts based on their history of prior HSCT for a 
lymphoproliferative disorder or hematologic malignancy ( Cohort 1 ), and a history of prior renal 
transplantation ( Cohort 2 ). In the rare event that a patient has a history of both prior HSCT and 
prior renal transplantation, the patient would be included in Cohort 2. Following biopsy, 
screening, and enrollment, participants in Cohort 1 receive cemiplimab at standard dosing (350 
mg IV every 21 days) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (including graft -versus - 
host disease [GVHD]), whichever occurs first. Cohort 2 mandates that the patient follow a 
standard immunosuppressive regimen that includes: everolimus or sirolimus with monitored 
trough levels to ensure therapeutic levels, in addition to prednisone pulse dosing corresponding  
to each dose of cemiplimab (prednisone 40 mg daily 1 day prior to cemiplimab, followed by 40 
mg daily on the day of and up to 2 additional days after dosing, then 20 mg for 3 days, followed 
by 10 mg daily thereafter until the day prior to redosing of cemiplimab when the prednisone 
cycle repeats). Prophylactic antibiotics are permitted at the discretion of the treating physician 
while  the patient  is on immunosuppression  and for the duration  of the study.  Treatment  continues 
in Cohort 2 with cemiplimab at standard dosing (350 mg IV every 21 days) until unacceptable 
toxicity (acute allograft rejection) or disease progression. Our aim is to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of cemiplimab in this high -risk but in -need population, and utilize a standard,  
augmented immunosuppression regimen to minimize the risk of immune -related toxicity, 
specifically organ transplant rejection.  
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
To determine the safety and toxicity of immunotherapy in advanced cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma (cSCC) patients having undergone prior hematopoietic stem cell or renal transplant.  
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
 
To evaluate  the anti-tumor  activity  and survival  benefit  in advanced  cSCC  patients  receiving 
immunotherapy despite a history of transplant:  
• To estimate progression -free survival (PFS)  and overall survival (OS) 
• To estimate  overall  response  rate (ORR)  
• To estimate duration  of therapeutic response  
• To estimate the  propensity for secondary  infection on treatment

 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease(s)  
 
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is diagnosed in hundreds of thousands of patients 
each year in the United States and continues to increase due to our aging and sun -exposed 
population [1]. Risk factors for cSCC include sun or ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, 
advanced age, and immunosuppression [2]. The vast majority of cases are localized to the skin 
and treatment is with curative intent but, compared with other non -melanomatous skin cancers 
cSCC in immunosuppressed populations, can result in a greater propensity for aggressive 
recurrence and metastatic involvement [3]. Standard treatments involve surgery with the goal of 
oncologic resection (including sizeable excisional margins) with a role for adjuvant radiotherapy 
favored among patients with intermediate -to-high risk features such as nodal involvement, 
perineural invasion, significant depth of invasion, and large tumor size – with 5 -year survival 
estimated at 73% in those receiving radiation vs. surgery alone (54%), and mitigating 
locoregional recurrence rates (20% vs. 43%) in this scenario [4]. Host factors such as the 
immunocompetence of the patient and whether the lesion in question represents a recurrence are 
other important considerations when considering adjuvant radiation to prevent locoregional 
relapse.  
 
When unresectable or advanced, metastatic cSCC develops, prior to 2018 there had previously 
been no standard systemic regimen when considering platinum -based chemotherapy and 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting antibodies due to a lack of robust safety and 
efficacy data in large, prospective, multicenter trials. Rather, single -arm studies often reported 
benefit among a heterogeneous cSCC population with much extrapolation from head and neck 
SCC data. Cisplatin and 5 -fluorouracil -based regimens have shown some efficacy but with 
notable rates of toxicity (76% of cSCC patients with grade 3+ adverse events) [5]. The EGFR 
inhibitor  cetuximab  has demonstrated  a 28% overall  response  rate with a median  OS of 8 months 
[6], and a similar antibody (panitumumab) demonstrated 31% response rates [7]. Across the 
board, response rates for systemic cytotoxic and antibody -directed therapies in advanced cSCC 
have ranged from 17 -50% and seem to be muted in patients with more widespread disease [8].  
 
Until 2018, no systemic therapies were approved for the treatment of advanced cSCC, as 
mentioned above. Because of a robust UV driven mutational burden and the link with 
immunosuppression, there was a strong interest in exploring immunotherapies in this disease. 
Cancer medicine has been revolutionized by the advent of immune checkpoint blockade agents 
that serve to block T cell inhibitory signaling and thereby promote T cell activation through 
receptors like programmed cell death -protein 1 (PD -1) and its ligand (PD -L1) on tumor and 
surrounding immune cells [9]. Recently, a landmark phase I/II study demonstrated that the  
highly potent PD -1 inhibitor cemiplimab (formerly REGN2810) resulted in 47 -50% overall 
response rates among advanced cSCC patients; with the duration of response exceeding 6  
months in more than half of patients [10]. Neither median PFS nor OS had been reached at that 
time of reporting, but the estimated PFS at 1 -year was 53% and 1 -year OS 81%. Adverse events 
were manageable with 15% of patients experiencing immune -mediated side effects such as rash, 
diarrhea, and fatigue. These data led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 
cemiplimab in September 2018.

Despite  the success  of immune  checkpoint  blockade  in advanced  cSCC,  there  are some  important 
groups excluded from immunotherapy trials in general. Non -melanomatous skins cancers, 
particularly cSCC, represents a major cause of morbidity following organ transplantation – with 
SCC representing the most common cutaneous malignancy in this setting with a 65 -100 fold 
greater incidence among organ transplant recipients compared with the general population [11]. 
Because of their ongoing need for some component of long -term immunosuppression, their 
competing medical issues, and the concern for off -target immune toxicity jeopardizing their 
transplanted organ, these patients have been excluded from immunotherapy trials despite the 
devastation and mortality of advanced cSCC in these transplant survivors – where 3 -year 
disease -specific survival may only approach 50% [12].  
 
2.2 IND Agents  
 
2.2.1 Cemiplimab  
 
2.2.1.1  Mechanism  of action and pharmacology  
 
Cemiplimab -rwlc is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits programmed 
death -1 (PD -1) activity by binding to PD -1 and blocking the interactions with the ligands PD -L1 
and PD -L2, releasing PD -1 pathway -mediated inhibition of immune response, including anti - 
tumor response. PD -1 ligand upregulation may occur in some tumors and signaling through this 
pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T -cell immune surveillance of tumors. Blocking 
PD-1 activity has resulted in decreased tumor growth. Cemiplimab has a volume of distribution 
of 5.3L and a half -life elimination of 19 days with renal clearance (first dose: 0.32 L/day, steady 
state: 0.21 L/day).  
 
2.2.1.2  Clinical  safety  
 
Cemiplimab was investigated in a phase I/II open -label trial in advanced cSCC patients where  
the most common adverse events were diarrhea (27% of patients), fatigue (24%), nausea (17%), 
constipation  (15%),  and skin rash (15%)  [10].  Four  patients  (7% of the initial  study)  discontinued 
therapy due to adverse events. Grade 3 toxicity or higher events that occurred in >1 patient 
included cellulitis, pneumonitis, hypercalcemia, pleural effusion, and death. Overall there were 
11 deaths in the original phase I/II study, 8 attributed to disease progression, and 3 from adverse 
events.  
 
In terms of safety after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo -HSCT), Herbaux 
and colleagues reported on 20 relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients treated with another 
PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab [13] ( Table 1 , below ). GVHD occurred in 6 patients (30%) after 
nivolumab initiation, but all had a prior history of acute GVHD. Overall response rate was 95% 
and the 1 -year PFS was 58% and OS 79%. All cases of PD -1 triggered acute GVHD occurred 
within 1 week of the first dose. There were no reported cases of chronic GVHD among the 
cohort. Time between allo -HSCT and nivolumab treatment was significantly shorter in patients 
with PD -1 triggered GVHD (median of 8.5 months). All patients were successfully managed  
with standard  GVHD  treatments.  In another  study  evaluating  relapsed  lymphoma  patients  post- 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817

9  
 allo-HSCT, Haverkos and colleagues reported anti -PD-1 inhibitor use in 31 patients with a 
response rate of 77% overall but n = 8/31 (26%) developed significant GVHD after anti -PD-1 
dosing,  with an onset  between  1-2 doses  [14].  The majority  of cases  were  among  those  with prior 
acute GVHD or active chronic GVHD.  
There is also emerging data about allo -HSCT patients who have previously received immune 
checkpoint blockade for lymphoma after autologous HSCT. A report of 39 patients with 
lymphoma who had prior PD -1 inhibition before allo -HSCT showed that at a median of 12  
month  follow -up, 1-year cumulative  rates  of grade  3-4 GVHD  were  23%,  but the overall  survival 
at 1-year was excellent at 89% [15].

In terms of PD -1 blockade in organ transplantation recipients, data is limited to case reports to - 
date given the concern for acute organ rejection and ongoing immunosuppression needs. Herz 
and colleagues  reported  a renal  transplant  recipient  treated  with tacrolimus  and prednisolone  who 
received the anti -cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen -4 (CTLA -4) antibody ipilimumab, 
another immune checkpoint inhibitor, and later received PD -1 blockade with single -agent 
nivolumab [16]. Neither PD -1 or CTLA -4 inhibition triggered renal allograft rejection and the 
patient had clinical benefit from the therapy. Several studies summarized in Table 2 below have 
reported success and failure with allograft tolerance following checkpoint inhibitor use, but the 
actual rates of rejection are not known. An important observation among these reports is that in 
two series (Lesouhaitier, et al. 2018; Barnett, et al. 2017) [17, 18], all of the patients in the anti - 
PD-1 use post -renal transplant group who did not experience organ rejection had been on 
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition as part of immunosuppression. Abdel - 
Wahab and colleagues recently published the largest series to date of 23 renal transplant 
recipients who received various checkpoint inhibitors (PD -1/CTLA -4 directed, or both) and 
11/23 (48%) experienced acute kidney rejection within a median of 21 days (range: 5 -60 days) 
from transplantation [19]. Of note, the immunosuppressive regimen was quite variable among 
this retrospective group and included steroids, mTOR inhibitors, CNIs, and combinations of  
these agents without standardization.

2.2.1.3  Clinical  efficacy  
 
In the pivotal phase I/II trial of cemiplimab in advanced or metastatic cSCC patients the overall 
response rate was 47% and the rate of durable disease control was 61% with 4 complete 
responses and 24 partial responses [10]. Median time to an observed response was 1.9 months 
(range, 1.7 -6.0 months), and the median duration of response had not been reached at the time of 
reporting. However, 57% of patients with a response had a duration of benefit that exceeded 6 
months in their analysis. Only 3 patients had subsequent disease progression following  
confirmed response, and at the time of data cutoff 82% of responders continued to benefit and 
continued on PD -1 blockade. Both median PFS and OS were not reached at the time of analysis 
but the estimated 1 -year PFS was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37 -66%) and 1 -year OS 
was 81% (95%  CI, 68-89%).  In subgroup  analysis,  similar  efficacy  was observed  in patients  with 
either  regional or  distant metastatic  disease involvement  (43 vs.  49% response  rate, respectively).  
Several trials are ongoing which utilize PD -1 antibodies in the HSCT setting. A study of the PD - 
1 inhibitor  pembrolizumab  as maintenance  after autologous  HSCT  is enrolling  in diffuse  large  B- 
cell lymphoma (DLBCL), classical HL, and T cell non -HL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In addition, studies 
are enrolling using nivolumab after autologous HSCT in multiple myeloma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and 
evaluating the PD -L1 antibody durvalumab for DLBCL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). PD -1 blockade has a 
track record of clinical benefit in post -HSCT patients: a report of 3 classical HL patients who 
relapsed after allo -HSCT all had objective responses to the PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab [20]. 
Haverkos and colleagues treated classical HL patients who relapsed after allo -HSCT with PD -1 
blockade as well and noted an overall response rate of 77% (15 complete and 8 partial responses 
among  30 patients)  [14].  Herbaux  and colleagues  reported  a 95% response  rate with a 1-year PFS 
of 58% and 79% 1 -year OS among 20 classical HL patients treated with nivolumab after relapse 
following allo -HSCT [13].

 malignancies has not uniformly been reported – as the literature is comprised of cases reports  
and a few series. That said, complete and partial responses in this setting have been observed 
[21]. 
2.2.2 Mechanistic  target  of rapamycin  (mTOR)  inhibition:  Everolimus  and Sirolimus  
 
2.2.2.1  Mechanism  of action and pharmacology  
 
Everolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant and a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
inhibitor which has antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties. It reduces protein synthesis 
and cell proliferation by binding to the FK binding protein -12 (FKBP -12), an intracellular 
protein, to form a complex that inhibits activation of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) 
serine -threonine kinase activity. It also reduces angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia -inducible factor (HIF -1) expression.  
 
Everolimus is rapidly absorbed with a volume of distribution of 128 -589L and is 74% protein 
bound. The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and yields six weak 
metabolites [22]. The tablet form is 30% bioavailable and this is reduced by 22% with a high - 
fate meal and by 32% with a light -fat meal. The tablet for suspension form has an area under the 
curve (AUC) equivalent to tablets although peak concentrations are 20 -36% lower and steady 
state concentrations are similar [23]. Systemic exposure is reduced by 12% with a high -fat meal 
and 30% with a low -fat meal. The half -life of elimination is about 30 hours and the time to peak 
plasma concentration is about 1 -2 hours. Fecal excretion is about 80% with around 5% urinary 
excretion [24].  
 
Sirolimus inhibits T -lymphocyte activation and proliferation in response to antigenic and 
cytokine stimulation and inhibits antibody production. Its mechanism differs from other 
immunosuppressants. Sirolimus binds to FKBP -12, an intracellular protein, to form an 
immunosuppressive complex which inhibits the regulatory kinase, mTOR. This inhibition 
suppresses  cytokine  mediated  T-cell proliferation,  halting  progression  from  the G1 to the S phase 
of the cell cycle.  
 
Sirolimus is rapidly absorbed with a volume of distribution of 12L/kg and is about 92% protein 
bound to albumin primarily. The drug is extensively metabolized in the intestinal wall via P - 
glycoprotein  and hepatic  CYP3A4  enzymes  to seven  major  metabolites.  The oral solution  form  is 
14% bioavailable where the oral tablet form is 27% higher relative to the oral solution 
bioavailability.  Half-life of elimination  is on average  62 hours  (range:  46-78 hours)  and extended 
up to 113 hours  in those  with hepatic  impairment.  Time  to peak  concentration  is 1-3 hours  for the 
oral solution and 1 -6 hours for the oral tablet. Fecal excretion is about 91% due to the P - 
glycoprotein -mediated efflux into the gut lumen, and 2% urinary excretion [25].  
 
2.2.2.2  Clinical  safety  
 
The dose and schedule of everolimus for clinical use was established in a study of 55 advanced 
solid tumor patients using a dose escalation scheme whereby dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of 
stomatitis,  neutropenia,  and hyperglycemia  yielded  a recommended  10 mg daily  dose for further  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
12  
 development [24]. Everolimus has established safety in patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) where a phase II study utilized a 10 mg daily oral dose without interruption 
with permitted dose modifications for toxicity among 39 patients. Common toxicities included: 
nausea (38% of patients), anorexia (38%), diarrhea (31%), stomatitis (31%), pneumonitis (31%), 
and skin rash (10%). Grade 3 -4 adverse events included pneumonitis (18%) transaminase 
elevations (10%), thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and alkaline phosphatase elevations (8% 
each), and hyperlipidemia (5%) [26]. In a phase III, randomized trial, everolimus and  
exemestane (endocrine hormone therapy) was compared in 724 post -menopausal hormone - 
receptor positive breast cancer patients with similar expected toxicities as noted in RCC. In 
addition, grade 3 -4 adverse events included: stomatitis (8%), anemia (6%), dyspnea (4%), 
hyperglycemia (4%), fatigue (4%), and pneumonitis (3%) in the hormone and mTOR 
combination arm [27].  
 
Outside of treatment for malignancy, mTOR inhibition also has an established role as 
immunosuppression alone or in combination for kidney transplant recipients to prevent organ 
rejection. In the multicenter, open -label ZEUS study of everolimus -based, calcineurin -inhibitor 
(CNI) -free immunosuppression for recipients of de -novo kidney transplants, 155 patients 
received an everolimus -based regimen based on trough concentrations (6 -10 ng/mL) with a 
primary objective of showing favorable renal function at 1 -year post -transplant [28]. In the 
mTOR inhibition arm, 76% (118 patients) completed therapy with rates of biopsy -proven acute 
renal rejection being around 10% (n = 15/154). Adverse events included elevated lipid 
concentrations, mildly elevated urine protein excretion, and lower hemoglobin concentrations in 
the everolimus -based arm. Thrombocytopenia, aphthous stomatitis, and diarrhea also were 
notable in the mTOR inhibition arm. Similarly, a multinational comparative, randomized trial 
using sirolimus 1 -5 mg/day adjusted to a trough concentration of 8 -15 ng/mL at the time of 
conversion to the agent (and 7 -15 ng/mL thereafter) in 57 patients post -cardiac transplantation 
compared with a CNI was reported [29]. The most common adverse events in the sirolimus arm 
were diarrhea (28%), skin rash (28%), and infection (47%). Everolimus also has established 
immunosuppressive safety in pediatric transplant recipients: a phase I trial examined single dose 
everolimus in combination with cyclosporin A and steroids with and without azathioprine. 
Nineteen  children  enrolled  at 1.2 mg/m2 per day which  was safe and well tolerated.  There  was no 
increase in infection rates [23].  
 
2.2.2.3  Clinical  efficacy  
 
Everolimus has demonstrated efficacy as immunosuppression following de -novo lung 
transplantation as noted in an investigator -sponsored, single institution study from Germany in 
2016 [30]. Forty -three patients were randomized to everolimus (over mycophenolate mofetil 
[MMF]) and the everolimus group had less rates of acute organ rejection, lower rates of 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and lower rates of respiratory tract infection. In addition,  
rates of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) were lower (1/43 patients) compared with the 
MMF group (p=0.04). There was a notable dropout rate in the mTOR inhibition group due to 
drug-related side effects, which are discussed above. Among de -novo kidney transplant  
recipients in the ZEUS trial, mTOR inhibition demonstrated somewhat higher rates of acute 
kidney rejection (10%) compared with 3% in the CNI group [28]. Sirolimus had numerically 
higher  acute  rejection  rates  compared  with MMF  in a post-cardiac  transplant  group,  but overall  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
13  
 rates  of rejection  were  low, comparatively  [29]. 
2.2.3 Combining  Cemiplimab  and mTOR inhibition  
 
2.2.3.1  Preclinical  efficacy  
 
While no data have yet reported the safety or efficacy of PD -1/L1 blockade used in combination 
with everolimus  or mTOR  inhibition,  therapeutic  efficacy  in the early  preclinical  setting  suggests 
that combining these agents could offer enhanced anti -tumor effect [31]. Hirayama and 
colleagues treated immunocompetent mice with RCC with anti -PD-L1 therapy and everolimus 
and showed a significant decrease in tumor burden as compared with anti -PD-L1 and placebo 
alone groups. They also noted increased tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and a higher ratio 
of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells compared to TILs in the combination arm. It is important to 
acknowledge that a serious and overlapping toxicity shared by both anti -PD-1/L1 and 
mTOR inhibitors is pneumonitis, and it is unknown whether combined use increases the 
likelihood of lung inflammation as compared with either agent alone. Nonetheless, we are 
excluding patients with significant renal dysfunction which have been associated with the 
highest risk of pneumonitis on mTOR inhibitors [32].  
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
Until  2018  there  were  no systemic  therapies  approved  for the treatment  of advanced  or metastatic 
cSCC, despite its significant cosmetic and functional morbidity and overall poor prognosis. 
However, UV radiation leading to a rich mutational burden in this disease proved a promising 
attribute when considering the influx of novel immunotherapies in cancer medicine. Immune 
checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD -1 work to remove the inhibitory break signal on surrounding 
T cells to enhance tumor killing potential [33]. Cemiplimab, an anti -PD-1 antibody,  
demonstrated a nearly 50% durable response rate in advanced cSCC with a favorable toxicity 
profile – leading to regulatory approval of this agent for an otherwise devastating disease [10].  
 
Despite  the success of solid organ and hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation (HSCT)  in the  last 
decade, transplant recipients remain at high -risk for second cancers given their altered immune 
systems and immunosuppressive needs [34] – with cSCC representing the most common new 
malignancy  with a nearly  100-fold risk increase  in this population  [11].  When  the cSCC  becomes 
advanced or metastatic post -transplant, the treating physician is left with minimizing systemic 
immunosuppression or offering cytotoxic chemotherapy to palliate the disease. Of note, mTOR 
inhibitors (namely everolimus and sirolimus) are generally the preferred immunosuppressive 
agent after transplant to prevent future malignancies [35]. While immune checkpoint inhibitors 
have revolutionized the cancer landscape, trials have excluded this high -risk, but in -need 
population for fear of precipitating transplant rejection by stimulating a broad immune response  
– a scenario that has been reported of late [34, 36, 37]. In addition, including post -HSCT patients 
brings concern about the recrudescence of GVHD. Recent studies have shown that rates of acute 
GVHD exceed 45 -50% when a patient is challenged with PD -1 blockade for relapse >3 months 
out from their prior HSCT and when they have a prior history of acute GVHD [13, 38]. While 
acute GVHD can occur in post -HSCT patients exposed to PD -1 blockade even in the absence of 
prior  GVHD,  a shorter  time from  HSCT  increases  the risk significantly  – therefore  we expect  the 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
14  
 risk to be lower given the requirement that patients enrolled to this study be ≥2 years out from 
HSCT.  
While the hazards of immune checkpoint therapy in HSCT and renal transplant recipients is 
important to recognize, advanced cSCC patients post -transplant are often left with no further 
therapeutic options and the prospect of morbidity and death. It is not known whether response 
rates to PD -1 blockade are similar in prior transplant recipients with cSCC, moreover the actual 
rate of allograft rejection or GVHD has not been elucidated in this population. A uniform and 
aggressive approach to immunomodulation using dynamic immunosuppression (as not to impair 
the anti -tumor response) has not been applied to these patients to further understand the role of 
PD-1 blockade in this critical population. Barnett and colleagues reported the use of a dynamic 
immunosuppression regimen (combining pulsed steroids before, concurrent, and rapidly tapering 
after PD -1 blockade with mTOR inhibition) in a single patient with microsatellite unstable 
duodenal adenocarcinoma having undergone kidney transplantation and receiving nivolumab – 
with no evidence  organ  rejection  nearly  a year out from  therapy  [18].  Similarly,  small  series  have 
demonstrated success with mTOR inhibition as the backbone of immunosuppression to prevent 
organ rejection when also a patient with concomitant immune checkpoint blockade [17, 21].  
 
Here we plan to investigate PD -1 blockade with cemiplimab in post -allo-HSCT and post -renal 
allograft transplant populations to better understand anti -tumor activity and to potentially 
mitigate the risk of acute rejection by using a dynamic mTOR -based immunosuppression 
regimen in our renal transplant recipients.  
 
2.4 Correlative  Studies  Background  
 
Clinical trial administration of immune checkpoint blockade among prior transplant recipients 
with a modified immunosuppressive regimen will provide a unique opportunity to understand 
immunology within this high -risk and vulnerable population. Peripheral blood and tumor tissue 
biopsy samples will be required before (at baseline) and after (after 30 days or 2 cycles of 
therapy) anti -PD-1 therapy, with an additional required tissue biopsy at the time of organ 
rejection or the development of GVHD to assess the off -target immunologic effects of treatment.  
 
Phenotypic analysis of immune cells in the blood and tumor microenvironment . Incubation of 
peripheral blood and tumor biopsy samples with monoclonal antibodies specific for different cell 
markers will be used to identify immune cell subsets and tumor cells. After incubation of cells 
with monoclonal antibodies, individual subsets are then enumerated by flow cytometry (and 
immunohistochemistry [IHC]/multiplexed immunofluorescence [MIF] where applicable). These 
studies will allow us to measure quantitative changes of individual cell populations that occur as 
a result of anti -PD-1 treatment. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) allows for high throughput analysis of 
single cells for a large number of parameters, and has recently been used to deeply 
immunophenotype and track the inhibitory and activating receptor diversity of human immune 
cells [39].  
 
Plasma  cytokines  and chemokines . ELISA  or other  relevant  assays  will be used to measure  levels 
of key cytokines (including IL -2, IFN -γ etc.), chemokines (such as CXCL2, CXCL5 etc.) and 
soluble ligands in plasma samples.

Functional assays . To assess the functional capacity of cytotoxic T cells that expand in vivo in 
response to treatment, selected samples will be used to assess their cytokine and cytotoxicity 
responses after re -stimulation with cytokines and tumor target cells.  
DNA analyses . Additional genetic analyses (e.g., short term tandem repeats [STRs]) will be 
considered to assess clearance of measurable disease and underlying tumor subclones and  
banked DNA and cell samples would be accessed for such analyses.

“Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)” is defined as any female who has 
experienced menarche, who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy), who is not postmenopausal, who is sexually active with a male 
partner.  Menopause  is defined  clinically  as 12 months  of amenorrhea  in a woman  over 45 
in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the 
age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less 
than 40 mIU/mL.  
3.1.10  Women of childbearing potential, as defined above, must have a negative serum or urine 
pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24  
hours prior to the start of cemiplimab.  
3.1.11  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use any contraceptive method 
with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP 
will be instructed  to adhere  to contraception  for a period  of 7 months  after the last dose of 
investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential as defined above, 
and azoospermic men) do not require contraception. See Appendix C for further guidance 
on contraception.  
3.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 1 week prior to entering 
the study or those who have unresolved toxicities from prior anti -cancer therapy more

 3.2.2 For Cohort  1 allo-HSCT  patients  enrolling  to the study,  corticosteroid  doses  > 10 mg 
of prednisone daily or equivalent within 4 weeks of the first dose of PD -1 inhibitor 
are prohibited. For Cohort 2 renal transplant patients enrolling to the study, 
corticosteroid use is permitted if used as part of their immunosuppressive regimen 
for graft protection prior to enrollment.  
 
3.2.3 Existing significant autoimmune conditions. Patients with a history of Hashimoto 
thyroiditis who are stable on replacement hormone therapy are not excluded.  
3.2.4 Known human immunodeficiency virus carrier or a diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Any 
positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating presence of virus, 
e.g., Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, Australia antigen) positive, or Hepatitis C 
antibody (anti -HCV) positive ( except  if HCV -RNA negative).  
3.2.5 Kidney  transplant  recipients  with active  acute rejection.  
3.2.6 Allergy  to cemiplimab  or any  of its components.  
3.2.7 Any prior  exposure  to the phosphoinositide  3-kinase  inhibitor idelalisib.  
3.2.8 Subject who has been treated with immunotherapy. This includes prior treatment with 
anti-PD-1, anti -PD-L1, anti -PD-L2, anti -CTLA -4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug 
specifically targeting T -cell co -stimulation or checkpoint pathways (including chimeric 
antigen receptor [CAR] T cell therapies). Prior topical or intralesional immunotherapies 
(e.g. imiquimod, talimogene laherperepvec) are allowed.  
3.2.9 Subject with known and untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical 
trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive 
neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other 
adverse  events.  However,  baseline  brain  imaging  is not required  prior  to enrollment  in the 
study if patients are asymptomatic. Patients at least 4 weeks out from metastatic central 
nervous system (CNS) treatment are permitted to enroll, if they are asymptomatic, 
radiographically stable per the investigator, and on stable doses of anti -epileptic drugs 
(AEDs) and oral corticosteroids (for Cohort 1 only, the patient must be on 10 mg of 
prednisone daily equivalent dosing or less, see 3.2.2) at the time of enrollment.  
3.2.10  Participants  receiving  any medications  or substances  that are strong  inhibitors  or inducers 
of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is 
important to regularly consult a frequently -updated list such as 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx ; medical reference texts such as the 
Physicians’ Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the 
enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of 
interactions  with other  agents,  and what  to do if new medications  need  to be prescribed  or 
if the patient is considering a new over -the-counter medicine or herbal product.

4. REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General  Guidelines  for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of any protocol -specific therapy or 
intervention. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol -specific therapy or 
intervention begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
An investigator  will confirm  eligibility  criteria  and a member  of the study  team  will complete  the 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
Following registration, participants may begin protocol -specific therapy and/or intervention. 
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal 
Investigator (PI). If the subject does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the 
subject must be taken off -study in the CTMS (OnCore) with an appropriate date and reason 
entered.  
4.1 Registration  Process  for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
Applicable  DF/HCC policy (REGIST -101) must be followed.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
While accrual is expected to be slow, we will approve two patients to enroll into to each cohort  
at a time to monitor toxicity appropriately.  
 
Eligibility and exclusion criteria are provided in Section 3 . These criteria will be assessed within 
14 days prior to study registration to establish eligibility and baseline values.  
 
Informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to the subject and 
before the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  
 
Demographic information and baseline characteristics will be collected at the Screening Visit. 
Standard demographic parameters include age, sex, and race/ethnicity (recorded in accordance 
with prevailing  regulations).  Baseline  characteristics  will include  ECOG  PS (Appendix  B), 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
19  
 disease  status, and  medical  histories.  
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 
No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the participant’s malignancy during the course of treatment. 
Treatment  cycles  will be 21 days  throughout  the protocol.  Patients  are assigned  to one of two 
predetermined  Cohorts  based  on their prior  transplant  history:  Cohort  1 (prior  allogeneic 
hematopoietic  stem  cell transplant  [allo-HSCT]  history)  or Cohort  2 (prior  renal  or kidney 
transplant history).  
 
5.1.1 Cemiplimab  Treatment  (same  for both Cohort  1 and Cohort 2) 
 
Cemiplimab (350 mg IV) will be administered in the outpatient setting at the beginning of the 
study (following a prednisone lead -in in Cohort 2 only ) and will be dosed every 21 days (3 
weeks) until disease progression, intolerability, or limiting toxicity.  
 
5.1.2 Dynamic  Immunosuppression  (Cohort  2 only) 
 
Patients in Cohort 2 with a history of prior renal transplant will need to transition to dynamic 
immunosuppression with either sirolimus or everolimus (mTOR inhibitors) during a lead -in 
phase of the study, 7 -10 days prior to receiving the first dose of cemiplimab. If the patient is on 
an existing immunosuppression regimen that includes other agents (azathioprine, tacrolimus, 
MMF) they will need to be cross -tapered in discussion with the lead transplant nephrologist on 
the study team, Dr. Naoka Murakami.  
 
5.1.2.1  mTOR  inhibitor and  Prednisone Lead -in 
 
Patients in Cohort 2 will start mTOR inhibition with either sirolimus or everolimus at least 7 -10 
days prior to receiving the first dose of cemiplimab (Cycle 1, Day 1). The choice of agent, 
starting dose, and titration of mTOR dosing to optimal blood levels is at the discretion of the 
treating transplant nephrologist.  
 
Patients in Cohort 2 will also receive prednisone 40 mg orally the day prior to the start of 
cemiplimab dosing (Cycle 1, Day 1).  
 
5.1.2.2  mTOR  inhibitor and Prednisone  dosing Scheme After Lead -in 
 
In Cohort 2, after the patient starts mTOR inhibition and receives 40 mg of prednisone as their 
lead-in to the first dose of cemiplimab, the patient then receives 40 mg of prednisone orally on 
the day of cemiplimab treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1) and for 2 days after cemiplimab dosing, 
followed by 20 mg daily for three additional days after anti -PD-1 dosing. Then on Cycle 1, Day  
7 the patient tapers to prednisone 10 mg orally daily and remains on this dose continuously until 
the day prior to the next cycle when the schedule repeats:

5.1.2.3  Antibiotic  prophylaxis  on immunosuppression  
 
Prophylactic  antimicrobial  and antiviral  use is permitted  while  patients  are receiving  mTOR 
inhibition and prednisone as part of dynamic immunosuppression.  
 
Dose  adjustments  of mTOR  inhibitors  based  on trough  levels  throughout  the study  do not impact 
the timing or dosing schedule of cemiplimab in the absence of toxicity concerns.  
 
5.2 Pre-Treatment  Criteria  
 
5.2.1 Cycle 1, Day 1 
 
Laboratory evaluations need to be repeated (except mTOR monitoring levels) and reviewed to  
re-meet eligibility criteria on Cycle 1, Day 1. In Cohort 2, patients must be on mTOR inhibition 
and have taken their 40 mg prednisone oral dose prior to cemiplimab on Cycle 1, Day 1.  
5.2.2 Subsequent Cycles  
 
Reasonable effort should be made to conduct study visits on the day scheduled (  3 days). 
Laboratory evaluations should be reviewed prior to the start of each cycle.  
 
Any changes from screening clinical evaluation findings that meet the definition of an adverse 
event (AE) will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. The drug diary for the prior cycle 
should be reviewed at each study visit by the clinical staff.  
 
5.3 Agent Administration  
 
5.3.1 Cemiplimab  
 
No pre-medications  are recommended  prior  to the administration  of cemiplimab.  Day -1 
prednisone is part of dynamic immunosuppression, not pre -medication.  
Cemiplimab (350 mg flat dose IV every 21 days) will be administered in an outpatient setting as 
an approximately 30 -minute infusion (+/ - 20 minutes). Post -treatment observation is required for 
30-minutes after the first infusion only to monitor for immune -mediated infusion reactions.

5.3.2 Dynamic  Immunosuppression  (Cohort  2) 
 
Participants in Cohort 2 will receive everolimus or sirolimus and prednisone on an outpatient 
basis. Everolimus or sirolimus pills can be taken with or without food as prescribed based on 
desired dosing (although ingestion of a high -fat meal should be avoided with sirolimus). As  
noted below in Section 5.4.2 , grapefruit juice should be avoided. Dosing of mTOR inhibitors is 
often once or twice daily (aiming for approximately 10 -12 hours between doses) and the patient 
should try to be consistent with dose administration timing. Prednisone dosing daily should also 
be timed so as to maintain consistent time intervals between daily doses.  
 
Immunosuppression compliance will be monitored as part of the study. Each participant will be 
required to maintain a medication diary of each dose of immunosuppressive medication. The 
medication diary will be returned to the clinic study staff at the end of each 21 -day cycle.  
 
If a dose of immunosuppression  is missed  by  6 hours  from  the last oral dose,  then the next dose 
should be retimed for the morning of the following day. Any dose of immunosuppression that 
was missed less than 6 hours from the last administration should be taken, and the following  
dose retimed for the morning of the following day. If immunosuppression is not tolerated, or 
vomiting results in loss of the ingested dose, the dose should be skipped, and the next planned 
dose attempted when possible. The immunosuppressive drugs may be crushed, chewed, or 
dissolved if necessary (everolimus is also available in a liquid suspension preparation).  
 
5.4 General  Concomitant  Medication  and Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Concomitant  Medical  Guidelines  
 
Pertinent concomitant medications will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). If changes 
occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also 
be included on the CRF.  
 
Topical,  intradermal,  and intraarticular  corticosteroids  are permitted.  
 
5.4.2 CYP3A4  Interactions  among  mTOR  inhibitors  
 
mTOR inhibitors are a known substrate of CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein/ABCB1 and therefore 
medications which can cause drug -drug interactions are listed in the Table below. Strong 
inducers of CYP3A4 are identified below with monitoring during concomitant therapy 
recommended. Category X drugs below should be avoided .

5.5 Criteria  for Taking a  Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until any of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease  progression  
• Intercurrent  illness  that prevents  further  administration  of treatment  
• Unacceptable  adverse event(s),  see Section 6.1.3  
• Participant  demonstrates  an inability  or unwillingness  to comply  with the oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
• Participant  decides  to withdraw  from  the protocol  therapy  
• General  or specific  changes  in the participant's  condition  render  the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
• Pregnancy  
 
The reason  for removal  from  protocol  therapy,  and the date the participant  was removed,  must  be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant. When a participant is removed from protocol therapy and/or is off study,  
participant’s status must be updated in OnCore in accordance with REGIST -OP-1. 
 
Following completion of 2 years or 24 months of protocol therapy with cemiplimab, the patient 
can be moved to commercial product at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
5.6 Duration  of Follow -Up 
 
Participants will be followed for best overall response and development and documentation of 
first disease progression and for survival throughout the course of the trial for 1 years from the 
time of end of treatment visit Participants who are removed from protocol therapy for an 
unacceptable adverse event and who have not developed first disease progression at time of 
discontinuation of protocol therapy will continue to be followed for 1 year from EOT visit. 
Follow -up after discontinuation of the cemiplimab study treatment should include one 30 -day 
follow up visit, then routine check -ins every 3 -4 months up to 12 months (1 year), which can 
overlap with routine clinic visits or include telephone encounters. Participants removed from 
protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
 
5.7 Criteria  for Taking a Participant Off Study  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
23  
 Participants  will be removed  from  study when  any of the  following  criteria apply:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal  of consent  for data  submission  
• Death  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant. In addition, the study team will ensure the participant’s status is updated in OnCore 
in accordance with REGIST -OP-1. 
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators must 
immediately notify the Principal Investigator, Glenn J. Hanna, MD, call Partners paging  
directory at (617) 732 -5500 and ask for pager #46231 . 
 
6. DOSING  DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated below. The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 5.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE 
version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website:  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
6.1 Cemiplimab  
 
There will be no dose reductions for cemiplimab permitted. Doses of cemiplimab may be 
interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the participant tolerates the 
treatment. Cemiplimab dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed. If cemiplimab doses are 
delayed or skipped, study testing resumes when the next cycle of cemiplimab begins and drug is 
resumed. However, immunosuppression dosing continues during the delay or skipped periods.  
6.1.1 Cemiplimab  Dose  Delays  or Holds  
 
Administration of cemiplimab should be delayed and the dose held for the following adverse  
events:  
• Grade  II, III, or IV acute  GVHD  according  to the modified  Glucksberg  scale  (see Section 
7.7) in Cohort 1  
• Moderate  to severe  chronic  GVHD  by the revised  NIH consensus  scoring  system  (see 
Section 7.8 ) in Cohort 1  
• Grade  2 non -skin,  drug-related adverse event  (AE), with the  exception  of fatigue  
• Grade 2 drug -related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or total bilirubin abnormalities unless 
specifically  due to chronic  GVHD  and not meeting  stopping  criteria  in bullet  two above  
• Grade  3 skin, drug -related adverse event  
• Grade  3 drug-related  laboratory  abnormality,  with the following  exceptions : lymphopenia 
or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not require dose delay  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
24  
 • Any adverse  event,  laboratory  abnormality,  or intercurrent  illness  which,  in the judgment 
of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.  
Note:  see Cemiplimab  investigator  brochure  and guidelines  on managing  immune -related 
toxicities ( Appendix E ) 
6.1.2 Re-treatment  Criteria  for Cemiplimab  
 
Participants who require delay of cemiplimab should be re -evaluated weekly or more frequently 
if clinically  indicated  and resume  dosing  when  re-treatment  criteria  (as described  below)  are met. 
Participants with a delay in dosing beyond 12 weeks should be considered for discontinuation of 
protocol treatment and discussed with the Overall PI.  
 
Subsequent dosing may be re -started if subjects continue to meet laboratory criteria (eligibility 
criteria values). The investigator will determine if subsequent dosing is appropriate for subjects 
who have laboratory or clinical abnormalities that do not meet dose discontinuation criteria.  
 
Immune -mediated adverse events or acute/chronic GVHD episodes or flares managed with oral 
steroid doses or standard treatment need (1) to resolve to Grade I for acute GVHD within 10  
days of starting GVHD treatment, (2) to mild NIH consensus score for chronic GVHD, or (3) to 
grade 1 AE symptoms or less for immune -related AEs, and the patient needs to be on ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone daily equivalent dose before resuming cemiplimab on study.  
 
All related grade 3+ toxicities and cases of acute or chronic GVHD should be discussed with the 
Overall PI, prior to subsequent dosing.  
 
6.1.3 Cemiplimab  Discontinuation  
 
Administration  of cemiplimab  should  be discontinued  for the following  AEs:  
• Unresolved  Grade  II, III, or IV acute  GVHD  according  to the modified  Glucksberg  scale 
despite 14 days (or 2 weeks) of systemic corticosteroids ( see Section 7.6.1 ) in Cohort 1  
• Any degree  of biopsy  proven  acute  renal  allograft  rejection  (see Section  7.6.3 ) in Cohort 
2 
• A grade  3 pneumonitis  and grade  3 uveitis  will require  permanent discontinuation.  
• A recurrent  grade  3 immune -mediated  adverse  reactions,  grade  2 or 3 immune -mediated 
adverse reactions persistent for 12 weeks or longer, and any grade 3+ infusion -related 
immune reaction.  
• Any grade  4 treatment -related  adverse  event  will require  permanent  discontinuation  with 
the following exceptions : 
− Certain grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities (specifically hypo/hypercalcemia, 
hypo/hyperchloremia,  hypo/hypermagnesemia,  hypo/hyperphosphatemia)  that < 72 
hours in duration  
− Grade  4 neutropenia <  5 days  in duration  
− Grade  4 increase  in amylase  or lipase  that is not associated  with clinical  or 
radiographic evidence of pancreatitis  
− Grade  4 lymphopenia <  5 days  in duration  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
25  
 The consideration  to re-initiate  study  therapy  under  these  exceptions  will be made  on a case by 
case basis  after considering the  overall benefit/risk profile  and in consultation with the Overall 
PI. 
6.2 Dynamic Immunosuppression  
 
Dose delays of prednisone and mTOR inhibition are discouraged as to promote immune  
tolerance of the bone marrow and kidney organ graft while the patient is receiving immune 
checkpoint blockade with cemiplimab.  
 
Dose modifications for prednisone may be required outside of the planned treatment dosing 
outlined above if the patient has immune -mediated AEs or graft rejection issues that require a 
change in dosing. Prednisone adjustments will be made by the treating investigator at their 
discretion.  
 
Everolimus or sirolumus dosing will be determined by target trough levels obtained or drawn every 7 -10 
days (± 3 days)  in cycles  1-2, then on days 1, 8 for cycles  3-6, and on day 1 only for cycle  7 onward  while 
on the study . There is delay in outside reporting of mTOR drug levels and this must be accounted 
for with periodic monitoring. The involved transplant nephrologist participating in the patient’s 
care should determine the dose and schedule of mTOR inhibition based on a target trough level 
of 4-6 ng/mL for everolimus or sirolimus.  
 
7. ADVERSE  EVENTS:  LIST  AND  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or potential AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an 
observed  AE (Section  7.2) will determine  whether  the event  requires  expedited  reporting  in 
addition to routine reporting.  
 
All adverse events experienced by participants will be collected during screening, from the time 
of the first dose of cemiplimab study treatment, through the study and within 30 days of the last 
study intervention. Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the last scheduled study visit 
may be kept on the study until the toxicity has resolved, or until the toxicity is deemed 
irreversible.  
 
7.1 Expected toxicities or adverse events are those that have been previously identified 
as resulting  from  administration  of cemiplimab.  For the purposes  of this study,  an adverse  event 
is considered expected when it appears in the current adverse event list in the investigator 
brochure or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Most common 
adverse  events  or expected  toxicities  are listed  below.  Management  of expected  immune -related 
toxicities is described in Appendix E . 
Toxicities  related  to mTOR  inhibitors  and prednisone  will be managed  according  to their 
respective package insert.

7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
An adverse  event  (AE)  is any undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition,  or experience  that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment (cemiplimab) 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they  
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be 
utilized  for AE reporting.  All appropriate  treatment  areas  should  have  access  to a copy  of the 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
27  
 CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
• For expedited  reporting  purposes  only:  
- AEs for the agent(s)  that are listed  above  should  be reported  only if the adverse  event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which 
is provided.  
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the 
next section  (Expedited  Adverse  Event  Reporting)  under  the sub-heading  of Protocol - 
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions.  
 
 
 
Attribution  of the AE: 
• Definite  – The AE  is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable  – The AE is likely related  to the  study treatment.  
• Possible  – The AE may be  related to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely  – The AE is  doubtfully  related to  the study treatment.  
• Unrelated  – The AE is  clearly NOT  related to  the study treatment.  
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.1 In the event of an unanticipated problem or life -threatening complications treating 
investigators must immediately notify the Overall PI  
7.3.2 Investigators must report to the Overall PI any adverse event (AE) that occurs after  
the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within 90 days of the last dose 
of cemiplimab treatment on the local institutional SAE form.  
 
7.3.3 DF/HCC  Adverse  Event  Reporting Guidelines  
Investigative  sites within  DF/HCC  will report  AEs directly  to the DFCI  Office  for Human 
Research Studies (OHRS) per the DFCI IRB reporting policy.  
Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
Definition  of SAEs  
 
A Serious  Adverse  Event (SAE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  that at any dose:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or causes  prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
28  
 • Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that  may not be  immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g. 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g. pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the 
study drug is an SAE.  
 
Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI), and cancer are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs.  
Any component  of a study  endpoint  that is considered  related  to study  therapy  should  be reported 
as an SAE (e.g. death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).  
 
 
 
7.3.4 Protocol -Specific  Adverse Event  Reporting Exclusions  
 
There  are no protocol -specific  adverse  event  reporting  exclusions  for this protocol.  
 
7.4 Reporting  to the Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA ) 
 
The Overall  PI, as study  sponsor,  will be responsible  for all communications  with the FDA.  The 
Overall  PI will report  to the FDA,  regardless  of the site of occurrence,  any serious  adverse  event 
that meets the FDA’s criteria for expedited reporting following the reporting requirements and 
timelines set by the FDA. Submit by fax to 1 -800-FDA -0178.  
 
7.5 Reporting  to Hospital  Risk  Management  
 
Participating investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any participant 
safety  reports,  sentinel  events  or unanticipated  problems  that require  reporting  per institutional 
policy.  
7.6 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse  Events  must  be reported  in routine  study  data submissions  to the Overall  PI on the 
toxicity case report forms.  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., reported to the 
IRB, FDA, etc.) must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
7.7 Routine Adverse Event Reporting to Regeneron  
 
Routine  Adverse  Events  will not  be reported to  Regeneron.  Regeneron will  be collecting SAE

 reports  only.  
All SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those  
thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that 
occur within 90 days of discontinuation of cemiplimab dosing. All SAEs should be followed to 
resolution or stabilization.  
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period. If applicable, SAEs must be 
collected that relate to any protocol -specified procedure (e.g., a follow -up skin biopsy).  The 
sponsor -investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods that is believed  
to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
The sponsor -investigator will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level only) 
transmitted to Regeneron, but all SAEs must be reported to Regeneron within 24 hours  of 
occurrence, and sent to medical.safety@regeneron.com .

7.6.1 Acute  GVHD  Adverse  Event Grading  (Cohort 1) 
Symptoms of acute GVHD among Cohort 1 require staging at initial and subsequent visits to 
ensure accuracy of severity. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria use of 
clinical findings [41], rather than a set of time periods, defines acute vs. chronic GVHD for the 
purpose of this study.  
The modified Glucksberg grade (I -IV) should be utilized for on -study documentation (Table 
below).  
 
 
7.6.2 Diagnostic  Criteria  for Chronic  GVHD  (Cohort  1) 
 
Symptoms of chronic GVHD among Cohort 1 require staging at initial and subsequent visits to 
ensure accuracy of severity. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria use of 
clinical  findings  as summarized  in the Table  below  [42],  rather  than a set of time periods,  defines 
acute vs. chronic GVHD for the purposes of this study.

¶ Diagnosis  of chronic  GVHD  requires  biopsy  or radiology  confirmation  (or Schirmer  test for eyes). 
PFTs = pulmonary function tests  
 
The NIH GVHD scoring system includes information on the number of organs or sites involved 
and the severity within each affected organ (e.g., skin, mouth, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, 
lungs,  joints/fascia,  and genital  tract)  (see Form  in Appendix  F). Organ  specific  severity  is scored 
from 0 to 3 with higher scores reflecting more severe disease. Based upon this information, the 
overall severity is scored as mild, moderate, or severe:  
• Mild  – Involves  two or fewer  organs/sites  with no clinically  significant  functional 
impairment  
• Moderate  – Involves  three  or more  organs/sites  with no clinically  significant  functional 
impairment or at least one organ/site with clinically significant functional impairment, 
but no major disability  
• Severe  – Major disability  caused by chronic GVHD  
 
7.6.3 Suspected  Acute  renal  allograft  rejection  (Cohort  2) 
 
For the purposes  of this study,  acute  renal  allograft  rejection  should  be suspected  in patients  with 
one or more of the following:  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
32  
 • New  increase  in serum  creatinine  of ≥ 25% from  baseline  which  is persistent  for at least 7 
days or a serum creatinine that is higher than expected (such as in recently transplanted 
patients whose serum creatinine stops decreasing earlier than expected after 
transplantation).  
• Worsening hypertension  
• Proteinuria  >1 g/day  
• Plasma  donor -derived  cell-free DNA  (dd-cfDNA) >1% 
 
Any participant  in Cohort  2 with suspected  acute  renal  allograft  rejection  would  require  a renal 
allograft biopsy at the discretion of the involved transplant nephrologist to make the 
diagnosis, accurately grade the severity of rejection, and determine the degree of irreversible 
kidney damage. Biopsy of the renal allograft can also reveal other causes of renal inflammation 
and injury, including: cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, BK (polyomavirus) nephropathy, 
interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, de novo or recurrent glomerular disease, and posttransplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).  
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse  events  and potential  risks  associated  with the investigational  or other  agents 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7 . 
 
8.1 Cemiplimab  
 
8.1.1 Description  
 
Cemiplimab is a covalent heterotetramer consisting of two disulfide -link human heavy chains, 
each of which is covalently bonded through disulfide linkages to a human kappa light chain. The 
antibody possesses an approximate molecular weight of 143.6 kilounified atomic mass unit  
(kDa) based on the primary sequence. There is a sing N -linked glycosylation site on each heavy 
chain, located within the constant region in the Fc portion of the molecule. The cemiplimab 
heavy chain possesses an IgG4 isotype constant region. The variable domains of the heavy and 
light chains combine to form PD -1 binding site within the antibody.  
 
Cemiplimab -rwlc (REGN -8210 or Libtayo®) is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal  
antibody that inhibits programmed death -1 (PD -1) activity by binding to PD -1 and blocking the 
interactions with the ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2, releasing PD -1 pathway -mediated inhibition of 
immune response, including anti -tumor response. PD -1 ligand upregulation may occur in some 
tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T -cell immune 
surveillance of tumors. Blocking PD -1 activity has resulted in decreased tumor growth.

9. BIOMARKER,  CORRELATIVE,  AND  SPECIAL  STUDIES  
 
9.1 Laboratory  Correlative Studies  
Correlative studies are planned as part of this study in order to characterize the peripheral and 
tumor  immune  microenvironment  and perform  tumor  immunophenotyping  and functional  assays. 
A peripheral blood sample and fresh tissue tumor biopsy ( B1) is required as part of enrollment to 
the study and after (30 days or 2 cycles of therapy but before cycle 3, [ B2]) anti -PD-1 therapy. 
Blood and tissue will be sent for tumor immune profiling and other studies, which will include 
genomic  and mutational  analysis.  Fine needle  aspiration  cytology  samples  alone  are discouraged, 
but acceptable if no core material is available.  
 
An additional required tissue biopsy ( B3R ) is required at the time of organ rejection or the 
development of GVHD to assess the off -target immunologic effects of treatment.  
 
9.1.1 Specimen  Collection  and Handling  
 
The study aims for 2 -3 cores per mandatory tumor biopsy obtained throughout the study. The 
tumor biopsy may be core, a fine needle aspiration (FNA), or skin biopsy. If doing a skin core, 
any size up to 6mm is acceptable.  
• 1 core is fresh tissue  placed in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 5 mL 
microcentrifuge tube for multiparametric flow cytometry or CyTOF, or other genomic or 
molecular studies. The tissue will and delivered to the Belfer Center for Applied Cancer 
Science, 360 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, phone: 207 -423-0958 or 631 -487- 
6573 (contact: Patrick Lizotte, Ph.D.). The specimen must arrive in a timely fashion to 
facilitate processing for evaluation of immune cells.  
• 1 or 2 cores are fixed  or placed a standard specimen cup containing 10% neutral buffered 
formalin for IHC/MIF, genomic, and functional assay work. Once prepared, aliquoted 
core material for will be delivered immediately to the laboratory of Dr. Ravindra  
Uppaluri at the DFCI [Dana Building, 8th floor, room 819, 450 Brookline Avenue, 
Boston, MA 02215, phone: 617 -632-3091].  
 
The study  aims  to collect  mandatory  peripheral  blood  samples  throughout  the study.  
 
• 4 tubes  drawn in phlebotomy or clinic and captured in 8 mL whole blood, purple top 
tubes are collected at each time point for peripheral immunophenotyping. The volume of 
blood to be collected per blood draw for study purposes will not exceed 40 mL. After 
collection, two blood tube samples should be delivered immediately to the Belfer Center 
for Applied Cancer Science, 360 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, phone: 207 - 
423-0958 or 631 -487-6573 (contact: Patrick Lizotte, Ph.D.). The other two samples 
should be delivered immediately to the Transplant Research Center, 221 Longwood 
Avenue,  Boston,  MA 02215,  phone:  617-732-5252  (contact:  Naoka  Murakami,  MD 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817

 PhD).  The specimens  must  arrive  in a timely  fashion  (ideally  within  4 hours  of 
colelction) to facilitate processing for evaluation of immune cells.  
The study aims to collect mandatory urine samples throughout the study for the detection of 
potential biomarkers of kidney rejection.  
• 1 urine cup  (at least 10 mL) should be collected in clinic and after collection, the urine 
sample should be delivered immediately to the Transplant Research Center, 221 
Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, phone: 617 -732-5252 (contact: Naoka 
Murakami, MD PhD). The specimen must arrive within 4 hours of collection to facilitate 
processing for evaluation of immune cells.  
All specimens will be de -identified and labeled with the participant’s study ID number, the date 
of acquisition, and timepoint on study [ B1, B2, B3R as above]. Leftover specimens may be 
banked for future use and would be accessible to Dr. Glenn Hanna, the overall PI.  
 
9.1.2 Planned  Correlative Studies  
 
Peripheral blood and tumor biopsy samples will be treated with monoclonal antibodies specific 
for different immune cell markers (CD3, CD8, PD -1/L1, TIM -3, LAG -3, CTLA -4, FOXp3, 
CD56, etc.) to identify immune cell subsets (or phenotypes) and tumor cells. After incubation of 
cells with monoclonal antibodies, individual subsets are then enumerated by flow cytometry. 
These studies will allow us to measure quantitative changes of individual cell populations that 
occur as a result of anti -PD-1 treatment. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) will permit high throughput 
analysis of single cells for a large number of parameters, to deeply immunophenotype and track 
the inhibitory and activating receptor diversity of immune cells among samples.  
 
IHC/MIF is additionally planned on tumor biopsy specimens to identify immune cell population 
geographic and spatial interactions not depicted by flow cytometry or CyTOF. Antibody staining 
for immune cell markers noted above will be employed for slide overlay comparison among 
matched pre - and post -immunotherapy tumor biopsies (when available).  
 
Paired tumor biopsy material is also partitioned to perform whole -exome sequencing analyses on 
DNA, bulk RNA, or both (as tissue and resources permit). Additional T cell receptor (TCR) 
sequencing  may also be  explored.  Mutational  burden  and individual alterations will  be correlated 
with response.  
 
Peripheral blood and urine samples will be used for immune cell characterization with above 
flow cytometry, and matched to tumor samples to compare immune subsets in circulation with 
those in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, plasma and urine cytokine profiling will be 
employed to measure key inflammatory cytokines (IL -2, IFN -γ) to correlate with response.  
 
10. STUDY  CALENDAR  
 
Baseline or screening evaluations are to be conducted within 2 weeks (14 days, ± 3 days) of the 
start of protocol  therapy  (either  cemiplimab  in Cohort  1, or the lead-in phase  for Cohort  2).

 11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
11.1 Antitumor  Effect  – Solid  Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, participants should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks 
through cycle 10 at which point restaging scans can occur every 12 weeks.  In addition to a 
baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained (not less than 4) weeks following 
initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed  by the Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  guideline  (version  1.1) 
[43] and by WHO response criteria [44]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Changes in the sum of the products of the two longest 
diameters in perpendicular directions (bidimensional measurements) are used in the WHO 
criteria.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for Target Disease response.  Only those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their 
disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. 
(Note:  Participants who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response . Participants who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non -target disease. The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease . Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with  
CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  area may be considered 
measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
 
Page  39 

NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
40  
  
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short  
axis), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/lung parenchymal inflammation, 
inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), and cystic 
lesions are all considered non -measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts  
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non - 
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as  
target lesions.  
 
Target lesions (per RECIST v1.1).  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions 
per organ  and 5 lesions  in total,  representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified 
as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be  
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of 
all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not 
lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest 
for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short  axis is added  into the sum.  The baseline  sum diameters  will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension  of the disease.  For the purpose  of this study,  when  using  WHO  criteria,  up to 5 
lesions are measured, or are deemed target lesions.  
 
Non-target lesions (per RECIST v1.1) . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including  
any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- 
target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are 
not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each 
should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
11.1.3  Methods  for Evaluation  of Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, 
or a digital measurement tool. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  
 
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used to characterize  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
41  
 each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm in diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Conventional CT and MRI.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice  
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the  
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used, and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all (target) lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions,  taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters  per RECIST  v1.1.  At least a 
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
42  
 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the two longest diameters among all 
lesions per WHO criteria.  
Progressive  Disease  (PD) : Per RECIST  v1.1,  at least a 20% increase  in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at least 5 
mm. Per WHO criteria, at least a 25% increase in the sum of the product of the two 
longest diameters among all lesions, or at least 25% increase in any 1 lesion.  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study per both RECIST v1.1 and WHO criteria.  
11.1.4.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  for RECIST  v1.1 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or  
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3  Evaluation  of New  Lesions  
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new. If a new 
lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it 
truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared 
using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
11.1.4.4  Second  Primary  Cutaneous  and Other  Malignancies  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
43  
 Given this study involves high -risk and immunosuppressed transplant survivors, the 
finding of a new, spatially or regionally distinct (not in -transit) non -melanomatous 
skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) thought to be a second primary is not 
considered a new lesion for the definition of PD. In addition, the development of a 
second primary malignancy with squamous histology (in the lungs, head and neck) is 
also not considered a new lesion for the definition of PD.  
11.1.4.5  Treatment  Beyond Disease Progression  
 
The decision to treat any study participant beyond progression of disease is at the 
discretion of the treating investigator and can be discussed with the Overall PI. 
Patients who are assigned a best response of PD at any time point can continue on - 
study treatment if the patient is receiving some reasonable clinical benefit and is 
tolerating the study drug.  
 
Patients treated beyond disease progression should be re -consented at the time of 
initial imaging showing possible progression to ensure they are aware of alternative 
therapies and investigational options that may be available in lieu of continued study 
treatment.  
 
In this scenario, it is recommended that repeat restaging imaging be performed 4 -6 
weeks after the documentation of PD to re -evaluate for ongoing clinical benefit.  
 
 
11.1.4.6  Evaluation  of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

11.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration  of overall  response : The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started,  or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation).  
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events  
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.  
 
Duration  of stable  disease : Stable  disease is  measured from  the start of the treatment  until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to death 
due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
 
Progression -Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
registration to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive 
without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.  *** In exceptional  circumstances,  unequivocal  progression  in non-target  lesions  may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note : Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective  evidence  of disease  progression  at that time should  be reported  as “symptomatic  deterioration.” 
Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.

12. DATA  REPORTING  / REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse  event  lists, guidelines,  and instructions  for AE reporting  can be found  in Section 7.0 
(Adverse  Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  
 
12.1 Data Reporting  
 
12.1.1  Method  
The Office of Data Quality (ODQ) will collect, manage, and perform quality checks on  
the data for this study.  
12.1.2  Responsibility  for Data Submission  
Study  team  is responsible  for entering  data in the eDC system  (InForm),  within  the 
timeframe, in accordance with DF/HCC SOPs.  
 
Tumor  genomic  and molecular  profiling  results  that are available  or become  available 
during the study will be recorded during study participation.  
 
 
12.2 Data Safety Monitoring  
 
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity 
and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with 
experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that 
raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI and study 
team.  
 
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review 
toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up -to-date 
participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade 2 or higher 
unexpected adverse events that have been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30  
days of intervention  for Phase  I or II protocols;  for gene  therapy  protocols,  summary  of all deaths 
while being treated and during active follow -up; any response information; audit results, and a 
summary provided by the study team. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be 
provided upon request.  
 
13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This study  is not designed  for statistical  hypothesis  testing.  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
46  
  
Original  biostatistical  design : 
The 3+3 design is adapted to determine the safety and toxicity of immunotherapy in Cohort 1  
and Cohort 2. To that end, while accrual is expected to be slow, we will approve two patients to 
enroll into to each cohort at a time to monitor toxicity appropriately. For each cohort, the 
maximum sample size is 12. The actual sample size is dependent upon observed GVHD rate or 
acute organ rejection rate. The assessments will be done when up to 12 patients have been 
enrolled and observed in each cohort. For Cohort 1 , a GVHD rate exceeding 33% is considered 
unacceptable. The following table shows the stop rule:  
 
Number  of patients  treated  in Cohort  1 3 6 12 
Stop recruitment  if # of GVHD  ≥ 2 3 6 
 
For Cohort 2 , a renal transplant rejection rate exceeding 60% is considered unacceptable. This 
cutoff was selected given that recently published data including 23 renal transplant recipients 
who received  various  checkpoint  inhibitors  experienced  a 50% rate of acute  kidney  rejection  [19] 
on variable immunosuppressive regimens. Since enrolled subjects in the current study have 
incurable, metastatic, and life -threatening cutaneous SCC, the investigators feel that an acute 
renal graft rejection rate above 60% would mitigate the exposure risk to PD -1 blockade in the 
present study. Therefore, the following table shows the stop rule:  
 
Number  of patients  treated  in Cohort  2 3 6 12 
Stop recruitment if #  of rejection ≥ 2 4 6 
 
Modified biostatistical design: Due to slower than expected accrual in Cohort 1 and the  
observation of safety and efficacy in Cohort 2, the Sponsor -Investigator and study team  
discussed  closure  of Cohort  1 with a focus  on Cohort  2 in November  2021.  No patients  enrolled  
to Cohort 1. With those updates, the final sample size was set at a maximum of 12 patients  
overall (in Cohort 2 only).  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoints: To determine the safety and toxicity of immunotherapy in advanced 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) patients having undergone prior hematopoietic stem 
cell or renal transplant.  
 
Secondary  Endpoints:  To evaluate  the anti-tumor  activity  and survival  benefit  in advanced 
cSCC patients receiving immunotherapy despite a history of transplant:  
• To estimate progression -free survival (PFS)  and overall survival (OS) 
• To estimate duration  of therapeutic response  
• To estimate the  propensity for secondary  infection on treatment  
Follow -up visits will occur every 3 -4 months up to 1 year. Accrual is expected to be slower than 
other  therapeutic  protocols  given  the rarity  of the condition,  but we expect  1 patient  to enroll  
NCI Protocol  #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19 -817 
Protocol  Version Date: May 3, 2023  
47  
 every 3 months among each cohort (1 renal transplant patient, and 1 stem cell transplant patient) 
which would result in an estimated 18 months or 1.5 years to accrue the study.  
13.2 Stratification  Factors  
 
There  are no planned  stratification factors.  
 
13.3 Analysis  of Primary  Endpoints  
 
Patient safety will be assured by monitoring the proportions of patients who have 
observed GVHD in Cohort 1 or renal transplant rejection in Cohort 2 when 3 to 12 
patients have been enrolled into each cohort.  
Participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment. The 
toxicity will be presented in frequency tables (overall and by cohort). In tables 
showing  the overall  incidence  of adverse  events,  patients  who experienced  the same 
event on more than one occasion will be counted only once in the calculation of the 
event frequency. The worst grade of an event will be reported for any patient.  
13.4 Analysis  of Secondary  Endpoints  
 
Time -to-event endpoints will be summarized using the method of Kaplan -Meier. 
Point estimates for each endpoint will be presented with 90% confidence intervals 
derived using log( -log(survival)) methodology. The other secondary endpoints 
including anti -tumor activity will be summarized descriptively.  
14. PUBLICATION  PLAN  
 
The results should be made public within 24 months of reaching the end of the study. The end of 
the study is the time point at which the last data items are to be reported, or after the outcome 
data are sufficiently mature for analysis, as defined in Section 13 on Sample Size, Accrual Rate 
and Study Duration. If a report is planned to be published in a peer -reviewed journal, then that 
initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of 
Medical  Journal  Editors.  A full report  of the outcomes  should  be made  public  no later than three  
(3) years  after the end  of the study.

APPENDIX  C GUIDANCE  ON CONTRACEPTION  
 
Highly  Effective  Methods  of Contraception:  
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently and 
correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to use one of the 
highly effective methods of contraception listed below. Male subjects must inform their female partners 
who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are expected to adhere to using 
contraception with their partner.  
 
At a minimum,  subjects  must  agree  to use one highly  effective  method  of contraception  as listed  below:  
 
For WOCBP  highly  effective  methods  of birth  control  include  the following:  
• Progestogen  only hormonal  contraception associated with  inhibition of ovulation  
• Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills 
(combination  of estrogen  and progesterone),  vaginal  ring, injectables,  or implants  
• Intrauterine  devices  (IUDs)  (hormonal  or non-hormonal)  
• Intrauterine  Hormone -releasing  System  (IUS)  
• Bilateral  tubal ligation  
• Vasectomy  
• Complete  abstinence  (complete  avoidance of  heterosexual intercourse)  
 
For male  subjects  with  partners  that are WOCBP:  
• Condom  
 
All male  subjects  who have  partners  who are WOCBP  must  use condoms  as their second  method  of 
contraception.  
 
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving cemiplimab will be instructed to adhere to 
contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving 
nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a 
period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product. These durations have been calculated 
using the upper limit of the half -life for cemiplimab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement 
that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half -lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with 
WOCBP use contraception for 5 half -lives plus 90 days after the last dose of cemiplimab.

APPENDIX  D IMMUNE -MEDIATED  TOXICITY  MANAGEMENT  ALGORITHMS  
 
• These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncology (I -O) agents and regimens.  
• A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately 
treated.  
• Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug -related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low - 
grade  toxicity.  The lower  bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids  should  be taken  into account  when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
• Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.  
• The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno -oncology agent or regimen being used.

in Sections 9.3.2.1 and 
9.3.2.2 accordingly as 
follows :
xRemoved endpoints 
containing ‘PSSD sign

this change is that PSSD 
sign score is redundant 
with components 
assessed by PASI and 
sPGA which are already 
in the hierarchy.
xRemoved ‘change from 
baseline in DLQI score. ’ 
The reason for this 
change is that DLQI endpoint ‘DLQI 0/1 
among subjects with 
baseline DLQI score ≥ 2’ 
is clinically meaningful 
and is already in the 
hierarchy.
xChanged the 
comparisons to 
apremilast from ‘sPGA

75 at Week 52 ’, and 
‘PASI 90 at Week 52 ’to

for AnalysesChanged to:
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  All subjects who were randomized to 
receiv eassigned study treatment. Following the intent-to- treat 
principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment  
group assigned at randomization. The FAS will be the primary 
efficacy analysis population .
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  A subset of the FAS who are compliant 
with study treatment and who do not have any relevant protocol 
deviations that may impact the coprimary efficacy endpoint 
assessments (Section 9.6.3 ). The PPS will be analyzed for the 
coprimary endpoint comparison according to the treatment
assigned at randomization.
As-treated Population :  All randomized subjects who take at least 
one dose of study treatment. Subjects will be analyzed accordin g 
to treatment received. The As-treated population will be for 
safety analyses.To align populations for testing 
coprimary efficacy endpoints in order and to clarify that Per Protocol set will 
be a subset of FAS to assess the 
sensitivity of coprimary endpoints results based on FAS with respect to 
data irregularity and deviations

Protocol 
DeviationsChanged to:
Relevant protocol deviations are deviations that can have an 
impact on the primary efficacy endpoints. The impact of 
relevant protocol deviations on the primary efficacy results will 
be assessed by excluding subjects from the FAS to define the PPS 
in supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints. 
Relevant protocol deviations to be consi dered regarding exclusion 
of subjects from the FAS will include the following:
Subject randomized but did not take any study treatment
Subject failed to meet study inclusion criteria but was 
randomi zed to receive study treatment
Subject met astudy exclusion criterion which may have an 
impact on the coprimar y efficacy endpoints but was 
randomized to receive study treatment
Subject non -compliant with study treatment within the first 
16weeks of treatment; defined as < 80% compliant with study 
treatment 
Subject took prohibited concomitant medication prior to 
Week 16
Subject received treatment diffe rent to intended treatment at 
any visit prior to Week 16
All subjects with relevant protoc ol deviations will be identifi ed 
prior to database lock. Relevant protocol deviations will be 
summarized by treatment group  and deviation category for 
the FAS population.To clarify and document the final list of 
relevant protocol deviations for Per

1.1 Synopsis 
Protocol Title:  A Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- and Active Comparator-
Controlled Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of  BMS-986165 in Subjects with 
Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Short Title: Efficacy and Safety of BMS-986165 versus Placebo and Active Comparator in Subjects 
with Psoriasis
Study Phase: 3
Rationale: 
BMS-986165 is being evaluated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of subjects with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis based on results of a recen tly completed 12-week,
randomized, Phase 2, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study ( Study IM011011). The Phase 2 
study was conducted with the following 5 different BMS-986165 t reatment arms: 3 mg every other 
day (QOD); 3 mg once daily (QD); 3 mg twice daily (BID); 6 mg B ID; and 12 mg QD. Overall, 
267 subjects were randomized (44 to 45 subjects per treatment a rm) in the Phase 2 study. All 
BMS-986165 treatment groups, except 3 mg QOD, achieved the prim ary endpoint of superiority 
compared with placebo in the proportion of subjects experiencin g at least a 75% improvement in 
the Psoriasis Area and Severity  Index (PASI 75) after 12 weeks of treatment. Compared with the 
placebo treatment group (6.7%), 38.6% (p = 0.0003), 68.9% (p < 0.0001), 66.7% (p < 0.0001) and 
75% (p < 0.0001) of the subjects treated with BMS-986165 at 3 mg QD, 3 mg BID, 6 mg BID and 
12 mg QD doses achieved a PASI 75 response, respectively. The P ASI 75 responses appear to 
plateau at the dose of 3 mg BID. The current Phase 3 study is d esigned to confirm the efficacy and 
safety of BMS-986165 6 mg QD which is expected to have equivale nt efficacy as the 3 mg BID 
dose in Phase 2, in a larger global population of subjects with  stable moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis.  
Study Population: 
Men and women ≥18 years of age di agnosed with stable (defined as no morphology changes or 
significant flares of disease activity in the opi nion of the investigator) plaque psoriasis for ≥6 
months and with moderate-to- severe disease by involvement of ≥10% of body surface area (BSA), 
static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥3, PASI score ≥12, and candidates for phototherapy 
or systemic therapy will be eligible to participate in the stud y.

Overall Design: 
This will be a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,  double-dummy, placebo- and 
active comparator-controlled study in subjects with stable mode rate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. 
Subjects will undergo screening evaluations within 28 days prio r to administration of study 
medication to determine eligibility. Following the screening process, approximately 600 qualified 
subjects will be randomized i n a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the foll owing 3 treatment groups: 
xBMS-986165 6 mg QD 
xPlacebo 
xApremilast 30 mg BID (with initial titration per label) as acti ve comparator 
Randomization should not occur until at least 8 days after the Screening Visit to allow collection 
of PSSD data during screening in order to calculate a baseline PSSD score. Randomization will be 
stratified by geographic region (U.S., Japan [body weight stratum will not be applied in Japan],

use (for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or other inflammatory d iseases only; yes/no), and body weight 
(≥90 kg and <90 kg). If subjects from China are not enrolled in the study, then  the stratification 
level for China will not be utilized. As this is designed to be  a global study across multiple 
countries, randomization in each country will be targeted to ap proximately 35% or less of the total 
sample size. This change is being implemented to achieve geogra phical representation across 
countries and to minimize the potential for any single country to have a disproportionate impact 
on the overall efficacy and/or safety profile. 
At Week 16, subjects receiving placebo will be switched in a bl inded manner to BMS-986165

continue their current dose through Week 52.  
At Week 24, subjects originally randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID who do not achieve PASI 50 
response will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-986165 6 m g QD; those who achieve

Statistical Methods 
General Methodology 
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the Full Analy sis Set (FAS). The FAS will 
include all randomized subjects who are dispensed study drug.  
The analysis model for the coprimary efficacy endpoints and sec ondary binary endpoints will use 
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests stratified by th e factors used for randomization 
(see Sec. 4.1.2 ) to compare the response rates of BMS-986165 6 mg QD to placeb o or apremilast 
as applicable. If expected cell counts are not sufficient for each strata level, then strata levels will 
be combined for the analysis. Nonresponder imputation will be u sed for binary endpoints for 
subjects who discontinue study or treatment of study prior to W eek 16, start a protocol prohibited 
medication/therapy that could improve psoriasis during the firs t 16 weeks of treatment, or who 
have otherwise missing endpoint data at the specified timepoint .

17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 19The analysis model for continuous secondary endpoints will use analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment and the factors used for randomization as fixed effects. The baseline 
value will be added into the model as a covariate. Treatment di fferences based on least-squares 
(LS) means and the corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interva ls (CIs) will be provided for the 
difference between BMS-986165 6 mg QD and placebo or apremilast  depending on the endpoint 
being assessed. 
Testing Strategy for Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary family of coprimary endpoints will each be tested at a Type I error=0.05 first, and if 
significant for both endpoints, testing will proceed for the se condary family of key secondary 
endpoints . The primary family of coprimary endpoints will be the serial  gatekeeper for 
proceeding with testing of the secondary family of key secondar y efficacy endpoints. 
Primary Family – Coprimary endpoints compared with placebo; both must be signif icant at a Type 
I error=0.05 in order to proceed with the secondary family test s for the key secondary endpoints:  
xPrimary 1: Proportion of subjects who achieve sPGA 0/1 at Week 16 
xPrimary 2: Proportion of subjects who achieve PASI 75 at Week 1 6 
In order to control for Type I error rate inflation within the secondary family of key secondary 
endpoints, separate testing branches with a 2-sided Type I erro r=0.025 will be used for 
comparisons of BMS-986165 6 mg QD compared to placebo and BMS-9 86165 6 mg QD 
compared to apremilast. A hierarchical testing method within ea ch testing branch will be 
implemented for the key secondary endpoints. The hierarchical test may only proceed to the next 
key secondary endpoint within each testing branch if the null h ypothesis is rejected a Type I 
error=0.025. If an endpoint fails at any step, then all subsequent p-values will be considered descriptive. 
Safety Analysis 
Safety data will be summarized  using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and frequency distributions (counts and 
percentages) for categorical variables.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, characterize d primarily by erythematous scaly 
plaques, that affects up to 3% of the general population. Men a nd women are equally affected and 
it can present at any age.1,2 Several studies have observed a bimodal distribution of psoria sis onset 
with the first peak ranging from 15 to 22 years of age, and the  second peak ranging from 55 to 60 
years of age.3,4,5 The most common form of psoriasis (58% to 97% of cases) is pla que psoriasis 
(psoriasis vulgaris), with less common forms being guttate, pus tular, inverse (flexural), and 
erythrodermic psoriasis. The disease can have a fluctuating relapsing course, with flares that may 
be induced by factors such as infections, trauma, smoking, and stress.3 Psoriasis can involve skin 
in any part of the body; particularly disabling is the involvem ent of specific anatomic regions, such 
as hands and feet (palmoplantar), face, scalp, and nails. Disea se severity can be classified by body 
surface area (BSA) involvement with mild defined as ≤10% BSA, and moderate -to-severe as 
>10% BSA.6 Psoriasis has a profound impact on quality of life and can lea d to psychological, 
social and economic consequences, especially in moderate-to-sev ere disease. This condition is also 
associated with an increased risk of depression, occurrence of sleep disturbances, social stigma, 
and decreased work productivity.7,8 Commonly associated comorbidities found in psoriasis 
patients include diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. In p atients with more severe forms of 
the disease, life expectancy is decreased due to an increase of  cardiovascular risk.9
Treatments include topical preparations, eg, corticosteroids, v itamin D analogues, calcineurin 
inhibitors, and salicylic acid; phototherapy modalities, includ ing PUVA (psoralens with UVA) and 
narrow band UVB; and systemic therapies. In moderate-to-severe disease, systemic treatments are 
usually needed and may include oral agents (retinoids, methotre xate, cyclosporine, and apremilast) 
or injectables (eg, biologics such as tumor necrosis factor (TN F) inhibitors etanercept, infliximab, 
and adalimumab) anti-IL-12/23p40 antibody (ustekinumab), IL-17 antagonists (secukinumab, 
ixekizumab, and brodalumab), and anti-IL-23p19 antibody (guselk umab). Many of these 
treatments are associated with increased risk of adverse events  (AEs) such as hepatotoxicity and 
neutropenia (methotrexate);10 nephrotoxicity (cyclosporine);11 depression and weight loss 
(apremilast);12 serious infections (cytokine inhibitors);13,14,15,16candidiasis and Crohn’s disease 
(IL-17 antagonists).16,17,18
Although effective therapeutic options are available, under-treatment or nontreatment of psoriasis 
has been reported in up to half of surveyed patients (based on absence of treatment and/or 
dissatisfaction with treatment).19 Many patients with severe disease are still being managed with 
only topicals,4,8 and many patients consider their psoriasis treatment to be inadequate. 
Accordingly, there remains a need for more effective oral optio ns, when compared with currently 
available agents, that would improve efficacy responses and inc rease adherence to treatment. 
2.1 Study Rationale 
BMS-986165 could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of s ubjects with moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis based on results of a recently completed 12-we ek, randomized, Phase 2, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study with 5 different BMS-986165 tr eatment arms: 3 mg every other

IM011011). Overall, 267 subjects were randomized (44 to 45 subj ects per treatment arm) in the 
Phase 2 study. All BMS-986165 treatment groups, except 3 mg QOD , achieved the primary 
endpoint of superiority compared with placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75
after 12 weeks of treatment. Compared with placebo treatment gr oup, in which 6.7% of the subjects 
achieved PASI 75 response, 38.6% (P = 0.0003), 68.9% (P < 0.0001), 66.7% (P < 0.0001) and 75% (P < 0.0001) of subjects treated with 3 mg QD, 3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, and 12 mg QD achieved 
PASI 75, respectively. The PASI 75 responses plateaued at a dos e of 3 mg BID. Also, there was a 
clinically significant proportion of subjects treated with BMS- 986165 achieving an sPGA score of 
0 or 1 compared with placebo at Week 12. Compared with the placebo treatment group in which 6.7% of the subjects achieved an sPGA score of 0 or 1, 41.5%, 7 5.6%, 65.9%, and 75% of the 
subjects treated with 3 mg QD, 3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, and 12 mg QD  achieved an sPGA score of 
0 or 1, respectively with responses again plateauing at dose of 3 mg BID. The Phase 3 dose selected 
(6 mg QD) is expected to demonstrate equivalent efficacy to the  3 mg BID dose. Please refer to 
 
This Phase 3 study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safe ty of BMS-986165 6 mg QD and 
demonstrate its superiority to a widely used oral agent, apremi last, in a larger global population of 
subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  
2.2 Background 
Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase assoc iated with receptors for the 
p40-containing cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, as well as the Type I  interferon (IFN) receptor, and is 
required for the activation of their downstream signaling pathw ays. TYK2 catalyzes the 
phosphorylation of the intracellular receptor domains and signa l transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) proteins resulting in the activation of ST AT-dependent transcription and 
functional responses specific for these cytokines.
20,21,22 Because TYK2-dependent cytokines (eg, 
Type I IFNs, IL-12, IL-23) are distinct from those dependent on closely related Janus kinase (JAK) 
family members JAK1/JAK3 (eg, IL-2, IL-15, IL-7) or JAK2 (eg, e rythropoietin, thrombopoietin, 
GM-CSF), a TYK2 inhibitor would be expected to have a highly di fferentiated profile from 
inhibitors of other JAK family kinases. TYK2-dependent pathways  and the cytokine networks they 
modulate (eg, IL-23/IL- 17, IFNα ) have be en implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple 
immune- mediated diseases, including psoriasis, lupus, spondyloarthritides, and Crohn’s disease.
BMS-986165 is a potent, highly-selective, oral, small molecule inhibitor of TYK2. A 
comprehensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of BMS-9861 65 has been established and 
supports the development of this compound in humans. Inhibition  of TYK2 is expected to provide 
therapeutic benefit for subjects with psoriasis for multiple re asons: 1) Many of the pathways in the 
TYK2 signaling cascade (IL-23 and the downstream mediators IL-1 7 and IL- 22; IFNα ) have been 
implicated in pathogenesis of psoriasis.8 2) Biologic agents targeting the IL-17, IL-23p19, and IL-
12/23 p40 pathways have been approved for and are highly effica cious in the treatment of psoriasis.

1 Early Clinical Development 
The clinica
l data available to date supporting the safety, phar macokinetics (PK), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of BMS-986165 are from 5 completed Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects 
(IM011002, IM011015, IM011016, IM011031, and IM011039) and 1 completed Phase 2 study in 
adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (IM0110 11).  
Overall, BMS-986165 has been generally well-tolerated across all studies, and no safety issues 
have been identified to limit the investigation of the dose of BMS-986165 up to 12 mg QD in 
further clinical studies. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of BMS-986165 is provided in the Investigator Brochure (IB).

4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Design 
This will be a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,  double-dummy, placebo- and 
active comparator-controlled study to evaluate the safety and e fficacy of BMS-986165 vs placebo 
and apremilast. A total of 600 qualified subjects with moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis will be 
enrolled. 
The duration of study participation is approximately 60 weeks a nd will be divided into the 
following periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), treatment (52 wee ks), and follow-up (4 weeks). 
Physical exams, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and other assessments will be done 
at select visits during the study. Subjects in this study will be monitored for AEs.

BMS-986165 TYK2 Inhibitor 
17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 39Subjects will be evaluated during the screening period to ensur e they meet eligibility criteria. A 
detailed medical history will be done at this time, as well as a complete physical exam. Psoriasis-
related history, which will include length of diagnosis, body i nvolvement, and history of systemic 
treatment, will be assessed here. Depression and suicidality assessments will also be performed. 
An evaluation for tuberculosis will be done based on medical hi story, recent chest imaging, and a 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. 
4.1.2 Treatment Period 
Qualified subjects who have completed the screening procedures and have met the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 2:1:1 ratio, respectively to one of the 
following 3 treatment groups: 
xBMS-986165 6 mg QD 
xPlacebo 
xApremilast titrated to 30 mg BID as follows: 
oDay 1: 10 mg tablet in the morning 
oDay 2: 10 mg tablet in the morning and evening 
oDay 3: 10 mg tablet in the morning and 20 mg tablet in the even ing 
oDay 4: 20 mg tablet in the morning and the evening 
oDay 5: 20 mg tablet in the morning and 30 mg tablet in the even ing 
oDay 6 and thereafter: 30 mg tablet in the morning and the eveni ng 
Dummy tablets (placebo to the BMS-985165 6 mg tablet, placebo t o apremilast 30 mg tablet BID, 
and placebo to apremilast 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg during titrat ion) will be administered to the 
subjects to maintain blinding. Additional details are provided in Section 6.1. Note that apremilast 
will not be used as a treatment arm in China. 
Randomization should not occur until at least 8 days after the Screening Visit to allow collection 
of PSSD data during screening in order to calculate a baseline PSSD score. Randomization will be 
stratified by geographic region (U.S., Japan [body weight stratum will not be applied in Japan], 
China [body weight stratum will not be applied in China], and R est of World), previous biologic 
use (for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or other inflammatory d iseases only; yes/no), and body weight 
(≥90 kg and <90 kg). If subjects from China are not enrolled in the study, then  the stratification 
level for China will not be utilized. As this is designed to be  a global study across multiple 
countries, randomization in each country will be targeted to ap proximately 35% or less of the total 
sample size. This change is being implemented to achieve geogra phical representation across 
countries and to minimize the potential for any single country to have a disproportionate impact 
on the overall efficacy and/or safety profile.

17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 404.1.3 Week 16 
The coprimary endpoints (sPGA 0/1 and PASI 75) will be assessed  at Week 16. Subjects receiving 
placebo will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-986165 6 mg  QD at Week 16. Subjects who 
are randomized to BMS-986165 6 mg QD or apremilast 30 mg BID wi ll continue their treatment 
regimen. 
4.1.4 Week 24 
At Week 24, subjects originally randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID who do not achieve PASI 50 
response will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-986165 6 m g QD. Subjects in the 
apremilast treatment arm who achieve PASI 50 response at Week 2 4 will continue to receive 
apremilast 30 mg BID in a blinded manner through Week 52.
During the Week 24 assessment, a subject who has an sPGA ≥3  may be treated with 
restricted topicals/shampoos as described in Section 6.7.1 at the inve stigator’s discretion. These 
treatments may be only initiated at Week 24, and not at subsequ ent time points. A subject who is 
initiated on these treatments at Week 24 may use them as needed per the investigator’s judgment 
through Week 52. 4.1.5 Week 52 and Follow-up Period 
The follow-up period is a 4-week window after the Week 52 visit , unless the subject rolls over into 
the long-term extension. The subject will be encouraged to repo rt any SAEs or AEs experienced 
during this time. 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment early should remain in  the study for protocol-specified 
procedures (please refer to Section 7.1for more details).
Subjects completing 52 weeks of treatment will be offered the opportunity to roll over to a separate 
long- term extension study ( ≥2 years) where they will be treated with BMS -986165 6 mg QD.

fluctuation of psoriasis activity that may occur and to provide  a safety standard for comparison. 
Subjects in the placebo arm will be switched to BMS-986165 at Week 16 to provide them psoriasis 
treatment after the endpoints ar e collected. Apremilast is incl uded as the active control in this study 
as it is an approved, widely used, oral, daily medication for p soriasis. Week 16 was chosen as it 
would allow enough time for BMS-986165 as well as apremilast to  treat psoriasis. In addition, 
prior apremilast registrational trials had reported psoriasis-r elated outcomes at Week 16 as their 
primary endpoints. Subjects in the apremilast arm who do not ac hieve PASI 50 at Week 24 will 
be switched in a blinded fashion to BMS-986165. This will allow subjects who are not responding to apremilast to receive an alternate study treatment. PASI 50 is used to justify the switch because 
achieving PASI 50 has been shown to have a meaningful impact on  quality of life in people with 
psoriasis.

For laboratory parameters that initially do not meet eligibilit y requirements, a single retest within 
the 28-day screening period is permitted before subject is decl ared a screen failure. This is an effort 
to find all possible well-qualified subjects. Consultation with  the Medical Monitor may be needed 
to identify whether repeat testing of any particular parameter would be clinically relevant. 
The study permits the rescreening (after the end of the initial  28-day screening period) of a subject 
who discontinues the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, the subject fails to meet eligibility criteria 
and has not been treated). The s ubject must be reconsented, wil l be assigned a new identification 
number, and a full Screening Visit must be performed again. A s ubject can only be rescreened 1 
time (ie, if the subject fails 1 rescreening attempt, no additi onal rescreening is allowed). Depending 
on the timing of rescreening, repeat chest imaging may not be required. Duration of existing 
treatments and required discontinuation periods shall be considered relative to the new Screening 
Visit and/or randomization. 
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be 
assessed, as it represents the subject’s most current clinical state.
6 TREATMENT 
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s),  marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study subject a ccording to the study randomization 
or treatment allocation. 
Study treatment includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Produ ct (IP/IMP) and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non-IP/Non-IMP) and can consist of the following: 
BMS-986165, placebo, and apremilast. 
An IP, also known as IMP in some regions, is defined as a pharm aceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a c linical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (f ormulated or packaged) differently 
than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indicatio n, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form. 
Other medications used as support or escape medication for prev entive, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as  
non-IP. Table 5 shows the study treatments for Protocol IM011046.

between subjects receiving apremilast and BMS-986165 during the  titration period, active 
apremilast and matching apremilast placebo tablets will be prov ided. This will be supplied in an 
18-day titration kit as follows: 
One 10 mg tablet in the morning on Day 1; two 10 mg tablets (on e in the morning, one in the 
evening) on Day 2; one 10 mg tablet in the morning and one 20 m g tablet in the evening on Day 3;

6.2 Method of Treatment Assignment 
Before the study is initiated, each user (at investigative sites) will receive log-in information and 
directions on how to access the interactive response technology  (IRT) system. At the time of the 
Screening Visit, immediately after informed consent is obtained  and before any study-related 
procedures are performed, the investigative site will access th e enrollment option of the IRT 
system for assignment of a subject number for all subjects, including subjects not subsequently randomized or treated. The subject number is assigned sequentia lly by the system and will be 
unique across all sites. All enrolled subjects will be assigned  sequential subject numbers. The 
subject number will not be used for any other subject. If a sub ject is rescreened, they will be given 
a new identification number.

17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 53At Week 0 (Day 1), subjects who meet all criteria for enrollmen t at Screening and Day 1 will be 
centrally randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to BMS-986165 6 mg QD, pl acebo, or apremilast 30 mg BID 
as determined by a computer-generated randomization schedule us ing IRT. The randomization 
lists will be generated by the IRT vendor using a permuted block design within each combination 
of stratum level. The randomization in this study will be stratified by geographic region (U.S., Japan [body weight stratum will not be applied in Japan], China  [body weight stratum will not be 
applied in China], and Rest of World), previous biologic use (f or psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or 
other inflammatory diseases only; yes/no), and body weight ( ≥90 kg and <90 kg). As this is 
designed to be a global study across multiple countries, randomization in each country will be targeted to approximately 35% or less of the total sample size.  This change is being implemented 
to achieve geographical representation across countries and to minimize the potential for any single 
country to have a disproportiona te impact on the overall effica cy and/or safety profile.
After all inclusion/exclusion c riteria have been met for a subj ect, the investigative site will access 
the IRT on Day 1 for the purposes of randomizing a subject. A t reatment group will be assigned 
by IRT based on the above-described randomization schedule and each subject will be assigned a 
unique randomization number. In addition, a unique kit number will be assigned to the subject 
corresponding to the treatment assignment. 
A kit will contain adequate study treatment for a 4-week supply . At subsequent visits, when new 
treatment kits need to be provided, the investigative site will  access the IRT to obtain the kit 
number to assign to the subject. Study treatment will be dispen sed at study visits as shown in the 
Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).
At Week 16, subjects receiving placebo will be switched in a bl inded manner to BMS-986165 
6m g  Q D .  At Week 24, subjects originally randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID who do not achieve PASI 50 
response will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-986165 6 m g QD. Subjects originally 
randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID who achieve PASI 50 response at Week 24 will continue to 
receive apremilast 30 mg BID in a blinded manner. The investiga tive site and other study personnel 
will not have knowledge of the PASI 50 score at this visit and will therefore remain blinded. 
6.3 Blinding
6.3.1 Maintaining the Blind 
Blinded treatment assignments will be managed using IRT. Throug hout the study, subjects will 
receive matching placebo (for BMS-986165 and/or apremilast) as needed to maintain the treatment 
blind. IP supply will be controlled by IRT at each visit. 
All tablets are identical in appearance and will be supplied in  blister cards or bottles with each 
daily dose made up of the appropriate combination of active and /or placebo tablets to provide the 
correct treatment, as shown in Table 5 . Investigative site staff, Sponsor and designee personnel, 
and subjects and their families will remain blinded to treatmen t assignments.

6.3.
2 Circumstances for Unblinding 
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject in which knowledge of the IP 
is critical to the subject's management, the blind for that sub ject may be broken by the investigator. 
The subject’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment 
assignment should be unblinded. 
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment, the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it will a lter the subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is c learly not related to the IP, the 
problem may be properly managed by assuming that the subject is  receiving active product. It is 
highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignm ent be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate authority for  the decision to unblind. The 
principal investigator should only call in for emergency unblinding AFTER the decision to discontinue the subject has been made. 
In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted acce ss to randomization information via 
IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the 
Sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify th e Medical Monitor and/or study 
director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is de scribed in the IRT manual. 
Subject and unblinded treatment information and the reason for the blind being broken must be 
recorded on the appropriate stud y status page of the electronic case report form (eCRF). After 
unblinding via IRT, the investigator shall notify the Medical M onitor. 
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt is made 
to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a subject for non emergency purposes must be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to unblinding. 
If a subject is unblinded for a ny reason, the subject will be discontinued from treatment. 
6.4 Dosage Modification 
There is no provision for dose-modification of study treatment.  If a subject interrupts treatment 
due to an AE, study treatment can be restarted in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
6.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local reg ulations. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that the IP is only dispensed to stu dy subjects. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatm ent is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (te mperature, light, and humidity)  as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treat ment arise, the study treatment 
should not be dispensed and BMS should be contacted immediately .

At the end of the study, the investigator should ensure that su bjects continue to receive appropriate 
standard of care to treat the condition under study.  
In addition, for subjects who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit, BMS may continue to 
provide study treatment via a rollover extension study requirin g approval by responsible health 
authority and ethics committee , or through another mechanism at  the discretion of BMS.  
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied stud y treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b) th e development of BMS-986165 is 
terminated for other reasons including, but not limited to, lac k of efficacy and/or not meeting the 
study objectives; c) the subject can obtain medication from a government sponsored or private health program. In all cases BMS will follow local regulations.  
7 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA 
7.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment 
Subjects MUST discontinue IP (and non-IP at the discretion of t he investigator) for any of the 
following reasons: 
xSubject requests to stop study treatment. Subjects who disconti nue study treatment early 
should remain in the study for protocol-specified procedures. The only exception to this is 
when a subject specifically withdraws consent for any further c ontact with him/her or 
persons previously authorized by subject to provide this inform ation. 
xAny clinically significant AE, laboratory abnormality, or inter current illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participa tion in the study is not in the 
best interest of the subject. If treatment is discontinued due to an AE, the AE eCRF must 
be completed to show that the AE caused discontinuation. 
xeGFR <45 mL/min on repeat assessment within 7 days 
xAbnormal liver tests suggestive of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), as defined in Section 
8.2.8 or if the investigator believes th at it is in the best interest  of the subject 
xSubject reports suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, or suicid e attempts at any time after 
randomization, or documents suicidal ideation by answering “Yes” to Question 4 or 5 on 
the eC-SSRS, or documents suicidal behavior on the eC-SSRS at a ny time during the study. 
The subject should then be immediately referred to a mental hea lth professional for 
evaluation of suicide risk.

xLoss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectio us disease) illness 
Refer to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up and fo r any further evaluations t hat can be completed. 
All subjects who discontinue BMS-986165 should comply with prot ocol-specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 1.3. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness). Replacement of subjects is not permitted. 
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documen ted in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page. 
7.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation of Study Medication 
Temporary study treatment discontinuation is only allowed if th e subject develops an AE which, 
in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that it is in the subject’s best interest that the study 
treatment be placed on hold. Study treatment in this situation should be stopped until the AE is 
medically treated and has resolved pe r principal investigator’s judgment.
Any temporary study treatment discontinuation as well as restart must be documented on the 
corresponding eCRF. 
7.1.2 Post-Study Treatment Study Follow-Up
Post-study follow-up is of critical importance and is essential  to preserving subject safety and the 
integrity of the study. Subjects who discontinue study treatmen t must continue to be followed for 
collection of outcomes and/or survival follow-up data as requir ed and in line with Section 4 until 
death or the conclusion of the study.

7.2 Discontinuation from the Study 
Subjects who request to discontinue study treatment will remain  in the study and must continue to 
be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures as spec ified in Section 1.3. The only 
exception to this is when a subject specifically withdraws cons ent for any further contact with 
him/her or persons previously authorized by subject to provide this information.  
xSubjects should notify the investigator of the decision to with draw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible. 
xThe withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
investigator and entered on the appropriate CRF page. 
xIn the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or  dead) is being measured, publicly 
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in 
accordance with local law. 
xIf the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future infor mation, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal  of consent. 
7.3 Lost to Follow-Up
xAll reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to deter mine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the subject. 
xLost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of three
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of res ponse by subject to one 
registered mail letter. All attempts should be docu mented in the subject’s medical records.
xIf it is determined that the subject has died, the site will us e permissible local methods to obtain 
date and cause of death. 
xIf investigator’s use of third -party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the  study 
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor-retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact 
information or other public vital status data necessary to comp lete the follow-up portion of the 
study. 
xThe site staff and representative will consult publicly availab le sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, i n order to obtain updated contact in formation.

meet all eligibility criteria before randomization. Randomizati on should not occur until at least 
8 days after the Screening Visit to allow collection of PSSD da ta during screening in order to 
calculate a baseline PSSD score. The investigator will maintain  a screening log to record details 
of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record r easons for screening failure, as 
applicable.

xFor several assessments, appropriate training will be provided to investigators and designated 
personnel at sites. Only those individuals trained and certifie d to perform these assessments 
will be performing them during the study. 
8.1 Efficacy Assessments 
Every effort must be made to ensure that the same evaluator(s) complete the assessment for each 
subject. If the evaluator(s) is unable to complete the evaluati on, then a qualified individual with 
overlapping experience may perform the evaluation. Documentatio n of who performed the 
evaluation is to be recorded in source documents. Assessments a re to be performed at 
approximately the same time  of day throughout the duration of the study.  
Baseline assessments must be performed per protocol (standard of care assessments may not be 
used for baseline). Procedures not specified in the protocol th at are part of standard care may be 
performed if they do not interfere with study procedures; any d ata arising from such procedures 
are not to be reported in the eCRF. 
8.1.1 Investigator-Administered Assessments 
8.1.1.1 static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA)
The sPGA is a 5-point scale of an average assessment of all pso riatic lesions based on erythema, 
scale, and induration.25 The sPGA measure determines psoriasis severity at a single poi nt in time 
(without taking into account the baseline disease condition) as  clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), 
moderate (3), or severe (4). All sPGA assessments should be per formed by a trained physician (eg 
dermatologist) or appropriately trained investigator who is exp erienced in the assessment of 
psoriasis patients. Every effort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who 
performed the sPGA evaluations for a subject at randomization p erforms the sPGA for that subject 
at all subsequent visits (see APPENDIX 5 ).
8.1.1.2 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 
The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of psoriatic skin lesions 
(each graded on a 0 –4 scale), weighted by the area of involvement (head, arms, trun k to groin, and 
legs to top of buttocks).26 The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72,  with

response to treatment. The PASI 50 is the proportion of subjects who experience at least a 50% 
improvement in PASI score as compared with the baseline value. The PASI 75, PASI 90, and 
PASI 100 are defined similarly. BMS will host a training sessio n prior to initiation of the study to 
demonstrate proper PASI scoring. All PASI assessments should be  performed by a trained 
physician (dermatologist) or appropriately trained investigator  who is experienced in the 
assessment of psoriasis patients (see APPENDIX 6 ).  
8.1.1.3 Body Surface Area (BSA) 
Measurement of psoriasis BSA involvement is estimated using the  handprint method with the size 
of a subject’s handprint (including fingers and thumb) representing 1% of BSA involved.27,28,29
The total BSA = 100% with breakdown by body region as follows: head and neck = 10% 
(10 handprints), upper extremities = 20% (20 handprints), trunk  including axillae  and groin = 30% 
(30 handprints), lower extremities including buttocks = 40% (40 handprints). All BSA assessments 
should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately trained  investigator who is experienced 
in the assessment of psoriasis patients. 
8.1.1.4 scalp specific Physician’s Global Assessment (ss -PGA) 
For this assessment in subjects with scalp involvement,30scalp lesions are evaluated in terms of 
clinical signs of redness, thickness, and scaliness and scored on the following 5-point ss-PGA 
scale:
0 = absence of disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease , 3 = moderate 
disease, 4 = severe disease. 
The ss-PGA should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately trained investigator who is 
experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients. An example  of the ss-PGA is provided in 
APPENDIX 7 .

tightness) and 6 subject-observed signs (skin dryness, cracking , scaling, shedding or flaking, 
redness, bleeding) using 0– 10 numerical ratings. The severity of each item is rated on an 11-point 
numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). Two versions of the PSSD 
were developed, one with a 24-hour recall period (PSSD-24h) and one with a 7-day recall period. 
The PSSD-24h will be administered daily in this trial to avoid recall bias with a longer recall period 
(see APPENDIX 13 ).
8.1.2.4 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
The DLQI39 is a subject-reported quality of life index which consists of 10 questions concerning 
symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, school,  personal relationships, and treatment 
during the last week. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 t o 3 by a tick box: 0 - "not at all", 
1 -- "a little", 2 - "a lot", or 3 - "very much". The scores are summed, giving a range from 0 (no 
impairment of life quality) to 30 (maximum impairment) (see APPENDIX 14 ).

The PASE questionnaire will be ad ministered at Screening in sub jects with peripheral joint 
complaints. The PASE questionnair e is a self-administered tool that is used to screen for psoriatic 
arthritis among subjects who have psoriasis. The PASE questionn aire consists of 15 questions 
subdivided into 7 questions focusing on symptoms of psoriatic a rthritis, and 8 questions focusing 
on the impact of psoriatic arthritis on function. Each question  is scored on a 1 to 5 scale, with a 
maximum score of 75. A score of 47 or above has been shown to d istinguish between psoriatic 
arthritis and non-psoriatic arthritis.46 This questionnaire is only intended to be a screening tool for  
psoriatic arthritis and does not replace a comprehensive muscul oskeletal exam performed by a 
rheumatologist. The PASE questionnaire should take 6 to 10 minu tes to complete and is only done 
at Screening (See APPENDIX 21 ).
8.2 Adverse Events 
The definitions of an AE and SAE can be found in APPENDIX 3 . 
All AEs will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the subject to 
discontinue before completing the study.  Contacts for SAE repor ting are specified in APPENDIX 3 . 
8.2.1 Adverse Events of Interest 
Adverse events of interest (AEIs) are AEs for a particular prod uct or class of products that a 
Sponsor may wish to monitor carefully. Adverse events of interest may be serious or nonserious. 
Such events may require further investigation  to better charac terize and understand them. In the 
BMS-986165 clinical development program, certain skin-related A Es (eg, acne), infection AEs, 
and CK elevation have been identified as potential AEIs; however, there has been no definitive

Additionally, given a potential association between treatment for autoimmune diseases and 
increased risk for cancer, malignancy has been identified as a potential AEI. Therefore, additional 
information about certain skin-related AEs, infection AEs, CK e levation, and malignancy may be 
collected on the case report form in order to better characteri ze and understand them. 
8.2.2 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at ini tiation of study treatment until 
discharge from the study (ie, final study visit for a given subject), at the timepoints specified in the 
Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).  
The Reference Safety Information in Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 of  the IB should be used to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the subject’s written con sent to 
participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not rela ted to study drug, must be collected, 
including those thought to be associated with protocol-specifie d procedures. 
All SAEs must be collected from the date of subject’s written consent until 30 days after the final 
dose of the study drug or subject’s participation in th e study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a 
later time. Monitoring for SAEs will occur at every study visit.  
xThe investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed 
to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Me dical occurrences that begin 
before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informe d consent will be recorded on the 
appropriate section of the CRF. 
xAll SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee w ithin 24 hours, as indicated 
inAPPENDIX 3 .  
xThe investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponso r within 24 hours of this being 
available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study subjects. However, 
if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a subject has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reaso nably related to the study treatment 
or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify t he Sponsor. 
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAE s and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in APPENDIX 3 . 
8.2.3 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during  open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent r eporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specifi c occurrence of one or more AEs ). 
8.2.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
xNonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see APPENDIX 3 ).
xFollow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.

the CRF. Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for A Es and/or laboratory 
abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of  the study. 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required t o proactively follow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until res olution, until the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up (as defined 
in Section 7.3).
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in APPENDIX 3 . 
8.2.5 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
xPrompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of s ubjects and the safety of a product 
under clinical investigation are met. 
xAn investigator who receives an investigator safety report desc ribing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to  local requirements. 
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive  2001/20/EC and FDA Code of 
Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (Suspecte d, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities 
and investigators following local and global guidelines and req uirements. 
8.2.6 Pregnancy 
In the event a subject becomes pregnant during the trial, the s tudy treatment must be discontinued 
immediately. If the subject becomes pregnant while on treatment  or within 3 days of discontinuing 
study treatment, the investigator must immediately notify  D rug Safety of this event and 
complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to  Drug Safety within 24 hours of 
awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting pro cedures described in APPENDIX 
3. The investigator must also notify the Medical Monitor or designee of this event within 24 hours 
of awareness of pregnancy.  
The pregnant subject will need to be followed up until the conc lusion of the pregnancy for 
pregnancy outcomes. The safety data of the subject will continu e to be collected under the same 
rules as instructed in Section 7.1.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study s ubject should be reported to  
Drug Safety. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pr egnancy surveillance information 
from the female partner, the female partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of this information. 
Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnanc y Surveillance Form. 
8.2.7 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities 
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.

It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than  laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia vs low hemoglobin value). 
8.2.8 Potential Drug-Induc ed Liver Injury (DILI) 
All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteri a, must be reported as SAEs (see 
Section 8.2 and APPENDIX 3  for reporting details). Wherever possible, timely confirmation of 
initial liver-related laborator y abnormalities should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI 
event. 
Potential DILI is defined as:  1)ALT or AST elevation >3 times ULN 
AND
2)Total bilirubin >2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase), 
AND
3)No other immediately apparent possible causes of liver function  test elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepati tis, preexisting chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
8.2.9 Other Safety Considerations 
Any significant worsening of a preexisting medical condition no ted during interim or final PE, 
ECG, x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment requi red or not required by protocol 
should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 
8.3 Overdose 
For this study, taking more than 2 days’ worth of study treatment within a 24 -hour time period will 
be considered an overdose. 
In the event of an overdose the investigator should: 1)Contact the Medical Monitor immediately 
2)Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnorma lities  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be  made by the investigator in

A complete physical examination will include general appearance , vital signs, eyes, ears, nose 
mouth, throat, neck, respiratory, cardiovascular, respiratory, GI/abdomen, lymphatic, 
musculoskeletal, skin, psychiatric, and neurologic exams. A tar geted physical examination will 
include any organ system associate d with an AE or a laboratory abnormality. 
8.4.2 Vital Signs 
Refer to Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).
8.4.3 Electrocardiograms A 12-lead ECG will be performed at the visits indicated in the schedule of activity (Section 1.3).
The patient will remain supine for 5-10 minutes prior to the EC G and must have their lab work 
done after the tracing so that the ECG results remain as accura te as possible. The ECG  results will 
be read by the primary study investigator or a designee. 
8.4.4 Tuberculosis Screening and Chest Imaging
Chest imaging results and PE are part of the process to assess a subject’s eligibility, as outlined in 
Section 1.3 and as defined in exclusion criterion 3.c (Section  5.2). Chest imaging (eg, chest x-ray, 
chest CT scan) at the Screening Visit is required if not alread y performed and documented within 
6 months of obtaining written informed consent. A subject must n ot have active signs or symptoms 
of TB, as judged by the investigator, to be eligible for the st udy. 
In addition to a complete PE and medical history to evaluate ex posure to TB, all subjects will have 
a screening test, an IGRA (eg, QuantiFERON
®-TB Gold) performed centrally. If unable to obtain 
central laboratory results, an IGRA test could be obtained loca lly, after consultation with the  
Medical Monitor. A subject with an indeterminate IGRA test resu lt must be retested for 
confirmation. If the second result is again indeterminate, the subject will be excluded from the 
study. If the second result is positive, the subject should be considered as having LTBI provided 
there are no signs or symptoms of active TB. If the second resu lt is negative, the subject may be 
eligible provided no other exclusi on criterion for TB is met.

Depression will be monitored by administration of the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-8) at Screening and during visits as outlined in Section 1.3.
8.4.6.1 Eight-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)
The PHQ-8 is established as a valid diagnostic and severity mea sure for depressive disorders in 
large clinical studies.48 Each of the 8 questions is based on a 2-week recall and scored  on a scale 
of 0 to 3 by a tick box as: Not at All, Several Days, More than Half the Days, and Nearly Every 
Day. A score of ≥10 is suggestive of moderate depressive symptoms (see APPENDIX 22 ).49 If a 
subject scores ≥15 on the PHQ -8 during the study, the investigator will review the situation and 
refer the subject to a mental health professional if deemed nec essary. 
8.4.7 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SIB) Monitoring 
Subjects in this clinical trial will be monitored for SIB by th e eC-SSRS (Section 8.4.7.1) at the 
visits outlined in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Subjects who answer yes to Questions 4 
or 5 which indicates a suicidal ideation severity level of 4 or 5 or document suicidal behavior or 
suicidal attempts on the eC-SSRS will have their treatments dis continued and be immediately 
referred to a mental health professional for further evaluation . In addition, family members or 
caregivers of the subjects will be instructed to immediately re port any suicidal ideation, suicidal 
behavior, or suicide attempt to the investigator. 
8.4.7.1 electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) 
The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS)  is a computer-automated, 
patient-reported version of the C-SSRS instrument that defines 11 categories of SIB events.50,51,52
The categories are as follows: 
xSuicidal ideation 1. Passive 
2. Active: Nonspecific (no method, intent, or plan) 
3. Active: Method, but no intent or plan

The analysis model for the coprimary efficacy endpoints, sPGA 0 /1 and PASI 75 
(responder/nonresponder) at Week 16, will use stratified Cochra n-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests 
stratified by the stratification factors used for randomization  (see Section 4.1.2) to compare the 
response rates of BMS-986165 6 mg QD to placebo using the Week 16 data of the FAS. If expected 
cell counts are not sufficient for each strata level, then stra ta levels will be combined for the 
analysis. The odds ratio (ratio of odds in BMS-986165 6 mg QD g roup to the odds in placebo 
group) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be provided. Estimates of 
proportions and their 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided.
9.4.1.1 Imputation Methods for Coprimary Endpoints 
Nonresponder imputation (NRI) will be used for coprimary efficacy endpoints for subjects who 
discontinue study or treatment of study prior to Week 16, start  a protocol prohibited 
medication/therapy that could improve psoriasis during the firs t 16 weeks of treatment, or who 
have otherwise missing endpoint d ata at the specified timepoint . The NRI will the primary method 
of imputation for the coprima ry efficacy endpoints. 
9.4.1.2 Sensitivity Analyses for the Coprimary Endpoints 
The following imputation methods will be used in sensitivity an alyses of the coprimary efficacy 
endpoints: 
xLast observation carried forward (LOCF) for subjects with missi ng values at Week 16 
xFor subjects with missing values at Week 16, LOCF will be used for placebo subjects and 
NRI will be used for BMS-986165 6 mg QD subjects. This will include subjects who 
discontinue early, start a protocol prohibited medication/thera py prior to Week 16 that 
could improve psoriasis, or who have otherwise missing endpoint  data at Week 16 
9.4.1.3 Supportive Analyses for the Coprimary Endpoints 
The coprimary efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using th e Week 16 data of the PPS using 
the analysis described in Section 9.4.1 and the imputation methods described in Section 9.4.1.1.
Additionally, the coprimary efficacy endpoints for the FAS will  be analyzed with a logistic 
regression model with treatment and the stratification factors used for randomization as covariates. 
9.4.1.4 Subgroup Analyses for the Coprimary Endpoints 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the coprimary efficacy endpoints for the FAS using the 
analysis described in Section 9.4.1 and the imputation methods described in Section 9.4.1.2.

9.4.2 Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
The analysis model for the binary secondary endpoints will use stratified CMH tests stratified by 
the stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 4.1.2) to compare the response rates 
of BMS-986165 6 mg QD to placebo or apremilast for the FAS. If expected cell counts are not 
sufficient for each strata level, t hen strata levels will be co mbined for the analysis. The odds ratio 
(ratio of odds in BMS-986165 6 mg QD group to the/odds in place bo group or active comparator 
group), and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI will be provided. 
The analysis model for continuous secondary endpoints will use analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) , with treatm ent and stratification factors 
used for randomization as fixed effects. The baseline value wil l be added into the model as a 
covariate. Treatment differences based on least-squares (LS) me ans and the corresponding 2-sided 
95% CIs will be provided for the difference between BMS-986165 6 mg QD and placebo or active 
comparator depending on the endpoint being assessed. 
9.4.2.1 Imputation Methods for Secondary Endpoints 
The NRI will be applied to the analyses of binary secondary eff icacy endpoints for subjects who 
discontinue early, start a protocol prohibited medication/thera py that could improve psoriasis, or 
who have otherwise missing endpoint data prior to the specified  timepoint.  
For continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, a modified baselin e observation carried forward 
(mBOCF) will be used for missing data. The baseline observation  will be carried forward for 
subjects who discontinue study treatment due to: 
xLack of efficacy 
xAEs 
and for subjects who start a protocol prohibited medication/the rapy that could improve psoriasis 
prior to the endpoint. The last valid observation will be carri ed forward for all other subjects with 
missing data. 
At Week 24, subjects originally randomized to apremilast 30 mg BID who do not achieve PASI 50 
response will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-986165 6 m g QD. These subjects will be 
considered nonresponders to apremilast for the timepoints after  the switch for the binary endpoints 
for the Week 52 comparisons. The mBOCF described above will be used for the continuous 
endpoints. Subjects will be ana lyzed according to their origina l randomized treatment group.

Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 
Good Clinical Practice 
This study will be conducted in accordance with: 
xGood Clinical Practice (GCP)  
xas defined by the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)  
xin accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC 
xUnited States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (2 1CFR50)  
xapplicable local requirements. 
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. Th e protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will receive approval/favorabl e opinion by Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), and regulatory au thorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study. 
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or d esignee immediately. A serious 
breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in c onnection with the study or the 
protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity 
of the subjects of the study or the  scientific value of the study. 
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified b y education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks. 
This study will not use the services of study personnel where s anctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific mis conduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
Institutional Review Board/I ndependent Ethics Committee 
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and  dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recrui tment materials 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be p rovided to subjects. The investigator 
or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Inves tigator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates .  
The investigator, Sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/IE C with reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and admi nistrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures. 
Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions 
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change t o the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendmen t from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects.

BMS-986165 TYK2 Inhibitor 
17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 98If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to elimin ate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining relevant approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as soon 
as possible to: 
xIRB/IEC 
xRegulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by local regulations ( per national requirements) 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority  must be sent to BMS. 
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the subject: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s )/IEC(s) for review and 
approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the ame ndment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment . 
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s). 
Financial Disclosure 
Investigators and sub-Investigators will provide the Sponsor wi th sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the S ponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to th e appropriate health authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on fina ncial interests during the course of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. 
Informed Consent Process 
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully i nformed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about th e purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject  volunteers to participate.  
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appro priate (ie, Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form (ICF), which will include all elements re quired by ICH, GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements. The sample ICF will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Investigators must: 
xProvide a copy of the conse nt form and written information abou t the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be 
nontechnical and easily understood.  
xAllow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptabl e representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.

17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 99xObtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the s ubject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and b y the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
xObtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favora ble opinion of the written ICF and any o ther 
information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginn ing of the study, and after any 
revisions are completed for new information. 
If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subse quently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or her 
informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be  obtained from the subject. 
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legally accept able representative or legal guardian, 
of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new informatio n relevant to the subject's willingness 
to continue participation in the study. This communication shou ld be documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records. For minors, according to local leg islation, one or both parents  or a legally acceptable representative 
must be informed of the study procedures and must sign the ICF approved for the study prior to 
clinical study participation. The explicit wish of a minor, who  is capable of forming an opinion 
and assessing this information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study 
at any time should be considered by the investigator.  
Minors who are judged to be of an age of reason must also give their written assent. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acc eptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exte nt compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or sh e should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a su bject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion a nd assessing information to refuse 
participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study a t any time should be considered by 
the investigator. 
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society. 
Source Documents

Case Report Forms 
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate an d accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the inve stigation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are der ived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRF s may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.  
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture  tool, electronic CRFs will be 
prepared for all data collection fields except for fields speci fic to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and paper Pregnancy Surv eillance Form, respectively. If

Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must mee t Sponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the electronic data capture tool using the unique user account 
provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be sh ared or reassigned to other 
individuals. 
Monitoring 
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to 
determine a schedule of on-si te visits for targeted review of s tudy records.  
Representatives of BMS must be all owed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity. On site they will review stud y records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with th e investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electron ic files may serve as the source 
documents: 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by Sponsor or designee internal auditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents , other study files, and study 
facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential. 
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections sc heduled by regulatory authorities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Sponsor or  designee.  
Records Retention 
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must reta in all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulat ions and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified by BMS or d esignee, whichever is longer. The 
investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must contact BMS prior to destroying any records 
associated with the study. 
BMS or designee will notify the investigator (or head of the st udy site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed. 
If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, r etirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another inv estigator, study site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or designee.

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING,
EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTING 
Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definition:
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a cau sal relationship with this treat ment .
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
xAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological sc ans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, consi dered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the inves tigator. Note that 
abnormal lab tests or other safety assessments should only be r eported as AEs if the 
final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term 
should be updated to be the diagnosis. 
xExacerbation of a chronic or intermi ttent preexisting condition  including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
xNew conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinica l sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdo se of either study 
intervention or a concomita nt medication. Overdose as a ve rbatim term (as reported by 
the investigator), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless i t is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self- harming intent. Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae and should specify "intentional  overdose" as the 
verbatim term.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
xMedical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads 
to the procedure is the AE.
xSituations in which an untowa rd medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Serious Adverse Event Definition : Any untoward medical occurren ce that, at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (defined as an event  in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see note 
below)
Note: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in  BMS clinical studies: 
xa visit to the emergency ro om or other hospital department <24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
xelective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
xadmissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
xroutine health assessment requiri ng admission for baseline/tren ding of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
xmedical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.
xadmission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respite, fa mily circumstances, administra tive reason)
xadmission for administration of ant icancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability or permanent da mage
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition a bove). Examples 
of such events include, but are not  limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that d o not result in 
hospitalization. Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event (see Section 8.2.8 for the definition of potential DILI).

used for SAEs (see Section 8.2.6 for reporting pregnancies).
Evaluating AEs and SAEs 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEsAssessment of Intensity
The intensity of AEs is determined by a physician and will use the following levels:
xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing  minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes su fficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents  normal everyday activities. An A E that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for 
rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
Assessment of Causality
xThe investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betwee n study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility of a relationship” 
conveys that there are facts, evidences, and/or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
xThe investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event  to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.
xThe investigator will also con sult the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
xFor each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SA E and has provided an assessment o f causali ty.
xThere may be situations in whic h an SAE has occurred and the in vestigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to Sponsor . However, it is very 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of ca usality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Sponso r.
xThe investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in lig ht of follow-up
information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated ca usality 
assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of t he criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
DEFINITIONS 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 
xPremenarchal 
xPremenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
Documented hysterectomy 
Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’ s review of the subject’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview. 
xPostmenopausal female 
A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in  a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physiological cause s. In addition, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle-stimulating horm one, (FSH) level >40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause. 
Note: Females treated with hormone  replacement therapy, (HRT) a re likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their judgment 
in checking serum FSH levels.  
x1-week minimum for vaginal horm onal products (rings, creams, ge ls) 
x4-week minimum for transdermal products 
x8-week minimum for oral products 
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

Sexual abstinence is considered  a highly effective method only if  defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during th e entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be eva luated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
xIt is not necessary to use any other method of contraception wh en complete abstinence is 
elected. 
xWOCBP subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, 
as specified in Section 5.1
xAcceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP subjects chooses to forego complete abstin ence 
NOTES: 
a  Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use 
should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use o f contraceptive methods for 
subjects participating in clinical studies. 
b  Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study treatment, which may 
reduce the efficacy o f the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissib le only 
when there is sufficient evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter 
hormonal exposures such that contraception would be ineffective  or result in increased 
exposure s that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternativ e methods of 
contraception should be utilized. 
c  Intrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone- releasing systems are acceptable methods of 
contraception in the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures 
from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiven ess

DEFINITIONS 
Suicidal Ideation 
Passive suicidal ideati on: wish to be dead 
Patient has thoughts about a wish to be dead or not alive anymo re, or wish to fall asleep 
and not wake up. 
Active suicidal ideation: nonsp ecific (no method, intent, or pl an) 
General nonspecific thoughts of wanting to en d one’s life or commit suicide (eg, “I’ve 
thought about killing myself”) without general thoughts of ways to kill oneself/associated 
methods, intent, or plan during the assessment period. Active suicidal ideation: method, but no intent or plan 
Patient has thoughts of suicide and has thought of at least one  method during the assessment 
period.  This situation is different than a specific plan with time, place, or method details 
worked out (eg, thought of method to kill self but not a specif ic plan). Includes person who 
would say, “I thought abo ut taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan as to wh en, 
where, or how I would actually do it . . . and I would never go through with it.”
Active suicidal ideation: me thod and intent, but no plan 
Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself, and patient report s having some intent to act on 
such thoughts, as opposed to “I have the thoughts but I definitely will not do anything about 
them.”
Active suicidal ideation:  method, intent, and plan 
Thoughts of killing oneself with details of plan fully or parti ally worked out and patient 
has some intent to carry it out (ie, some degree of intent is i mplicit in the concept of plan). 
Suicidal Behavior 
Completed suicide A self-injurious behavior that resulted in fatality and was ass ociated with at least some 
intent to die as a result of the act. Evidence that the individ ual intended to kill him- or 
herself, at least to some degree, can be explicit or inferred from the behavior or 
circumstance. 
Suicide attempt 
A potentially self-injurious behavior, associated with at least  some intent to die as a result 
of the act. Evidence that the individual intended to kill him- or herself, at least to some 
degree, can be explicit or inferred from the behavior or circum stance. A suicide attempt

17 Dec 2019, Final Approved v6.0 BMS Confidential 148Interrupted suicide attempt 
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) fro m starting a potentially 
self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred). 
Aborted suicide attempt 
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops before 
actually engaging in any self-destructive behavior. Examples ar e similar to interrupted 
attempts, except that the individual stops before being stopped by something else. 
Preparatory acts toward immi nent suicidal behaviors 
This category can include anything beyond a verbalization or th ought, but it stops short of 
a suicide attempt, an interrupted suicide attempt, or an aborte d suicide attempt. This might 
include behaviors related to assembling a specific method (eg, buying pills, purchasing a 
gun) or preparing for one’s death by suicide (eg, giving things away, writing a suicide 
note).
Self-Injurious Behavior Without Suicidal Intent 
Self-injurious behavior associated with no intent to die. The b ehavior is intended purely for other 
reasons, either to relieve distress (often referred to as self-mutilation [eg, superficial cuts or 
scratches, hitting or banging, or burns]) or to effect change i n others or the environment.
